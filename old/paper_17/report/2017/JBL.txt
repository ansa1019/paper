risk factors  we derive a substantial majority of our revenue from our international operations, which may be subject to a number of risks and often require more management time and expense than our domestic operations.
we have acquired and may continue to pursue the acquisition of manufacturing and supply chain management operations from our customers (or potential customers). in these acquisitions, the divesting company will typically enter into a supply arrangement with the acquirer. therefore, our competitors often also pursue these acquisitions. in addition, certain divesting companies may choose not to offer to sell their operations to us because of our current supply arrangements with other companies or may require terms and conditions that may impact our profitability. if we are unable to attract and consummate some of these acquisition opportunities at favorable terms, our growth and profitability could be adversely impacted.
we have expanded the primary scope of our acquisitions strategy beyond focusing on acquisition opportunities presented by companies divesting internal manufacturing operations. as we continue to pursue acquisitions that diversify our business into new industry sectors with new customers and services, the amount and scope of the risks associated may extend beyond those that we have traditionally faced in making acquisitions. these risks include greater uncertainties in the financial benefits and potential liabilities associated with this expanded base of acquisitions.
we face risks arising from the restructuring of our operations.
over the past several years, we have undertaken initiatives to restructure our business operations with the intention of improving utilization and realizing cost savings. these initiatives have included changing the number and location of our production facilities, largely to align our capacity and infrastructure with current and anticipated customer demand. the process of restructuring entails, among other activities, moving production between facilities, transferring programs from higher cost geographies to lower cost geographies, closing facilities, reducing the level of staff, realigning our business processes and reorganizing our management.
14
restructurings could adversely affect us, including a decrease in employee morale, delays encountered in finalizing the scope of, and implementing, the restructurings, failure to achieve targeted cost savings, and failure to meet operational targets and customer requirements due to the restructuring process. these risks are further complicated by our extensive international operations, which subject us to different legal and regulatory requirements that govern the extent and speed of our ability to reduce our manufacturing capacity and workforce.
when financial markets experience significant turmoil, the financial arrangements we may need to enter into, refinance or repay and our customers may be adversely affected.
credit market turmoil could negatively impact the counterparties and lenders to our forward foreign exchange contracts, trade accounts receivable securitization and sale programs, unsecured credit and term loan facilities, various foreign subsidiary credit facilities and other debt facilities. these potential negative impacts could limit our ability to borrow under these financing agreements, contracts, facilities and programs or renew or obtain future additional financing. credit market turmoil could also negatively impact certain of our customers and certain of their respective customers, which could cause them to reduce or cancel their orders and have a negative effect on our results of operations.
we can offer no assurance under the uncommitted trade accounts receivable sales programs that if we attempt to sell receivables through such programs in the future that we will receive funding from the associated banks, which would require us to utilize other available sources of liquidity, including our revolving credit facilities.
we are subject to increasingly extensive government regulations and industry standards; a failure to comply with current and future regulations and standards could have an adverse effect on our business, customer relationships, reputation and profitability.
we are subject to extensive government regulation and industry standards relating to the products we design and manufacture as well as how we conduct our business, including regulations and standards relating to labor and employment practices, workplace health and safety, the environment, sourcing and import/export practices, the market sectors we support, privacy and data protection, the regulations that apply to government contracts, and many other facets of our operations. the regulatory climate in the u.s. and other countries has become increasingly complex and fragmented, and regulatory activity has increased in recent periods.
failure or noncompliance with such regulations or standards could have an adverse effect on our reputation, customer relationships, profitability and results of operations.
if we manufacture products containing design or manufacturing defects, demand for our services may decline, our reputation may be damaged and we may be subject to liability claims.
our customers products and the manufacturing processes and design services that we use to produce them often are highly complex. defects in the products we manufacture or design, whether caused by a design, manufacturing or component failure or error, or deficiencies in our manufacturing processes, may result in delayed shipments to customers or reduced or canceled customer orders. if these defects or deficiencies are significant, our business reputation may also be damaged. the failure of the products that we manufacture or of our manufacturing processes or facilities may subject us to regulatory enforcement, fines or penalties and, in some cases, require us to shut down, temporarily halt operations or incur considerable expense to correct a manufacturing process or facility. in addition, these defects may result in liability claims against us, expose us to liability to pay for the recall or remanufacture of a product or adversely affect product sales or our reputation. even if our customers are responsible for the defects or defective specifications, they may not, or may not have resources to, assume responsibility for any costs or liabilities arising from these defects, which could expose us to additional liability claims. any of these actions could increase our expenses, reduce our revenue or damage our reputation as a supplier to these customers.
we may face heightened liability risks specific to our medical device business as a result of additional healthcare regulatory related compliance requirements and the potential severe consequences (e.g., death or serious injury)
that could result from manufacturing defects or malfunctions of the medical devices we manufacture or design.
as a manufacturer and designer of medical devices for our customers, we have compliance requirements in addition to those relating to other areas of our business. we are required to register with the u.s. food and drug administration (fda) and are subject to periodic inspection by the fda for compliance with the fdas quality system regulation (qsr) and current good manufacturing practices (cgmp) requirements, which require manufacturers of medical devices to adhere to certain regulations and to implement design and process manufacturing controls, quality control, labeling, handling and documentation procedures. the fda, through periodic inspections and product field monitoring, continually reviews and rigorously monitors compliance with these qsr requirements and other applicable regulatory requirements. if any fda inspection reveals noncompliance, and we do not address the fdas concerns to its satisfaction, the fda may take action against us, including issuing inspection observations or a notice of violation or a warning letter, imposing fines, bringing an action against the company and its officers, requiring a recall of the products we manufactured, issuing an import detention on products entering the u.s. from an offshore facility or temporarily halting operations at or shutting down a manufacturing facility. beyond the fda, our medical device business is subject to additional state and foreign regulatory requirements. in the event of noncompliance with these requirements, our reputation and business could suffer.
15
compliance or the failure to comply with current and future environmental, health and safety, product stewardship and producer responsibility laws or regulations could cause us significant expense.
we are subject to a variety of federal, state, local and foreign environmental, health and safety, product stewardship and producer responsibility laws and regulations, including those relating to the use, generation, storage, discharge and disposal of hazardous chemicals used during our manufacturing process, those governing worker health and safety, those requiring design changes, supply chain investigation or conformity assessments and those relating to the recycling or reuse of products we manufacture. if we fail to comply with any present or future regulations or timely obtain any needed permits, we could become subject to liabilities, and we could face fines or penalties, the suspension of production, or prohibitions on sales of products we manufacture. in addition, such regulations could restrict our ability to expand our facilities or could require us to acquire costly equipment, or to incur other significant expenses, including expenses associated with the recall of any non-
compliant product or with changes in our operational, procurement and inventory management activities.
certain environmental laws impose liability for the costs of investigation, removal and remediation of hazardous or toxic substances on an owner, occupier or operator of real estate, or on parties who arranged for hazardous substance treatment or disposal, even if such person or company was unaware of, or not responsible for, contamination at the affected site. soil and groundwater contamination may have occurred at or near, or may have arisen from, some of our facilities. from time to time we investigate, remediate and monitor soil and groundwater contamination at certain of our operating sites. in certain instances where contamination existed prior to our ownership or occupation of a site, landlords or former owners have retained some contractual responsibility for contamination and remediation. however, failure of such persons to perform those obligations could result in us being required to address such contamination. as a result, we may incur clean-up costs in such potential removal or remediation efforts. in other instances, we may be responsible for clean-up costs and other liabilities, including the possibility of claims due to health risks by both employees and non-employees, as well as other third-party claims in connection with contaminated sites.
in addition, there is an increasing governmental focus around the world on global warming and environmental impact issues, which may result in new environmental, health and safety regulations that may affect us, our suppliers and our customers. this could cause us to incur additional direct costs for compliance, as well as increased indirect costs resulting from our customers, suppliers or both incurring additional compliance costs that get passed on to us. these costs may adversely impact our operations and financial condition.
we have limited insurance coverage for potential environmental liabilities associated with current operations and we do not anticipate increasing such coverage in the future.
our manufacturing, production and design processes and services may result in exposure to intellectual property infringement and other claims.
providing manufacturing services can expose us to potential claims that products, designs or manufacturing processes we use infringe third party intellectual property rights. even though many of our manufacturing services contracts require our customers to indemnify us for infringement claims relating to their products, including associated product specifications and designs, a particular customer may not, or may not have the resources to, assume responsibility for such claims. in addition, we may be responsible for claims that our manufacturing processes or components used in manufacturing infringe third party intellectual property rights. providing turnkey design solutions, and design and other services can expose us to different or greater potential liabilities than those we face providing just manufacturing services, including an increase in exposure to potential claims that products we design or supply, or materials or components we use, infringe third party property rights. infringement claims could subject us to significant liability for damages, potential injunctive action, or hamper our normal operations such as by interfering with the availability of components.
regardless of merits of any such claim, it could be time-consuming and expensive to resolve, and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position. in the event of such a claim, we may spend significant amounts of money and effort to develop non-infringing alternatives or obtain and maintain licenses. we may not be successful in developing such alternatives or obtaining and maintaining such licenses on reasonable terms or at all. our customers may be required to or decide to discontinue products that are alleged to be infringing rather than face continued costs of defending infringement claims, and such discontinuance may result in a significant decrease in our business and/or could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position. these risks may be heightened in connection with our customer relationships with emerging companies.
components we purchase, products we design and/or manufacture and/or services we provide may infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties, some of whom may hold key intellectual property rights in areas in which we operate. our customers or suppliers could also become subject to infringement claims. patent clearance or licensing activities, if any, may be inadequate to anticipate and avoid third party claims. additionally, customers for our services in which we have significant technology contributions, typically require that we indemnify them against the risk of intellectual property infringement. if any claims are brought against our customers, our suppliers or us for such infringement, regardless of their merits, we could be required to expend significant resources in the defense or settlement of such claims, or in the defense or settlement of related indemnification claims. in the event of a claim, we may be required to spend significant amounts of money and effort to develop non-infringing alternatives or obtain and
16
maintain licenses. we may not be successful in developing such alternatives or obtaining or maintaining such licenses on reasonable terms or at all. we, our suppliers or our customers may be required to or decide to discontinue products which are alleged to be infringing rather than face continued costs of defending the infringement claims, and such discontinuance may result in a significant decrease in our business, and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position.
the success of certain aspects of our business depends in part on our ability to obtain, protect and leverage intellectual property rights.
in certain circumstances, we strive to obtain and protect certain intellectual property rights related to solutions, designs, processes and products that we create. we believe that obtaining a significant level of protected proprietary technology may give us a competitive advantage.
in addition to selectively relying on patent rights, we rely on unpatented proprietary know-how and trade secrets, and employ various methods, including non-disclosure agreements with our customers, employees and suppliers and our internal security systems, policies and procedures to protect our know-how and trade secrets. however, we cannot be certain the measures we employ will result in protected intellectual property rights or will result in the prevention of unauthorized use of our technology. if we are unable to obtain and protect intellectual property rights embodied within our solutions, designs, processes and products, this could reduce or eliminate competitive advantages of our proprietary technology, which would harm our business and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position.
even if we take steps to protect certain intellectual property rights, these mechanisms may not afford complete or sufficient protection, and misappropriation may still occur. further, there can be no assurance that we will be able to acquire or enforce our patent or other rights, if any, and that others will not independently develop similar know-how and trade secrets, or develop better production methods than us. we have not historically sought patent protection for many of our proprietary processes, designs or other patentable intellectual property. further, we may not be able to prevent current and former employees, contractors and other parties from breaching non-disclosure agreements and misappropriating proprietary information. if any of the foregoing occur, it could impair our ability to compete with others in our industry, result in a significant decrease in our business and/or could have material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position.
any delay in the implementation of our information systems could disrupt our operations and cause unanticipated increases in our costs.
we are currently in the process of completing the installation of an enterprise resource planning system in certain of our manufacturing facilities, which will replace the existing planning and financial information systems. any delay in the implementation of these information systems could result in material adverse consequences, including disruption of operations, loss of information and unanticipated increases in costs.
disruptions to our information systems, including security breaches, losses of data or outages, and other security issues, could adversely affect our operations.
we rely on information systems, some of which are owned and operated by third parties, to store, process and transmit confidential information, including financial reporting, inventory management, procurement, invoicing and electronic communications, belonging to our customers, our suppliers, our employees and/or us. we attempt to monitor and mitigate our exposure and modify our systems when warranted and we have implemented certain business continuity items including data backups at alternative sites. nevertheless, these systems are vulnerable to, and at times have suffered from, among other things, damage from power loss or natural disasters, computer system and network failures, loss of telecommunication services, physical and electronic loss of data, terrorist attacks, security breaches and computer viruses. we regularly face attempts by others to access our information systems in an unauthorized manner, to introduce malicious software to such systems or both. the increased use of mobile technologies can heighten these and other operational risks. if we, or the third parties who own and operate certain of our information systems, are unable to prevent such breaches, losses of data and outages, our operations could be disrupted. also, the time and funds spent on monitoring and mitigating our exposure and responding to breaches, including the training of employees, the purchase of protective technologies and the hiring of additional employees and consultants to assist in these efforts could adversely affect our financial results. the increasing sophistication of cyberattacks requires us to continually evaluate new technologies and processes intended to detect and prevent these attacks. there can be no assurance that the security measures we choose to implement will be sufficient to protect the data we manage. finally, any theft or misuse of information resulting from a security breach could result in, among other things, loss of significant and/or sensitive information, litigation by affected parties, financial obligations resulting from such theft or misuse, higher insurance premiums, governmental investigations, negative reactions from current and potential future customers (including potential negative financial ramifications under certain customer contract provisions) and poor publicity and any of these could adversely affect our financial results.
we are subject to the risk of increased taxes.
we base our tax position upon the anticipated nature and conduct of our business and upon our understanding of the tax laws of the various countries in which we have assets or conduct activities. our tax position, however, is subject to review and possible challenge by taxing authorities and to possible changes in law (including adverse changes to the manner in which the u.s. and other countries tax multinational companies or interpret their tax laws). we cannot determine in advance the extent to which some
17
jurisdictions may assess additional tax or interest and penalties on such additional taxes. in addition, our effective tax rate may be increased by the generation of higher income in countries with higher tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in our cash management strategies, changes in local tax rates or countries adopting more aggressive interpretations of tax laws.
refer to note 5  income taxes to the consolidated financial statements for details of the field examinations completed by the internal revenue service (irs) of our tax returns for the fiscal years 2012 through 2014 and fiscal years
2009 through 2011 which resulted in proposed adjustments. while we currently believe that the resolution of these issues will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows, an unfavorable resolution could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
several countries in which we are located allow for tax incentives to attract and retain business. we have obtained incentives where available and practicable. our taxes could increase if certain tax incentives are retracted, which could occur if we are unable to satisfy the conditions on which such incentives are based, if they are not renewed upon expiration, or if tax rates applicable to us in such jurisdictions otherwise increase. it is not anticipated that any tax incentives will expire within the next year. however, due to the possibility of changes in existing tax law and our operations, we are unable to predict how any expirations will impact us in the future. in addition, acquisitions may cause our effective tax rate to increase, depending on the jurisdictions in which the acquired operations are located.
certain of our subsidiaries provide financing, products and services to, and may undertake certain significant transactions with, other subsidiaries in different jurisdictions. several jurisdictions in which we operate have tax laws with detailed transfer pricing rules that require that all transactions with non-resident related parties be priced using arms length pricing principles, and that contemporaneous documentation must exist to support such pricing. there is a risk that the taxing authorities may not deem our transfer pricing documentation acceptable. in addition, the organization for economic cooperation and development (oecd) released guidance related to base erosion and profit shifting (beps) which may result in legislative changes that could negatively impact our effective tax rate.
our credit rating may be downgraded.
our credit is and certain of our financial instruments are rated by credit rating agencies. any potential future negative change in our credit ratings may make it more expensive for us to raise additional capital on terms that are acceptable to us, if at all; negatively impact the price of our common stock; increase our interest payments under existing debt agreements; and have other negative implications on our business, many of which are beyond our control. in addition, the interest rate payable on the 8.250% senior notes and under the credit facility (as such terms are defined in 9  notes payable, long-term debt and capital lease obligations to the consolidated financial statements) is subject to adjustment from time to time if our credit ratings change. thus, any potential future negative change in our credit rating may increase the interest rate payable on the 8.250% senior notes, the credit facility and certain of our other borrowings.
our amount of debt could significantly increase in the future.
the company has a number of debt facilities. refer to managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  liquidity and capital resources and note 9  notes payable, long-term debt and capital lease obligations to the consolidated financial statements for further details.
should we desire to consummate significant additional acquisition opportunities, undertake significant additional expansion activities, make substantial investments in our infrastructure or enter into a stock repurchase program, our capital needs would increase and could possibly result in our need to increase available borrowings under our revolving credit facilities or access public or private debt and equity markets. there can be no assurance, however, that we would be successful in raising additional debt or equity on terms that we would consider acceptable. an increase in the level of our indebtedness, among other things, could:
make it difficult for us to obtain any necessary financing in the future for other acquisitions, working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements or other purposes;
limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to changes in, our business;
make us more vulnerable in the event of a downturn in our business; and impact certain financial covenants that we are subject to in connection with our debt and asset-backed securitization programs.
there can be no assurance that we will be able to meet future debt service obligations.
an adverse change in the interest rates for our borrowings could adversely affect our financial condition.
we pay interest on outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facilities and certain other long term debt obligations at interest rates that fluctuate based upon changes in various base interest rates. an adverse change in the base rates upon which our interest rates are determined could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
if certain economic or fiscal issues occur, interest rates could rise, which would increase our interest costs and reduce our net income. also, increased interest rates could make any future fixed interest rate debt obligations more expensive.
18
we are subject to risks of currency fluctuations and related hedging operations.
although a significant number of our operations are located outside the united states, the majority of our business is conducted in u.s.
dollars. changes in exchange rates will affect our net revenue, cost of sales, operating margins and net income. we cannot predict the impact of future exchange rate fluctuations. we use financial instruments, primarily forward contracts, to hedge our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations. we believe that our hedging activities enable us to largely protect ourselves from future exchange rate fluctuations. if, however, these hedging activities are not successful, if the counterparties to these hedging activities default on their obligations to us or if we change or reduce these hedging activities in the future, we may experience significant unexpected expenses from fluctuations in exchange rates. in addition, certain countries in which we operate have adopted, or may adopt, currency controls requiring that local transactions be settled only in local currency. such controls could require us to hedge larger amounts of local currency than we have in the past.
energy price increases may negatively impact our results of operations.
certain of the components that we use in our manufacturing activities are petroleum-based. in addition, we, along with our suppliers and customers, rely on various energy sources (including oil) in our facilities and transportation activities. an increase in energy prices, which have been volatile historically, could cause an increase in our raw material costs and transportation costs. in addition, increased transportation costs of certain of our suppliers and customers could be passed along to us. we may not be able to increase our product prices enough to offset these increased costs. in addition, any increase in our product prices may reduce our future customer orders and profitability.
we are subject to risks associated with natural disasters, climate change and global events.
our operations and those of our customers and suppliers may be subject to natural disasters, climate change-related events, or other business disruptions, which could seriously harm our results of operation and increase our costs and expenses. we are susceptible to losses and interruptions caused by hurricanes (including in florida, where our headquarters are located), earthquakes, power shortages, telecommunications failures, water or other natural resource shortages, tsunamis, floods, typhoons, drought, fire, extreme weather conditions, rising sea level, geopolitical events such as direct or indirect terrorist acts or acts of war, other natural or manmade disasters, boycotts and sanctions or widespread criminal activities. such events could make it difficult or impossible to manufacture or to deliver products to our customers, receive production materials from our suppliers, or perform critical functions, which could adversely affect our business globally or in certain regions. while we maintain similar manufacturing capacities at different locations and coordinate multi-
source supplier programs on many of our materials, which we believe better enables us to respond to these types of events, we cannot be sure that our plans will fully protect us from all such disruptions. our insurance coverage with respect to natural disasters is limited and is subject to deductibles and coverage limits. such coverage may not be adequate, or may not continue to be available at commercially reasonable rates and terms.
while we manufacture our products in a large number of diversified facilities and maintain insurance covering our facilities, including business interruption insurance, a catastrophic loss of the use of all or a portion of one of our key manufacturing facilities due to accident, labor issues, weather conditions, natural disaster or otherwise, whether short- or long-term, could have a material adverse effect on us.

declared, per share item 7. managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are one of the leading providers of worldwide manufacturing services and solutions. we provide comprehensive electronics design, production and product management services to companies in the automotive and transportation, capital equipment, consumer lifestyles and wearable technologies, computing and storage, defense and aerospace, digital home, healthcare, industrial and energy, mobility, networking and telecommunications, packaging, point of sale and printing industries.
we derive substantially all of our revenue from production and product management services (collectively referred to as manufacturing services), which encompass the act of producing tangible components that are built to customer specifications and are then provided to the customer.
we have two reporting segments: electronics manufacturing services (ems) and diversified manufacturing services
(dms), which are organized based on the economic profiles of the services performed, including manufacturing capabilities, market strategy, margins, return on capital and risk profiles. our ems segment is focused around leveraging it, supply chain design and engineering, technologies largely centered on core electronics, utilizing our large scale manufacturing infrastructure and our ability to serve a broad range of end markets. our ems segment is typically a lower-margin but high volume business that produces product at a quicker rate (i.e. cycle time) and in larger quantities and includes customers primarily in the automotive and transportation, capital equipment, computing and storage, digital home, industrial and energy, networking and telecommunications, point of sale and printing industries. our dms segment is focused on providing engineering solutions, with an emphasis on material sciences and technologies. our dms segment is typically a higher-margin business and includes customers primarily in the consumer lifestyles and wearable technologies, defense and aerospace, healthcare, mobility and packaging industries.
our cost of revenue includes the cost of electronic components and other materials that comprise the products we manufacture; the cost of labor and manufacturing overhead; and adjustments for excess and obsolete inventory. as a provider of turnkey manufacturing services, we are responsible for procuring components and other materials. this requires us to commit significant working capital to our operations and to manage the purchasing, receiving, inspecting and stocking of materials. although we bear the risk of fluctuations in the cost of materials and excess scrap, we periodically negotiate cost of materials adjustments with our customers. net revenue from each product that we manufacture consists of an element based on the costs of materials in that product and an element based on the labor and manufacturing overhead costs allocated to that product. our gross margin for any product depends on the mix between the cost of materials in the product and the cost of labor and manufacturing overhead allocated to the product.
our operating results are impacted by the level of capacity utilization of manufacturing facilities; indirect labor costs; and selling, general and administrative expenses. operating income margins have generally improved during periods of high production volume and high capacity utilization. during periods of low production volume, we generally have idle capacity and reduced operating income margins.
we monitor the current economic environment and its potential impact on both the customers we serve as well as our end-markets and closely manage our costs and capital resources so that we can try to respond appropriately as circumstances change.
we have consistently utilized advanced circuit design, production design and manufacturing technologies to meet the needs of our customers. to support this effort, our engineering staff focuses on developing and refining design and manufacturing technologies to meet specific needs of specific customers. most of the expenses associated with these customer-specific efforts are reflected in our cost of revenue. in addition, our engineers engage in research and development (r&d) of new technologies that apply generally to our operations. the expenses of these r&d activities are reflected in the research and development line item within our consolidated statement of operations.
26
an important element of our strategy is the expansion of our global production facilities. the majority of our revenue and materials costs worldwide are denominated in u.s. dollars, while our labor and utility costs in operations outside the u.s. are denominated in local currencies. we economically hedge certain of these local currency costs, based on our evaluation of the potential exposure as compared to the cost of the hedge, through the purchase of foreign currency exchange contracts. changes in the fair market value of such hedging instruments are reflected within the consolidated statement of operations and the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
see note 13  concentration of risk and segment data to the consolidated financial statements.
in september 2017, our operations in cayey, puerto rico received significant hurricane damage. while we are still assessing the impact to our operations, we anticipate asset impairments and costs associated with business interruptions during the first half of fiscal year 2018. we also expect that the majority of these costs will ultimately be offset by insurance coverage.
summary of results net revenues for fiscal year 2017 increased approximately 3.9% to $19.1 billion compared to $18.4 billion for fiscal year 2016 primarily due to increased revenues due to new business from existing customers in our consumer lifestyles and wearable technologies business, and new business from existing customers in our healthcare and mobility businesses.

(1)  days in accounts payable; accordingly, the variance in the sales cycle quarter over quarter is a direct result of changes in these indicators.
(2)  during the three months ended august 31, 2017, the decrease in days in accounts receivable from the prior sequential quarter was primarily due to the timing of sales and collections activity.
during the three months ended february 28, 2017, days in inventory increased as compared to the prior
(3)  sequential quarter: (i) as a result of lower production in the dms segment due to reduced consumer demand in the mobility business and (ii) to support expected revenue levels in the third quarter of fiscal year
2017.
during the three months ended august 31, 2017, the increase in days in accounts payable from the prior sequential quarter was primarily due to higher materials purchases during the quarter due to increased demand in the mobility business as well as the timing of purchases and cash payments for purchases during the quarter. during the three months ended may 31, 2017, the increase in days in accounts payable from the
(4)  prior sequential quarter was primarily due to the timing of purchases and cash payments for purchases during the quarter. during the three months ended august 31, 2016, the increase in days in accounts payable from the prior sequential quarter was primarily due to the timing of purchases and cash payments for purchases and higher materials purchases during the quarter.
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles (u.s. gaap) requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. on an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions based upon historical experience and various other factors and circumstances. management believes that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable under the circumstances; however, actual results may vary from these
28
estimates and assumptions under different future circumstances. we have identified the following critical accounting policies that affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. for further discussion of our significant accounting policies, refer to note 1  description of business and summary of significant accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements.
revenue recognition we derive substantially all of our revenue from production and product management services (collectively referred to as manufacturing services), which encompasses the act of producing tangible components that are built to customer specifications, which are then provided to the customer. we recognize manufacturing services revenue when such tangible components are shipped to or the goods are received by the customer, title and risk of ownership have passed, the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured (net of estimated returns). we also derive revenue to a lesser extent from electronic design services to certain customers. revenue from electronic design services is generally recognized upon completion and acceptance by the respective customer. upfront payments from customers are recorded upon receipt as deferred income and are recognized as revenue as the related manufacturing services are provided.
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts related to receivables not expected to be collected from our customers. this allowance is based on managements assessment of specific customer balances after considering the age of receivables and financial stability of the customer. if there is an adverse change in the financial condition and circumstances of our customers, or if actual defaults are higher than provided for, an addition to the allowance may be necessary.
inventory valuation we purchase inventory based on forecasted demand and record inventory at the lower of cost or market. management regularly assesses inventory valuation based on current and forecasted usage, customer inventory-related contractual obligations and other lower of cost or market considerations. if actual market conditions or our customers product demands are less favorable than those projected, additional valuation adjustments may be necessary.
long-lived assets we review property, plant and equipment and amortizable intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. recoverability of property, plant and equipment is measured by comparing its carrying value to the undiscounted projected cash flows that the asset(s) or asset group(s) are expected to generate. if the carrying amount of an asset or an asset group is not recoverable, we recognize an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount of the long-lived asset or asset group over its respective fair value, which is generally determined as either the present value of estimated future cash flows or the appraised value. the impairment analysis is based on significant assumptions of future results made by management, including revenue and cash flow projections.
circumstances that may lead to impairment of property, plant and equipment include unforeseen decreases in future performance or industry demand and the restructuring of our operations resulting from a change in our business strategy or adverse economic conditions. for further discussion of our current restructuring program, refer to managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  results of operations  restructuring and related charges.
we have recorded intangible assets, including goodwill, in connection with business acquisitions. estimated useful lives of amortizable intangible assets are determined by management based on an assessment of the period over which the asset is expected to contribute to future cash flows. the fair value of acquired amortizable intangible assets impacts the amounts recorded as goodwill.
we perform a goodwill impairment analysis using the two-step method on an annual basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. the recoverability of goodwill is measured at the reporting unit level by comparing the reporting units carrying amount, including goodwill, to the fair value of the reporting unit. we determine the fair value of our reporting units based on an average weighting of both projected discounted future results and the use of comparative market multiples. if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, goodwill is considered impaired and a second test is performed to measure the amount of loss, if any.
we perform an indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment analysis on an annual basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. the recoverability of indefinite-lived intangible assets is measured by comparing the carrying amount to the fair value. we determine the fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets principally based on a variation of the income approach, known as the relief from royalty method. if the carrying amount of the indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value, the indefinite-lived intangible asset is considered impaired.
we completed our annual impairment test for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets during the fourth quarter of fiscal year
2017 and determined that the fair values of our reporting units and the indefinite-lived intangible assets are substantially in excess of the carrying values and that no impairment existed as of the date of the impairment test. significant judgments inherent in this analysis included assumptions regarding appropriate revenue growth rates, discount rates and royalty rates.
29
income taxes we estimate our income tax provision in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate, a process that includes estimating exposures related to examinations by taxing authorities. we must also make judgments regarding the ability to realize deferred tax assets. the carrying value of our net deferred tax assets is based on our belief that it is more likely than not that we will generate sufficient future taxable income in certain jurisdictions to realize these deferred tax assets. a valuation allowance has been established for deferred tax assets that we do not believe meet the more likely than not
criteria. we assess whether an uncertain tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return meets the threshold for recognition and measurement in the consolidated financial statements. our judgments regarding future taxable income as well as tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return may change due to changes in market conditions, changes in tax laws or other factors. if our assumptions and consequently our estimates change in the future, the valuation allowances and/or tax reserves established may be increased or decreased, resulting in a respective increase or decrease in income tax expense for the fiscal year ended august 31, 2017, the company recorded an income tax benefit of $27.5 million related to the reversal of deferred tax asset valuation allowances in certain non-u.s. jurisdictions. the companys assessment included consideration of all available positive and negative evidence including, among other recent evidence, historical cumulative operating income, projected future taxable income and recent utilization of non-u.s. tax credit carryforwards.
the internal revenue service (irs) completed its field examination of our tax returns for fiscal years 2009
through 2011 and issued a revenue agents report (rar) on may 27, 2015, which was updated on june 22, 2016. the irs completed its field examination of our tax returns for fiscal years 2012 through 2014 and issued an rar on april 19,
2017. the proposed adjustments in the rar from both examination periods relate primarily to u.s. taxation of certain intercompany transactions. if the irs ultimately prevails in its positions, our income tax payments due for the fiscal years 2009
through 2011 and fiscal years 2012 through 2014 would be approximately $28.6 million and $5.3 million, respectively, after utilization of tax loss carry forwards available through fiscal year 2014. also, the irs has proposed interest and penalties with respect to fiscal years 2009 through 2011. the irs may make similar claims in future audits with respect to these types of transactions. at this time, anticipating the amount of any future irs proposed adjustments, interest, and penalties is not practicable.
we disagree with the proposed adjustments and intend to vigorously contest these matters through the applicable irs administrative and judicial procedures, as appropriate. as the final resolution of the proposed adjustments remains uncertain, we continue to provide for the uncertain tax positions based on the more likely than not standard. while the resolution of the issues may result in tax liabilities, interest and penalties that are significantly higher than the amounts accrued for these matters, management currently believes that the resolution will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. however, there can be no assurance that managements beliefs will be realized. for further discussion related to our income taxes, refer to note 5  income taxes to the consolidated financial statements.
recent accounting pronouncements see note 17  new accounting guidance to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of recent accounting guidance.

the fiscal year ended august 31, 2017 compared to the fiscal year ended august 31, 2016
net revenue. net revenue increased 3.9% to $19.1 billion during the fiscal year ended august 31, 2017, compared to
$18.4 billion during the fiscal year ended august 31, 2016. the dms segment revenues increased 9% as a result of a 4% increase in revenues due to new business from existing customers in our consumer lifestyles and wearable technologies business, a 3%
increase in revenues due to new business from existing customers in our healthcare business and a 2% increase in revenues from existing customers within our mobility business. ems segment revenues remained relatively consistent due to a mix of increases and decreases spread across various industries within the ems segment, with no one change being significant individually.
generally, we assess revenue on a global customer basis regardless of whether the growth is associated with organic growth or as a result of an acquisition. accordingly, we do not differentiate or separately report revenue increases generated by acquisitions as opposed to existing business. in addition, the added cost structures associated with our acquisitions have historically been relatively insignificant when compared to our overall cost structure.
the distribution of revenue across our segments has fluctuated, and will continue to fluctuate, as a result of numerous factors, including the following: fluctuations in customer demand as a result of recessionary and other conditions, such as the less than anticipated product demand that we have experienced in our mobility business; efforts to diversify certain portions of our business; seasonality in our business; business growth from new and existing customers; specific product performance; and any potential termination, or substantial winding down, of significant customer relationships.

the following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, revenue by segment expressed as a percentage of net revenue:
fiscal year ended august 31,
2017       2016       2015

total                             100  %     100  %     100  %
foreign source revenue represented 91.4% and 90.7%, respectively, of our net revenue for the fiscal years ended august 31, 2017 and 2016.
gross profit. gross profit remained relatively consistent on an absolute basis and as a percent of revenue at $1.5 billion (8.1% of net revenue) during the fiscal year ended august 31, 2017, compared to $1.5 billion (8.3% of net revenue) during the fiscal year ended august 31, 2016.
selling, general and administrative. selling, general and administrative expenses decreased to $907.7 million (4.8%
of net revenue)
during the fiscal year ended august 31, 2017, compared to $924.4 million (5.0% of net revenue) during the fiscal year ended august 31, 2016. the decrease resulted primarily from a $21.0 million reversal of stock-based compensation expense during fiscal year 2017 due to decreased expectations for the vesting of certain performance-based restricted stock awards. the decrease was partially offset by an increase in salary and salary-related expenses and other costs.
research and development. research and development expenses remained relatively consistent at $29.7 million (0.2%
of net revenue)
during the fiscal year ended august 31, 2017, compared to $32.0 million (0.2% of net revenue) during the fiscal year ended august 31, 2016.
amortization of intangibles. amortization of intangibles decreased to $35.5 million during the fiscal year ended august 31, 2017
compared to $37.1 million during the fiscal year ended august 31, 2016. the decrease is due to certain intangible assets that were fully amortized during fiscal year 2016.
restructuring and related charges.
following is a summary of our restructuring and related charges (in thousands):

includes $51.3 million and $10.7 million recorded in the ems segment, $82.4 million and $0.8 million
(1)  recorded in the dms segment and $26.7 million and $(0.1) million of non-allocated charges for the fiscal years ended august 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. except for asset write-off costs, all restructuring and related charges are cash costs.
includes employee severance and benefit costs of $52.2 million and $4.6 million, lease costs of $4.0
million and $0.0 million, asset write-off costs of $94.2 million and $0.1 million and other related costs
(2)  of $3.8
million and $1.5 million for the 2017 restructuring plan and the 2013 restructuring plan, respectively, which are discussed in greater detail below.
costs relate to the restructuring plan approved by the board of directors in fiscal year 2013 (the 2013
(3)  restructuring plan) which was intended to better align our manufacturing capacity in certain geographies and to reduce our worldwide workforce in order to reduce operating expenses.
32
2017 restructuring plan on september 15, 2016, our board of directors formally approved a restructuring plan to better align our global capacity and administrative support infrastructure to further optimize organizational effectiveness. this action includes headcount reductions across our selling, general and administrative cost base and capacity realignment in higher cost locations (the
2017 restructuring plan).
upon completion of the 2017 restructuring plan, we expect to recognize approximately $195.0 million in restructuring and related charges. we incurred $154.2 million of costs during fiscal year 2017 and anticipate incurring the remaining costs during fiscal year 2018 for employee severance and benefits costs, asset write-off costs and other related costs.
the 2017 restructuring plan, once complete, is expected to yield annualized cost savings beginning in fiscal year
2019 in the range of $70.0 million to $90.0 million. during fiscal year 2017, we realized costs savings of $25.0 million. the annual cost savings is expected to be reflected as a reduction in cost of revenue as well as a reduction of selling, general and administrative expense.
2013 restructuring plan as of august 31, 2017, the 2013 restructuring plan was substantially complete.
see note 15  restructuring and related charges to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of restructuring and related charges for the 2017 and 2013 restructuring plans.
other expense. other expense increased to $28.4
million for the fiscal year ended august 31, 2017 compared to $8.4 million for the fiscal year ended august 31,
2016. the increase is primarily due to an other than temporary impairment on available for sale securities of $11.5
million, an increase in fees associated with the asset-backed securitization programs and a loss associated with a cost method investment.
interest income. interest income increased to $12.5 million during the fiscal year ended august 31, 2017, compared to $9.1 million during the fiscal year ended august 31, 2016 due to increased investments.
interest expense. interest expense remained relatively consistent at $138.1 million during the fiscal year ended august 31, 2017, compared to $136.5 million during the fiscal year ended august 31, 2016.
income tax expense. income tax expense reflects an effective tax rate of 50.4% for the fiscal year ended august 31,
2017, compared to an effective tax rate of 34.1% for the fiscal year ended august 31, 2016. the increase in the effective tax rate was primarily due to decreased income in jurisdictions with low tax rates and increased losses in jurisdictions with existing valuation allowances, which was partially due to an increase in restructuring expense, and increased income in jurisdictions with high tax rates. this effective tax rate increase was partially offset by an income tax benefit of $27.5 million for the reversal of valuation allowances related to non-u.s. jurisdictions.
fiscal year ended august 31, 2016 compared to fiscal year ended august 31, 2015
net revenue. net revenue increased 2.5% to $18.4 billion during the fiscal year ended august 31,
2016, compared to $17.9 billion during the fiscal year ended august 31, 2015. specifically, the dms segment revenues increased 3% due to increased revenues from customers within our mobility business due to strengthened end user product demand during the first half of fiscal year 2016. ems segment revenues increased 2% due to a 3% increase in revenues from new business with existing customers within our telecommunications business, partially offset by a 1% revenue decline spread across the remaining industries within the ems segment.
foreign source revenue represented 90.7% and 88.0%, respectively, of our net revenue for fiscal years 2016 and 2015.
gross profit. gross profit remained relatively consistent at $1.5 billion (8.3% of net revenue) during the fiscal year ended august 31, 2016, compared to $1.5 billion (8.4% of net revenue) during the fiscal year ended august 31, 2015.
selling, general and administrative. selling, general and administrative expenses increased to $924.4 million (5.0%
of net revenue) for fiscal year 2016 compared to $862.6 million (4.8% of net revenue) for fiscal year 2015. selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenue remained relatively consistent with the same period of the prior fiscal year. selling, general and administrative expenses on a gross basis increased during the fiscal year ended august
31, 2016 as compared to the fiscal year ended august 31, 2015, primarily due to increases in salary and salary-
related expenses and other costs due to increased headcount to support the continued growth of our business.
33
research and development. research and development expenses increased to $32.0
million (0.2% of net revenue) during the fiscal year ended august 31, 2016, compared to $27.6 million (0.2% of net revenue) during the fiscal year ended august 31, 2015, primarily as the result of new projects in targeted growth sectors.
amortization of intangibles. amortization of intangibles increased to $37.1 million during the fiscal year ended august 31, 2016 as compared to $24.4 million during the fiscal year ended august 31, 2015. the increase is due to the definite lived intangible assets acquired in connection with the plasticos acquisition that occurred in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015 and the acquisitions of shemer, inala and hanson that occurred during the first and second quarters of fiscal year 2016, respectively.
restructuring and related charges.
2013 restructuring plan in conjunction with the 2013 restructuring plan, we charged $11.4 million of restructuring and related charges to the consolidated statements of operations during the fiscal year ended august 31, 2016 compared to $34.6 million during the fiscal year ended august 31, 2015. the restructuring and related charges during the fiscal years ended august 31, 2016 and 2015
include cash costs of $8.8 million and $24.3 million related to employee severance and benefit costs, respectively, $0.0
million and $2.8 million related to lease costs, respectively, and $1.4 million and $1.9 million of other related costs, respectively, as well as non-cash costs of $1.2 million and $5.6 million related to asset write-off costs, respectively.
for further discussion of restructuring and related charges related to the 2013 restructuring plan, refer to note 15  restructuring and related charges to the consolidated financial statements.
other expense. other expense increased to $8.4 million for the fiscal year ended august 31, 2016 compared to $5.6
million for the fiscal year ended august 31, 2015. the increase was primarily due to an increase in fees associated with the asset-backed securitization programs as a result of an increase in receivables sold.
interest income. interest income remained relatively consistent at $9.1 million during the fiscal year ended august
31, 2016, compared to $10.0 million during the fiscal year ended august 31, 2015.
interest expense. interest expense increased to
$136.5 million during the fiscal year ended august 31, 2016, compared to $128.1 million during the fiscal year ended august 31, 2015. the increase was due to interest expense associated with the term loan facility entered into on july 6, 2015, (see note 9  notes payable, long-term debt and capital lease obligations to the consolidated financial statements).
income tax expense. income tax expense reflects an effective tax rate of 34.1% for the fiscal year ended august 31,
2016, compared to an effective tax rate of 31.8% for the fiscal year ended august 31, 2015. the effective tax rate for the fiscal year ended august 31, 2016 increased from the effective tax rate for the fiscal year ended august 31,
2015
primarily due to the decrease in income from continuing operations in low tax-rate jurisdictions and the increase in losses in tax jurisdictions with existing valuation allowances during fiscal year 2016. this effective tax rate increase was partially offset by tax benefits from favorable tax audit resolutions and statute of limitation expirations in non-u.s. jurisdictions during fiscal year 2016.
non-u.s. gaap (core) financial measures the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations include certain non-u.s.
gaap financial measures as identified in the reconciliation below. the non-u.s. gaap financial measures disclosed herein do not have standard meaning and may vary from the non-u.s. gaap financial measures used by other companies or how we may calculate those measures in other instances from time to time. non-u.s. gaap financial measures should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with u.s. gaap. also, our
core financial measures should not be construed as an inference by us that our future results will be unaffected by those items that are excluded from our core financial measures.
management believes that the non-u.s. gaap core financial measures set forth below are useful to facilitate evaluating the past and future performance of our ongoing manufacturing operations over multiple periods on a comparable basis by excluding the effects of the amortization of intangibles, stock-based compensation expense and related charges, restructuring and related charges, distressed customer charges, acquisition costs and certain purchase accounting adjustments, loss on disposal of subsidiaries, settlement of receivables and related charges, impairment of notes receivable and related charges, goodwill impairment charges, other than temporary impairment on securities, income (loss) from discontinued operations, gain (loss) on sale of discontinued operations and certain other expenses, net of tax and certain deferred tax valuation allowance charges. among other uses, management uses non-u.s. gaap core financial measures to make operating decisions, assess business performance and as a factor in determining certain employee performance when evaluating incentive compensation.
34
we determine the tax effect of the items excluded from core earnings and
core basic and diluted earnings per share based upon evaluation of the statutory tax treatment and the applicable tax rate of the jurisdiction in which the pre-tax items were incurred, and for which realization of the resulting tax benefit, if any, is expected. in certain jurisdictions where we do not expect to realize a tax benefit (due to a history of operating losses or other factors resulting in a valuation allowance related to deferred tax assets), a
0% tax rate is applied.
we are reporting core operating income and core earnings to provide investors with an additional method for assessing operating income and earnings, by presenting what we believe are our core manufacturing operations.
a significant portion (based on the respective values) of the items that are excluded for purposes of calculating
core operating income and core earnings also impacted certain balance sheet assets, resulting in a portion of an asset being written off without a corresponding recovery of cash we may have previously spent with respect to the asset. in the case of restructuring and related charges, we may make associated cash payments in the future. in addition, although, for purposes of calculating core operating income and core earnings, we exclude stock-based compensation expense (which we anticipate continuing to incur in the future) because it is a non-cash expense, the associated stock issued may result in an increase in our outstanding shares of stock, which may result in the dilution of our stockholders ownership interest. we encourage you to consider these matters when evaluating the utility of these non-u.s. gaap financial measures.

acquisitions and expansion as discussed in note 16  business acquisitions to the consolidated financial statements, we completed one acquisition during the fiscal year ended august 31, 2017 and three acquisitions during the fiscal year ended august 31, 2016.
acquisitions are accounted for as business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting. our consolidated financial statements include the operating results of each business from the date of acquisition.
seasonality production levels for a portion of the dms segment are subject to seasonal influences. we may realize greater net revenue during our first fiscal quarter which ends on november 30, due to higher demand for consumer-related products during the holiday selling season.
liquidity and capital resources we believe that our level of liquidity sources, which includes available borrowings under our revolving credit facilities, additional proceeds available under our asset-backed securitization programs and under our uncommitted trade accounts receivable sale programs, cash on hand, funds provided by operations and the access to the capital markets, will be adequate to fund our capital expenditures, the payment of any declared quarterly dividends, share repurchases, any potential acquisitions and our working capital requirements for the next 12 months.
cash and cash equivalents as of august 31, 2017, we had approximately $1.2 billion in cash and cash equivalents. as our growth remains predominantly outside of the united states, a significant portion of such cash and cash equivalents are held by our foreign subsidiaries. we estimate that approximately $841.1 million of the cash and cash equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries could not be repatriated to the united states without potential income tax consequences.
during fiscal year 2017, we repatriated $225.9 million of current year foreign earnings to our u.s. operations, which did not result in tax expense due to a current year operating loss and valuation allowance in the u.s. as of august 31, 2017, we intend to repatriate pre-acquisition undistributed earnings of $188.5 million related to nypro and a portion of our remaining current year foreign earnings to our u.s. operations from cash and cash equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries. in connection with this future repatriation of earnings, we have a deferred tax liability of approximately $86.2
million at august 31,
2017. we intend to indefinitely reinvest the remaining earnings from our foreign subsidiaries outside the u.s.

we believe that our cash on hand and available borrowing under our credit facilities will be adequate to
(1)  fund the payment of the 8.250% senior notes. however, we anticipate that we will enter into a new borrowing agreement to repay our 8.250% senior notes prior to maturity.
on july 6, 2015, we entered into an amended and restated senior unsecured five-year credit agreement. the credit agreement provides for: (i) the revolving credit facility in the initial amount of $1.5 billion, which may, subject to the lenders discretion, be increased to $2.0 billion and (ii) a $500.0 million
(2)  five-year delayed draw term loan facility, (collectively the credit facility). both the revolving credit facility and the term loan facility expire on july 6, 2020. the revolving credit facility is subject to two whole or partial one-year extensions, at the lenders discretion.
as of august 31, 2017, the interest rate on the revolving credit facility borrowings ranged from 2.4% to 4.4% and the interest rate on the term loan facility was 2.6%. interest is charged at a rate equal to (a) for the revolving credit facility, either
0.000% to 0.650% above the base rate or 1.000% to 1.650% above the eurocurrency rate and (b) for the term loan facility, either 0.125% to 1.000% above the base rate or 1.125% to 2.000% above the eurocurrency rate. the base rate represents the greatest of: (i) citibank, n.a.s base rate, (ii) 0.50% above the federal funds rate, and (iii) 1.0%
above one-month libor, but not less than zero. the eurocurrency rate represents adjusted libor or adjusted cdor, as applicable, for the applicable interest period, but not less than zero.
as of august 31, 2017, our foreign subsidiaries have various additional credit facilities that finance their future growth and any corresponding working capital needs. the foreign subsidiary credit facilities incur interest at fixed and variable rates ranging from 1.2% to 3.5%.
as of august 31, 2017, we had $1.9 billion in available unused borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facilities. we may need to finance day-to-day working capital needs, as well as future growth and any corresponding working capital needs, with additional borrowings under our revolving credit facility and our other credit facilities as well as additional public and private offerings of our debt and equity. we continue to assess our capital structure and evaluate the merits of redeploying available cash to reduce existing debt or repurchase common stock.
in addition to the term loan facility described above, as of august 31, 2017, we have borrowings
(3)  outstanding to fund working capital needs. these additional loans are approximately $2.1 million and have interest rates ranging from 0.0% to 10.0%.
39
currently, we have a shelf registration statement with the sec registering the potential sale of an indeterminate amount of debt and equity securities in the future to augment our liquidity and capital resources.
the current shelf registration statement expires in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 and we expect to file a new registration statement prior to its expiration.
our senior notes and our credit facility contain various financial and nonfinancial covenants. a violation of these covenants could negatively impact our liquidity by restricting our ability to borrow under the notes payable and credit facilities and potentially causing acceleration of amounts due under these notes payable and credit facilities. as of august 31, 2017 and 2016, we were in compliance with all covenants under our senior notes and credit facility. refer to note 9  notes payable, long-term debt and capital lease obligations to the consolidated financial statements for further details.
asset-backed securitization and trade accounts receivable sale programs asset-backed securitization programs we continuously sell designated pools of trade accounts receivable, at a discount, under our asset-backed securitization programs to special purpose entities, which in turn sell 100% of the receivables to: (i) conduits administered by unaffiliated financial institutions and (ii) an unaffiliated financial institution. any portion of the purchase price for the receivables not paid in cash upon the sale occurring is recorded as a deferred purchase price receivable, which is paid from available cash as payments on the receivables are collected.
following is a summary of our asset-backed securitization programs and key terms:

(1)  maximum amount available at any one time.
(2)  on october 18, 2017, the program was extended to november 17, 2017.
in connection with our asset-backed securitization programs, as of august 31, 2017, we sold $1.2 billion of eligible trade accounts receivable, which represents the face amount of total sold outstanding receivables at that date. in exchange, we received cash proceeds of $590.9 million and recorded a deferred purchase price receivable of $568.7 million. as of august 31, 2017, we had up to $11.1 million in available liquidity under our asset-backed securitization programs.
our asset-backed securitization programs contain various financial and nonfinancial covenants. as of august 31,
2017 and 2016, we were in compliance with all covenants under our asset-backed securitization programs. refer to note 3  trade accounts receivable securitization and sale programs to the consolidated financial statements for further details on the programs.

(2)  the maximum amount under the program was increased during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017 and will be reduced to $650.0 million on february 1, 2018.
(3)  any party may elect to terminate the agreement upon 15 days prior notice.
during the fiscal year ended august 31, 2017, we sold $3.0 billion of trade accounts receivable under these programs and we received cash proceeds of $3.0 billion. as of august 31, 2017, we had up to $613.7 million in available liquidity under our trade accounts receivable sale programs.
capital expenditures we currently anticipate that during the next 12 months, our net capital expenditures, which do not include any amounts spent on acquisitions, will be approximately $700.0 million, principally to support ongoing business in the dms and ems segments.

equivalents net cash provided by operating activities during the fiscal year ended august 31, 2017 resulted primarily from net income, an increase in non-cash expenses, accounts payable and accrued expenses and other liabilities, partially offset by an increase in inventories and accounts receivable. the increase in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities was primarily due to an increase in materials purchases due to increased demand in the mobility business, advance deposits from customers and the timing of purchases and cash payments. the increase in inventories supports expected sales levels in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 and also is due to increased demand. the increase in accounts receivable is primarily driven by the timing of sales and cash collections activity as well as higher sales levels.
net cash used in investing activities during the fiscal year ended august 31, 2017 consisted primarily of: (i)
capital expenditures principally to support ongoing business in the dms and ems segments and (ii) cash paid for the acquisition of lewis engineering, including certain intangible assets, net of cash received, which were partially offset by proceeds from the sale of property, plant and equipment.
net cash used in financing activities during the fiscal year ended august 31, 2017, was primarily due to: (i) payments for debt agreements, (ii) the repurchase of our common stock and (iii) dividend payments. net cash used in financing activities was partially offset by: (i) borrowings under debt agreements and (ii) net proceeds from the exercise of stock options and issuance of common stock under the employee stock purchase plan.

the difference between dividends declared and dividends paid is due to dividend equivalents for unvested

we currently expect to continue to declare and pay regular quarterly dividends of an amount similar to our past declarations. however, the declaration and payment of future dividends are discretionary and will be subject to determination by our board of directors (the board) each quarter following its review of our financial performance.
in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015, our board authorized the repurchase of $100.0 million of our common stock during the twelve-month period following the authorization (the 2015 share repurchase program).
during the first quarter of fiscal year 2016, we repurchased 2.8 million shares for approximately $54.5 million, which utilized the remaining amount outstanding under the 2015 share repurchase program.
in june 2016, the board authorized the repurchase of up to $400.0 million of our common stock (the 2016 share repurchase program). as of august 31, 2017, $400.0
million of shares had been repurchased under the 2016 share repurchase program, which utilized the total amount authorized by the board.
in july 2017, the board authorized the repurchase of up to $450.0 million of our common stock (the 2017 share repurchase program). the 2017 share repurchase program expires on august 31, 2018. as of october 10, 2017, $32.9
million of shares had been repurchased under the 2017 share repurchase program.
contractual obligations our contractual obligations as of august 31, 2017 are summarized below. as disclosed below, while we have certain non-cancelable purchase order obligations for property, plant and equipment, we generally do not enter into non-cancelable purchase orders for materials until we receive a corresponding purchase commitment from our customer. non-cancelable purchase orders do not typically extend beyond the normal lead time of several weeks, at most. purchase orders beyond this time frame are typically cancelable.

consists of interest on notes payable, long-term debt and capital lease obligations outstanding as of
(1)  august 31, 2017. certain of our notes payable and long-term debt pay interest at variable rates. we have applied estimated interest rates to determine the value of these expected future interest payments.
(2)  consists of purchase commitments entered into as of august 31, 2017 for property, plant and equipment pursuant to legally enforceable and binding agreements.

includes the estimated company contributions to funded pension plans during fiscal year 2018 and the
(3)  expected benefit payments for unfunded pension and postretirement plans from fiscal years 2018 through
2027. these future payments are not recorded on the consolidated balance sheets but will be recorded as incurred.
as of august 31, 2017, we have $100.9 million recorded as a long-term liability for uncertain tax positions. we are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of payments, or the amount by which our
(4)  liability for these uncertain tax positions will increase or decrease over time, and accordingly, this liability has been excluded from the above table.
item 7a. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange risks we transact business in various foreign countries and are, therefore, subject to risk of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. we enter into forward contracts to economically hedge transactional exposure associated with commitments arising from trade accounts receivable, trade accounts payable, intercompany transactions and fixed purchase obligations denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the respective operating entity. we do not, and do not intend to use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes. all derivative instruments are recorded on our consolidated balance sheets at their respective fair values.
the forward contracts (both those that are designated and not designated as accounting hedging instruments) will generally expire in less than three months, with 11 months being the maximum term of the contracts outstanding as of august 31, 2017. the change in fair value related to contracts designated as accounting hedging instruments will be reflected in the revenue or expense line in which the underlying transaction occurs within our consolidated statements of operations. the change in fair value related to contracts not designated as accounting hedging instruments will be reflected in cost of revenue within our consolidated statements of operations. the forward contracts are primarily denominated in chinese yuan renminbi, euros, indian rupees and mexican pesos.
based on our overall currency rate exposures as of august 31, 2017, including the derivative financial instruments intended to hedge the nonfunctional currency-denominated monetary assets and liabilities, an immediate 10% hypothetical change of foreign currency exchange rates would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.
interest rate risk a portion of our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to our domestic investment portfolio. we do not, and do not intend to, use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes. we place cash and cash equivalents with various major financial institutions.
during fiscal year 2016, we entered into forward starting swap transactions to hedge the fixed interest rate payments for an anticipated debt issuance. the forward starting swaps have an aggregate notional amount of $200.0 million and have been designated as hedging instruments and accounted for as cash flow hedges. the forward starting swaps are scheduled to expire on march 15, 2018. if the anticipated debt issuance occurs before march 15, 2018, the contracts will be terminated simultaneously with the debt issuance. the contracts will be settled with the respective counterparties on a net basis at the time of termination or expiration. changes in the fair value of the forward starting swap transactions are recorded on our consolidated balance sheets as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income
(aoci).
during fiscal year 2016, we entered into interest rate swap transactions to hedge the variable interest rate payments for the term loan facility. in connection with this transaction, we pay interest based upon a fixed rate as agreed upon with the respective counterparties and receive variable rate interest payments based on the one-month libor.
the interest rate swaps have an aggregate notional amount of $200.0 million and have been designated as hedging instruments and accounted for as cash flow hedges. the interest rate swaps were effective on september 30, 2016 and are scheduled to expire on june 30, 2019. the contracts will be settled with the respective counterparties on a net basis at each settlement date. changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap transactions are recorded on our consolidated balance sheets as a component of aoci.
we pay interest on several of our outstanding borrowings at variable interest rates. there were $456.3 million in borrowings outstanding under variable interest rate debt facilities as of august 31, 2017. see managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  liquidity and capital resources
and note 9  notes payable, long-term debt and capital lease obligations to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our outstanding debt obligations. the effect of an immediate hypothetical 10% change in variable interest rates would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.

item 9. changes in and disagreements with accountants on accounting and financial disclosure there have been no changes in or disagreements with our accountants on accounting and financial disclosure.
item 9a. controls and procedures
(a) evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures we carried out an evaluation required by rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the exchange act (the evaluation), under the supervision and with the participation of our chief executive officer (ceo) and chief financial officer (cfo), of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the exchange act as of august 31, 2017. based on the evaluation, our ceo and cfo concluded that the design and operation of our disclosure controls were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the exchange act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in sec rules and forms, and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our senior management, including our ceo and cfo, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
(b) managements report on internal control over financial reporting we assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of august 31, 2017. managements report on internal control over financial reporting as of august 31, 2017 is incorporated herein at item 15. ernst & young llp, our independent registered public accounting firm, issued an audit report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of august 31, 2017, which is incorporated herein at item 15.
our management, including our ceo and cfo, does not expect that our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud. a control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the company have been detected. these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. additionally, controls may be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the control.
the design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, a control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.
notwithstanding the foregoing limitations on the effectiveness of controls, we have reached the conclusions set forth in managements report on internal control over financial reporting as of august 31, 2017.
(c) changes in internal control over financial reporting for our fiscal quarter ended august 31, 2017, we did not identify any modifications to our internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

managements report on internal control over financial reporting management of jabil inc. (the company) is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rule13a-15(f) of the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended.
because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
under the supervision of and with the participation of the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer, the companys management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of the companys internal control over financial reporting as of august 31, 2017. management based this assessment on the framework as established in internal control  integrated framework (2013) issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission. managements assessment included an evaluation of the design of the companys internal control over financial reporting and testing of the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting.
based on this assessment, management has concluded that, as of august 31, 2017, the company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting.
ernst & young llp, the companys independent registered public accounting firm, issued an audit report on the effectiveness of the companys internal control over financial reporting which follows this report.

report of independent registered public accounting firm the board of directors and stockholders of jabil inc.
we have audited jabil inc. and subsidiaries internal control over financial reporting as of august 31, 2017, based on criteria established in internal controlintegrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission (2013 framework) (the coso criteria). jabil inc. and subsidiaries management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying managements report on internal control over financial reporting. our responsibility is to express an opinion on the companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board (united states). those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
a companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. a companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)
pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
in our opinion, jabil inc. and subsidiaries maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of august 31, 2017, based on the coso criteria.
we also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board (united states), the consolidated balance sheets of jabil inc. and subsidiaries as of august 31, 2017 and 2016, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended august 31, 2017 of jabil inc. and subsidiaries and our report dated october 19, 2017 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

jabil inc. and subsidiaries notes to consolidated financial statements
1. description of business and summary of significant accounting policies jabil inc. (together with its subsidiaries, herein referred to as the company) is an independent provider of manufacturing services and solutions. the company provides comprehensive electronics design, production and product management services to companies in the automotive and transportation, capital equipment, consumer lifestyles and wearable technologies, computing and storage, defense and aerospace, digital home, healthcare, industrial and energy, mobility, networking and telecommunications, packaging, point of sale and printing industries. the companys services combine a highly automated, continuous flow manufacturing approach with advanced electronic design and design for manufacturability technologies. the company is headquartered in st. petersburg, florida and has manufacturing operations in the americas, europe, asia and africa.
significant accounting policies followed by the company are as follows:
principles of consolidation and basis of presentation the consolidated financial statements include the accounts and operations of the company, and its wholly-owned and majority-owned subsidiaries.
all significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements.
use of accounting estimates management is required to make estimates and assumptions during the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in conformity with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles (u.s. gaap). these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. actual results could differ materially from these estimates and assumptions.
cash and cash equivalents cash equivalents consist of investments that are readily convertible to cash with original maturities of 90 days or less. as of august 31, 2017 and 2016 there were $71.5 million and $22.4 million of cash equivalents, respectively.
accounts receivable accounts receivable consist of trade receivables and other miscellaneous receivables. the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments. bad debts are charged to this allowance after all attempts to collect the balance are exhausted. allowances of $14.1 million and $11.1
million were recorded as of august 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. as the financial condition and circumstances of the companys customers change, adjustments to the allowance for doubtful accounts are made as necessary.
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market and use a first in, first out (fifo) method.
property, plant and equipment, net property, plant and equipment is capitalized at cost and depreciated using the straight-line depreciation method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets. estimated useful lives for major classes of depreciable assets are as follows:
asset class                                 estimated useful life buildings                                   up to 35 years leasehold improvements                      shorter of lease term or useful life of the improvement machinery and equipment                     2 to 10 years furniture, fixtures and office equipment    5 years computer hardware and software              3 to 7 years transportation equipment                    3 years certain equipment held under capital leases is classified as property, plant and equipment and the related obligation is recorded as notes payable, long-term debt and capital lease obligations on the consolidated balance sheets. amortization of assets held under capital leases is included in depreciation expense in the consolidated statements of operations. maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. the cost and related accumulated depreciation of assets sold or retired is removed from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is reflected in the consolidated statements of operations as a component of operating income.
60
goodwill and other intangible assets the company accounts for goodwill in a business combination as the excess of the cost over the fair value of net assets acquired and is assigned to the reporting unit in which the acquired business will operate. the company tests goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
the recoverability of goodwill is measured at the reporting unit level by comparing the reporting units carrying amount, including goodwill, to the fair value of the reporting unit. if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, goodwill is considered impaired and a second step is performed to measure the amount of loss, if any.
the recoverability of indefinite-lived intangible assets is measured by comparing the carrying amount to the fair value. the company determines the fair value of its indefinite-lived intangible assets principally based on a variation of the income approach, known as the relief from royalty method. if the carrying amount of the indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value, the indefinite-lived intangible asset is considered impaired.
business combinations can also result in other intangible assets being recognized. finite-lived intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful life and include contractual agreements and customer relationships and intellectual property. no significant residual values are estimated for the amortizable intangible assets.
long-lived assets long-lived assets, such as property, plant and equipment, and finite-lived intangible assets, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable.
recoverability of the asset or asset group is measured by comparing its carrying amount to the undiscounted future net cash flows the asset is expected to generate. if the carrying amount of an asset or asset group is not recoverable, the company recognizes an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount of the long-lived asset or asset group over its respective fair value, which is generally determined as the present value of estimated future cash flows or as the appraised value.
derivative instruments all derivative instruments are recorded gross on the consolidated balance sheets at their respective fair values.
the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative instrument depends on the intended use and designation of the derivative instrument. for derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a fair value hedge, the gain or loss on the derivative and the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in current earnings. for derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a cash flow hedge, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is initially reported as a component of aoci, net of tax, and is subsequently reclassified into the line item within the consolidated statements of operations in which the hedged items are recorded in the same period in which the hedged item affects earnings. the ineffective portion of the gain or loss is recognized immediately in current earnings. for derivative instruments that are not designated as hedging instruments, gains and losses from changes in fair values are recognized in earnings. cash receipts and cash payments related to derivative instruments are recorded in the same category as the cash flows from the items being hedged on the consolidated statements of cash flows.
accumulated other comprehensive income the following table sets forth the changes in accumulated other comprehensive income (aoci), net of tax, by component during the fiscal year ended august 31, 2017 (in thousands):

(1)  there is no tax benefit (expense) related to the foreign currency translation adjustment components of aoci, including reclassification adjustments, for the fiscal years ended august 31, 2017 and 2016.
the portions of aoci reclassified into earnings during the fiscal years ended august 31, 2017 and 2016 for derivative instruments were primarily classified as a component of cost of revenue. the portion that is expected to be reclassified into earnings during the next 12 months will primarily be classified as a component of cost of revenue. the annual tax benefit (expense) for unrealized gains on derivative
(2)  instruments, including reclassification adjustments, is $(1.9) million and $(4.0) million for the fiscal years ended august 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. the accumulated tax benefit (expense) for unrealized gains on derivative instruments, including reclassification adjustments, is $13.4 million and $15.3 million for the fiscal years ended august 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
the portions of aoci reclassified into earnings during the fiscal years ended august 31, 2017 and 2016 for actuarial gain and prior service cost are included in the computation of net periodic benefit pension cost.
(3)  refer to note 10  postretirement and other employee benefits for additional information. the tax benefit
(expense) for actuarial gain, including reclassification adjustments, is $(1.0) million and $0.6 million, and for prior service cost, including reclassification adjustments, is $(0.3) million and $(0.3) million for the fiscal years ended august 31, 2017 and 2016.
the portion of aoci reclassified into earnings during the fiscal year ended august 31, 2017 for available for sale securities was due to an other than temporary impairment on securities and was classified as a
(4)  component of other expense. there is no tax benefit (expense) related to the available for sale securities components of aoci, including reclassification adjustments, for the fiscal years ended august 31, 2017 and
2016.
foreign currency transactions for the companys foreign subsidiaries that use a currency other than the u.s. dollar as their functional currency, the assets and liabilities are translated at exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date, and revenues and expenses are translated at the average exchange rate for the period. the effects of these translation adjustments are reported in accumulated other comprehensive income. gains and losses arising from transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the entity involved are included in operating income.
revenue recognition the company derives substantially all of its revenue from production and product management services (collectively referred to as
manufacturing services), which encompasses the act of producing tangible components that are built to customer specifications, which are then provided to the customer. the company recognizes manufacturing services revenue when such tangible components are shipped to or the goods are received by the customer, title and risk of ownership have passed, the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured (net of estimated returns). the company also derives revenue to a lesser extent from electronic design services to certain customers. revenue from electronic design services is generally recognized upon completion and acceptance by the respective customer. taxes collected from the companys customers and remitted to governmental authorities are presented within the companys consolidated statement of operations on a net basis. the company records shipping and handling costs reimbursed by the customer in revenue.
upfront payments from customers are recorded upon receipt as deferred income and are recognized as revenue as the related manufacturing services are provided.
stock-based compensation the company recognizes stock-based compensation expense, reduced for estimated forfeitures, on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the award, which is generally the vesting period for outstanding stock awards.
the stock-based compensation expense for time-based and performance based restricted stock is measured at fair value on the date of grant based on the number of shares expected to vest and the quoted market price of the companys common stock. for restricted stock awards with performance conditions, stock-based compensation expense is originally based on the number of shares that would vest if the company achieved 100% of the performance goal, which is the intended outcome at the grant date.
throughout the requisite service period, management monitors the probability of achievement of the performance condition. if it becomes probable, based on the companys performance, that more or less than the current estimate of the awarded shares will vest, an adjustment to stock-based compensation expense will be recognized as a change in accounting estimate in the period the probability changes.
the stock-based compensation expense for market-based restricted stock awards is measured at fair value on the date of grant. the market conditions are considered in the grant date fair value using a monte carlo valuation model, which utilizes multiple input variables to determine the probability of the company achieving the specified market conditions.
stock-based compensation expense related to an award with a market condition will be recognized over the requisite service period regardless of whether the market condition is satisfied, provided that the requisite service period has been completed.
62
the company capitalizes stock-based compensation costs related to awards granted to employees whose compensation costs are directly attributable to the cost of inventory.
the company currently expects to satisfy share-based awards with registered shares available to be issued.
see note 12  stockholders equity for further discussion of stock-based compensation expense.
income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in the tax rate is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date of the rate change. the company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. the company considers future taxable income and ongoing feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance.
earnings per share the company calculates its basic earnings per share by dividing net income attributable to jabil inc. by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. the companys diluted earnings per share is calculated in a similar manner, but includes the effect of dilutive securities. the difference between the weighted average number of basic shares outstanding and the weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding is primarily due to dilutive unvested restricted stock awards.
potential shares of common stock are excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share when their effect would be antidilutive. performance-based restricted stock awards are considered dilutive when the related performance criterion have been met assuming the end of the reporting period represents the end of the performance period. all potential shares of common are antidilutive in periods of net loss. dilutive shares outstanding not included in the computation of earnings per share because their effect was antidilutive were as follows (in thousands):

fair value of financial instruments the three levels of the fair-value hierarchy include: level 1  quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities; level 2  inputs other than quoted market prices included in level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly; and level 3  unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.
the carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, trade accounts receivable, prepaid expenses and other current assets, accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate fair value because of the short-term nature of these financial instruments. refer to note 3  trade accounts receivable securitization and sale programs, note 9  notes payable, long-term debt and capital lease obligations, note 10  postretirement and other employee benefits and note 14
derivative financial instruments and hedging activities for disclosure surrounding the fair value of the companys deferred purchase price receivables, debt obligations, pension plan assets and derivative financial instruments, respectively.
refer to note 2  discontinued operations for discussion of the companys senior non-convertible cumulative preferred stock. the senior non-convertible cumulative preferred stock is valued each reporting period using unobservable inputs (level 3 inputs) based on an interest rate lattice model and is classified as an available for sale security with an unrealized gain (loss) recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (aoci). the unobservable inputs have an immaterial impact on the fair value calculation of the senior non-convertible cumulative preferred stock. as of august 31,
2017, the fair value was $49.8 million, and is included within other assets on the consolidated balance sheets.
2. discontinued operations on december 17, 2013, the company announced that it entered into a stock purchase agreement with iqor holdings, inc. (iqor)
for the sale of jabils aftermarket services (ams) business for consideration of $725.0 million, which consisted of $675.0 million in cash and an aggregate liquidation preference value of $50.0 million in senior non-convertible cumulative preferred stock of iqor that accretes dividends at an annual rate of 8 percent and is redeemable in nine years or upon a change in control. on april 1, 2014, the company completed the sale of the ams business except for the sale of the malaysian operations, which was completed on december 31, 2014.
63
the purchase price was finalized during fiscal year 2015 and was reduced by $100.2 million for cash, indebtedness, taxes, interest and certain working capital accounts of the companys ams business. also, as part of this transaction, the company is subject to a limited covenant not to compete.
for all periods presented, the operating results associated with this business have been reclassified into discontinued operations, net of tax in the consolidated statements of operations. net revenue of $14.6 million was included in discontinued operations for fiscal year 2015.

3. trade accounts receivable securitization and sale programs the company regularly sells designated pools of trade accounts receivable under two asset-backed securitization programs and five uncommitted trade accounts receivable sale programs (collectively referred to herein as the programs). the company continues servicing the receivables sold and in exchange receives a servicing fee under each of the programs. servicing fees related to each of the programs recognized during the fiscal years ended august 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 were not material.
the company does not record a servicing asset or liability on the consolidated balance sheets as the company estimates that the fee it receives to service these receivables approximates the fair market compensation to provide the servicing activities.
transfers of the receivables under the programs are accounted for as sales and, accordingly, net receivables sold under the programs are excluded from accounts receivable on the consolidated balance sheets and are reflected as cash provided by operating activities on the consolidated statements of cash flows.
asset-backed securitization programs the company continuously sells designated pools of trade accounts receivable, at a discount, under its north american asset-backed securitization program and its foreign asset-backed securitization program (collectively referred to herein as the
asset-backed securitization programs) to special purpose entities, which in turn sell 100% of the receivables to:
(i) conduits administered by unaffiliated financial institutions for the north american asset-backed securitization program and (ii) to an unaffiliated financial institution and a conduit administered by an unaffiliated financial institution for the foreign asset-backed securitization program. any portion of the purchase price for the receivables not paid in cash upon the sale occurring is recorded as a deferred purchase price receivable, which is paid from available cash as payments on the receivables are collected.
the special purpose entity in the north american asset-backed securitization program is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the company. the special purpose entity in the foreign asset-backed securitization program is a separate bankruptcy-remote entity whose assets would be first available to satisfy the creditor claims of the unaffiliated financial institution. the company is deemed the primary beneficiary of this special purpose entity as the company has both the power to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impact the entitys economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive the benefits that could potentially be significant to the entity from the transfer of the trade accounts receivable into the special purpose entity. accordingly, the special purpose entities associated with these asset-backed securitization programs are included in the companys consolidated financial statements.
following is a summary of the asset-backed securitization programs and key terms:

(2)  recorded to other expense within the consolidated statements of operations.
recorded initially at fair value as prepaid expenses and other current assets on the consolidated balance sheets and are valued using unobservable inputs (level 3 inputs), primarily discounted cash flows, and due
(3)  to their credit quality and short-term maturity the fair values approximated book values. the unobservable inputs consist of estimated credit losses and estimated discount rates, which both have an immaterial impact on the fair value calculations.
65
the asset-backed securitization programs require compliance with several covenants. the north american asset-backed securitization program covenants include compliance with the interest coverage ratio and debt to ebitda ratio of the five-year unsecured credit facility amended as of july 6, 2015 (the credit facility). the foreign asset-backed securitization program covenants include limitations on certain corporate actions such as mergers and consolidations. as of august 31, 2017 and 2016, the company was in compliance with all covenants under the asset-backed securitization programs.

for the fiscal year ended august 31, 2017, the change in the impact of foreign tax rates was due to a decrease in income in low tax-rate jurisdictions. the valuation allowance increase was due to an increase of deferred tax assets for sites with existing valuation allowances, partially offset by an income tax benefit of
$27.5 million for the reversal of valuation allowances related to non-u.s. jurisdictions.
the company has been granted tax incentives for its brazilian, chinese, malaysian, polish, singaporean and vietnamese subsidiaries. the majority of the tax incentive benefits expire at various dates through fiscal year 2021 and are subject to certain conditions with which the company expects to comply. these subsidiaries generated income from continuing operations during the fiscal years ended august 31, 2017, 2016 and
2015, resulting in a tax benefit of approximately $38.6 million ($0.22 per basic share), $50.5 million ($0.27 per basic share) and
$74.7 million ($0.39 per basic share), respectively. the benefits of these incentives are recorded as the impact of foreign tax rates and income tax credits.

as of august 31, 2017, the company had federal, state (tax-effected) and foreign income tax net operating loss carry forwards (net of unrecognized tax benefits) of approximately $442.5 million, $58.7 million, and $315.0
million, respectively, which are available to reduce future taxes, if any. the net operating loss carry forwards in the companys major tax jurisdictions expire in fiscal years 2018 through 2037 or have an indefinite carry forward period. the company has u.s. federal and state tax credit carry forwards of $53.9 million and $5.0 million, respectively, which are available to reduce future taxes, if any. most of the u.s. federal tax credits expire through the year 2024. most of the u.s.
state tax credits expire through the year 2027. as of august 31, 2017, the foreign jurisdiction tax credits include foreign investment tax credits of $21.4 million that expire in 2026 and are based on the deferral method.
based on the companys historical operating income, projection of future taxable income, scheduled reversal of taxable temporary differences, and tax planning strategies, management believes that it is more likely than not that the company will realize the benefit of its deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowances recorded. the net (decreases) increases in the total valuation allowance for the fiscal years ended august 31, 2017 and 2016 were $(59.3) million and $40.0 million, respectively. the decrease in valuation allowance is primarily related to the decrease of a net operating loss carry forward due to additional non-u.s.
unrecognized tax benefits, the decrease of a net operating loss carry forward due to a non-u.s. tax audit, and the release of certain non-u.s.

valuation allowances. this decrease is partially offset by the increase of deferred tax assets in sites with existing valuation allowances. the companys assessment of the valuation allowance release included consideration of all available positive and negative evidence including, among other evidence, historical cumulative operating income, projected future taxable income and recent utilization of non-u.s. tax credit carryforwards.
as of august 31, 2017, the company intends to indefinitely reinvest the remaining earnings from its foreign subsidiaries for which a deferred tax liability has not already been recorded. the accumulated earnings are the most significant component of the basis difference which is indefinitely reinvested. the aggregate undistributed earnings of the companys foreign subsidiaries for which no deferred tax liability has been recorded is approximately $3.4 billion as of august 31, 2017. determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability on these undistributed earnings is not practicable.

recognized)
for the fiscal year ended august 31, 2017, the additions for tax positions related to current year primarily related to certain non-u.s. net operating loss carry forwards, previously offset with a valuation allowance, that can no longer be recognized due to an internal restructuring. it is reasonably possible that the august 31, 2017
unrecognized tax benefits could decrease during the next 12 months by $66.3 million, primarily related to a taxing authority ruling associated with the internal restructuring.
for the fiscal year ended august 31, 2015, the reductions from settlements with taxing authorities is primarily related to the closure of a non-u.s. audit, which partially disallowed a net operating loss carry forward and future tax amortization.
the company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. the companys accrued interest and penalties were approximately $27.1 million and $21.9 million as of august 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. the company recognized interest and penalties of approximately $5.2 million, $1.8 million and $2.1 million during the fiscal years ended august 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. the company is no longer subject to u.s. federal income tax examinations for fiscal years before august 31, 2009. in major state and major non-u.s. jurisdictions, the company is no longer subject to income tax examinations for fiscal years before august 31, 2003 and august 31, 2006, respectively.
the internal revenue service (irs) completed its field examination of the companys tax returns for fiscal years 2009 through 2011 and issued a revenue agents report (rar) on may 27, 2015, which was updated on june 22,
2016. the irs completed its field examination of the companys tax returns for fiscal years 2012 through
2014 and issued an rar on april 19, 2017. the proposed adjustments in the rar from both examination periods relate primarily to u.s. taxation of certain intercompany transactions. if the irs ultimately prevails in its positions, the companys income tax payment due for the fiscal years 2009 through 2011 and 2012 through 2014 would be approximately $28.6 million and $5.3 million, respectively, after utilization of tax loss carry forwards available through fiscal year 2014.
also, the irs has proposed interest and penalties with respect to fiscal years 2009 through 2011. the irs may make similar claims in future audits with respect to these types of transactions. at this time, anticipating the amount of any future irs proposed adjustments, interest, and penalties is not practicable.
the company disagrees with the proposed adjustments and intends to vigorously contest these matters through the applicable irs administrative and judicial procedures, as appropriate.
as the final resolution of the proposed adjustments remains uncertain, the company continues to provide for the uncertain tax positions based on the more likely than not standard. while the resolution of the issues may result in tax liabilities, interest and penalties that are significantly higher than the amounts accrued for these matters, management currently believes that the resolution will not have a material adverse effect on the companys financial position, results of operations or cash flows. however, there can be no assurance that managements beliefs will be realized.

(1)  the notes are carried at the principal amount of each note, less any unamortized discount and unamortized debt issuance costs.
(2)  the senior notes are the companys senior unsecured obligations and rank equally with all other existing and future senior unsecured debt obligations.
(3)  the interest rate payable on the 8.250% senior notes is subject to adjustment from time to time if the credit ratings assigned to the 8.250% senior notes increase or decrease.
on may 19, 2016, the company entered into a note purchase agreement with certain third parties, which
(4)  closed on july 14, 2016, for a private placement of $300.0 million of senior unsecured notes (the
4.900% senior notes). the proceeds from the sale of the notes were used to repay debt maturities.
on july 6, 2015, the company entered into an amended and restated senior unsecured five-year credit agreement. the credit agreement provides for: (i) the revolving credit facility in the initial amount of
$1.5
(5)  billion, which may, subject to the lenders discretion, potentially be increased up to $2.0 billion and
(ii) a $500.0 million five-year delayed draw term loan facility, (collectively the credit facility). the credit facility expires on july 6, 2020. the revolving credit facility is subject to two whole or partial one-year extensions, at the lenders discretion.
as of august 31, 2017, the interest rates on the revolving credit facility ranged from 2.4% to 4.4% and the term loan facility was 2.6%.
interest is charged at a rate equal to (a) for the revolving credit facility, either 0.000% to 0.650% above the base rate or 1.000% to 1.650% above the eurocurrency rate and (b) for the term loan facility, either 0.125% to

debt covenants borrowings under the companys debt agreements are subject to various covenants that limit the companys ability to: incur additional indebtedness, sell assets, effect mergers and certain transactions, and effect certain transactions with subsidiaries and affiliates. in addition, the revolving credit facility and 4.900% senior notes contain debt leverage and interest coverage covenants. the company is also subject to a covenant requiring the repurchase of the 8.250%, 5.625%, or 4.700%
senior notes upon a change of control. as of august 31, 2017 and 2016, the company was in compliance with its debt covenants.
fair value the estimated fair values of the companys publicly traded debt, including the 8.250%, 5.625% and 4.700% senior notes, were approximately $414.0 million, $433.6 million and $530.6 million respectively, as of august 31, 2017. the fair value estimates are based upon observable market data (level 2 criteria). the estimated fair value of the companys private debt, the
4.900% senior notes, was approximately $316.6 million, as of august 31, 2017. this fair value estimate is based on the companys indicative borrowing cost derived from discounted cash flows (level 3 criteria). the carrying amounts of borrowings under credit facilities and under loans approximates fair value as interest rates on these instruments approximates current market rates.
10. postretirement and other employee benefits postretirement benefits the company has a qualified defined benefit pension plan for employees of jabil circuit uk limited (the uk plan). the uk plan, which is closed to new participants, provides benefits based on average employee earnings over a three-
year service period preceding retirement and length of employee service. the companys policy is to contribute amounts sufficient to meet minimum funding requirements as set forth in uk employee benefit and tax laws plus such additional amounts as are deemed appropriate by the company.
as a result of acquiring various other operations in europe and asia, the company assumed both qualified and unfunded nonqualified retirement benefits covering eligible employees who meet age and service requirements (the other plans).
the uk plan and other plans are collectively referred to herein as the plans.

assumptions weighted-average actuarial assumptions used to determine net periodic benefit cost and projected benefit obligation for the plans for the fiscal years 2017, 2016 and 2015 were as follows:
pension
2017       2016       2015
net periodic benefit cost:
expected long-term return on plan               3.3  %     4.3  %     4.4  %

rate of compensation increase                   2.7  %     2.4  %     3.2  %
discount rate                                   1.9  %     2.9  %     1.8  %
projected benefit obligation:
expected long-term return on plan assets        4.0  %     3.3  %     4.4  %
rate of compensation increase                   4.4  %     4.1  %     4.3  %
discount rate(2)                                2.3  %     1.7  %     3.2  %
the expected return on plan assets assumption used in calculating net periodic benefit cost is based on
(1)  historical return experience and estimates of future long-term performance with consideration to the expected investment mix of the plan.
the discount rate is used to state expected cash flows relating to future benefits at a present value on the measurement date. this rate represents the market rate for high-quality fixed income investments whose
(2)  timing would match the cash outflow of retirement benefits. other assumptions include demographic factors such as retirement, mortality and turnover.
plan assets the company has adopted an investment policy for a majority of plan assets, which was set by plan trustees who have the responsibility for making investment decisions related to the plan assets. the plan trustees oversee the investment allocation, including selecting professional investment managers and setting strategic targets. the investment objectives for the assets are (1) to acquire suitable assets that hold the appropriate liquidity in order to generate income and capital growth that, along with new contributions, will meet the cost of current and future benefits under the plan, (2) to limit the risk of the plan assets from failing to meet the plan liabilities over the long-term and (3) to minimize the long-term costs under the plan by maximizing the return on the plan assets.
investment policies and strategies governing the assets of the plans are designed to achieve investment objectives with prudent risk parameters. risk management practices include the use of external investment managers; the maintenance of a portfolio diversified by asset class, investment approach and security holdings; and the maintenance of sufficient liquidity to meet benefit obligations as they come due. within the equity securities class, the investment policy provides for investments in a broad range of publicly traded securities including both domestic and international stocks. within the debt securities class, the investment policy provides for investments in corporate bonds as well as fixed and variable interest debt instruments. the company currently expects to achieve a target mix of 35% equity and 65% debt securities in fiscal year 2018.

consist of an insurance contract that guarantees the payment of the funded pension entitlements, as well as provides a profit share to the company. the profit share in this contract is not based on actual investments, but, instead on a notional investment portfolio that is expected to return a pre-defined rate. insurance contract assets are recorded at fair value and is determined based on the cash surrender value of the insured benefits which is the present
(4)  value of the guaranteed funded benefits. insurance contracts are valued using unobservable inputs (level 3
inputs), primarily by discounting expected future cash flows relating to benefits paid from a notional investment portfolio in order to determine the cash surrender value of the policy. the unobservable inputs consist of estimated future benefits to be paid throughout the duration of the policy and estimated discount rates, which both have an immaterial impact on the fair value estimate of the contract.

the company procures components from a broad group of suppliers. almost all of the products manufactured by the company require one or more components that are available from only a single source.
segment data operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise that engage in business activities from which they may earn revenues and incur expenses; for which separate financial information is available; and whose operating results are regularly reviewed by the chief operating decision maker to assess the performance of the individual segment and make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment.
the company derives its revenue from providing comprehensive electronics design, production and product management services. the chief operating decision maker evaluates performance and allocates resources on a segment basis. the companys operating segments consist of two segments  ems and dms, which are also the companys reportable segments. the segments are organized based on the economic profiles of the services performed, including manufacturing capabilities, market strategy, margins, return on capital and risk profiles. the ems segment is focused around leveraging it, supply chain design and engineering, technologies largely centered on core electronics, utilizing the companys large scale manufacturing infrastructure and the ability to serve a broad range of end markets. the ems segment is typically lower-margin but high volume business that is produced at a quicker rate (i.e. cycle time) and in higher quantities and includes customers primarily in the automotive and transportation, capital equipment, computing and storage, digital home, industrial and energy, networking and telecommunications, point of sale and printing industries. the dms segment is focused on providing engineering solutions, with an emphasis on material sciences and technologies. the dms segment is typically higher-margin business and includes customers primarily in the consumer lifestyles and wearable technologies, defense and aerospace, healthcare, mobility and packaging industries.
net revenue for the operating segments is attributed to the segment in which the service is performed. an operating segments performance is evaluated based on its pre-tax operating contribution, or segment income. segment income is defined as net revenue less cost of revenue, segment selling, general and administrative expenses, segment research and development expenses and an

allocation of corporate manufacturing expenses and selling, general and administrative expenses. segment income does not include amortization of intangibles, stock-based compensation expense and related charges, restructuring and related charges, distressed customer charges, acquisition costs and certain purchase accounting adjustments, loss on disposal of subsidiaries, settlement of receivables and related charges, impairment of notes receivable and related charges, goodwill impairment charges, income (loss) from discontinued operations, gain
(loss) on sale of discontinued operations, other expense, interest income, interest expense, income tax expense or adjustment for net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests. total segment assets are defined as accounts receivable, inventories, net customer-related property, plant and equipment, intangible assets net of accumulated amortization and goodwill. all other non-segment assets are reviewed on a global basis by management. transactions between operating segments are generally recorded at amounts that approximate those at which we would transact with third parties.

14. derivative financial instruments and hedging activities the company is directly and indirectly affected by changes in certain market conditions. these changes in market conditions may adversely impact the companys financial performance and are referred to as market risks. the company, where deemed appropriate, uses derivatives as risk management tools to mitigate the potential impact of certain market risks.
the primary market risks managed by the company through the use of derivative instruments are foreign currency fluctuation risk and interest rate risk.
foreign currency risk management forward contracts are put in place to manage the foreign currency risk associated with the anticipated foreign currency denominated revenues and expenses. a hedging relationship existed with an aggregate notional amount outstanding of $314.6 million and $323.3 million as of august 31, 2017 and august 31, 2016, respectively. the related forward foreign exchange contracts have been designated as hedging instruments and are accounted for as cash flow hedges.
the forward foreign exchange contract transactions will effectively lock in the value of anticipated foreign currency denominated revenues and expenses against foreign currency fluctuations. the anticipated foreign currency denominated revenues and expenses being hedged are expected to occur between september 1, 2017 and may 31, 2018.
in addition to derivatives that are designated as hedging instruments and qualify for hedge accounting, the company also enters into forward contracts to economically hedge transactional exposure associated with commitments arising from trade accounts receivable, trade accounts payable, fixed purchase obligations and intercompany transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the respective operating entity. the aggregate notional amount of these outstanding contracts as of august 31, 2017 and august 31, 2016, was $2.1 billion and $1.7 billion, respectively.

17. new accounting guidance recently issued accounting guidance during fiscal year 2014, the fasb issued an accounting standard which will supersede existing revenue recognition guidance under current u.s.
gaap. the new standard is a comprehensive new revenue recognition model that requires a company to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to a customer at an amount that reflects the consideration it expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. the accounting standard is effective for the company in the first quarter of fiscal year 2019. companies may use either a full retrospective or a modified retrospective approach to adopt this standard.
the company has determined that the new standard will result in a change to the timing of the companys revenue recognition policy for certain customer contracts to an over time model as opposed to a point in time model upon delivery.
additionally, the company anticipates the new standard will impact the companys accounting for certain fulfillment costs, which include up-front
87
costs to prepare for manufacturing activities that are expected to be recovered. under the new standard, such up-
front costs would be recognized as an asset and amortized on a systematic basis consistent with the pattern of the transfer of the goods to which the asset relates. the financial impacts of the new standard cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. the company is in the process of implementing changes to its processes, policies and internal controls to meet the impact of the new standard and disclosure requirements. the company expects to adopt the new guidance under the modified retrospective approach.
during fiscal year 2016, the fasb issued a new accounting standard to address certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of financial instruments. this guidance is effective for the company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2019. early application is permitted only for certain provisions, and the update must be applied by means of a cumulative-effect adjustment to the consolidated balance sheet as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption and applied prospectively to equity investments that exist as of the date of adoption of the standard. the company is currently assessing the impact this new standard may have on its consolidated financial statements.
during fiscal year 2016, the fasb issued a new accounting standard revising lease accounting. the new guidance requires organizations to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet and disclose key information regarding leasing arrangements. this guidance is effective for the company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2020. early application of the new standard is permitted and must be adopted using a modified retrospective approach. the adoption of this standard will impact the companys consolidated balance sheet. the company is currently assessing any other impacts this new standard will have on its consolidated financial statements.
during fiscal year 2016, the fasb issued an accounting standard, which replaces the existing incurred loss impairment methodology with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates. this guidance is effective for the company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2021 and early adoption is permitted beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2020. this guidance must be applied using a modified retrospective or prospective transition method, depending on the area covered by this accounting standard. the company is currently assessing the impact this new standard may have on its consolidated financial statements.
during fiscal year 2016, the fasb issued a new accounting standard to address the presentation of certain transactions within the statement of cash flows with the objective of reducing the existing diversity in practice. this guidance is effective for the company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2019 and early adoption is permitted. the company is currently assessing the impact this new standard may have on its consolidated financial statements.
during fiscal year 2017, the fasb issued a new accounting standard to improve the accounting for the income tax consequences of intra-entity transfers of assets other than inventory. the new standard eliminates the exception for an intra-entity transfer of an asset other than inventory and requires an entity to recognize the income tax consequences when the transfer occurs. this guidance is effective for the company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2019 and early adoption is permitted.
this guidance should be applied on a modified retrospective basis through a cumulative-effect adjustment directly to retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption. the company is currently assessing the impact this new standard may have on its consolidated financial statements.
during fiscal year 2017, the fasb issued a new accounting standard that clarifies the definition of a business to assist entities with evaluating whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions (or disposals) of assets or businesses.
this guidance is effective for the company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2019 and will be applied on a prospective basis.
early application is permitted for certain transactions. the impact on the companys consolidated financial statements will depend on the facts and circumstances of any specific future transactions.
during fiscal year 2017, the fasb issued a new accounting standard to simplify how an entity is required to test goodwill for impairment by eliminating the requirement to calculate the implied fair value of goodwill (i.e., step 2 of the current goodwill impairment test) to measure a goodwill impairment charge. goodwill will be considered impaired when the carrying amount of a reporting unit that includes goodwill exceeds its fair value. this guidance is effective for the company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2021, with early application permitted. the guidance will be applied on a prospective basis. the company is currently assessing the impact this new standard may have on its consolidated financial statements.
during fiscal year 2017, the fasb issued a new accounting standard which clarifies the scope of asset derecognition and adds further guidance for recognizing gains and losses from the transfer of non-financial assets in contracts with non-customers. this guidance is effective for the company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2019 coincident with the new revenue recognition guidance. the company is currently assessing the impact this new standard may have on its consolidated financial statements.
during fiscal year 2017, the fasb issued a new accounting standard to improve the financial reporting of hedging relationships to better portray the economic results of an entitys risk management activities by simplifying the application of hedge accounting and improving the related disclosures in its financial statements. this guidance is effective for the company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2020, with early adoption permitted. the guidance must be applied using a modified retrospective approach. the company is currently assessing the impact this new standard may have on its consolidated financial statements.
recently issued accounting guidance not discussed above is not applicable or did not have, or is not expected to have, a material impact to the company.

during the fiscal year ended august 31, 2017, the reductions charged to other accounts primarily relate to the decrease of net operating loss carry forwards due to non-u.s. unrecognized tax benefits and a non-u.s.
(2)  tax audit. during the fiscal year ended august 31, 2016, the additions charged to other accounts primarily related to the recognition of excess tax benefits due to the early adoption of the new accounting guidance for share-based payment transactions.
during the fiscal year ended august 31, 2017, the reductions charged to costs and expenses primarily
(3)  relate to the release of certain non-u.s. valuation allowances.

item 7. managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are one of the leading providers of worldwide manufacturing services and solutions. we provide comprehensive electronics design, production and product management services to companies in the automotive and transportation, capital equipment, consumer lifestyles and wearable technologies, computing and storage, defense and aerospace, digital home, healthcare, industrial and energy, mobility, networking and telecommunications, packaging, point of sale and printing industries.
we derive substantially all of our revenue from production and product management services (collectively referred to as manufacturing services), which encompass the act of producing tangible components that are built to customer specifications and are then provided to the customer.
we have two reporting segments: electronics manufacturing services (ems) and diversified manufacturing services (dms), which are organized based on the economic profiles of the services performed, including manufacturing capabilities, market strategy, margins, return on capital and risk profiles. our ems segment is focused around leveraging it, supply chain design and engineering, technologies largely centered on core electronics, utilizing our large scale manufacturing infrastructure and our ability to serve a broad range of end markets. our ems segment is typically a lower-margin but high volume business that produces product at a quicker rate (i.e. cycle time) and in larger quantities and includes customers primarily in the automotive and transportation, capital equipment, computing and storage, digital home, industrial and energy, networking and telecommunications, point of sale and printing industries. our dms segment is focused on providing engineering solutions, with an emphasis on material sciences and technologies. our dms segment is typically a higher-margin business and includes customers primarily in the consumer lifestyles and wearable technologies, defense and aerospace, healthcare, mobility and packaging industries.
our cost of revenue includes the cost of electronic components and other materials that comprise the products we manufacture; the cost of labor and manufacturing overhead; and adjustments for excess and obsolete inventory. as a provider of turnkey manufacturing services, we are responsible for procuring components and other materials. this requires us to commit significant working capital to our operations and to manage the purchasing, receiving, inspecting and stocking of materials. although we bear the risk of fluctuations in the cost of materials and excess scrap, we periodically negotiate cost of materials adjustments with our customers. net revenue from each product that we manufacture consists of an element based on the costs of materials in that product and an element based on the labor and manufacturing overhead costs allocated to that product. our gross margin for any product depends on the mix between the cost of materials in the product and the cost of labor and manufacturing overhead allocated to the product.
our operating results are impacted by the level of capacity utilization of manufacturing facilities; indirect labor costs; and selling, general and administrative expenses. operating income margins have generally improved during periods of high production volume and high capacity utilization. during periods of low production volume, we generally have idle capacity and reduced operating income margins.
we monitor the current economic environment and its potential impact on both the customers we serve as well as our end-markets and closely manage our costs and capital resources so that we can try to respond appropriately as circumstances change.
we have consistently utilized advanced circuit design, production design and manufacturing technologies to meet the needs of our customers. to support this effort, our engineering staff focuses on developing and refining design and manufacturing technologies to meet specific needs of specific customers. most of the expenses associated with these customer-specific efforts are reflected in our cost of revenue. in addition, our engineers engage in research and development (r&d) of new technologies that apply generally to our operations. the expenses of these r&d activities are reflected in the research and development line item within our consolidated statement of operations.
26
an important element of our strategy is the expansion of our global production facilities. the majority of our revenue and materials costs worldwide are denominated in u.s. dollars, while our labor and utility costs in operations outside the u.s. are denominated in local currencies. we economically hedge certain of these local currency costs, based on our evaluation of the potential exposure as compared to the cost of the hedge, through the purchase of foreign currency exchange contracts. changes in the fair market value of such hedging instruments are reflected within the consolidated statement of operations and the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
see note 13  concentration of risk and segment data to the consolidated financial statements.
in september 2017, our operations in cayey, puerto rico received significant hurricane damage. while we are still assessing the impact to our operations, we anticipate asset impairments and costs associated with business interruptions during the first half of fiscal year 2018. we also expect that the majority of these costs will ultimately be offset by insurance coverage.
summary of results net revenues for fiscal year 2017 increased approximately 3.9% to $19.1 billion compared to $18.4 billion for fiscal year 2016 primarily due to increased revenues due to new business from existing customers in our consumer lifestyles and wearable technologies business, and new business from existing customers in our healthcare and mobility businesses.

(1)   the sales cycle is calculated as the sum of days in accounts receivable and days in inventory, less the days in accounts payable; accordingly, the variance in the sales cycle quarter over quarter is a direct result of changes in these indicators.

(2)   during the three months ended august 31, 2017, the decrease in days in accounts receivable from the prior sequential quarter was primarily due to the timing of sales and collections activity.

(3)   during the three months ended february 28, 2017, days in inventory increased as compared to the prior sequential quarter: (i) as a result of lower production in the dms segment due to reduced consumer demand in the mobility business and (ii) to support expected revenue levels in the third quarter of fiscal year 2017.

(4)                     during the three months ended august 31, 2017, the increase in days in accounts payable from the prior sequential quarter was primarily due to higher materials purchases during the quarter due to increased demand in the mobility business as well as the timing of purchases and cash payments for purchases during the quarter. during the three months ended may 31, 2017, the increase in days in accounts payable from the prior sequential quarter was primarily due to the timing of purchases and cash payments for purchases during the quarter. during the three months ended august 31, 2016, the increase in days in accounts payable from the prior sequential quarter was primarily due to the timing of purchases and cash payments for purchases and higher materials purchases during the quarter.

critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles (u.s. gaap) requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. on an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions based upon historical experience and various other factors and circumstances. management believes that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable under the circumstances; however, actual results may vary from these
28
estimates and assumptions under different future circumstances. we have identified the following critical accounting policies that affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. for further discussion of our significant accounting policies, refer to note 1  description of business and summary of significant accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements.
revenue recognition we derive substantially all of our revenue from production and product management services (collectively referred to as manufacturing services), which encompasses the act of producing tangible components that are built to customer specifications, which are then provided to the customer. we recognize manufacturing services revenue when such tangible components are shipped to or the goods are received by the customer, title and risk of ownership have passed, the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured (net of estimated returns). we also derive revenue to a lesser extent from electronic design services to certain customers. revenue from electronic design services is generally recognized upon completion and acceptance by the respective customer. upfront payments from customers are recorded upon receipt as deferred income and are recognized as revenue as the related manufacturing services are provided.
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts related to receivables not expected to be collected from our customers. this allowance is based on managements assessment of specific customer balances after considering the age of receivables and financial stability of the customer. if there is an adverse change in the financial condition and circumstances of our customers, or if actual defaults are higher than provided for, an addition to the allowance may be necessary.
inventory valuation we purchase inventory based on forecasted demand and record inventory at the lower of cost or market. management regularly assesses inventory valuation based on current and forecasted usage, customer inventory-related contractual obligations and other lower of cost or market considerations. if actual market conditions or our customers product demands are less favorable than those projected, additional valuation adjustments may be necessary.
long-lived assets we review property, plant and equipment and amortizable intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. recoverability of property, plant and equipment is measured by comparing its carrying value to the undiscounted projected cash flows that the asset(s) or asset group(s) are expected to generate. if the carrying amount of an asset or an asset group is not recoverable, we recognize an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount of the long-lived asset or asset group over its respective fair value, which is generally determined as either the present value of estimated future cash flows or the appraised value. the impairment analysis is based on significant assumptions of future results made by management, including revenue and cash flow projections. circumstances that may lead to impairment of property, plant and equipment include unforeseen decreases in future performance or industry demand and the restructuring of our operations resulting from a change in our business strategy or adverse economic conditions. for further discussion of our current restructuring program, refer to managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  results of operations  restructuring and related charges.
we have recorded intangible assets, including goodwill, in connection with business acquisitions. estimated useful lives of amortizable intangible assets are determined by management based on an assessment of the period over which the asset is expected to contribute to future cash flows. the fair value of acquired amortizable intangible assets impacts the amounts recorded as goodwill.
we perform a goodwill impairment analysis using the two-step method on an annual basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. the recoverability of goodwill is measured at the reporting unit level by comparing the reporting units carrying amount, including goodwill, to the fair value of the reporting unit. we determine the fair value of our reporting units based on an average weighting of both projected discounted future results and the use of comparative market multiples. if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, goodwill is considered impaired and a second test is performed to measure the amount of loss, if any.
we perform an indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment analysis on an annual basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. the recoverability of indefinite-lived intangible assets is measured by comparing the carrying amount to the fair value. we determine the fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets principally based on a variation of the income approach, known as the relief from royalty method. if the carrying amount of the indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value, the indefinite-lived intangible asset is considered impaired.
we completed our annual impairment test for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017 and determined that the fair values of our reporting units and the indefinite-lived intangible assets are substantially in excess of the carrying values and that no impairment existed as of the date of the impairment test. significant judgments inherent in this analysis included assumptions regarding appropriate revenue growth rates, discount rates and royalty rates.
29
income taxes we estimate our income tax provision in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate, a process that includes estimating exposures related to examinations by taxing authorities. we must also make judgments regarding the ability to realize deferred tax assets. the carrying value of our net deferred tax assets is based on our belief that it is more likely than not that we will generate sufficient future taxable income in certain jurisdictions to realize these deferred tax assets. a valuation allowance has been established for deferred tax assets that we do not believe meet the more likely than not criteria. we assess whether an uncertain tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return meets the threshold for recognition and measurement in the consolidated financial statements. our judgments regarding future taxable income as well as tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return may change due to changes in market conditions, changes in tax laws or other factors. if our assumptions and consequently our estimates change in the future, the valuation allowances and/or tax reserves established may be increased or decreased, resulting in a respective increase or decrease in income tax expense for the fiscal year ended august 31, 2017, the company recorded an income tax benefit of $27.5 million related to the reversal of deferred tax asset valuation allowances in certain non-u.s. jurisdictions. the companys assessment included consideration of all available positive and negative evidence including, among other recent evidence, historical cumulative operating income, projected future taxable income and recent utilization of non-u.s. tax credit carryforwards.
the internal revenue service (irs) completed its field examination of our tax returns for fiscal years 2009 through 2011 and issued a revenue agents report (rar) on may 27, 2015, which was updated on june 22, 2016. the irs completed its field examination of our tax returns for fiscal years 2012 through 2014 and issued an rar on april 19, 2017. the proposed adjustments in the rar from both examination periods relate primarily to u.s. taxation of certain intercompany transactions. if the irs ultimately prevails in its positions, our income tax payments due for the fiscal years 2009 through 2011 and fiscal years 2012 through 2014 would be approximately $28.6 million and $5.3 million, respectively, after utilization of tax loss carry forwards available through fiscal year 2014. also, the irs has proposed interest and penalties with respect to fiscal years 2009 through 2011. the irs may make similar claims in future audits with respect to these types of transactions. at this time, anticipating the amount of any future irs proposed adjustments, interest, and penalties is not practicable.
we disagree with the proposed adjustments and intend to vigorously contest these matters through the applicable irs administrative and judicial procedures, as appropriate. as the final resolution of the proposed adjustments remains uncertain, we continue to provide for the uncertain tax positions based on the more likely than not standard. while the resolution of the issues may result in tax liabilities, interest and penalties that are significantly higher than the amounts accrued for these matters, management currently believes that the resolution will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. however, there can be no assurance that managements beliefs will be realized. for further discussion related to our income taxes, refer to note 5  income taxes to the consolidated financial statements.

the fiscal year ended august 31, 2017 compared to the fiscal year ended august 31, 2016
net revenue. net revenue increased 3.9% to $19.1 billion during the fiscal year ended august 31, 2017, compared to $18.4 billion during the fiscal year ended august 31, 2016. the dms segment revenues increased 9% as a result of a 4% increase in revenues due to new business from existing customers in our consumer lifestyles and wearable technologies business, a 3% increase in revenues due to new business from existing customers in our healthcare business and a 2% increase in revenues from existing customers within our mobility business. ems segment revenues remained relatively consistent due to a mix of increases and decreases spread across various industries within the ems segment, with no one change being significant individually.
generally, we assess revenue on a global customer basis regardless of whether the growth is associated with organic growth or as a result of an acquisition. accordingly, we do not differentiate or separately report revenue increases generated by acquisitions as opposed to existing business. in addition, the added cost structures associated with our acquisitions have historically been relatively insignificant when compared to our overall cost structure.
the distribution of revenue across our segments has fluctuated, and will continue to fluctuate, as a result of numerous factors, including the following: fluctuations in customer demand as a result of recessionary and other conditions, such as the less than anticipated product demand that we have experienced in our mobility business; efforts to diversify certain portions of our business; seasonality in our business; business growth from new and existing customers; specific product performance; and any potential termination, or substantial winding down, of significant customer relationships.

the following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, revenue by segment expressed as a percentage of net revenue:
fiscal year ended august 31,
2017               2016                2015
ems              58   %              60   %              60   %
dms              42   %              40   %              40   %
total           100   %             100   %             100   %
foreign source revenue represented 91.4% and 90.7%, respectively, of our net revenue for the fiscal years ended august 31, 2017 and 2016.
gross profit. gross profit remained relatively consistent on an absolute basis and as a percent of revenue at $1.5 billion (8.1% of net revenue) during the fiscal year ended august 31, 2017, compared to $1.5 billion (8.3% of net revenue) during the fiscal year ended august 31, 2016.
selling, general and administrative. selling, general and administrative expenses decreased to $907.7 million (4.8% of net revenue) during the fiscal year ended august 31, 2017, compared to $924.4 million (5.0% of net revenue) during the fiscal year ended august 31, 2016. the decrease resulted primarily from a $21.0 million reversal of stock-based compensation expense during fiscal year 2017 due to decreased expectations for the vesting of certain performance-based restricted stock awards. the decrease was partially offset by an increase in salary and salary-related expenses and other costs.
research and development. research and development expenses remained relatively consistent at $29.7 million (0.2% of net revenue) during the fiscal year ended august 31, 2017, compared to $32.0 million (0.2% of net revenue) during the fiscal year ended august 31, 2016.
amortization of intangibles. amortization of intangibles decreased to $35.5 million during the fiscal year ended august 31, 2017 compared to $37.1 million during the fiscal year ended august 31, 2016. the decrease is due to certain intangible assets that were fully amortized during fiscal year 2016.
restructuring and related charges.
following is a summary of our restructuring and related charges (in thousands):
fiscal year ended august 31,
2017(2)                      2016(3)
employee severance and benefit costs         $56,834                       $8,845
lease costs                                    3,966                          (43   )
asset write-off costs                         94,346                        1,170
other related costs                            5,249                        1,397
total restructuring and related             $160,395                      $11,369
charges(1)
(1)          includes $51.3 million and $10.7 million recorded in the ems segment, $82.4 million and $0.8 million recorded in the dms segment and $26.7 million and $(0.1) million of non-allocated charges for the fiscal years ended august 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. except for asset write-off costs, all restructuring and related charges are cash costs.

(2)   includes employee severance and benefit costs of $52.2 million and $4.6 million, lease costs of $4.0 million and $0.0 million, asset write-off costs of $94.2 million and $0.1 million and other related costs of $3.8
million and $1.5 million for the 2017 restructuring plan and the 2013 restructuring plan, respectively, which are discussed in greater detail below.

(3)   costs relate to the restructuring plan approved by the board of directors in fiscal year 2013 (the 2013 restructuring plan) which was intended to better align our manufacturing capacity in certain geographies and to reduce our worldwide workforce in order to reduce operating expenses.

32
2017 restructuring plan on september 15, 2016, our board of directors formally approved a restructuring plan to better align our global capacity and administrative support infrastructure to further optimize organizational effectiveness. this action includes headcount reductions across our selling, general and administrative cost base and capacity realignment in higher cost locations (the 2017 restructuring plan).
upon completion of the 2017 restructuring plan, we expect to recognize approximately $195.0 million in restructuring and related charges. we incurred $154.2 million of costs during fiscal year 2017 and anticipate incurring the remaining costs during fiscal year 2018 for employee severance and benefits costs, asset write-off costs and other related costs.
the 2017 restructuring plan, once complete, is expected to yield annualized cost savings beginning in fiscal year 2019 in the range of $70.0 million to $90.0 million. during fiscal year 2017, we realized costs savings of $25.0 million. the annual cost savings is expected to be reflected as a reduction in cost of revenue as well as a reduction of selling, general and administrative expense.   2013 restructuring plan as of august 31, 2017, the 2013 restructuring plan was substantially complete.
see note 15  restructuring and related charges to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of restructuring and related charges for the 2017 and 2013 restructuring plans.
other expense. other expense increased to $28.4 million for the fiscal year ended august 31, 2017 compared to $8.4 million for the fiscal year ended august 31, 2016. the increase is primarily due to an other than temporary impairment on available for sale securities of $11.5 million, an increase in fees associated with the asset-backed securitization programs and a loss associated with a cost method investment.
interest income. interest income increased to $12.5 million during the fiscal year ended august 31, 2017, compared to $9.1 million during the fiscal year ended august 31, 2016 due to increased investments.
interest expense. interest expense remained relatively consistent at $138.1 million during the fiscal year ended august 31, 2017, compared to $136.5 million during the fiscal year ended august 31, 2016.
income tax expense. income tax expense reflects an effective tax rate of 50.4% for the fiscal year ended august 31, 2017, compared to an effective tax rate of 34.1% for the fiscal year ended august 31, 2016. the increase in the effective tax rate was primarily due to decreased income in jurisdictions with low tax rates and increased losses in jurisdictions with existing valuation allowances, which was partially due to an increase in restructuring expense, and increased income in jurisdictions with high tax rates. this effective tax rate increase was partially offset by an income tax benefit of $27.5 million for the reversal of valuation allowances related to non-u.s. jurisdictions.
fiscal year ended august 31, 2016 compared to fiscal year ended august 31, 2015
net revenue. net revenue increased 2.5% to $18.4 billion during the fiscal year ended august 31, 2016, compared to $17.9 billion during the fiscal year ended august 31, 2015. specifically, the dms segment revenues increased 3% due to increased revenues from customers within our mobility business due to strengthened end user product demand during the first half of fiscal year 2016. ems segment revenues increased 2% due to a 3% increase in revenues from new business with existing customers within our telecommunications business, partially offset by a 1% revenue decline spread across the remaining industries within the ems segment.
foreign source revenue represented 90.7% and 88.0%, respectively, of our net revenue for fiscal years 2016 and 2015.
gross profit. gross profit remained relatively consistent at $1.5 billion (8.3% of net revenue) during the fiscal year ended august 31, 2016, compared to $1.5 billion (8.4% of net revenue) during the fiscal year ended august 31, 2015.
selling, general and administrative. selling, general and administrative expenses increased to $924.4 million (5.0% of net revenue) for fiscal year 2016 compared to $862.6 million (4.8% of net revenue) for fiscal year 2015. selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenue remained relatively consistent with the same period of the prior fiscal year. selling, general and administrative expenses on a gross basis increased during the fiscal year ended august 31, 2016 as compared to the fiscal year ended august 31, 2015, primarily due to increases in salary and salary-related expenses and other costs due to increased headcount to support the continued growth of our business.
33
research and development. research and development expenses increased to $32.0 million (0.2% of net revenue) during the fiscal year ended august 31, 2016, compared to $27.6 million (0.2% of net revenue) during the fiscal year ended august 31, 2015, primarily as the result of new projects in targeted growth sectors.
amortization of intangibles. amortization of intangibles increased to $37.1 million during the fiscal year ended august 31, 2016 as compared to $24.4 million during the fiscal year ended august 31, 2015. the increase is due to the definite lived intangible assets acquired in connection with the plasticos acquisition that occurred in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015 and the acquisitions of shemer, inala and hanson that occurred during the first and second quarters of fiscal year 2016, respectively.
restructuring and related charges.
2013 restructuring plan in conjunction with the 2013 restructuring plan, we charged $11.4 million of restructuring and related charges to the consolidated statements of operations during the fiscal year ended august 31, 2016 compared to $34.6 million during the fiscal year ended august 31, 2015. the restructuring and related charges during the fiscal years ended august 31, 2016 and 2015 include cash costs of $8.8 million and $24.3 million related to employee severance and benefit costs, respectively, $0.0 million and $2.8 million related to lease costs, respectively, and $1.4 million and $1.9 million of other related costs, respectively, as well as non-cash costs of $1.2 million and $5.6 million related to asset write-off costs, respectively.
for further discussion of restructuring and related charges related to the 2013 restructuring plan, refer to note 15  restructuring and related charges to the consolidated financial statements.
other expense. other expense increased to $8.4 million for the fiscal year ended august 31, 2016 compared to $5.6 million for the fiscal year ended august 31, 2015. the increase was primarily due to an increase in fees associated with the asset-backed securitization programs as a result of an increase in receivables sold.
interest income. interest income remained relatively consistent at $9.1 million during the fiscal year ended august 31, 2016, compared to $10.0 million during the fiscal year ended august 31, 2015.
interest expense. interest expense increased to $136.5 million during the fiscal year ended august 31, 2016, compared to $128.1 million during the fiscal year ended august 31, 2015. the increase was due to interest expense associated with the term loan facility entered into on july 6, 2015, (see note 9  notes payable, long-term debt and capital lease obligations to the consolidated financial statements).
income tax expense. income tax expense reflects an effective tax rate of 34.1% for the fiscal year ended august 31, 2016, compared to an effective tax rate of 31.8% for the fiscal year ended august 31, 2015. the effective tax rate for the fiscal year ended august 31, 2016 increased from the effective tax rate for the fiscal year ended august 31, 2015 primarily due to the decrease in income from continuing operations in low tax-rate jurisdictions and the increase in losses in tax jurisdictions with existing valuation allowances during fiscal year 2016. this effective tax rate increase was partially offset by tax benefits from favorable tax audit resolutions and statute of limitation expirations in non-u.s. jurisdictions during fiscal year 2016.
non-u.s. gaap (core) financial measures the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations include certain non-u.s. gaap financial measures as identified in the reconciliation below. the non-u.s. gaap financial measures disclosed herein do not have standard meaning and may vary from the non-u.s. gaap financial measures used by other companies or how we may calculate those measures in other instances from time to time. non-u.s. gaap financial measures should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with u.s. gaap. also, our core financial measures should not be construed as an inference by us that our future results will be unaffected by those items that are excluded from our core financial measures.
management believes that the non-u.s. gaap core financial measures set forth below are useful to facilitate evaluating the past and future performance of our ongoing manufacturing operations over multiple periods on a comparable basis by excluding the effects of the amortization of intangibles, stock-based compensation expense and related charges, restructuring and related charges, distressed customer charges, acquisition costs and certain purchase accounting adjustments, loss on disposal of subsidiaries, settlement of receivables and related charges, impairment of notes receivable and related charges, goodwill impairment charges, other than temporary impairment on securities, income (loss) from discontinued operations, gain (loss) on sale of discontinued operations and certain other expenses, net of tax and certain deferred tax valuation allowance charges. among other uses, management uses non-u.s. gaap core financial measures to make operating decisions, assess business performance and as a factor in determining certain employee performance when evaluating incentive compensation.
34
we determine the tax effect of the items excluded from core earnings and core basic and diluted earnings per share based upon evaluation of the statutory tax treatment and the applicable tax rate of the jurisdiction in which the pre-tax items were incurred, and for which realization of the resulting tax benefit, if any, is expected. in certain jurisdictions where we do not expect to realize a tax benefit (due to a history of operating losses or other factors resulting in a valuation allowance related to deferred tax assets), a 0% tax rate is applied.
we are reporting core operating income and core earnings to provide investors with an additional method for assessing operating income and earnings, by presenting what we believe are our core manufacturing operations. a significant portion (based on the respective values) of the items that are excluded for purposes of calculating core operating income and core earnings also impacted certain balance sheet assets, resulting in a portion of an asset being written off without a corresponding recovery of cash we may have previously spent with respect to the asset. in the case of restructuring and related charges, we may make associated cash payments in the future. in addition, although, for purposes of calculating core operating income and core earnings, we exclude stock-based compensation expense (which we anticipate continuing to incur in the future) because it is a non-cash expense, the associated stock issued may result in an increase in our outstanding shares of stock, which may result in the dilution of our stockholders ownership interest. we encourage you to consider these matters when evaluating the utility of these non-u.s. gaap financial measures.

acquisitions and expansion as discussed in note 16  business acquisitions to the consolidated financial statements, we completed one acquisition during the fiscal year ended august 31, 2017 and three acquisitions during the fiscal year ended august 31, 2016. acquisitions are accounted for as business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting. our consolidated financial statements include the operating results of each business from the date of acquisition.
seasonality production levels for a portion of the dms segment are subject to seasonal influences. we may realize greater net revenue during our first fiscal quarter which ends on november 30, due to higher demand for consumer-related products during the holiday selling season.
liquidity and capital resources we believe that our level of liquidity sources, which includes available borrowings under our revolving credit facilities, additional proceeds available under our asset-backed securitization programs and under our uncommitted trade accounts receivable sale programs, cash on hand, funds provided by operations and the access to the capital markets, will be adequate to fund our capital expenditures, the payment of any declared quarterly dividends, share repurchases, any potential acquisitions and our working capital requirements for the next 12 months.
cash and cash equivalents as of august 31, 2017, we had approximately $1.2 billion in cash and cash equivalents. as our growth remains predominantly outside of the united states, a significant portion of such cash and cash equivalents are held by our foreign subsidiaries. we estimate that approximately $841.1 million of the cash and cash equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries could not be repatriated to the united states without potential income tax consequences.
during fiscal year 2017, we repatriated $225.9 million of current year foreign earnings to our u.s. operations, which did not result in tax expense due to a current year operating loss and valuation allowance in the u.s. as of august 31, 2017, we intend to repatriate pre-acquisition undistributed earnings of $188.5 million related to nypro and a portion of our remaining current year foreign earnings to our u.s. operations from cash and cash equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries. in connection with this future repatriation of earnings, we have a deferred tax liability of approximately $86.2 million at august 31, 2017. we intend to indefinitely reinvest the remaining earnings from our foreign subsidiaries outside the u.s.

(1)   we believe that our cash on hand and available borrowing under our credit facilities will be adequate to fund the payment of the 8.250% senior notes. however, we anticipate that we will enter into a new borrowing agreement to repay our 8.250% senior notes prior to maturity.

(2)           on july 6, 2015, we entered into an amended and restated senior unsecured five-year credit agreement. the credit agreement provides for: (i) the revolving credit facility in the initial amount of $1.5 billion, which may, subject to the lenders discretion, be increased to $2.0 billion and (ii) a $500.0 million five-year delayed draw term loan facility, (collectively the credit facility). both the revolving credit facility and the term loan facility expire on july 6, 2020. the revolving credit facility is subject to two whole or partial one-year extensions, at the lenders discretion.

as of august 31, 2017, the interest rate on the revolving credit facility borrowings ranged from 2.4% to 4.4% and the interest rate on the term loan facility was 2.6%. interest is charged at a rate equal to (a) for the revolving credit facility, either 0.000% to 0.650% above the base rate or 1.000% to 1.650% above the eurocurrency rate and (b) for the term loan facility, either 0.125% to 1.000% above the base rate or 1.125% to 2.000% above the eurocurrency rate. the base rate represents the greatest of: (i) citibank, n.a.s base rate, (ii) 0.50% above the federal funds rate, and (iii) 1.0% above one-month libor, but not less than zero. the eurocurrency rate represents adjusted libor or adjusted cdor, as applicable, for the applicable interest period, but not less than zero.
as of august 31, 2017, our foreign subsidiaries have various additional credit facilities that finance their future growth and any corresponding working capital needs. the foreign subsidiary credit facilities incur interest at fixed and variable rates ranging from 1.2% to 3.5%.
as of august 31, 2017, we had $1.9 billion in available unused borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facilities. we may need to finance day-to-day working capital needs, as well as future growth and any corresponding working capital needs, with additional borrowings under our revolving credit facility and our other credit facilities as well as additional public and private offerings of our debt and equity. we continue to assess our capital structure and evaluate the merits of redeploying available cash to reduce existing debt or repurchase common stock.
(3)   in addition to the term loan facility described above, as of august 31, 2017, we have borrowings outstanding to fund working capital needs. these additional loans are approximately $2.1 million and have interest rates ranging from 0.0% to 10.0%.

39
currently, we have a shelf registration statement with the sec registering the potential sale of an indeterminate amount of debt and equity securities in the future to augment our liquidity and capital resources. the current shelf registration statement expires in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 and we expect to file a new registration statement prior to its expiration.
our senior notes and our credit facility contain various financial and nonfinancial covenants. a violation of these covenants could negatively impact our liquidity by restricting our ability to borrow under the notes payable and credit facilities and potentially causing acceleration of amounts due under these notes payable and credit facilities. as of august 31, 2017 and 2016, we were in compliance with all covenants under our senior notes and credit facility. refer to note 9  notes payable, long-term debt and capital lease obligations to the consolidated financial statements for further details.
asset-backed securitization and trade accounts receivable sale programs asset-backed securitization programs we continuously sell designated pools of trade accounts receivable, at a discount, under our asset-backed securitization programs to special purpose entities, which in turn sell 100% of the receivables to: (i) conduits administered by unaffiliated financial institutions and (ii) an unaffiliated financial institution. any portion of the purchase price for the receivables not paid in cash upon the sale occurring is recorded as a deferred purchase price receivable, which is paid from available cash as payments on the receivables are collected.
following is a summary of our asset-backed securitization programs and key terms:
maximum amount of   expiration net cash proceeds(1)   date north american(2)            $200.0 million   october 20, 2017

(1)   maximum amount available at any one time.

(2)   on october 18, 2017, the program was extended to november 17, 2017.

in connection with our asset-backed securitization programs, as of august 31, 2017, we sold $1.2 billion of eligible trade accounts receivable, which represents the face amount of total sold outstanding receivables at that date. in exchange, we received cash proceeds of $590.9 million and recorded a deferred purchase price receivable of $568.7 million. as of august 31, 2017, we had up to $11.1 million in available liquidity under our asset-backed securitization programs.
our asset-backed securitization programs contain various financial and nonfinancial covenants. as of august 31, 2017 and 2016, we were in compliance with all covenants under our asset-backed securitization programs. refer to note 3  trade accounts receivable securitization and sale programs to the consolidated financial statements for further details on the programs.

(3)   any party may elect to terminate the agreement upon 15 days prior notice.

during the fiscal year ended august 31, 2017, we sold $3.0 billion of trade accounts receivable under these programs and we received cash proceeds of $3.0 billion. as of august 31, 2017, we had up to $613.7 million in available liquidity under our trade accounts receivable sale programs.
capital expenditures we currently anticipate that during the next 12 months, our net capital expenditures, which do not include any amounts spent on acquisitions, will be approximately $700.0 million, principally to support ongoing business in the dms and ems segments.
cash flows the following table sets forth, for the fiscal years ended august 31, selected consolidated cash flow information (in thousands):

net cash provided by operating activities during the fiscal year ended august 31, 2017 resulted primarily from net income, an increase in non-cash expenses, accounts payable and accrued expenses and other liabilities, partially offset by an increase in inventories and accounts receivable. the increase in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities was primarily due to an increase in materials purchases due to increased demand in the mobility business, advance deposits from customers and the timing of purchases and cash payments. the increase in inventories supports expected sales levels in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 and also is due to increased demand. the increase in accounts receivable is primarily driven by the timing of sales and cash collections activity as well as higher sales levels.
net cash used in investing activities during the fiscal year ended august 31, 2017 consisted primarily of: (i) capital expenditures principally to support ongoing business in the dms and ems segments and (ii) cash paid for the acquisition of lewis engineering, including certain intangible assets, net of cash received, which were partially offset by proceeds from the sale of property, plant and equipment.
net cash used in financing activities during the fiscal year ended august 31, 2017, was primarily due to: (i) payments for debt agreements, (ii) the repurchase of our common stock and (iii) dividend payments. net cash used in financing activities was partially offset by: (i) borrowings under debt agreements and (ii) net proceeds from the exercise of stock options and issuance of common stock under the employee stock purchase plan.

(2)   excludes commissions.

we currently expect to continue to declare and pay regular quarterly dividends of an amount similar to our past declarations. however, the declaration and payment of future dividends are discretionary and will be subject to determination by our board of directors (the board) each quarter following its review of our financial performance.
in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015, our board authorized the repurchase of $100.0 million of our common stock during the twelve-month period following the authorization (the 2015 share repurchase program). during the first quarter of fiscal year 2016, we repurchased 2.8 million shares for approximately $54.5 million, which utilized the remaining amount outstanding under the 2015 share repurchase program.
in june 2016, the board authorized the repurchase of up to $400.0 million of our common stock (the 2016 share repurchase program). as of august 31, 2017, $400.0 million of shares had been repurchased under the 2016 share repurchase program, which utilized the total amount authorized by the board.
in july 2017, the board authorized the repurchase of up to $450.0 million of our common stock (the 2017 share repurchase program). the 2017 share repurchase program expires on august 31, 2018. as of october 10, 2017, $32.9 million of shares had been repurchased under the 2017 share repurchase program.
contractual obligations our contractual obligations as of august 31, 2017 are summarized below. as disclosed below, while we have certain non-cancelable purchase order obligations for property, plant and equipment, we generally do not enter into non-cancelable purchase orders for materials until we receive a corresponding purchase commitment from our customer. non-cancelable purchase orders do not typically extend beyond the normal lead time of several weeks, at most. purchase orders beyond this time frame are typically cancelable.

(3)   includes the estimated company contributions to funded pension plans during fiscal year 2018 and the expected benefit payments for unfunded pension and postretirement plans from fiscal years 2018 through 2027. these future payments are not recorded on the consolidated balance sheets but will be recorded as incurred.

(4)   as of august 31, 2017, we have $100.9 million recorded as a long-term liability for uncertain tax positions. we are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of payments, or the amount by which our liability for these uncertain tax positions will increase or decrease over time, and accordingly, this liability has been excluded from the above table.

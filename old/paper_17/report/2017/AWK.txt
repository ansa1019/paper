item 1a.   risk factors we operate in a market and regulatory environment that involves significant risks, many of which are beyond our control. in addition to the other information included or incorporated by reference in this form 10-k, the following factors should be considered in evaluating our business and future prospects. any of the following risks, either alone or taken together, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial position, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.
risks related to our industry and business operations our utility operations are subject to extensive economic regulation by state pucs and other regulatory agencies, which significantly affects our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. our utility operations also may be subject to fines, penalties and other sanctions for the inability to meet these regulatory requirements.
our regulated businesses provide water and wastewater services to our customers through subsidiaries that are subject to economic regulation by state pucs. economic regulation affects the rates we charge our customers and has a significant impact on our business and results of operations. generally, the state pucs authorize us to charge rates that they determine are sufficient to recover our prudently incurred operating expenses, including, but not limited to, operating and maintenance costs, depreciation, financing costs and taxes, and provide us the opportunity to earn an appropriate rate of return on invested capital.
our ability to successfully implement our business plan and strategy depends on the rates authorized by the various state pucs. we periodically file rate increase applications with state pucs. the ensuing administrative process may be lengthy and costly. our rate increase requests may or may not be approved, or may be partially approved, and any approval may not occur in a timely manner. moreover, a puc may not approve a rate request to an extent that is sufficient to:
•   cover our expenses, including purchased water and costs of chemicals, fuel and other commodities used in our operations;
•   enable us to recover our investment; and
•   provide us with an opportunity to earn an appropriate rate of return on our investment.
approval of the pucs is also required in connection with other aspects of our utilities' operations. some state pucs are empowered to impose financial penalties, fines and other sanctions for non-compliance with applicable rules and regulations. our utilities are also required to have numerous permits, approvals and certificates from the pucs that regulate their businesses and authorize acquisitions. although we believe that each utility subsidiary has obtained or sought renewal of the material permits, approvals and certificates necessary for its existing operations, we are unable to predict the impact that future regulatory activities may have on our business.
in any of these cases, our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity may be adversely affected. even if rates are sufficient, we face the risk that we will not achieve the rates of return on our invested capital to the extent permitted by state pucs. this could occur if certain conditions exist, including but not limited to, if water usage is less than the level anticipated in establishing rates, or if our investments or expenses prove to be higher than the level estimated in establishing rates.
18
our operations and the quality of water we supply are subject to extensive and increasingly stringent environmental, water quality and health and safety laws and regulations, including with respect to emerging contaminants, compliance with which could impact our operating costs, and violations of which could subject us to substantial liabilities and costs, as well as damage to our reputation.
our water and wastewater operations and the operations of our market-based businesses are subject to extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations and, in the case of our canadian operations, canadian laws and regulations that govern the protection of the environment, health and safety, the quality of the water we deliver to our customers, water allocation rights, and the manner in which we collect, treat, discharge and dispose of wastewater. these requirements include cercla, the clean water act and the safe drinking water act, and similar state and canadian laws and regulations. for example, cercla authorizes the epa to issue orders and bring enforcement actions to compel responsible parties to investigate and take remedial actions with respect to actual or threatened releases of hazardous substances, and can impose joint and several liability, without regard to fault, on responsible parties for the costs thereof. we are also required to obtain various environmental permits from regulatory agencies for our operations.
in addition, state pucs also set conditions and standards for the water and wastewater services we deliver. if we deliver water or wastewater services to our customers that do not comply with regulatory standards, or otherwise violate environmental laws, regulations or permits, or other health and safety and water quality regulations, we could incur substantial fines, penalties or other sanctions or costs, as well as damage to our reputation. in the most serious cases, regulators could reduce requested rate increases or force us to discontinue operations and sell our operating assets to another utility or to a municipality. given the nature of our business which, in part, involves supplying water for human consumption, any potential non-compliance with, or violation of, environmental, water quality and health and safety laws or regulations would likely pose a more significant risk to us than to a company not similarly involved in the water and wastewater industry.
we incur substantial operating and capital costs on an ongoing basis to comply with environmental, water quality and health and safety laws and regulations. these laws and regulations, and their enforcement, generally have become more stringent over time, and new or stricter requirements could increase our costs. although we may seek to recover ongoing compliance costs in our regulated businesses through customer rates, there can be no guarantee that the various state pucs or similar regulatory bodies that govern our regulated businesses would approve rate increases that would enable us to recover such costs or that such costs will not materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.
we may also incur liabilities if, under environmental laws and regulations, we are required to investigate and clean up environmental contamination at our properties, including potential spills of hazardous chemicals, such as chlorine, which we use to treat water, or at off-site locations where we have disposed of waste or caused an adverse environmental impact. the discovery of previously unknown conditions, or the imposition of cleanup obligations in the future, could result in significant costs and could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity. such remediation costs may not be covered by insurance and may make it difficult for us to secure insurance at acceptable rates in the future.
attention is being given to emerging contaminants, including, without limitation, chemicals and other substances that currently do not have any regulatory standard in drinking water or have been recently created or discovered (including by means of scientific achievements in the analysis and detection of trace amounts of substances). examples of sources of emerging contaminants include, but are not limited to, newly created chemical compounds (including, for example, perfluorinated compounds and manufactured nanomaterials); human and veterinary products; microbes, viruses, amoebae and other pathogens; and residual by-products of disinfection. we rely upon governmental agencies to set appropriate regulatory standards to protect the public from these and other contaminants. our role is to meet or surpass those standards, when established. in some of our states, pucs may disapprove of cost recovery, in whole or in part, for implementation of treatment infrastructure for an emerging contaminant in the absence of a regulatory standard. furthermore, given the rapid pace at which emerging contaminants are being created and/or discovered, we may not be able to detect and/or mitigate all such substances in our drinking water system or supplies, which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and reputation. in addition, we believe emerging contaminants may form the basis for additional or increased federal or state regulatory initiatives and requirements in the future, which could significantly increase the cost of our operations.
19
limitations on availability of water supplies or restrictions on our use of water supplies as a result of government regulation or action may adversely affect our access to sources of water, our ability to supply water to customers or the demand for our water services.
our ability to meet the existing and future demand of our customers depends on the availability of an adequate supply of water. as a general rule, sources of public water supply, including rivers, lakes, streams and groundwater aquifers, are held in the public trust and are not owned by private interests. as a result, we typically do not own the water that we use in our operations, and the availability of our water supply is established through allocation rights (determined by legislation or court decisions) and passing-flow requirements set by governmental entities. passing-flow requirements set minimum volumes of water that must pass through specified water sources, such as rivers and streams, in order to maintain environmental habitats and meet water allocation rights of downstream users. allocation rights are imposed to ensure sustainability of major water sources and passing-flow requirements are most often imposed on source waters from smaller rivers, lakes and streams. these requirements, which can change from time to time, may adversely impact our water supply. supply issues, such as drought, overuse of sources of water, the protection of threatened species or habitats, contamination or other factors may limit the availability of ground and surface water.
for example, in our monterey county, california operations, we are seeking to augment our sources of water supply, principally to comply with an october 20, 2009 cease and desist order (the "2009 order"), as amended by an order in july 2016 (the "2016 order"), of the swrcb that requires cal am to significantly decrease its diversions from the carmel river in accordance with a reduction schedule that terminates on december 31, 2021 (the "2021 deadline"). we are also required to augment our monterey county sources of water supply to comply with the requirements of the endangered species act. we cannot predict whether cal am will be able to secure alternative sources of water, or if cal am will be exposed to liabilities if it is unable to meet the 2021 deadline under the 2009 order and the 2016 order. if cal am or any of our other subsidiaries are unable to secure an alternative source of water, or if other adverse consequences result from the events described above, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected. see item 3-legal proceedings-alternative water supply in lieu of carmel river diversions, which includes additional information regarding this matter.
the current regulatory rate setting process may result in a significant delay, also known as "regulatory lag," from the time that we invest in infrastructure improvements, incur increased operating expenses or experience declining water usage, to the time at which we can seek to address these events in rate case applications; our inability to minimize regulatory lag could adversely affect our business.
there is typically a delay, known as "regulatory lag," between the time one of our regulated subsidiaries makes a capital investment or incurs an operating expense increase and the time when those costs are reflected in rates. in addition, billings permitted by state pucs typically are, to a considerable extent, based on the volume of water usage in addition to a minimum base rate. thus, we may experience regulatory lag between the time our revenues are affected by declining usage and the time we are able to adjust the rate per gallon of usage to address declining usage. our inability to reduce this regulatory lag could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.
we endeavor to reduce regulatory lag by pursuing constructive regulatory policies. for example, ten of our state pucs permit rates to be adjusted outside of the rate case application process through surcharges that address certain capital investments, such as replacement of aging infrastructure. these surcharges are adjusted periodically based on factors such as project completion or future budgeted expenditures, and specific surcharges are eliminated once the related capital investment is incorporated in new puc approved rates. furthermore, in setting rates, nine of our state pucs allow us to use future test years, which extend beyond the date a rate request is filed to allow for current or projected revenues, expenses and investments to be reflected in rates on a more timely basis. other examples of such programs include states that allow us to increase rates for certain cost increases that are beyond our control, such as purchased water costs, property or other taxes, or power, conservation, chemical or other expenditures. these surcharge mechanisms enable us to adjust rates in less time after costs have been incurred than would be the case under the rate case application process.
while these programs have reduced regulatory lag in several of our regulated states, we continue to seek expansion of programs to reduce regulatory lag in those jurisdictions that have not approved such programs. furthermore, pucs may fail to adopt new surcharge programs and existing programs may not continue in their current form, or at all. although we intend to continue our efforts to expand state puc approval of surcharges to address issues of regulatory lag, our efforts may not be successful, or even if successful they may not completely address our regulatory lag, in which case our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity may be materially and adversely affected.
20
changes in laws and regulations and changes in certain agreements can significantly affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.
new legislation, regulations, government policies or court decisions, including without limitation with respect to federal and state income and other tax laws, can materially affect our operations, results of operations and cash flows. the individuals who serve as regulators are elected or political appointees. therefore, elections which result in a change of political administration or new appointments may also result in changes in the individuals who serve as regulators and the policies of the regulatory agencies that they serve. new laws or regulations, new interpretations of existing laws or regulations, changes in agency policy, including those made in response to shifts in public opinion, or conditions imposed during the regulatory hearing process could have the following consequences, among others:
•   making it more difficult for us to raise our rates and, as a consequence, to recover our costs or earn our expected rates of return;
•   changing the determination of the costs, or the amount of costs, that would be considered recoverable in rate cases;
•   restricting our ability to terminate our services to customers who owe us money for services previously provided or limiting our bill collection efforts;
•   requiring us to provide water or wastewater services at reduced rates to certain customers;
•   limiting or restricting our ability to acquire water or wastewater systems, purchase or dispose of assets or issue securities, or making it less cost-effective for us to do so;
•   negatively impacting the deductibility of expenses under federal or state tax laws, the amount of tax credits or tax abatement benefits that may be available, the amount of taxes owed, or the ability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards;
•   changing regulations that affect the benefits we expected to receive when we began offering services in a particular area;
•   increasing the costs associated with complying with environmental, health, safety and water quality regulations to which our operations are subject;
•   changing or placing additional limitations on change in control requirements relating to any concentration of ownership of our common stock;
•   making it easier for governmental entities to convert our assets to public ownership via condemnation, eminent domain or other similar process, or for governmental agencies or private plaintiffs to assess liability against us for damages under these or similar processes;
•   placing limitations, prohibitions or other requirements with respect to the sharing of information and participation in transactions by or between a regulated subsidiary and us or our other affiliates, including service company and any of our other subsidiaries;
•   restricting or prohibiting our extraction of water from rivers, streams, reservoirs or aquifers; and
•   revoking or altering the terms of the certificates of public convenience and necessity (or similar authorizations) issued to us by state pucs.
any of the foregoing consequences could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.
21
in addition, new federal, state and local laws, changes in existing laws, rules or regulations, or administrative interpretations thereof, could impact us. on december 22, 2017, the tcja was signed into law, which, among other things, enacted significant and complex changes to the internal revenue code of 1986, including a reduction in the maximum u.s. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% as of january 1, 2018, and certain other provisions related specifically to the public utility industry, including continuation of interest expense deductibility, the exclusion from utilizing bonus depreciation and the normalization of deferred income taxes. the enactment of the tcja required a re-measurement of our deferred income taxes that materially impacted our 2017 results of operations and financial position. we have assumed that the predominant majority of our deferred tax assets and liabilities at our utility subsidiaries will remain subject to a normalization method of accounting pursuant to the u.s. tax code or applicable puc regulations and that we will be able to deduct for u.s. federal corporate income tax purposes substantially all of our interest expense, based upon our interpretation of u.s. tax law debt allocation methodologies , at the tcja's 21% corporate tax rate. the adoption or issuance of any related interpretations that impact these assumptions or with respect to provisions related specifically to the public utility industry or to corporate taxpayers in general may also impact our future financial performance, including our results of operations, cash flows and liquidity, which impacts will largely be determined through future regulatory proceedings. all of our 14 jurisdictions subject to economic regulation have opened formal proceedings related to the tcja, and we have open rate cases in three of them. at this time, we cannot predict the impacts of any related interpretations, if and when issued, on us, or the regulatory treatment of the tcja in each of our regulatory jurisdictions. moreover, we are unable to determine or predict the potential impacts, if any, of any other new or amended laws, rules or regulations, or interpretations thereof, to the extent they may be ultimately enacted, adopted or issued, on us or our businesses, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.
service disruptions caused by severe weather conditions, climate variability patterns or natural disasters may disrupt our operations or reduce the demand for our water services, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.
service interruptions due to severe weather, climate variability patterns and other natural events are possible across all our businesses. these include, among other things, storms, freezing conditions, high wind conditions, hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes, landslides, wildfires, coastal and intercoastal floods or high water conditions, including those in or near designated flood plains, severe electrical storms and solar flares. weather and other natural events such as these may affect the condition or operability of our facilities, limiting or preventing us from delivering water or wastewater services to our customers, or requiring us to make substantial capital expenditures to repair any damage. tariffs in place or cost recovery proceedings with respect to our regulated businesses may not provide reimbursement to us, in whole or in part, for any of these impacts.
government restrictions on water use may also result in decreased use of water services, even if our water supplies are sufficient to serve our customers, which may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. seasonal drought conditions that may impact our water services are possible across all of our service areas. governmental restrictions imposed in response to a drought may apply to all systems within a region independent of the supply adequacy of any individual system. as examples, drought conditions had persisted in california over a five-year period, and had been declared in new jersey in 2016. in 2017, these droughts were declared concluded, but other droughts that may occur from time to time may result in the imposition of voluntary or mandatory water use targets, rationing restrictions, water conservation regulations, and requirements to minimize water system leaks. while expenses incurred in implementing water conservation and rationing plans may generally be recoverable provided the relevant puc determines they were reasonable and prudent, we cannot assure that any such expenses incurred will, in fact, be fully recovered. moreover, reductions in water consumption, including those resulting from installation of equipment or changed consumer behavior, may persist even after drought restrictions are repealed and the drought has ended, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
climate variability may cause increased volatility in weather and may impact water usage and related revenue or require additional expenditures, all of which may not be fully recoverable in rates or otherwise.
the issue of climate variability is receiving increasing attention worldwide. some scientific experts are predicting a worsening of weather volatility in the future associated with climate variability. many climate variability predictions, if true, present several potential challenges to water and wastewater utilities, such as:
•   increased frequency and duration of droughts;
•   increased precipitation and flooding;
•   challenges associated with changes in temperature or increases in ocean levels;
•   potential degradation of water quality;
•   decreases in available water supply and changes in water usage patterns;
•   increases in disruptions in service;
•   increased costs to repair damaged facilities; or
22
•   increased costs to reduce risks associated with the increasing frequency of natural events, including to improve the resiliency and reliability of our water production and delivery facilities and systems.
because of the uncertainty of weather volatility related to climate variability, we cannot predict its potential impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity. although some or all potential expenditures and costs with respect to our regulated businesses could be recovered through rates, infrastructure replacement surcharges or other regulatory mechanisms, there can be no assurance that state pucs would authorize rate increases to enable us to recover such expenditures and costs, in whole or in part.
a loss of one or more large industrial customers could have a material adverse impact upon the results of operations of one or more of our regulated businesses.
adverse economic conditions or other factors can cause our customers, particularly industrial customers, to curtail operations. a curtailment of operations by an industrial customer would typically result in reduced water usage by that customer. in more severe circumstances, the decline in usage could be permanent. any decrease in demand resulting from difficult economic conditions affecting these industrial customers could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. tariffs in place with respect to our regulated businesses may not reimburse us, in whole or in part, for any of these impacts.
our regulated businesses require significant capital expenditures and may suffer if we fail to secure appropriate funding to make investments, or if we experience delays in completing major capital expenditure projects.
the water and wastewater utility business is capital intensive. we invest significant amounts of capital to add, replace and maintain property, plant and equipment, and to improve aging infrastructure. in 2017, we invested $1.4 billion in net company-funded capital improvements. the level of capital expenditures necessary to maintain the integrity of our systems will likely increase in the future. we expect to fund capital improvement projects using cash generated from operations, borrowings under our revolving credit facility and commercial paper programs and issuances of long-term debt. we may not be able to access our revolving credit facility or the commercial paper, long-term debt and equity capital markets, when necessary or desirable to fund capital improvements on favorable terms or at all. if we are not able to obtain sufficient financing, we could be unable to maintain our existing property, plant and equipment, fund our capital investment strategies, meet our growth targets and expand our rate base to enable us to earn satisfactory future returns on our investments. even with adequate financial resources to make required capital expenditures, we face the additional risk that we will not complete our major capital projects on time, as a result of construction delays, permitting delays, labor shortages or other disruptions, environmental restrictions, or other obstacles. each of these outcomes could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
seasonality could adversely affect the volume of water sold and our revenues.
the volume of water we sell during the warmer months, typically in the summer, is generally greater than during other months, due primarily to increased water usage for irrigation systems, swimming pools, cooling systems and other applications. throughout the year, and particularly during typically warmer months, the volume of water sold tends to vary with temperature, rainfall levels and rainfall frequency. in the event that temperatures during the typically warmer months are cooler than normal, or if there is more rainfall than normal, the amount of water we sell may decrease and adversely affect our revenues.
three of our jurisdictions, california, illinois and new york, have adopted revenue stability mechanisms, which permit us to collect state puc-authorized revenue for a given period which is not tied to the volume of water sold during that period. revenue stability mechanisms are designed to allow utilities to recover the fixed cost of operations while supporting water conservation goals. in those jurisdictions that have not adopted a revenue stability mechanism, operating results could continue to be affected by seasonality.
regulatory and environmental risks associated with the collection, treatment and disposal of wastewater may impose significant costs.
the wastewater collection, treatment and disposal operations of our subsidiaries are subject to substantial regulation and involve environmental risks. if collection, treatment or disposal systems fail, overflow, or do not operate properly, untreated wastewater or other contaminants could spill onto nearby properties or into nearby streams and rivers, causing damage to persons or property, injury to aquatic life and economic damages. this risk is most acute during periods of substantial rainfall or flooding, which are the main causes of sewer overflow and system failure. liabilities resulting from such damage could adversely and materially affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
23
contamination of water supplies or our water service provided to our customers could result in service limitations and interruptions and exposure to substances not typically found in potable water supplies, and could subject us and our subsidiaries to reductions in usage and other responsive obligations, government enforcement actions, damage to our reputation and private litigation.
the water supplies that flow into our treatment plants or are delivered through our distribution system, or the water service that is provided to our customers, may be subject to contamination, including, among other items, contamination from naturally-occurring compounds, chemicals in groundwater systems, pollution resulting from man-made sources (such as perchlorate, methyl tertiary butyl ether, lead and other materials, chemical spills or other accidents that result in contaminants entering the water source), and possible terrorist attacks. in addition, new categories of these substances continue to emerge in the water treatment industry. if one of our water supplies or the water service provided to our customers is contaminated, depending on the nature of the contamination, we may have to take responsive actions that could include, among other things (1) continuing limited use of the water supply under a "do not use" protective order that enables continuation of basic sanitation and essential fire protection, or (2) interrupting the use of that water supply. if service is disrupted, our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, liquidity and reputation may be adversely affected. in addition, we may incur significant costs in order to treat the contaminated source through the expansion of our current treatment facilities or the development of new treatment methods. we may be unable to recover costs associated with treating or decontaminating water supplies through insurance, customer rates, tariffs or contract terms. any recovery of these costs that we are able to obtain through regulatory proceedings or otherwise may not occur in a timely manner. moreover, we could be subject to claims for damages arising from government enforcement actions or toxic tort or other lawsuits arising out of an interruption of service or human exposure to hazardous substances in our drinking water and water supplies.
in this regard, on january 9, 2014, a chemical storage tank owned by freedom industries, inc. leaked two substances into the elk river near the west virginia-american water company ("wvawc") treatment plant intake in charleston, west virginia. on september 21, 2017, the u.s. district court for the southern district of west virginia granted preliminary approval of a settlement class and proposed global class action settlement (the "settlement") of claims involving wvawc and its affiliates arising out of the freedom industries chemical spill. under the terms of the settlement, wvawc has agreed that it will not seek rate recovery from the public service commission of west virginia (the "psc") for the amounts paid by wvawc, net of insurance recoveries, under the settlement. see item 3-legal proceedings-west virginia elk river freedom industries chemical spill, which includes additional information regarding this matter.
since we engage in the business of providing water service to our customers, contamination of the water supply, or the water service provided to our customers, could result in substantial injury or damage to our customers, employees or others and we could be exposed to substantial claims and litigation. such claims could relate to, among other things, personal injury, loss of life, business interruption, property damage, pollution, and environmental damage and may be brought by our customers or third parties. litigation and regulatory proceedings are subject to inherent uncertainties and unfavorable rulings can and do occur, and we may not be protected from these claims or negative impacts therefrom in whole or in part by tariffs or other contract terms. negative impacts to our reputation may occur even if we are not liable for any contamination or other environmental damage or the consequences arising out of human exposure to contamination or hazardous substances in the water or water supplies. in addition, insurance coverage may not cover all or a portion of these losses, and are subject to deductibles and other limitations. pending or future claims against us could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
we may sustain losses that exceed or are excluded from our insurance coverage or for which we are self-insured.
we maintain insurance coverage as part of our overall legal and risk management strategy to minimize potential liabilities arising from our utility operations, as well as the operations of our market-based businesses. our insurance programs have varying coverage limits, exclusions and maximums, and insurance companies may seek to deny claims we might make. generally, our insurance policies cover property damage, worker's compensation, employer's liability, general liability, terrorism risks and automobile liability. each policy includes deductibles or self-insured retentions and policy limits for covered claims. as a result, we may sustain losses that exceed or that are excluded from our insurance coverage or for which we are self-insured.
although in the past we have been generally able to cover our insurance needs, there can be no assurance that we can secure all necessary or appropriate insurance in the future, or that such insurance can be economically secured. for example, catastrophic events can result in decreased coverage limits, more limited coverage, increased premium costs or deductibles.
24
we are subject to adverse publicity and reputational risks, which make us vulnerable to negative customer perception and could lead to increased regulatory oversight or other sanctions.
water and wastewater utilities, including our regulated subsidiaries and our market-based businesses, have a large direct and indirect customer base and as a result are exposed to public criticism regarding, among other things, the reliability of their water, wastewater and related or ancillary services, the quality of water provided, and the amount, timeliness, accuracy and format of bills that are provided for such services. adverse publicity and negative consumer sentiment may render legislatures and other governing bodies, state pucs and other regulatory authorities, and government officials less likely to view us in a favorable light, and may cause us to be susceptible to less favorable legislative, regulatory and economic outcomes, as well as increased regulatory or other oversight and more stringent regulatory or economic requirements. unfavorable regulatory and economic outcomes may include the enactment of more stringent laws and regulations governing our operations and less favorable economic terms in our agreements related to our market-based businesses, as well as fines, penalties or other sanctions or requirements. the imposition of any of the foregoing could have a material negative impact on us and our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
the failure of, or the requirement to repair, upgrade or dismantle, any of our dams may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.
the properties of our regulated businesses segment include 80 dams, a failure of any of which could result in personal injury and downstream property damage for which we may be liable. the failure of a dam would also adversely affect our ability to supply water in sufficient quantities to our customers and could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. any losses or liabilities incurred due to a failure of one of our dams might not be covered by insurance policies or be recoverable in rates, and such losses may make it difficult for us to secure insurance at acceptable rates in the future.
we also are required from time to time to decommission, repair or upgrade the dams that we own. the cost of such repairs or upgrades can be and has been material. the federal and state agencies that regulate our operations may adopt rules and regulations requiring us to dismantle our dams, which also could entail material costs. although in most cases, the puc has permitted recovery of expenses and capital investment related to dam rehabilitation, we might not be able to recover costs of repairs, upgrades or dismantling through rates in the future. the inability to recover these costs or delayed recovery of the costs as a result of regulatory lag can affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.
any failure of our network of water and wastewater pipes and water reservoirs could result in losses and damages that may affect our financial condition and reputation.
our operating subsidiaries distribute water and collect wastewater through an extensive network of pipes and storage systems located across the united states. a failure of major pipes or reservoirs could result in injuries and property damage for which we may be liable. the failure of major pipes and reservoirs may also result in the need to shut down some facilities or parts of our network in order to conduct repairs. such failures and shutdowns may limit our ability to supply water in sufficient quantities to our customers and to meet the water and wastewater delivery requirements prescribed by government regulators, including state pucs with jurisdiction over our operations, and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, liquidity and reputation. any business interruption or other losses might not be covered by insurance policies or be recoverable in rates, and such losses may make it difficult for us to secure insurance at acceptable rates in the future. moreover, to the extent such business interruptions or other losses are not covered by insurance, they may not be recovered through rate adjustments.
an important part of our growth strategy is the acquisition of water and wastewater systems, which involves risks, including competition for acquisition opportunities from other regulated utilities, governmental entities and other buyers, that may hinder or limit our ability to grow our business.
an important element of our growth strategy is the acquisition of water and wastewater systems in order to broaden our current, and move into new, service areas. we may not be able to acquire other businesses if we cannot identify suitable acquisition opportunities or reach mutually agreeable terms with acquisition candidates. further, competition for acquisition opportunities from other regulated utilities, governmental entities, and other buyers may hinder our ability to expand our business.
the negotiation of potential acquisitions as well as the integration of acquired businesses with our existing operations could require us to incur significant costs and cause diversion of our management's time and resources. future acquisitions by us could result in, among other things:
•   incurrence or assumption of debt, contingent liabilities and environmental liabilities of or with respect to an acquired business, including liabilities that were unknown at the time of acquisition;
•   failure to recover acquisition premiums;
•   unanticipated capital expenditures;
25
•   failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting;
•   recording goodwill and other intangible assets at values that ultimately may be subject to impairment charges;
•   fluctuations in quarterly results;
•   unanticipated acquisition-related expenses;
•   failure to realize anticipated benefits, such as cost savings and revenue enhancements; and
•   difficulties in assimilating personnel, benefits, services and systems.
some or all of these items could have a material adverse effect on our business. the businesses we acquire in the future may not achieve anticipated sales and profitability, and any difficulties we encounter in the integration process could interfere with our operations, reduce our operating margins and adversely affect our internal control over financial reporting.
we compete with governmental entities, other regulated utilities, and strategic and financial buyers for acquisition opportunities. if consolidation becomes more prevalent in the water and wastewater industries and competition for acquisitions increases, the prices for suitable acquisition candidates may increase and limit our ability to expand through acquisitions.
our regulated businesses are subject to condemnation and other proceedings through eminent domain or other similar authorized process, which could materially and adversely affect their results of operations and financial condition.
municipalities and other government subdivisions have historically been involved in the provision of water and wastewater services in the united states, and organized efforts may arise from time to time in one or more of the service areas in which our regulated businesses operate to convert our assets to public ownership and operation through exercise of the governmental power of eminent domain, or another similar authorized process. should a municipality or other government subdivision or a citizen group seek to acquire our assets through eminent domain or such other process, either directly or indirectly as a result of a citizen petition, we may resist the acquisition.
furthermore, the law in certain jurisdictions in which our regulated businesses operate, including, for example, california, provide for eminent domain rights allowing private property owners to seek just compensation against a public utility if the public utility's infrastructure has been determined to be a substantial cause of damage to that property. in these actions, the plaintiff would not have to prove that the public utility acted negligently. these actions have occurred in connection with events such as floods, mudslides and debris flow, broken water mains, landslides and wild and brush fires.
contesting an exercise of condemnation, eminent domain or other similar process, or responding to a citizen petition, may result in costly legal proceedings and may divert the attention of management of affected regulated businesses from the operation of those businesses. moreover, our efforts to resist the condemnation, eminent domain or other process may not be successful, which may require us to sell the operations at issue in a condemnation proceeding or to pay a private property owner compensation for the property damage suffered. if a municipality or other government subdivision succeeds in acquiring the assets of one or more of our regulated businesses through eminent domain or other process, there is a risk that we will not receive adequate compensation for the business, that we will not be able to keep the compensation, or that we will not be able to divest the business without incurring significant charges. any of these outcomes may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and liquidity.
we rely on technology systems to facilitate the management of our business and customer and supplier relationships, and a disruption of these systems could adversely affect our business.
our technology systems, particularly our operational technology and it systems, are an integral part of our business, and any disruption of these systems could significantly limit our ability to manage and operate our business efficiently, which, in turn, could cause our business and competitive position to suffer and adversely affect our results of operations. for example, we depend on these systems to bill customers, process orders, provide customer service, manage certain plant operations and construction projects, manage our financial records, track assets, remotely monitor certain of our plants and facilities and manage human resources, inventory and accounts receivable collections. these systems also enable us to purchase products from our suppliers and bill customers on a timely basis, maintain cost-effective operations and provide service to our customers.
although we do not believe that these systems are at a materially greater risk of failure or cybersecurity incidents than other similar organizations, our operational technology and it systems remain vulnerable to damage or interruption from:
•   power loss, computer systems failures, and internet, telecommunications or data network failures;
•   operator error or improper operation by, or the negligent or improper supervision of, employees and contractors;
26
•   physical and electronic loss of customer or employee data due to security breaches, cyber attacks, misappropriation and similar events;
•   computer viruses;
•   intentional security breaches, hacking, denial of services actions, misappropriation of data and similar events; and
•   severe weather and other events, including without limitation, hurricanes, tornadoes, fires, floods, earthquakes and other disasters.
these events may result in physical and electronic loss of customer, employee or financial data, security breaches, misappropriation and other adverse consequences. in addition, a lack of or inadequate levels of redundancy for certain of these systems, including billing systems, could exacerbate the impact of any of these events on us. we may not be successful in developing or acquiring technology that is competitive and responsive to the needs of our business, and we might lack sufficient resources to make the necessary upgrades or replacements of outdated existing technology to enable us to continue to operate at our current level of efficiency.
we may be subject to physical and/or cyber attacks.
as operators of critical infrastructure, we may face a heightened risk of physical and/or cyber attacks. our water and wastewater systems may be vulnerable to disability or failures as a result of physical or cyber acts of war or terrorism, vandalism or other causes. our operational technology and it systems throughout our businesses may be vulnerable to unauthorized access due to hacking, viruses, acts of war or terrorism, and other causes. unauthorized access to confidential information located or stored on these systems could negatively and materially impact our customers, employees, suppliers and other third parties. while we have instituted certain safeguards to protect our operational technology and it systems, those safeguards may not always be effective due to the evolving nature of cyber attacks and cyber vulnerabilities. we cannot guarantee that such protections will be completely successful in the event of a cyber attack.
if, despite our security measures, a significant physical attack or cyber breach occurred, our operations could be disrupted, property damaged, and customer and other confidential information lost or stolen; experience substantial loss of revenues, response costs and other financial loss; suffer a loss of management time, attention and resources from our regular business operations; and be subject to increased regulation, litigation, and damage to our reputation, any of which could have a negative impact on our business, results of operations and cash flows. these types of events, either impacting our facilities or the industry in general, could also cause us to incur additional security and insurance related costs. losses resulting from a physical or cyber attack against us or our operations or assets may not be covered by, or may exceed the coverage provided by, applicable insurance policies.
in addition, in the ordinary course of business, we collect and retain sensitive information, including personally identifiable information, about our customers and employees. in many cases, we outsource administration of certain functions to vendors that could be targets of cyber attacks. any theft, loss and/or fraudulent use of customer, employee or proprietary data as a result of a cyber attack could subject us to significant litigation, liability and costs, as well as adversely impact our reputation with customers and regulators, among others.
our inability to efficiently upgrade and improve our operational technology and it systems, or implement new systems, could result in higher than expected costs or otherwise adversely impact our internal controls environment, operations and profitability.
upgrades and improvements to computer systems and networks, or the implementation of new systems, may require substantial amounts of management's time and financial resources to complete, and may also result in system or network defects or operational errors due to multiple factors, including employees' ability to effectively use the new or upgraded system. we continue to implement technology to improve our business processes and customer interactions, and have installed new, and upgraded existing, technology systems. these efforts support our broader strategic initiatives and are intended to improve our operations and enhance our customer service capabilities. any technical or other difficulties in upgrading and improving existing or implementing new technology systems may increase costs beyond those anticipated and have an adverse or disruptive effect on our operations and reporting processes, including our internal control over financial reporting. we may also experience difficulties integrating current systems with new or upgraded systems, which may impact our ability to serve our customers effectively or efficiently. although we make efforts to minimize any adverse impact on our controls, business and operations, we cannot assure that all such impacts have been or will be mitigated, and any such impacts could harm our business (individually or collectively) and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
our business has inherently dangerous workplaces. if we fail to maintain safe work sites, we may experience workforce injuries or loss of life, and be exposed to financial losses, including penalties and other liabilities.
our safety record is critical to our reputation. we maintain health and safety standards to protect our employees, customers, contractors, vendors and the public. although we intend to adhere to such health and safety standards and aim for zero injuries, it is extremely difficult to avoid accidents at all times.
27
our business sites, including construction and maintenance sites, often put our employees, contractors and others in close proximity with large pieces of equipment, moving vehicles, pressurized water, underground trenches and vaults, chemicals and other regulated materials. on many sites we are responsible for safety and, accordingly, must implement safety procedures. if we fail to implement such procedures or if the procedures we implement are ineffective or are not followed by our employees or others, our employees, contractors and others may be injured or die. unsafe work sites also have the potential to increase employee turnover, expose us to litigation and raise our operating costs. any of the foregoing could result in financial losses, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
in addition, our operations can involve the handling and storage of hazardous chemicals, which, if improperly handled, stored or disposed of, could subject us to penalties or other liabilities. we are also subject to regulations dealing with occupational health and safety. although we maintain functional employee groups whose primary purpose is to ensure we implement effective health, safety, and environmental work procedures throughout our organization, including construction sites and maintenance sites, the failure to comply with such regulations or procedures could subject us to liability.
work stoppages and other labor relations matters could adversely affect our results of operations.
as of december 31, 2017, approximately 46% of our workforce was represented by unions, and we had 76 collective bargaining agreements in place with 19 different unions representing our unionized employees. these collective bargaining agreements, including 35 which expired in 2017, and 20 which will expire during 2018, are subject to periodic renewal and renegotiation. moreover, our national benefits agreement with most of the labor unions that represent employees in our regulated businesses expires on july 31, 2018 and will be renegotiated during 2018. we may not be able to successfully renew or renegotiate these labor contracts on terms that are fair to us. any negotiations or dispute resolution processes undertaken in connection with our labor contracts could be delayed or affected by labor actions or work stoppages. labor actions, work stoppages or the threat of work stoppages, and our failure to obtain favorable labor contract terms during renegotiations, may disrupt our operations and result in higher labor costs, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity. while we have developed contingency plans to be implemented as necessary if a work stoppage or strike does occur, a strike or work stoppage may have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
our continued success is dependent upon our ability to hire, retain, and utilize qualified personnel.
the success of our business is dependent upon our ability to hire, retain, and utilize qualified personnel, including engineers, licensed operators, water quality and other operating and craft personnel, and management professionals who have the required experience and expertise. from time to time, it may be difficult to attract and retain qualified individuals with the expertise and in the timeframe demanded for our business needs. in certain geographic areas, for example, we may not be able to satisfy the demand for our services because of our inability to successfully hire and retain qualified personnel.
in addition, as some of our key personnel approach retirement age, we need to have appropriate succession plans in place and to successfully implement such plans. if we cannot attract and retain qualified personnel or effectively implement appropriate succession plans, it could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
financial and market-related risks our indebtedness could affect our business adversely and limit our ability to plan for or respond to changes in our business, and we may be unable to generate sufficient cash flows to satisfy our liquidity needs.
as of december 31, 2017, our aggregate long-term and short-term debt balance (including preferred stock with mandatory redemption requirements) was $7.7 billion, and our working capital (defined as current assets less current liabilities) was in a deficit position. our indebtedness could have important consequences, including:
•   limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital requirements or capital expenditures;
•   exposing us to interest rate risk with respect to the portion of our indebtedness that bears interest at variable rates;
•   limiting our ability to pay dividends on our common stock or make payments in connection with our other obligations;
•   impairing our access to the capital markets for debt and equity;
•   requiring that an increasing portion of our cash flows from operations be dedicated to the payment of the principal and interest on our debt, thereby reducing funds available for future operations, dividends on our common stock or capital expenditures;
•   limiting our ability to take advantage of significant business opportunities, such as acquisition opportunities, and to react to changes in market or industry conditions; and
•   placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to those of our competitors that have less debt.
28
in order to meet our capital expenditure needs, we may be required to make additional borrowings under our revolving credit facility or issue new short-term and long-term debt securities. moreover, additional borrowings may be required to refinance outstanding indebtedness. debt maturities and sinking fund payments in 2018, 2019 and 2020 will be $322 million, $170 million and $51 million, respectively. we can provide no assurance that we will be able to access the debt capital markets on favorable terms, if at all. moreover, if new debt is added to our current debt levels, the related risks we now face could intensify, limiting our ability to refinance existing debt on favorable terms.
in an attempt to manage our exposure to interest rate risk associated with our issuance of variable and fixed-rate debt, we have entered into, and in the future may enter into, financial derivative instruments, including without limitation, interest rate swaps, forward starting swaps, swaptions and u.s. treasury lock agreements. see item 7a-quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk. however, these efforts may not be effective to fully mitigate interest rate risk, and may expose us to other risks and uncertainties, including quarterly "mark to market" valuation risk associated with these instruments, that could negatively and materially affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
we will depend primarily on cash flows from operations to fund our expenses and to pay the principal and interest on our outstanding debt. therefore, our ability to pay our expenses and satisfy our debt service obligations depends on our future performance, which will be affected by financial, business, economic, competitive, legislative (including tax initiatives and reforms, and other similar legislation or regulation), regulatory and other factors largely beyond our control. if we do not have sufficient cash flows to pay the principal and interest on our outstanding debt, we may be required to refinance all or part of our existing debt, reduce capital investments, sell assets, borrow additional funds or sell additional equity. in addition, if our business does not generate sufficient cash flows from operations, or if we are unable to incur indebtedness sufficient to enable us to fund our liquidity needs, we may be unable to plan for or respond to changes in our business, which could cause our financial condition, operating results and prospects to be affected adversely.
our inability to access the capital or financial markets or other events could affect our ability to meet our liquidity needs at reasonable cost and our ability to meet long-term commitments, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
in addition to cash from operations, we rely primarily on our revolving credit facility, commercial paper programs, and the capital markets to satisfy our liquidity needs. in this regard, our principal external sources of short-term liquidity are our $1.6 billion commercial paper program and our $1.75 billion revolving credit facility. our revolving credit facility expires in accordance with its terms in june 2020. we regularly use our commercial paper program under this revolving credit facility as a principal source of short-term borrowing due to the generally more attractive rates we generally can obtain in the commercial paper market. as of december 31, 2017, american water capital corp. ("awcc"), our wholly owned financing subsidiary, had no outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility, and had $905 million of commercial paper outstanding and $84 million in outstanding letters of credit. there can be no assurance that awcc will be able to continue to access its commercial paper program or its revolving credit facility, when, as and if desired, or that the amount of capital available thereunder will be sufficient to meet all of our liquidity needs at a reasonable, or any, cost.
under the terms of our revolving credit facility, our consolidated debt cannot exceed 70% of our consolidated capitalization, as determined under the terms of the credit facility. if our equity were to decline or debt were to increase to a level that caused our debt to exceed this limit, lenders under the credit facility would be entitled to refuse any further extension of credit and to declare all of the outstanding debt under the credit facility immediately due and payable. to avoid such a default, a waiver or renegotiation of this covenant would be required, which would likely increase funding costs and could result in additional covenants that would restrict our operational and financing flexibility.
our ability to comply with this and other covenants contained in the revolving credit facility and our other consolidated indebtedness is subject to various risks and uncertainties, including events beyond our control. for example, events that could cause a reduction in equity include, without limitation, a significant write-down of our goodwill. even if we are able to comply with this or other covenants, the limitations on our operational and financial flexibility could harm our business by, among other things, limiting our ability to incur indebtedness or reduce equity in connection with financings or other corporate opportunities that we may believe would be in our best interests or the interests of our stockholders to complete.
29
disruptions in the capital markets or changes in our credit ratings could also limit our ability to access capital on terms favorable to us or at all. while the lending banks that participate in our revolving credit facility have met all of their obligations, disruptions in the credit markets, changes in our credit ratings, or deterioration of the banking industry's financial condition could discourage or prevent lenders from meeting their existing lending commitments, extending the terms of such commitments, or agreeing to new commitments. these or other occurrences may cause our lenders to not meet their existing commitments, and we may not be able to access the commercial paper or loan or debt markets in the future on terms acceptable to us or at all. furthermore, our inability to maintain, renew or replace commitments under this facility could materially increase our cost of capital and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. longer term disruptions in the capital and credit markets as a result of uncertainty, including as a result of changes in u.s. tax and other laws, reduced financing alternatives, or failures of significant financial institutions could adversely affect our access to the liquidity needed for our business. any significant disruption in the capital, debt or credit markets, or financial institution failures could require us to take measures to conserve cash until the market stabilizes or until alternative financing can be arranged. such measures could include deferring capital expenditures, reducing or suspending dividend payments, and reducing other discretionary expenditures.
any of the foregoing events that impede our access to the capital markets, or the failure of any of our lenders to meet their commitments that result from financial market disruptions, could expose us to increased interest expense, require us to institute cash conservation measures or otherwise adversely and materially affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.
american water may be unable to meet its ongoing and future financial obligations and to pay dividends on its common stock if its subsidiaries are unable to pay upstream dividends or repay funds to american water.
american water is a holding company and, as such, american water has no operations of its own. substantially all of our consolidated assets are held by subsidiaries. american water's ability to meet its financial obligations and to pay dividends on its common stock is primarily dependent on the net income and cash flows of its subsidiaries and their ability to pay upstream dividends to american water or repay indebtedness to american water. prior to paying dividends to american water, american water's regulated subsidiaries must comply with applicable regulatory restrictions and financial obligations, including, for example, debt service and preferred and preference stock dividends, as well as applicable corporate, tax and other laws and regulations and agreements, and covenants and other agreements made or entered into by american water and its subsidiaries. american water's subsidiaries are separate legal entities and have no obligation to pay dividends to american water. a failure or inability of any of these subsidiaries to pay such dividends or repay intercompany obligations could have a material adverse impact on american water's liquidity and its ability to pay dividends on its common stock and meet its other obligations.
we may not be able to fully utilize our u.s. and state net operating loss carryforwards.
as of december 31, 2017, we had u.s. federal and state nol carryforwards of approximately $1.05 billion and $322 million, respectively, and management believes it is more likely than not that these nol carryforwards will be recovered in the future. with the enactment of the tcja, the company analyzed the impacts of the reduction in the u.s. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% on the company's deferred tax assets and liabilities, including its nol carryforwards, and as a result, remeasured those nol carryforwards as of the date of enactment of the tcja based on this tax rate change.
our federal nol carryforwards will begin to expire in 2028, and our state nol carryforwards will begin to expire in 2018 through 2037. our ability to utilize our nol carryforwards is primarily dependent upon our ability to generate sufficient taxable income. we have, in the past, been unable to utilize certain of our state nol carryforwards, and the establishment or increase of a valuation allowance in the future would reduce our deferred income tax assets and our net income.
our actual results may differ from those estimated by management in making its assessment as to our ability to use the nol carryforwards. moreover, adoption of related interpretations with respect to the tcja and other changes in income tax laws, the economy and the general business environment could affect the future utilization of our nol carryforwards. if we are unable to fully utilize our nol carryforwards to offset taxable income generated in the future, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.
we have recorded a significant amount of goodwill, and we may never realize the full value of our intangible assets, causing us to record impairments that may negatively affect our results of operations.
our total assets include $1.4 billion of goodwill at december 31, 2017. the goodwill is primarily associated with the acquisition of american water by an affiliate of our previous owner in 2003 and the acquisition of e'town corporation by a predecessor to our previous owner in 2001, and, to a lesser extent, the acquisition of keystone in 2015. goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price the purchaser paid over the fair value of the net tangible and other intangible assets acquired. goodwill is recorded at fair value on the date of an acquisition and is reviewed annually or more frequently if changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. as required by the applicable accounting rules, we have taken significant non-cash charges to operating results for goodwill impairments in the past.
30
we may be required to recognize an impairment of goodwill in the future due to market conditions or other factors related to our performance or the performance of an acquired business. these market conditions could include a decline over a period of time of our stock price, a decline over a period of time in valuation multiples of comparable water utilities, market price performance of our common stock that compares unfavorably to our peer companies, decreases in control premiums, or, with respect to keystone, fluctuations in the level of exploration and production activities in the marcellus and utica shale regions served by keystone, a prolonged depression of natural gas prices or other factors that negatively impact our current or future forecasts of operating results, cash flows or key assumptions. a decline in the results forecasted in our business plan due to events such as changes in rate case results, capital investment budgets or interest rates, could also result in an impairment charge. recognition of impairments of goodwill would result in a charge to income in the period in which the impairment occurred, which may negatively affect our financial condition, results of operations and total capitalization. the effects of any such impairment could be material and could make it more difficult to maintain our credit ratings, secure financing on attractive terms, maintain compliance with debt covenants and meet the expectations of our regulators.
market conditions may impact the value of benefit plan assets and liabilities, as well as assumptions related to the benefit plans, which may require us to provide significant additional funding.
the performance of the capital markets affects the values of the assets that are held in trust to satisfy significant future obligations under our pension and postretirement benefit plans. the value of these assets is subject to market fluctuations, which may cause investment returns to fall below our projected return rates. a decline in the market value of the pension and postretirement benefit plan assets can increase the funding requirements under our pension and postretirement benefit plans. additionally, our pension and postretirement benefit plan liabilities are sensitive to changes in interest rates. if interest rates decrease, our liabilities would increase, potentially increasing benefit expense and funding requirements. further, changes in demographics, such as increases in life expectancy assumptions and increasing trends in health care costs may also increase our funding requirements. future increases in pension and other postretirement costs as a result of reduced plan assets may not be fully recoverable in rates, in which case our results of operations and financial position could be negatively affected.
in addition, market factors can affect assumptions we use in determining funding requirements with respect to our pension and postretirement plans. for example, a relatively modest change in our assumptions regarding discount rates can materially affect our calculation of funding requirements. to the extent that market data compels us to reduce the discount rate used in our assumptions, our benefit obligations could be materially increased, which could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
new accounting standards or changes to existing accounting standards could materially impact how we report our results of operations, cash flow and financial condition.
our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap. the sec, the financial accounting standards board or other authoritative bodies or governmental entities may issue new pronouncements or new interpretations of existing accounting standards that may require us to change our accounting policies. these changes are beyond our control, can be difficult to predict and could materially impact how we report our results of operations, cash flow and financial condition. we could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively, which could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flow and financial condition.
undetected errors in internal controls and information reporting could result in the disallowance of cost recovery and noncompliant disclosure.
our internal controls, accounting policies and practices and internal information systems are designed to enable us to capture and process transactions and information in a timely and accurate manner in compliance with gaap, taxation requirements, federal securities laws and regulations and other laws and regulations applicable to us. such compliance permits us to, among other things, disclose and report financial and other information in connection with the recovery of our costs and with the reporting requirements under federal securities, tax and other laws and regulations.
we have implemented corporate governance, internal control and accounting policies and procedures in connection with the sarbanes-oxley act of 2002 (the "sarbanes-oxley act") and relevant sec rules, as well as other applicable regulations. such internal controls and policies have been and continue to be closely monitored by our management and board of directors to ensure continued compliance with these laws, rules and regulations. management is also responsible for establishing and maintaining internal control over financial reporting and is required to assess annually the effectiveness of these controls. while we believe these controls, policies, practices and systems are adequate to verify data integrity, unanticipated and unauthorized actions of employees or temporary lapses in internal controls due to shortfalls in oversight or resource constraints could lead to undetected errors that could result in the disallowance of cost recovery and noncompliant disclosure and reporting. the consequences of these events could have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition. the inability of management to certify as to the effectiveness of these controls due to the identification of one or more material weaknesses in these controls could also increase financing costs or could also adversely affect our or awcc's ability to access the capital markets.
31
additional risks related to our market-based businesses we (excluding our regulated subsidiaries) provide performance guarantees with respect to certain obligations of our market-based businesses, including financial guarantees or deposits, to our public-sector and public clients, and these clients may seek to enforce the guarantees if our market-based businesses do not satisfy these obligations.
under the terms of some of our agreements for the provision of services to water and wastewater facilities with municipalities, other governmental entities and other customers, american water (excluding our regulated subsidiaries) provides guarantees of specified performance obligations of our market-based businesses, including financial guarantees or deposits. in the event our market-based businesses fail to perform these obligations, the entity holding the guarantees may seek to enforce the performance commitments against us or proceed against the deposit. in that event, our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and liquidity could be adversely affected.
at december 31, 2017, we had remaining performance commitments as measured by remaining contract revenue totaling approximately $3.6 billion, and this amount is likely to increase if our market-based businesses expand. the presence of these commitments may adversely affect our financial condition and make it more difficult for us to secure financing on attractive terms.
awe's operations are subject to various risks associated with doing business with the u.s. government.
we enter into contracts with the u.s. government for the operation and maintenance of water and wastewater systems, which contracts may be terminated, in whole or in part, prior to the end of the 50-year term for convenience of the u.s. government or as a result of default or non-performance by the subsidiary performing the contract. in addition, the contract price for each of these military contracts is typically subject to redetermination two years after commencement of operations and every three years thereafter. price redetermination is a contract mechanism to periodically adjust the service fee in the next period to reflect changes in contract obligations and anticipated market conditions. any early contract termination or unfavorable price redetermination could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
moreover, entering into contracts with the u.s. government subjects us to a number of operational and compliance risks, including dependence on the level of government spending and compliance with and changes in governmental procurement and security regulations. we are subject to potential government investigations of our business practices and compliance with government procurement and security regulations, which are complex, and compliance with these regulations can be expensive and burdensome. if we were charged with wrongdoing as a result of an investigation, we could be suspended or barred from bidding on or receiving awards of new contracts with the u.s. government, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows.
awe operates a number of water and wastewater systems under o&m contracts and faces the risk that the owners of those systems may fail to provide capital to properly maintain those systems, which may negatively affect awe as the operator of the systems.
awe operates a number of water and wastewater systems under o&m contracts. pursuant to these contracts, awe operates the system according to the standards set forth in the applicable contract, and it is generally the responsibility of the owner of the system to undertake capital improvements. in some cases, awe may not be able to convince the owner to make needed improvements in order to maintain compliance with applicable regulations. although violations and fines incurred by water and wastewater systems may be the responsibility of the owner of the system under these contracts, those non-compliance events may reflect poorly on awe as the operator of the system and us, and damage our reputation, and in some cases, may result in liability to us to the same extent as if we were the owner.
awe's market-based businesses are party to long-term contracts to operate and maintain water and wastewater systems under which we may incur costs in excess of payments received.
some of awe's market-based businesses enter into long-term contracts under which they agree to operate and maintain a municipality's, federal government's or other party's water or wastewater treatment and delivery facilities, which includes specified major maintenance for some of those facilities, in exchange for an annual fee. these market-based businesses are generally subject to the risk that costs associated with operating and maintaining the facilities, including production costs such as purchased water, electricity, fuel and chemicals used in water treatment, may exceed the fees received from the municipality or other contracting party. losses under these contracts or guarantees may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.
32
keystone's operations may expose us to substantial costs and liabilities with respect to environmental laws and matters.
keystone's operations, and the operation generally of natural gas and oil exploration and production facilities by keystone's customers, are subject to stringent federal, state and local laws, rules, regulations and ordinances governing the release of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection. these provisions may require the acquisition by keystone of permits or licenses before providing its services to customers, prohibit the release of substances defined thereunder as hazardous in connection with these activities, and impose substantial liabilities for the violation thereof that may result from these operations. failure to comply with these laws, rules, regulations and ordinances may result in substantial environmental remediation and other costs to keystone, the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties or the issuance of injunctions restricting or prohibiting certain activities. under existing environmental laws and regulations, keystone could be held strictly liable for the removal or remediation of previously released materials or property contamination regardless of whether the release resulted from its operations, or whether its operations were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time they were performed. while we have structured and maintained our ownership and control of keystone's operations in such a way that we believe should insulate the company, its regulated subsidiaries and its other market-based businesses from any liabilities associated with keystone's operations, including liabilities for environmental matters, there can be no assurance that such efforts will be sufficient to prevent the company from incurring liability for the operations of keystone.
changes in environmental laws and regulations occur frequently, and any changes to these or other laws governing the natural gas and oil exploration industry that result in more stringent or costly water or wastewater handling, storage, transport, disposal or cleanup requirements could require keystone to make significant expenditures to maintain compliance with such requirements, may harm keystone's business and results of operations by reducing the demand for keystone's water and related services, and may otherwise have a material adverse effect on keystone's competitive position, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read together with the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this form 10-k. this discussion contains forward-looking statements that are based on management's current expectations, estimates and projections about our business, operations and financial performance. the cautionary statements made in this form 10-k should be read as applying to all related forward-looking statements whenever they appear in this form 10-k. our actual results may differ materially from those currently anticipated and expressed in such forward-looking statements as a result of a number of factors, including those we discuss under "forward-looking statements," item 1a-risk factors and elsewhere in this form 10-k.
overview american water is the largest and most geographically diverse, publicly-traded water and wastewater utility company in the united states, as measured by both operating revenues and population served. we employ approximately 6,900 professionals who provide drinking water, wastewater and other related services to an estimated 15 million people in 46 states, the district of columbia and ontario, canada. our primary business involves the ownership of utilities that provide water and wastewater services to residential, commercial, industrial, public authority, fire service and sale for resale customers, collectively presented as our "regulated businesses." our utilities operate in 16 states and serve approximately 3.4 million customers, based on the number of active service connections to our water and wastewater networks. our regulated businesses are generally subject to economic regulation by certain state utility commissions or other entities engaged in utility regulation, collectively referred to as pucs. we also operate market-based businesses within four operating segments, providing a broad range of related and complementary water and wastewater services to military bases, municipalities, oil and gas exploration and production companies, as well as commercial, industrial and residential customers. individually, these four operating segments do not meet the criteria of a reportable segment in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states ("gaap"), and are collectively presented as our market-based businesses, which is consistent with how management assesses the results of these businesses.

for the year ended december 31, 2017, net income attributable to common stockholders was $2.38 per diluted share, a decrease of $0.24 per diluted share, or 9.2%, as compared to the prior year. included in the 2017 amount was: (i) an after-tax benefit of $13 million, or $0.07 per diluted share, resulting from an insurance settlement with one of our general liability insurance carriers related to the freedom industries chemical spill; (ii) an after-tax charge of $4 million, or $(0.02) per diluted share, resulting from the early extinguishment of debt at the parent company; and (iii) a non-cash, after-tax re-measurement charge of $125 million, or $0.70 per diluted share, resulting from the impact of the change in the federal tax rate on the company's deferred income taxes from the enactment of the tcja on december 22, 2017. included in the 2016 amounts was an after-tax charge of $39 million, or $(0.22) per diluted share, resulting from the binding global agreement in principle to settle claims associated with the freedom industries chemical spill. for additional information, see item 3-legal proceedings-west virginia elk river freedom industries chemical spill.
excluding these items, adjusted diluted earnings per share (a non-gaap measure) was $3.03 for the year ended december 31, 2017, an increase of $0.19 per diluted share, or 6.7%, as compared to the prior year. this increase was primarily due to continued growth in our regulated businesses, largely driven by infrastructure investment, acquisitions and organic growth, combined with growth in our market-based businesses from our homeowner services group and keystone. these increases were partially offset by lower water services demand in 2017 in our regulated businesses, attributable in part to overall warmer weather in 2016, as well as lower capital upgrades in our military services group. for further discussion of our consolidated results of operations, as well as financial results for our regulated businesses segment and our market-based businesses, see "consolidated results of operations" and "segment results of operations" for additional information.
adjusted diluted earnings per share represents a non-gaap financial measure and means diluted earnings per share, calculated in accordance with gaap, excluding the impact of: (i) the third quarter of 2017 insurance settlement related to the freedom industries chemical spill; (ii) the early extinguishment of debt at the parent company in the third quarter of 2017; (iii) the non-cash, after-tax re-measurement charge in the fourth quarter of 2017 resulting from the impact of the change in the federal tax rate on the company's deferred income taxes from enactment of the tcja; and (iv) the fourth quarter of 2016 binding global agreement in principle to settle claims related to the freedom industries chemical spill. we believe that this non-gaap measure provides investors with useful information by excluding certain matters that may not be indicative of our ongoing operating results, and that providing this non-gaap measure will allow investors to understand better our businesses' operating performance and facilitate a meaningful year-to-year comparison of our results of operations. although management uses this non-gaap financial measure internally to evaluate our results of operations, we do not intend results excluding the adjustments to represent results as defined by gaap, and the reader should not consider them as indicators of performance. this non-gaap financial measure is derived from our consolidated financial information but is not presented in our financial statements prepared in accordance with gaap, and thus it should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with gaap. in addition, this non-gaap financial measure as defined and used above may not be comparable to similarly titled non-gaap measures used by other companies, and, accordingly, it may have significant limitations on its use.
strategic focus and 2017 achievements we believe our success in the future will be driven by engaged employees, smart investments and safe, efficient operations, leading to satisfied customers which in turn will lead to constructive regulatory outcomes and sustainable financial performance. our strategy, which is driven by our vision and core values, will continue to be anchored on our five central themes:
•   customer-our customers are at the center of everything we do. we want to be the best, and if our customers have a choice as to who serves them, we want it to be us.
•   in 2017, we:
•   achieved both a customer satisfaction rating and a service quality rating in the top quartile among our water industry peers;
•   expanded our customer experience initiative, designed to make it easier for customers to do business with us, and enhanced our quality of service through implementation and upgrades of technology tools; and
•   continued to make needed infrastructure investment while implementing operational efficiency improvements to keep customer rates affordable.
•   looking forward, we will:
•   target the achievement of customer satisfaction and service quality targets in the top quartile of service industries, beyond the water and wastewater industry. we have a three year plan to enhance technology and innovation in our customer experience through: (i) leveraging secure artificial intelligence to better serve our customers; (ii) using on-line customer communities for immediate input and reactions before rolling out programs; and (iii) mapping our most frequent customer interactions and re-working our internal processes to how the customer wants services; and
43
•   aim for top quartile targets for drinking water quality and being an industry leader in system resiliency and environmental stewardship. we intend to continue to make needed infrastructure investments while implementing operational efficiency improvements to help keep customer rates affordable.
•   safety-safety is both a strategy and a value at american water. we put safety first in everything that we do.
•   in 2017, we:
•   finished the year with fewer employee injuries than the prior year and exceeded our targeted results for our occupational safety and health administration recordable incident rate and our days away restricted or transferred rate; and
•   strengthened our safety culture as measured by employee responses to safety-related questions in the company's culture survey, and scored 13 points above "high performing companies" in the category of safety, as measured by ceb, inc. our safety council, consisting of management and labor employees from across the company, continued its mission of developing and implementing recommendations to reinforce the company's commitment to safety.
•   looking forward, we will:
•   strive toward zero workplace injuries;
•   focus on requiring that the contractors that perform work for the company are approved in accordance with the contractor safety qualification practice and are held to the same standards as our employees; and
•   continue our focus on "near miss reporting," to promote continuous learning and corrective action regarding potential safety hazards.
•   people-we are building a diverse, fully-engaged, high performance workforce and culture and creating an environment where our people feel valued, included and accountable.
•   in 2017, we continued to demonstrate our commitment to employees by expanding training and development across the company, with the vast majority of our employees completing at least 20 hours of training during 2017. we also added new respect and diversity training to strengthen our values-based culture.
•   looking forward, we will continue to:
•   improve the diversity of our overall employee population, reflective of our customers and communities;
•   implement a strategic workforce plan which will address the changing requirements of our business and our jobs, and how we will fill those critical positions throughout the company to promote continuity and help us to meet future operational needs; and
•   dedicate ourselves to personal development through effective training and development plans.
•   growth-we expect to continue to grow our businesses, with the significant majority of our growth to be achieved in our regulated businesses through: (i) continued investment in infrastructure to provide safe, clean, reliable and affordable water and wastewater services to our customers; and (ii) regulated acquisitions to expand our services to new customers. we also expect to continue to grow our market-based businesses, which leverage our core water and wastewater competencies.
•   in 2017, we invested $1.7 billion, a record level of annual investment since the company went public in 2008, and $200 million more than 2016, which had previously been a record year for investment. our 2017 investment included:
•   $1.4 billion, of which the majority was in our regulated businesses for infrastructure replacements and improvements; and
•   $210 million to fund acquisitions in our regulated businesses, which added approximately 40,000 water and wastewater customers, including bulk customers, highlighted by the:
•   april 3, 2017 acquisition of shorelands water company, inc. ("shorelands") in a stock transaction for $33 million in the form of 438,211 shares of our common stock. shorelands, which is now a part of our new jersey subsidiary, provides water service to approximately 11,000 customers in monmouth county, new jersey; and the
44
•   december 18, 2017 acquisition of the mckeesport system for $159 million. this acquisition was the first acquisition executed under pennsylvania's act 12 of 2016, which allows municipalities to sell water and wastewater systems for a price based upon the fair market value of the system. under act 12, the rate base for this acquisition was approved at $158 million. the mckeesport system, which is now part of our pennsylvania subsidiary, represents approximately 22,000 customers; comprised of 11,000 customer connections, as well as service to an additional 11,000 customers under bulk contracts to 13 municipalities in allegheny county, pennsylvania.
•   on september 29, 2017, our military services group was awarded a contract for ownership, operation and maintenance of the water and wastewater systems at wright-patterson air force base, the largest single-site employer in the state of ohio. the contract award includes estimated revenues of approximately $490 million over a 50-year period, subject to an annual economic price adjustment. in the fourth quarter of 2017, a bid protest was filed on this contract by an unsuccessful bidder. in january 2018, the bid protest was sustained because a required element of the solicitation was not properly considered. the protester's bid proposal will be re-evaluated, and we believe that the contract previously awarded to our military services group will be reinstated.
•   looking forward, we expect to invest between $8.0 billion to $8.6 billion from 2018 to 2022, including a range of $1.6 billion to $1.8 billion in 2018. our expected future investment includes:
•   capital investment for infrastructure improvements in our regulated businesses of $7.2 billion over the next five years, including a range of $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion expected in 2018;
•   growth from acquisitions in our regulated businesses to expand our water and wastewater customer base of between $600 million to $1.2 billion over the next five years, including a range of $120 million to $240 million expected in 2018; and
•   strategic capital investments of approximately $200 million over the next five years, including approximately $100 million expected in 2018. these investments include strategic growth opportunities in our market-based businesses and the construction of our new corporate headquarters in camden, new jersey, which is expected to be completed during the second half of 2018 and is eligible for up to $164 million in tax credits from new jersey's economic development authority.
the following chart depicts the estimated allocation of our expected capital investment for infrastructure improvements in our regulated businesses from 2018 to 2022, by purpose:

•   technology and operational efficiency-we continue to strive for industry-leading operational efficiency, driven by technology. our technology investments are aimed at enhancing our customer experience and operational efficiency.
•   in 2017:
•   our regulated businesses achieved an adjusted o&amp;m efficiency ratio (a non-gaap measure) of 33.8% for the year ended december 31, 2017, compared to 34.9% and 35.9% for the years ended december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. the continued improvement in our adjusted o&amp;m efficiency ratio in 2017 was attributable to both an increase in operating revenues and a decrease in o&amp;m expenses (see the following table). the improvement in the 2016 adjusted o&amp;m efficiency ratio over the 2015 ratio was primarily attributable to an increase in operating revenues;
•   we introduced new tools such as fsr customer one view, which provides our employees with information such as neighborhood maps, customer usage data, billing and payment history, and real-time meter reads; and mapcall, which helps to manage location based assets such as hydrants, valves, meters, among others; along with implementing technology upgrades to our national customer services, focused on helping us improve customer service;
•   we continued our commitment to water quality and the environment by leveraging new technologies; we now have advanced water quality sensors at all of our major drinking water intake sites and we are automating our reporting and compliance systems; and
•   we implemented other technology tools that will enhance communication, collaboration and mobility to help our operations and support employees work more safely and efficiently, and enhance the customer experience.
•   looking forward, we will focus on technology and efficiency to:
•   be the leader in optimizing technology deployment across the water and wastewater industry, with a keen focus on specific, innovative projects that will set us apart from other utilities, and to help us serve our customers with greater ease, make us safer and help us operate more efficiently; and
•   achieve our goal of an adjusted o&amp;m efficiency ratio equal to or below 32.0% by 2022.
our adjusted o&m efficiency ratio is defined as our regulated operation and maintenance expenses divided by our regulated operating revenues, where both operation and maintenance expenses and operating revenues were adjusted to eliminate purchased water expense. additionally, from operation and maintenance expenses, we have excluded the allocable portion of non-operation and maintenance support services costs, mainly depreciation and general taxes, that are reflected in our regulated businesses segment as operation and maintenance expenses, but for consolidated financial reporting purposes, are categorized within other line items in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. for the years ended december 31, 2017 and 2016, we have also excluded from operation and maintenance expenses the impact of certain freedom industries chemical spill settlement activities. we excluded all of the above items from the calculation as we believe such items are not reflective of management's ability to increase efficiency of our regulated operations. going forward, we expect changes to our adjusted o&m efficiency ratio related to the impact of the enactment of the tcja and the adoption of new accounting standards in the future.
we evaluate our operating performance using this ratio because we believe it directly measures improvement in the efficiency of our regulated operations. this information is intended to enhance an investor's overall understanding of our operating performance. our adjusted o&m efficiency ratio is not a gaap financial measure and may not be comparable to other companies' operating measures, and should not be used in place of the gaap information provided elsewhere in this form 10-k.
with respect to our adjusted o&m efficiency ratio goal for 2022, we are unable to provide without unreasonable efforts a quantitative reconciliation of each component of this ratio to the most comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with gaap. in calculating the components of the ratio, certain items that may ultimately be excluded would be reflective of events that cannot be reasonably predicted at this time. the unavailable information would include, among other things, the impact of items currently excluded from the calculation of the components, adjustments for weather conditions that exceed a certain threshold of variability and adjustments for events or circumstances that may not be reflective of ongoing operating results. the probable significance of these items is also presently unknown and cannot be reasonably estimated.

tax matters tax cuts and jobs act on december 22, 2017, the tcja was signed into law, which, among other things, enacted significant and complex changes to the internal revenue code of 1986, including a reduction in the maximum u.s. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% as of january 1, 2018, and certain other provisions related specifically to the public utility industry, including continuation of interest expense deductibility, the exclusion from utilizing bonus depreciation and the normalization of deferred income tax. the enactment of the tcja required a re-measurement of our deferred income taxes that materially impacted our 2017 results of operations and financial position. the portion of this re-measurement related to our regulated businesses was substantially offset by a regulatory liability, as we believe it is probable that the deferred income tax excesses created by the tcja will be refunded to customers in future rates. the remaining portion of this re-measurement of the net deferred income tax liability was recorded as a non-cash charge to earnings of $125 million during the fourth quarter of 2017.
other tax matters on april 11, 2017, the state of new york enacted legislation that increased the state income tax rate on our taxable income attributable to new york. this legislation eliminated the production of water as a qualified manufacturing activity in new york, which effectively increased the state income tax rate in new york. as a result of the legislative change, we were required to re-measure our cumulative deferred income tax balances using the higher state income tax rate in the second quarter of 2017. this change in legislation was the primary cause of an increase to our unitary deferred income tax liability of $11 million. the portion of this increase related to our new york subsidiary calculated on a stand-alone basis was $7 million, and was offset by a regulatory asset, as we believe it is probable of recovery in future rates. the remaining increase in the deferred income tax liability was calculated through state tax apportionment rates and recorded at the consolidated level, resulting in a non-cash, cumulative charge to earnings of $4 million during the second quarter of 2017.
on july 7, 2017, the state of illinois enacted legislation that increased, effective july 1, 2017, the state income tax rate on our taxable income attributable to illinois from 7.75% to 9.5%. as a result of the legislative change, we were required to re-measure our cumulative deferred income tax balances using the higher state income tax rate in the third quarter of 2017. this change in legislation was the primary cause of an increase to our unitary deferred income tax liability of $7 million. the portion of this increase related to our illinois subsidiary calculated on a stand-alone basis was $4 million, and was offset by a regulatory asset, as we believe it is probable of recovery in future rates. the remaining increase in the deferred income tax liability was recorded at the consolidated level, resulting in a non-cash, cumulative charge to earnings of $3 million during the third quarter of 2017.

operating revenues in 2017, operating revenues increased $55 million, or 1.7%, primarily due to a:
•   $87 million increase in our regulated businesses principally due to authorized rate increases to fund infrastructure investment growth, as well as acquisitions and organic growth, offset in part by lower water services demand in 2017, including a $15 million reduction due to warmer weather in 2016; partially offset by a
•   $29 million decrease in our market-based businesses mainly due to lower capital upgrades in our military services group, driven largely by reduced military base budgets, offset in part by incremental revenues in our homeowner services group from contract growth and price increases, and in keystone from an increase in operations as a result of market recovery in the natural gas industry.
in 2016, operating revenues increased $143 million, or 4.5%, primarily due to a:
•   $128 million increase in our regulated businesses principally due to authorized rate increases to fund infrastructure investment growth, as well as acquisitions and organic growth; and a
•   $17 million increase in our market-based businesses mainly due to our acquisition of keystone in the third quarter of 2015 and incremental revenues from our homeowner services and contract operations groups from contract growth, partially offset by lower capital upgrades in our military services group.
operation and maintenance in 2017, operation and maintenance expense decreased $126 million, or 8.4%, primarily due to a:
•   $85 million decrease in our regulated businesses principally due to a $65 million net charge recorded in 2016, resulting from the binding global agreement in principle to settle claims associated with the freedom industries chemical spill in west virginia, and a $22 million benefit recorded in 2017, resulting from a related insurance settlement with one of our general liability insurance carriers; and a
51
•   $35 million decrease in our market-based businesses mainly due to lower capital upgrades in our military services group, as discussed above, partially offset by higher employee-related costs from growth in keystone and increased customer uncollectible expense in homeowner services from contract growth during 2017.
in 2016, operation and maintenance expense increased $100 million, or 7.1%, primarily due to a:
•   $81 million increase in our regulated businesses principally due to a $65 million charge recorded in 2016, resulting from the binding global agreement in principle to settle claims associated with the freedom industries chemical spill in west virginia, as well as higher employee-related costs and litigation expenses, partially offset by lower casualty insurance and customer uncollectible expense; and an
•   $14 million increase in our market-based businesses which included $11 million from our acquisition of keystone in the third quarter of 2015, as well as incremental costs associated with growth in our homeowner services and contract operations group, partially offset by lower capital upgrades in our military services group, as discussed above.
depreciation and amortization in 2017 and 2016, depreciation and amortization expense increased $22 million and $30 million, or 4.7% and 6.8%, respectively. the increase for both periods was primarily due to additional utility plant placed in service. included in 2017 was the impact of revised depreciation rates from a depreciation study approved by the icc in our illinois subsidiary, resulting in lower depreciation expense of $16 million. included in 2016 was incremental depreciation and amortization expense resulting from our acquisition of keystone in the third quarter of 2015.
general taxes in 2017 and 2016, general taxes increased $1 million and $15 million, or 0.4% and 6.2%, respectively. the increase in 2016 was primarily due to incremental property and gross receipts taxes in our regulated businesses.
gain on asset dispositions and purchases in 2017 and 2016, gain on asset dispositions and purchases increased $6 million and $7 million, or 60.0% and 233.3%, respectively. the increase in 2017 was primarily due to a $7 million gain recognized on a land sale in our kentucky subsidiary. the increase in 2016 was largely attributable to a gains recognized on a land sale in our pennsylvania subsidiary and an acquisition in our missouri subsidiary.
other income (expense)
in 2017 and 2016, other expenses increased $22 million and $17 million, or 7.1% and 5.8%, respectively. the increase in 2017 was primarily due to an increase in interest expense from the issuance of incremental long-term debt in 2017 and the fourth quarter of 2016, as well as a $6 million charge resulting from the early extinguishment of debt at the parent company. the increase in 2016 was largely attributable to an increase in interest expense from the issuance of incremental long-term debt, as well as an increase in short-term interest expense, mainly due to higher levels of short-term borrowings during 2016, coupled with an increase in the average short-term borrowing rates in 2016, as compared to the prior year.
provision for income taxes in 2017, our provision for income taxes increased by $184 million, or 60.9%, from the previous year. the increase is primarily due to higher pretax income and a non-cash, after-tax re-measurement charge of $125 million, resulting from the impact of the change in the federal tax rate on the company's deferred income taxes from the enactment of the tcja, which included a reduction in the maximum u.s. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%. the $125 million charge includes $6 million allocated to our regulated businesses segment, $5 million to our market-based businesses and $114 million to our other segment. in 2016, our provision for income taxes decreased $4 million, or 1.3%, from the previous year. this decrease was primarily due to the decrease in pre-tax income. the effective tax rates were 53.3%, 39.2% and 39.1% for the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
as of december 31, 2017, we've recognized federal nol carryforwards of $1.05 billion. the tcja eliminated the bonus depreciation deduction for property acquired or constructed after september 27, 2017, and we currently expect to utilize the benefits of our federal nol carryforwards over the next two years. see note 13-income taxes in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information.

segment results of operations our segments are determined based on how we assess performance and allocate resources. we evaluate the performance of our segments and allocate resources based on several factors, with the primary measure being net income attributable to common stockholders. the majority of our business is conducted through our regulated businesses reportable segment. we also operate several market-based businesses that provide a broad range of related and complementary water and wastewater services within four operating segments that individually do not meet the criteria of a reportable segment in accordance with gaap. these four, non-reportable operating segments are collectively presented as our market-based businesses, which is consistent with how management assesses the results of these businesses.

note:   the correlation between water revenues and billed water volumes shown in the preceding tables is impacted by the california drought. in 2015, and to a lesser extent in 2016, california experienced a severe drought. in april 2015, the governor mandated water usage restrictions to reduce overall water usage by 25% in the state compared to 2013 levels. in april 2017, the mandated water usage restrictions were removed. in california, revenue is decoupled from sales volume through the wram/mcba, aligning our water conservation goals with those of the state and our customers, and therefore usage reductions do not impact earnings.
in 2017, operating revenues increased $87 million, or 3.0%, primarily due to a:
•   $81 million increase from authorized rate increases, including infrastructure surcharges, principally to fund investment growth in various states;
•   $43 million increase attributable to water and wastewater acquisitions, as well as organic growth in existing systems; and a
•   $9 million increase resulting from higher wastewater treatment volumes and an increase in private fire service connections; partially offset by a
•   $48 million decrease due to lower water services demand, including a $15 million reduction due to warmer weather in 2016.
in 2016, operating revenues increased $128 million, or 4.7%, primarily due to a:
•   $92 million increase from authorized rate increases, including infrastructure surcharges, principally to fund investment growth in various states;
•   $19 million increase attributable to water and wastewater acquisitions, as well as organic growth in existing systems;
•   $4 million increase resulting from higher wastewater treatment volumes and an increase in private fire service connections; and
•   $13 million increase mainly due to revenues from balancing accounts, primarily in our california subsidiary, as well as surcharges and other adjustments.

in 2017, production costs increased $10 million, or 3.5%, primarily due to a:

•   $2 million increase in fuel and power largely attributable to higher system delivery of water and supplier price increases in our missouri and california subsidiaries; and
•   $2 million increase in waste disposal mainly due to higher sludge removal costs in our illinois and missouri subsidiaries.
in 2016, production costs increased $6 million, or 2.1%, primarily due to a:
•   $5 million increase in purchased water principally due to price increases in our california subsidiary; and a
•   $4 million increase in waste disposal largely attributable to higher sludge removal costs in several of our subsidiaries; partially offset by a
•   $2 million decrease in fuel and power mainly due to a price decrease in our new jersey subsidiary.

in 2017, operating supplies and services decreased $3 million, or 1.4%, primarily due to a:
•   $9 million decrease in other principally due to charges recorded in 2016, including a $5 million write-off of timekeeping system costs that were previously capitalized and a $7 million judgment in litigation; partially offset by a
•   $4 million increase in office supplies and services largely attributable to higher employee relocation, telecommunication and office supplies expense.
in 2016, operating supplies and services increased $18 million, or 9.3%, primarily due to a:
•   $17 million increase in other principally due to a $5 million write-off of timekeeping system costs that were previously capitalized and a $7 million judgment in litigation, both recorded in 2016, and a $3 million adjustment recorded in 2015 to recognize previously expensed business transformation costs as a regulatory asset in our california subsidiary, resulting from a rate case decision.
maintenance materials and supplies in 2017, maintenance materials and supplies decreased $3 million, or 4.1%, primarily due to lower tank painting expense in our new jersey subsidiary and the timing of maintenance activities.

customer billing and accounting in 2017 and 2016, customer billing and accounting decreased $3 million and $9 million, or 5.6% and 14.3%, respectively. the decrease in both years was primarily due to lower customer uncollectible expense attributable to focused collection efforts.
other in 2017, other operation and maintenance decreased $89 million, or 84.0%, primarily due to a:
•   $65 million net charge recorded in 2016, resulting from the binding global agreement in principle to settle claims associated with the freedom industries chemical spill in west virginia, and a $22 million benefit recorded in 2017, resulting from a related insurance settlement with one of our general liability insurance carriers; and

•   $11 million increase in our contract operations group largely attributable to contract growth, specifically from our contract in camden, new jersey; partially offset by a
•   $21 million decrease in our military services group principally due to lower capital upgrades in 2016, offset in part by incremental revenues from the addition of the vandenberg air force base contract in 2016.

in 2017, operation and maintenance expense decreased $35 million, or 9.4%, primarily due to a:

liquidity and capital resources we regularly evaluate and monitor our cash requirements for capital investments, acquisitions, operations, commitments, debt maturities, interest and dividends. our business is capital intensive, with a majority of this capital funded by cash flows from operations. when necessary, we also obtain funds from external sources, primarily in the debt markets and through short-term commercial paper borrowings. we also have access to equity capital markets, if needed. our access to external financing on reasonable terms depends on our credit ratings and current business conditions, including that of the utility and water utility industries in general, as well as conditions in the debt or equity capital markets, and the national and international economic and geopolitical arenas. if these business, market, financial and other conditions deteriorate to the extent that we no longer are able to access the capital markets on reasonable terms, we have access to an unsecured revolving credit facility with aggregate bank commitments of $1.75 billion, with an expiration date of june 2020 (subject to extension by us for up to two one-year periods). we rely on this revolving credit facility and the capital markets to fulfill our short-term liquidity needs, to issue letters of credit and to support our $1.6 billion commercial paper program. disruptions in the credit markets may discourage lenders from extending the terms of such commitments or agreeing to new commitments. market disruptions may also limit our ability to issue debt and equity securities in the capital markets. see "credit facilities and short-term debt" for further discussion.
58
in order to meet our short-term liquidity needs, we, through awcc, our wholly owned financing subsidiary, issue commercial paper, which is supported by the revolving credit facility. as of december 31, 2017, awcc had no outstanding borrowings and $84 million of outstanding letters of credit under its revolving credit facility, with $1.75 billion available to fulfill our short-term liquidity needs and to issue letters of credit, which supported $905 million in outstanding commercial paper. we believe that our ability to access the capital markets, our revolving credit facility and our cash flows from operations will generate sufficient cash to fund our short-term requirements. we have no plans to issue equity under normal operating conditions in the foreseeable future with the limited exception of privately or investor-owned acquisitions whose sellers require equity as necessary to complete the acquisition. we believe we have sufficient liquidity and the ability to manage our expenditures, should there be a disruption of the capital and credit markets. however, we can provide no assurances that the lenders will meet their existing commitments to awcc under the revolving credit facility or that we will be able to access the commercial paper or loan markets in the future on terms acceptable to us or at all.
in addition, our regulated subsidiaries receive advances and contributions from customers, home builders and real estate developers to fund construction necessary to extend service to new areas. advances for construction are refundable for limited periods, which vary according to state regulations, as new customers begin to receive service or other contractual obligations are fulfilled. amounts which are no longer refundable are reclassified to contributions in aid of construction. utility plant funded by advances and contributions is excluded from our regulated businesses rate base. generally, we depreciate contributed property and amortize contributions in aid of construction at the composite rate of the related property. some of our subsidiaries do not depreciate contributed property, based upon regulatory guidelines. the taxability of advances and contributions in aid of construction was changed with the enactment of the tcja. previously, the majority of advances and contributions that we collected were not taxable however, with the enactment of the tcja, they will be taxable going forward. regulatory treatment for advances and contributions under the tcja has not yet been defined and we are working with our regulatory jurisdictions to determine impacts to the company and our customers.
we use our capital resources, including cash, primarily to: (i) fund operating and capital requirements; (ii) pay interest and meet debt maturities; (iii) pay dividends; (iv) fund acquisitions; and (v) fund pension and postretirement benefit obligations. we invest a significant amount of cash on regulated capital projects where we expect to earn a long-term return on investment. additionally, we operate in rate regulated environments in which the amount of new investment recovery may be limited, and where such recovery generally takes place over an extended period of time, and certain capital recovery is also subject to regulatory lag. see item 1-business-regulated businesses-economic regulation and rate making. we expect to fund future maturities of long-term debt through a combination of external debt and, to the extent available, cash flows from operations. since we expect our capital investments over the next few years to be greater than our cash flows from operating activities, we have no plans to reduce debt significantly. if necessary, we may delay certain capital investments or other funding requirements, or pursue financing from other sources to preserve liquidity. in this event, we believe we can rely upon cash flows from operations to meet our obligations and fund our minimum required capital investments for an extended period of time.
with the enactment of the tcja and the reduction of the u.s. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, we anticipate a decrease in future revenue authorizations associated with our regulated businesses, initially leading to lower cash flows. we expect this cash flow impact to decline over time, as our regulated businesses' rate base grows, the result of lower deferred income tax liabilities, which offset rate base. the lower deferred income tax liabilities are mainly due to: (i) a lower u.s. federal corporate income tax rate; (ii) the normalization (refunding to customers) of the re-measured deferred income tax liabilities over the remaining life of the associated assets; and (iii) the loss of future bonus depreciation deductions on capital projects that began after september 27, 2017.
cash flows provided by operating activities cash flows provided by operating activities primarily result from the sale of water and wastewater services and, due to the seasonality of demand, are generally greater during the warmer months. our future cash flows provided by operating activities will be affected by, among other things: economic utility regulation; inflation; compliance with environmental, health and safety standards; production costs; customer growth; declining customer usage of water; employee-related costs, including pension funding; weather and seasonality; taxes; and overall economic conditions.
we expect that the enactment of the tcja to be accretive to our consolidated earnings over time through: (i) growth in rate base for the same level of expected capital expenditures due to the impact of the lower u.s. federal corporate income tax rate and the re-measurement of our deferred income tax assets and liabilities; (ii) increased earnings in our market-based businesses due to the lower u.s. federal corporate income tax rate; all partially offset by (iii) the impact of increased debt due to lower cash flows from operations. we believe that we will likely begin paying federal income taxes towards the end of 2019, when we expect our federal nol carryforwards balance will be fully benefited or used, and expect to be a full cash taxpayer by 2020, although this timing could be impacted by any significant changes in our future results of operations and the outcome of regulatory proceedings regarding the tcja.
59
cash flows provided by operating activities have been a reliable, steady source of funding, sufficient to meet operating requirements, make our dividend payments and fund a portion of our capital expenditure requirements. we expect to seek access to debt capital markets to meet the balance of our capital expenditure requirements as needed. we also have access to equity capital markets, if needed. operating cash flows can be negatively affected by changes in our rate regulated environments or changes in our customers' economic outlook and ability to pay for service in a timely manner. as such, our working capital needs are primarily limited to funding increases in customer accounts receivable and unbilled revenues, mainly associated with revenue increases in our regulated businesses. we can provide no assurance that our customers' historical payment pattern will continue in the future. sometimes our current liabilities exceed current assets because of our debt due within one year and the periodic use of short-term debt as a funding source, primarily to meet scheduled maturities of long-term debt, as well as cash needs which can fluctuate significantly due to the seasonality of the business, stage of our acquisitions and construction projects. we address cash timing differences through the aforementioned liquidity funding mechanisms.

(b)   changes in working capital include changes to receivables and unbilled revenues, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, and other current assets and liabilities, net.
in 2017, cash flows provided by operating activities increased $160 million, primarily due to an increase in net income after non-cash adjustments, including the impact of the enactment of the tcja, and an increase in cash flows from working capital. the main factors contributing to the net income increase are described in the "consolidated results of operations" section and include higher operating revenues, partially offset by higher income taxes due to a $125 million re-measurement charge resulting from the impact of the change in the federal tax rate on the company's deferred income taxes from the enactment of the tcja. the increase in non-cash activities was mainly attributable to the increase in deferred income taxes, as mentioned above, and an increase in depreciation and amortization due to additional utility plant placed in service. the change in working capital was principally due to: (i) the timing of accounts payable and accrued liabilities, including the accrual recorded during 2016 for the binding global agreement in principle to settle claims associated with the freedom industries chemical spill in west virginia; (ii) a decrease in unbilled revenues as a result of our military services group achieving significant capital project milestones during 2016; and (iii) a change in other current assets and liabilities, including the decrease in other current assets associated with the termination of our four forward starting swap agreements and timing of payments clearing our cash accounts.
in 2016, cash flows provided by operations increased $94 million, primarily due to an increase in net income after non-cash adjustments, including the impact of the binding global agreement in principle to settle claims associated with the freedom industries chemical spill in west virginia, and an increase in cash flows from working capital. the main factors contributing to the net income increase are described in the "consolidated results of operations" section and include higher operating revenues, partially offset by higher o&m expenses. the increase in non-cash activities was mainly attributable to an increase in depreciation and amortization due to additional utility plant placed in service. the change in working capital was principally due to: (i) a change in accounts receivable and unbilled revenues resulting from continuous improvement in our regulated businesses' collection efforts, as well as a decrease in unbilled revenues in our military services group attributable to lower capital upgrades in 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015; (ii) the timing of accounts payable and accrued liabilities; and (iii) a change in other current assets and liabilities.
the company expects to make pension and postretirement contributions to the plan trusts up to $45 million in 2018. in addition, we estimate that contributions will amount to $47 million, $47 million, $51 million and $58 million in 2019, 2020, 2021 and 2022, respectively. actual amounts contributed could change materially from these estimates as a result of changes in assumptions and actual investment returns, among other factors.

in 2017 and 2016, cash flows used in investing activities increased primarily due to an increase in our regulated capital expenditures, principally from incremental investments associated with the replacement and renewal of our transmission and distribution infrastructure in our regulated businesses.
our infrastructure investment plan consists of both infrastructure renewal programs, where we replace infrastructure, as needed, and major capital investment projects, where we construct new water and wastewater treatment and delivery facilities to meet new customer growth and water quality regulations. our projected capital expenditures and other investments are subject to periodic review and revision to reflect changes in economic conditions and other factors.
the following table provides a summary of our historical capital expenditures related to the upgrading of our infrastructure and systems:

in 2017, our capital expenditures increased $123 million, or 9.4%, primarily due to investment in our general structure and equipment and wastewater categories. in 2016, our capital expenditures increased $151 million, or 13.0%, principally due to investment across the majority of our infrastructure categories.
we also grow our business through acquisitions of water and wastewater systems, as well as other water-related services. these acquisitions are complementary to our existing business and support continued geographical diversification and growth of our operations. generally, acquisitions are funded initially with short-term debt, and later refinanced with the proceeds from long-term debt.
the following provides a summary of the acquisitions and dispositions affecting our cash flows from investing activities:
2017:
•   the majority of cash paid for acquisitions pertained to the $159 million purchase of the mckeesport system, excluding a $5 million non-escrowed deposit made in 2016.
•   paid $18 million for 16 water and wastewater systems, excluding the mckeesport system and shorelands (a stock transaction), representing approximately 7,000 customers.
•   received $15 million for the sale of assets and securities.
2016:
•   paid $199 million for 15 water and wastewater systems, representing approximately 42,000 customers.
•   made a non-escrowed deposit of $5 million related to the mckeesport system acquisition.
61
•   received $9 million for the sale of assets and securities.
2015:
•   paid $133 million for the acquisition of our 95% interest in water solutions holdings, llc, the parent company of keystone.
•   paid $64 million for 14 water and wastewater systems, representing approximately 24,000 customers.
•   received $5 million for the sale of assets and securities.
as previously noted, we expect to invest between $8.0 billion to $8.6 billion from 2018 to 2022, with $7.2 billion of this range for infrastructure improvements in our regulated businesses. in 2018, we expect to invest between $1.6 billion to $1.8 billion, with a range of $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion for infrastructure improvements in our regulated businesses. also in 2018, we expect to invest between $120 million to $240 million for acquisitions in our regulated businesses, and approximately $100 million for strategic growth opportunities, including the construction of our new corporate headquarters in camden, new jersey, which is expected to be completed during the second half of 2018 and is eligible for tax credits from new jersey's economic development authority.
cash flows from financing activities our financing activities, primarily focused on funding infrastructure construction expenditures, include the issuance of long-term and short-term debt, primarily through awcc. in addition, new infrastructure may be funded with customer advances and contributions in aid of construction, net of refunds, which amounted to $28 million, $16 million and $26 million for the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. based on the needs of our regulated businesses and the company, awcc may borrow funds or issue its debt in the capital markets and then, through intercompany loans, provide those borrowings to the regulated businesses and the parent company. the regulated businesses and the parent company are obligated to pay their portion of the respective principal and interest to awcc, in the amount necessary to enable awcc to meet its debt service obligations. the parent company's borrowings are not a source of capital for the regulated businesses, therefore, the parent company is not able to recover the interest charges on its debt through regulated water and wastewater rates. as of december 31, 2017, awcc has made long-term fixed rate loans and commercial paper loans to our regulated businesses amounting to $3.9 billion and $586 million, respectively. additionally, as of december 31, 2017, awcc has made long-term fixed rate loans and commercial paper loans to the parent company amounting $1.6 billion and $319 million, respectively.
on august 10, 2017, awcc completed a $1.35 billion debt offering which included the sale of $600 million aggregate principal amount of its 2.95% senior notes due 2027, and $750 million aggregate principal amount of its 3.75% senior notes due in 2047. at the closing of the offering, awcc received, after deduction of underwriting discounts and debt issuance costs, $1.33 billion. on september 13, 2017, awcc used proceeds from the offering to prepay $138 million of its outstanding 5.62% series c senior notes due december 21, 2018 ("series c senior notes") and $181 million of its outstanding 5.77% series d senior notes due december 21, 2021 ("series d senior notes"). awcc also used the proceeds of this offering to repay commercial paper obligations and for general corporate purposes, and subsequently, on october 15, 2017, to repay at maturity, $524 million of its 6.085% senior notes.
as a result of awcc's prepayment of the series c senior notes and the series d senior notes, and payment of a make-whole premium amount to the holders thereof of $34 million, we recorded a $6 million charge resulting from the early extinguishment of debt at the parent company. substantially all of the early debt extinguishment costs allocable to the regulated businesses were recorded as regulatory assets for we believe they are probable of recovery in future rates. approximately $1 million of the early debt extinguishment costs allocable to the regulated businesses were amortized in 2017.
one of the principal market risks to which the company is exposed is changes in interest rates. in order to manage the exposure, we follow risk management policies and procedures, including the use of derivative contracts such as swaps. we reduce exposure to interest rates by managing commercial paper and debt maturities. we do not enter into derivative contracts for speculative purposes and do not use leveraged instruments. the derivative contracts entered into are for periods consistent with the related underlying exposures. the company is exposed to the risk that counterparties to derivative contracts will fail to meet their contractual obligations. we minimize the counterparty credit risk on these transactions by only dealing with leading, credit-worthy financial institutions, having long-term credit ratings of "a" or better.
on august 7, 2017, coinciding with awcc's $1.35 billion debt offering, we terminated four existing forward starting swap agreements with an aggregate notional amount of $300 million, realizing a gain of $19 million to be amortized through interest, net, over 30 years. on february 8, 2017, and december 11, 2017, we entered into forward starting swap agreements, each with notional amounts of $100 million, to reduce interest rate exposure on debt expected to be issued in 2018. these forward starting swap agreements terminate in november 2018, and have an average fixed rate of 2.59%. we have designated these forward starting swap agreements as cash flow hedges, with their fair values recorded in accumulated other comprehensive gain or loss. upon termination, the cumulative gain or loss recorded in accumulated other comprehensive gain or loss will be amortized through interest, net, over the term of the new debt.
62
in october 2017, we terminated our interest-rate swap to hedge $100 million of its 6.085% senior notes maturing in the fourth quarter of 2017. the company paid variable interest of six-month libor plus 3.422%, and had designated this interest rate swap as a fair value hedge, accounted for at fair value with gains or losses, as well as the offsetting gains or losses on the hedged item, recognized in interest, net. the net gain and loss recognized by the company was de minimis for the periods ended december 31, 2017 and 2016.
in may 2015, the parent company and awcc filed with the sec, a universal shelf registration statement that enables us to meet our capital needs through the offer and sale to the public from time to time of an unlimited amount of various types of securities, including american water common stock, preferred stock, and other equity and hybrid securities, and awcc debt securities, all subject to market conditions and demand, general economic conditions, and as applicable, rating status. the shelf registration will expire in may 2018. during 2017, 2016 and 2015, $1.35 billion, $550 million and $550 million, respectively, of debt securities were issued pursuant to this registration statements.

from time to time and as market conditions warrant, we may engage in long-term debt retirements through tender offers, open market repurchases or other viable alternatives to strengthen our balance sheets.
in february 2015, our board of directors authorized an anti-dilutive, common stock repurchase program to mitigate the effect of shares issued through our dividend reinvestment, employee stock purchase and executive compensation activities. the program allows the company to purchase up to 10 million shares of its outstanding common stock, over an unrestricted period of time, in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions. the program is conducted in accordance with rule 10b-18 of the exchange act, and to facilitate the repurchases, we have also entered into rule 10b5-1 share repurchase plans with a third-party broker, which allows us to repurchase shares at times when we may otherwise be prevented from doing so under insider trading laws or because of self-imposed trading blackout periods. subject to applicable regulations, we may elect to amend or cancel this repurchase program or the share repurchase parameters at our discretion. as of december 31, 2017, we have repurchased an aggregate of 3,950,000 shares of common stock under this program.

credit facilities and short-term debt we have an unsecured revolving credit facility of $1.75 billion that expires in june 2020. in march 2016, and under the terms of the revolving credit agreement dated june 30, 2015, awcc exercised its right to increase its borrowing capacity available under our revolving credit facility from the aggregate maximum of $1.25 billion, to $1.75 billion. all other terms, conditions and covenants with respect to the existing facility remained unchanged. on june 30, 2015, awcc and its lenders extended the termination date of the revolving credit facility from october 2018, to june 2020. this amended and restated agreement also allowed awcc to request to extend further the term of the credit facility for up to two one-year periods. an extension request must satisfy certain conditions and receive approval of the lenders, as set forth in the revolving credit agreement.
interest rates on advances under the facility are based on a credit spread to the eurodollar rate or base rate in accordance with awcc's then-applicable moody investors service or standard & poor's ratings services credit rating. at current ratings, that spread would be 0.90%. the facility is used principally to support awcc's commercial paper program and to provide up to $150 million in letters of credit. indebtedness under the facility is considered "debt" for purposes of a support agreement between the company and awcc, which serves as a functional equivalent of a guarantee by the company of awcc's payment obligations under the credit facility.
awcc also has an outstanding commercial paper program that is backed by the revolving credit facility, the maximum aggregate outstanding amount of which was increased on march 22, 2016, from $1.0 billion to $1.6 billion.
keystone has its own line of credit facility with a maximum availability of up to $12 million, the actual amount of which is determined pursuant to a collateral base calculation. borrowings under this facility are payable upon demand with interest being paid monthly. interest accrues each day at a rate per annum equal to 2.75% above the greater of the one month or one day libor. the borrowing base under the facility allows for financing up to the greater of the note or 80% of eligible accounts receivable. based on the collateral assets at december 31, 2017, $7 million was available to borrow. at december 31, 2017, there were no outstanding borrowings.
the following table summarizes information regarding the company's aggregate credit facility commitments, letter of credit sub-limits and available funds under those revolving credit facilities, as well as outstanding amounts of commercial paper and outstanding borrowings under the respective facilities as of december 31, 2017 and 2016:

december 31, 2016               1,766                   1,668           150                                         62                1,600         751
the weighted-average interest rate on awcc short-term borrowings for the years ended december 31, 2017 and 2016 was approximately 1.24% and 0.78%, respectively.
capital structure the following table indicates the percentage of our capitalization represented by the components of our capital structure as of december 31:
2017                                                                                  2016          2015
total common stockholders' equity                                   41.0   %      42.1   %      43.5   %
long-term debt and redeemable preferred stock at redemption value   49.6   %      46.4   %      50.6   %
short-term debt and current portion of long-term debt                9.4   %      11.5   %       5.9   %
total                                                                100   %       100   %       100   %
the changes in the capital structure between periods were mainly attributable to an increase in the current portion of long-term debt.
debt covenants our debt agreements contain financial and non-financial covenants. to the extent that we are not in compliance with these covenants, an event of default may occur under one or more debt agreements and we or our subsidiaries may be restricted in our ability to pay dividends, issue new debt or access our revolving credit facility. our long-term debt indentures contain a number of covenants that, among other things, prohibit or restrict the company from issuing debt secured by the company's assets, subject to certain exceptions. our failure to comply with any of these covenants could accelerate repayment obligations.
65
covenants in certain long-term notes and the revolving credit facility require us to maintain a ratio of consolidated debt to consolidated capitalization (as defined in the relevant documents) of not more than 0.70 to 1.00. on december 31, 2017, our ratio was 0.59 to 1.00 and therefore we were in compliance with the covenants.
security ratings our access to the capital markets, including the commercial paper market, and respective financing costs in those markets, may be directly affected by our securities ratings. we primarily access the debt capital markets, including the commercial paper market, through awcc. however, we have also issued debt through our regulated subsidiaries, primarily in the form of tax exempt securities or borrowings under state revolving funds, to lower our overall cost of debt.
the following table presents our long-term and short-term credit rating and rating outlook as of february 20, 2018:
securities              moody's investors service   standard &amp; poor's ratings service rating outlook          negative                    stable senior unsecured debt   a3                          a commercial paper        p-2                         a-1
on january 19, 2018, moody's investors service changed the rating outlooks to negative, from stable, for 24 regulated utilities and utility holding companies, including the company, all of which were primarily impacted by enactment of the tcja. a security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency, and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. security ratings are highly dependent upon our ability to generate cash flows in an amount sufficient to service our debt and meet our investment plans. we can provide no assurances that our ability to generate cash flows is sufficient to maintain our existing ratings. none of our borrowings are subject to default or prepayment as a result of the downgrading of these security ratings, although such a downgrading could increase fees and interest charges under our credit facility.
as part of the normal course of business, we routinely enter into contracts for the purchase and sale of water, energy, chemicals and other services. these contracts either contain express provisions or otherwise permit us and our counterparties to demand adequate assurance of future performance when there are reasonable grounds for doing so. in accordance with the contracts and applicable contract law, if we are downgraded by a credit rating agency, especially if such downgrade is to a level below investment grade, it is possible that a counterparty would attempt to rely on such a downgrade as a basis for making a demand for adequate assurance of future performance, which could include a demand that we provide collateral to secure our obligations. we do not expect to post any collateral which will have a material adverse impact on the company's results of operations, financial position or cash flows.
dividends our board of directors authorizes the payment of dividends. our ability to pay dividends on our common stock is subject to having access to sufficient sources of liquidity, the net income and cash flows of our subsidiaries, the receipt of dividends and repayments of indebtedness from our subsidiaries, compliance with delaware corporate and other laws, compliance with the contractual provisions of debt and other agreements, and other factors. the company's dividend rate on its common stock is determined by the board of directors on a quarterly basis and takes into consideration, among other factors, current and possible future developments that may affect the company's income and cash flows. historically, dividends have been paid quarterly to holders of record less than 30 days prior to the distribution date. since the dividends on our common stock are not cumulative, only declared dividends are paid.
during 2017, 2016 and 2015, we paid $289 million, $261 million and $239 million in cash dividends, respectively. the following table summarizes the per share cash dividends paid for the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015:
2017                        2016                2015
december       $0.415              $0.375             $0.34
september      $0.415              $0.375             $0.34
june           $0.415              $0.375             $0.34
march          $0.375               $0.34             $0.31
on december 8, 2017, our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend payment of $0.415 per share payable on march 1, 2018, to stockholders of record as of february 7, 2018.

regulatory restrictions the issuance by the company or awcc of long-term debt or equity securities does not require authorization of any state puc if no guarantee or pledge of the regulated subsidiaries is utilized. however, state puc authorization is required to issue long-term debt at most of our regulated subsidiaries. our regulated subsidiaries normally obtain the required approvals on a periodic basis to cover their anticipated financing needs for a period of time or in connection with a specific financing.
under applicable law, our subsidiaries can pay dividends only from retained, undistributed or current earnings. a significant loss recorded at a subsidiary may limit the dividends that the subsidiary can distribute to us. furthermore, the ability of our subsidiaries to pay upstream dividends or repay indebtedness to american water is subject to compliance with applicable regulatory restrictions and financial obligations, including, for example, debt service and preferred and preference stock dividends, as well as applicable corporate, tax and other laws and regulations, and other agreements or covenants made or entered into by american water and its subsidiaries.
insurance coverage we carry various property, casualty and financial insurance policies with limits, deductibles and exclusions that we believe are consistent with industry standards. however, insurance coverage may not be adequate or available to cover unanticipated losses or claims. additionally, annual policy renewals can be impacted by claims experience which in turn can impact coverage terms and conditions on a going forward basis. we are self-insured to the extent that losses are within the policy deductible or exceed the amount of insurance maintained. such losses could have a material adverse effect on our short-term and long-term financial condition and our results of operations and cash flows.
contractual obligations and commitments we enter into contractual obligations with third parties in the ordinary course of business. information related to our contractual obligations as of december 31, 2017 is summarized in the table below:

public-private partnerships wvawc has entered into a series of agreements with various public entities, which we refer to as the partners, to establish certain joint ventures, commonly referred to as "public-private partnerships." under the public-private partnerships, wvawc constructed utility plant, financed by wvawc, and the partners constructed utility plant (connected to wvawc's property), financed by the partners. wvawc agreed to transfer and convey some of its real and personal property to the partners in exchange for an equal principal amount of industrial development bonds, commonly referred to as idbs, issued by the partners under a state industrial development bond and commercial development act. wvawc leased back the total facilities, including portions funded by both wvawc and the partners, under leases for a period of 40 years.
the leases have payments that approximate the payments required by the terms of the idbs. these payments are considered "pilot payments" which represent payments that wvawc otherwise would pay as property taxes on the properties. we have presented the transaction on a net basis in the consolidated financial statements. the carrying value of the transferred facilities, which is presented in property, plant and equipment in the consolidated balance sheets, was approximately $150 million as of december 31, 2017.
performance obligations we have entered into agreements for the provision of services to water and wastewater facilities for the united states military, municipalities and other customers. these military services agreements expire between 2051 and 2068 and have remaining performance commitments as measured by estimated remaining contract revenues of $3.6 billion as of december 31, 2017. the operations and maintenance agreements with municipalities and other customers expire between 2018 and 2038 and have remaining performance commitments as measured by estimated remaining contract revenue of $711 million as of december 31, 2017. some of the company's long-term contracts to operate and maintain a municipality's, federal government's or other party's water or wastewater treatment and delivery facilities include responsibility for certain major maintenance for some of the facilities, in exchange for an annual fee.
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires that management apply accounting policies and make estimates, assumptions and judgments that could significantly affect a company's financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. management believes that the areas described below require significant judgment in the application of accounting policy or in making estimates and assumptions in matters that are inherently uncertain and that may change in subsequent periods. accordingly, changes in the estimates, assumptions and judgments applied to these accounting policies could have a significant impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, as reflected in our consolidated financial statements. management has reviewed the critical accounting polices described below with our audit committee, including the estimates, assumptions and judgments used in their application. additional discussion regarding these critical accounting policies and their application can be found in note 2-significant accounting policies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
rate regulation and regulatory accounting our regulated utilities are subject to economic regulation by pucs and, as such, we follow the authoritative accounting principles required for rate regulated utilities, which requires us to reflect the effects of rate regulation in our consolidated financial statements. use of this authoritative guidance is applicable to utility operations that meet the following criteria: (i) third-party regulation of rates; (ii) cost-based rates; and (iii) a reasonable assumption that rates will be set to recover the estimated costs of providing service, plus a return on net investment, or rate base. as of december 31, 2017, we concluded that the operations of our utilities met the criteria.
application of this authoritative guidance has a further effect on our financial statements as it pertains to allowable costs used in the ratemaking process. we make significant assumptions and estimates to quantify amounts recorded as regulatory assets and liabilities. such judgments include, but are not limited to, assets and liabilities related to regulated acquisitions, pension and postretirement benefits, depreciation rates and taxes. due to timing and other differences in the collection of revenues, these authoritative accounting principles allow a cost that would otherwise be charged as an expense by an non-regulated entity, to be deferred as a regulatory asset if it is probable that such cost is recoverable through future rates. conversely, the principles require the creation of a regulatory liability for amounts collected in rates to recover costs expected to be incurred in the future, or amounts collected in excess of costs incurred and are refundable to customers. regulators may also impose certain fines or penalties.
68
for each regulatory jurisdiction where we conduct business, we assess, at the end of each reporting period, whether the regulatory assets and liabilities continue to meet the criteria for probable, future recovery or settlement. this assessment includes consideration of factors such as changes in applicable regulatory environments; recent rate orders on recovery of a specific or similar incurred cost to other regulated entities in the same jurisdiction and the status of any pending or potential legislation that could impact the ability to recover costs through regulated rates. if subsequent events indicate that the regulatory assets or liabilities no longer meet the criteria for probable, future recovery or settlement, our consolidated statements of operations and financial position could be materially affected. in addition, if we conclude in a future period that a separable portion of the business no longer meets the criteria, we are required to eliminate the financial statement effects of regulation for that part of the business, which would include the elimination of any or all regulatory assets and liabilities that had been recorded in the consolidated financial statements. failure to meet the criteria of this authoritative guidance could materially impact our consolidated financial statements.
on december 22, 2017, the tcja was signed into law, which, among other things, enacted significant and complex changes to the internal revenue code of 1986, including a reduction in the maximum u.s. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% as of january 1, 2018. the tcja created significant excess deferred income taxes that the company and its regulatory jurisdictions believe should be refunded to customers. as such, we recorded these amounts as regulatory liabilities. the pucs in our regulatory jurisdictions have opened formal proceedings related to the tcja and we have begun working with our regulators on options to provide the income tax savings to our customers, and to address customer rate impacts and cash flow impacts for the company. the outcome of these proceedings will likely take some time and could vary by regulatory jurisdiction.
as of december 31, 2017 and 2016, our regulatory asset balance was $1.1 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively, and our regulatory liability balance was $1.7 billion and $403 million, respectively. see note 6-regulatory assets and liabilities in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our significant regulatory assets and liabilities.
goodwill as of december 31, 2017 and 2016, our goodwill balance was $1.4 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively. under gaap, goodwill must be allocated at the reporting unit level, which is defined as an operating segment or one level below, and evaluated for impairment minimally, once a year. we perform an annual review for impairment of goodwill as of november 30 of each year, or more frequently if we determine that changes in circumstances or a triggering event that would more likely than not, reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value, has occurred. adverse industry or economic trends, lower projections of profitability, or a sustained decline in our market capitalization, among other things, may be indicators of potential goodwill impairment issues, requiring the testing of the carrying value for recoverability.
entities evaluating goodwill for impairment have the option of first performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether a quantitative assessment is necessary. in performing a qualitative assessment, we assess and makes judgments, among other things, around macroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions, overall financial performance, cost factors and entity specific events. these factors require significant judgment and estimates, and application of alternative assumptions could produce significantly different results. if it is determined, based upon qualitative factors, that the fair value of a reporting unit is more likely than not, greater than its carrying value, no further testing is required. if an entity bypasses the qualitative assessment, or performs the qualitative assessment but determines that the fair value of a reporting unit is more likely than not, less than its carrying value, a two-step, quantitative fair value assessment is performed.
the first step of a quantitative assessment compares the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to its respective net carrying value, including goodwill, on the measurement date. if the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than such reporting unit's carrying value, then the second step of the quantitative assessment is performed to measure the amount of the impairment loss, if any, for such reporting unit.
the second step of a quantitative assessment requires an allocation of fair value to the individual assets and liabilities of the reporting unit, using purchase price allocation accounting guidance in order to determine the implied fair value of goodwill. if the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying value for the reporting unit, an impairment loss is recorded as a reduction to goodwill and a charge to operating expense. application of goodwill impairment testing requires significant management judgment, including the identification of reporting units and determining the fair value of the reporting unit. we estimate fair value using a combination of a discounted cash flow analysis and market multiples analysis. significant assumptions used in these fair value analyses include, but are not limited to, forecasts of future operating results, discount and growth rates, capital expenditures, tax rates, working capital, weighted average cost of capital and projected terminal values. changes in estimates or the application of alternative assumptions could produce significantly different results.
69
at november 30, 2017, we completed qualitative assessments for our regulated businesses, military services group and contract operations group reporting units, and determined that no qualitative factors were present that would indicate the estimated fair values of these reporting units were less than their respective carrying values. as such, we determined that the two-step, quantitative fair value assessment was not necessary for these reporting units as of november 30, 2017.
at november 30, 2017, we completed step one of the two-step, quantitative assessment for our homeowner services group and keystone reporting units, and concluded there were no impairments to their respective goodwill carry values. we used an income approach valuation technique which estimates discounted future cash flows from operations, which relies on a single scenario reflecting the best estimate of projected cash flows. the estimated fair value of the homeowner services group reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by more than 156%. the estimated fair value of the keystone reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by approximately 11%. if further decline in the fair value were to occur, the keystone reporting unit would be at risk of failing step one of the two-step, quantitative assessment. additional discussion regarding our goodwill can be found in note 7-goodwill and other intangible assets in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
impairment of long-lived assets long-lived assets include land, buildings, equipment and long-term investments. other than land and long-term investments, our long-lived assets are depreciated over their estimated useful lives and are reviewed for impairment whenever changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable. such circumstances include, but are not limited to, a significant decrease in the market value of the long-lived asset, a change in the asset's expected useful life or physical condition, a history of operating or cash flow losses associated with the use of the asset or a significant adverse change in the manner in which the asset is being used or is planned to be used. when such events or changes occur, we estimate the fair value of the long-lived asset from future cash flows expected to result from its use and, if applicable, the eventual disposition of the asset, and compare it to the carrying value of the asset. if the carrying value of the long-lived asset is greater than its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized equal to the amount by which carrying value exceeds fair value. key variables that must be estimated include assumptions regarding sales volume, rates, operating costs, labor and other benefit costs, capital additions, assumed discount rates and other economic factors. these variables require significant management judgment and include inherent uncertainties, since they are forecasting future events. a variation in the assumptions used could lead to a different conclusion regarding the realizability of a long-lived asset and, thus, could have a significant effect on our consolidated financial statements.
the long-lived assets of our regulated utilities are grouped on a separate entity basis for impairment testing, as they are integrated state-wide operations that do not have the option to curtail service and generally have uniform tariffs. a regulatory asset is charged to earnings if and when future recovery in rates of that asset is no longer probable. the fair values of our long-term investments are dependent on the financial performance and solvency of the entities in which we invest, as well as volatility inherent in the external markets, all of which are factors that we consider when assessing the potential impairment of these investments. if such long-term investments are considered impaired, an impairment loss is recognized equal to the amount by which the investment's carrying value exceeds its fair value.
revenue recognition revenue for our regulated utilities is recognized as water and wastewater services are delivered to customers and includes amounts billed to customers on a cycle basis, and unbilled amounts which are based on estimated usage from the date of the meter reading associated with the latest customer bill, to the end of the accounting period. increases or decreases in the volumes delivered to customers and rate mix due to changes in usage patterns in customer classes in the period could be significant to the calculation of unbilled revenue. in addition, changes in the timing of meter reading schedules and the number and type of customers scheduled for each meter reading date would also have an effect on the unbilled revenue calculation. unbilled revenue for our regulated utilities as of december 31, 2017 and 2016 was $152 million and $161 million, respectively.
revenues of the market-based businesses are recognized as services are rendered. for certain construction contracts, revenue is recognized over the contract term based on a calculated ratio that compares the costs incurred to date during the period to the total estimated costs for the entire contract. losses on contracts are recognized during the period in which the loss first becomes probable and estimable. revenues recognized during the period in excess of billings on construction contracts are recorded as unbilled revenue. billings in excess of revenues recognized on construction contracts are recorded as other current liabilities on the balance sheet until the recognition criteria are met. changes in contract performance and related estimated contract profitability may result in revisions to costs and revenues and are recognized in the period in which revisions are determined. unbilled revenue for our market-based businesses as of december 31, 2017 and 2016 was $60 million and $102 million, respectively.

accounting for income taxes significant management judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes, primarily due to the uncertainty related to tax positions taken, as well as deferred tax assets and liabilities, valuation allowances and the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards.
in accordance with applicable authoritative guidance, we account for uncertain income tax positions using a benefit recognition model with a two-step approach, including a more-likely-than-not recognition threshold and a measurement approach based on the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. if it is not more-likely-than-not that the benefit of the tax position will be sustained on its technical merits, no benefit is recorded. uncertain tax positions that relate only to timing of when an item is included on a tax return are considered to have met the recognition threshold. management evaluates each position based solely on the technical merits and facts and circumstances of the position, assuming the position will be examined by a taxing authority having full knowledge of all relevant information. significant judgment is required to determine whether the recognition threshold has been met and, if so, the appropriate amount of unrecognized tax benefit to be recorded in the consolidated financial statements.
we evaluate the probability of realizing deferred tax assets quarterly by reviewing a forecast of future taxable income and our intent and ability to implement tax planning strategies, if necessary, to realize deferred tax assets. we also assess our ability to utilize tax attributes, including those in the form of carryforwards, for which the benefits have already been reflected in the financial statements. we record valuation allowances for deferred tax assets when we conclude it is more-likely-than-not such benefit will not be realized in future periods.
under gaap, specifically accounting standards codification ("asc") topic 740, income taxes the tax effects of changes in tax laws must be recognized in the period in which the law is enacted. asc 740 also requires deferred tax assets and liabilities to be measured at the enacted tax rate expected to apply when temporary differences are to be realized or settled. thus, at the date of enactment, the company's deferred taxes were re-measured based upon the new tax rate. for our regulated entities, the change in deferred taxes are recorded as either an offset to a regulatory asset or liability and may be subject to refund to customers. for our unregulated operations, the change in deferred taxes are recorded as a non-cash re-measurement adjustment to earnings.
the staff of the sec has recognized the complexity of reflecting the impacts of changes in tax law, more specifically the tcja, and on december 22, 2017, issued guidance in staff accounting bulletin 118 ("sab 118") which clarifies accounting for income taxes under asc 740 if information is not yet available or complete and provides for up to a one year period in which to complete the required analyses and accounting. sab 118 describes three scenarios or buckets associated with a company's status of accounting for the tcja:(1) a company is complete with its accounting for certain effects of tax reform, (2) a company is able to determine a reasonable estimate for certain effects of tax reform and records that estimate as a provisional amount, or (3) a company is not able to determine a reasonable estimate and therefore continues to apply asc 740, based on the provisions of the tax laws that were in effect immediately prior to the tcja being enacted. the significant assumptions considered and evaluated by the company relating to our accounting for the tcja, include, but are not limited to, the:
•   recording of regulatory liabilities from the re-measurement of the company's deferred income taxes, and the uncertainty of regulatory treatment in our various jurisdictions in which the company currently operates;
•   allocation of interest deductibility at the parent to our subsidiaries;
•   bonus depreciation deductions for assets constructed and placed in service during the period september 28, 2017 through december 31, 2017; and
•   normalization periods for our re-measured deferred taxes.
actual income taxes could vary from estimated amounts due to the future impacts of various items, including changes in income tax laws, our forecasted financial condition and results of operations, failure to successfully implement tax planning strategies, recovery of taxes through the regulatory process for our regulated businesses, as well as results of audits and examinations of filed tax returns by taxing authorities. while we believe the resulting tax balances as of december 31, 2017 and 2016 are appropriately accounted for in accordance with the applicable authoritative guidance, the ultimate outcome of tax matters could result in favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our consolidated financial statements and such adjustments could be material. see note 13-income taxes in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding income taxes.
accounting for pension and postretirement benefits we maintain noncontributory defined benefit pension plans covering eligible employees of our regulated utility and shared service operations. see note 14-employee benefits in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the description of and accounting for the defined benefit pension plans and postretirement benefit plans.

the company's pension and postretirement benefit costs are developed from actuarial valuations. inherent in these valuations are key assumptions provided by the company to its actuaries, including the discount rate and expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. material changes in the company's pension and postretirement benefit costs may occur in the future due to changes in these assumptions as well as fluctuations in plan assets. the assumptions are selected to represent the average expected experience over time and may differ in any one year from actual experience due to changes in capital markets and the overall economy. these differences will impact the amount of pension and other postretirement benefit expense that the company recognizes. the primary assumptions are:
•   discount rate-the discount rate is used in calculating the present value of benefits, which are based on projections of benefit payments to be made in the future. the objective in selecting the discount rate is to measure the single amount that, if invested at the measurement date in a portfolio of high-quality debt instruments, would provide the necessary future cash flows to pay the accumulated benefits when due;
•   expected return on plan assets ("eroa")-management projects the future return on plan assets considering prior performance, but primarily based upon the plans' mix of assets and expectations for the long-term returns on those asset classes. these projected returns reduce the net benefit costs we record currently;
•   rate of compensation increase-management projects employees' pay increases, which are used to project employees' pension benefits at retirement;
•   health care cost trend rate-management projects the expected increases in the cost of health care; and
•   mortality-management retained the society of actuaries rp-2014 mortality table but adopted the new mp-2017 generational projection scale to project mortality improvements after 2006.
the discount rate assumption, which is determined for the pension and postretirement benefit plans independently, is subject to change each year, consistent with changes in applicable high-quality, long-term corporate bond indices. we use an approach that approximates the process of settlement of obligations tailored to the plans' expected cash flows by matching the plans' cash flows to the coupons and expected maturity values of individually selected bonds. the yield curve was developed for a portfolio containing the majority of united states-issued aa-graded non-callable (or callable with make-whole provisions) corporate bonds. for each plan, the discount rate was developed as the level equivalent rate that would yield the same present value as using spot rates aligned with the projected benefit payments. the discount rate for determining pension benefit obligations was 3.75%, 4.28% and 4.66% at december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. the discount rate for determining other post-retirement benefit obligations was 3.73%, 4.26% and 4.67% at december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
in selecting an eroa, we considered tax implications, past performance and economic forecasts for the types of investments held by the plans. the long-term eroa assumption used in calculating pension cost was 6.49% for 2017, 7.02% for 2016, and 6.91% for 2015. the weighted average eroa assumption used in calculating other postretirement benefit costs was 5.09% for 2017, 5.37% for 2016 and 4.92% for 2015.
the asset allocations for the company's u.s. pension plan by asset category were as follows:

during 2017, the company reduced the risk of its investments in the pension plan by reducing its exposure to equities from 60% to 50%, and increasing its long duration fixed-income allocation from 40% to 50%. this new structure is designed to reduce the plan's funded status volatility. it is also intended to reduce the pension plan's exposure to interest rates since a higher proportion of long duration fixed-income securities that have a duration similar to that of the pension liabilities should reduce interest rate risk associated with the plan's liabilities.

the company's other postretirement benefit plans are partially funded. the asset allocations for the company's other postretirement benefit plans by asset category were as follows:
targetallocation                percentage of plan assetsas of december 31, asset category                         2018                      2017                             2016

total                        100          %            100          %                   100          %
the company's target asset allocation, is evaluated periodically through asset liability studies. the studies consider projected cash flows of maturity liabilities, projected asset class returns and risks, correlations, and the company's risk tolerance. in 2017, the company conducted new asset-liability studies for the post-retirement plans and approved new asset allocations for both plans. the post-retirement medical bargaining plan increased its equity allocation from 20% to 30% due to rising medical claims and medical inflation and the long duration portion of the portfolio was reduced from 80% to 70%. the post-retirement non-bargaining medical plan's allocation was adjusted to reduce volatility and interest rate risk in a manner similar to that described above with respect to the pension plan, reducing the equity allocation from 70% to 60% and increasing the fixed-income allocation from 30% to 40%. the post-retirement medical non-bargaining plan's equity allocation was reduced due to the cap on benefits for some non-union participants and the resultant reduction in the plan's liabilities. these changes will be implemented in 2018.
the investments of the pension and postretirement welfare plan trusts include debt and equity securities held either directly or through commingled funds. the trustee for the company's defined benefit pension and postretirement welfare plans uses an independent valuation firm to calculate the fair value of plan assets. additionally, the company independently verifies the assets values. approximately 41% of the assets are valued using the quoted market price for the assets in an active market at the measurement date, while 59% of the assets are valued using other inputs.
in selecting a rate of compensation increase, we consider past experience in light of movements in inflation rates. our rate of compensation increase was 3.02% for 2017, 3.07% for 2016 and 3.10% for 2015.
in selecting health care cost trend rates, we consider past performance and forecasts of increases in health care costs. as of january 1, 2017, our health care cost trend rate assumption used to calculate the periodic cost was 7% in 2017 gradually declining to 5% in 2021 and thereafter. as of december 31, 2017, the company is projecting that medical inflation will continue to persist for longer than expected and, it will ultimately trend down to 4.50%, but not until 2026.
assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the other postretirement benefit plans. the health care cost trend rate is based on historical rates and expected market conditions. a one-percentage-point change in assumed health care cost trend rates would have the following effects:
change in actuarial assumption (dollars in millions)   impact on other                                    impact on 2017
postretirement                                     total service benefit obligation as of december 31, 2017         and interest cost components increase assumed health care cost trend by 1%          $73                                                $5
decrease assumed health care cost trend by 1%          $(60                              )                $(4           )
we will use a discount rate and eroa of 3.75% and 5.95%, respectively, for estimating our 2018 pension costs. additionally, we will use a discount rate and expected blended return based on weighted assets of 3.73% and 4.77%, respectively, for estimating our 2018 other postretirement benefit costs. a decrease in the discount rate or the eroa would increase our pension expense. our 2017 and 2016 pension and postretirement benefit costs were $56 million and $54 million, respectively. the company expects to make pension and postretirement benefit contributions to the plan trusts up to $45 million in 2018, and $47 million, $47 million, $51 million and $58 million in 2019, 2020, 2021 and 2022, respectively. actual amounts contributed could change significantly from these estimates. the assumptions are reviewed annually and at any interim re-measurement of the plan obligations. the impact of assumption changes is reflected in the recorded pension and postretirement benefit amounts as they occur, or over a period of time if allowed under applicable accounting standards. as these assumptions change from period to period, recorded pension and postretirement benefit amounts and funding requirements could also change.

accounting for contingencies we record loss contingencies when management determines that the outcome of future events is probable of occurring and when the amount of the loss or a range of losses can be reasonably estimated. the determination of a loss contingency is based on management judgment and estimates about the likely outcome of the matter, which may include an analysis of different scenarios. liabilities are recorded or adjusted when events or circumstances cause these judgments or estimates to change. in assessing whether a loss is reasonably possible, management considers many factors, which include, but are not limed to: the nature of the litigation, claim or assessment, review of applicable law, opinions or views of legal counsel and other advisors, and the experience gained from similar cases or situations. we provide disclosures for material contingencies when management deems there is a reasonable possibility that a loss or an additional loss may be incurred. we provide estimates of reasonably possible losses when such estimates may be reasonably determined, either as a single amount or within a reasonable range.
actual amounts realized upon settlement of contingencies may be different than amounts recorded and disclosed and could have a significant impact on the liabilities, revenue and expenses recorded on the consolidated financial statements. for a discussion of contingencies, see note 15-commitments and contingencies in the notes to consolidated financial statements.
new accounting standards see note 2-significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements for a description of recent accounting standards.

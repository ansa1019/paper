item 1a.   risk factors.
any of the factors described below could significantly and negatively affect our business, prospects, financial condition, operating results, or credit ratings, which could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline. additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us, or risks that we currently consider immaterial, could also impair our operations or financial condition.
the public announcement of data from our clinical studies, or those of our competitors, or news of any developments related to our, or our competitors', io products or late-stage compounds may cause significant volatility in our stock price and depending on the data, may result in an adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operation. if the development of any of our key io compounds, whether alone or as part of a combination therapy, is delayed or discontinued or a clinical study does not meet one or more of its primary endpoints, our stock price could decline significantly and there may be an adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
we are focusing our efforts and resources in disease areas of high unmet need. with our more focused portfolio, investors are placing heightened scrutiny on some of our products or late-stage compounds. in particular, opdivo is the backbone of our io portfolio. during 2017, we announced multiple regulatory milestones for opdivo, including the early stoppage of certain clinical studies for meeting their endpoints and label expansions for new indications. we have, however, also experienced setbacks and may continue to do so as there are further developments in our clinical studies. in 2018, we expect to receive further data from ongoing clinical studies including checkmate-227, a combination study in the first-line lung cancer setting and decisions from health authorities regarding potential label expansions.
the announcement of data from our clinical studies, or those of our competitors, or news of any developments related to our, or our competitors', io products or late-stage compounds, such as opdivo, may cause significant volatility in our stock price and depending on the news, may result in an adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operation. furthermore, the announcement of any negative or unexpected data or the discontinuation of development of any of our key io compounds, whether alone or as part of a combination therapy, any delay in our anticipated timelines for filing for regulatory approval or a significant advancement of a competitor, may cause our stock price to decline significantly and may have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations. there is no assurance that data from our clinical studies will support filings for regulatory approval, or that our key io compounds may prove to be effective or as effective as other competing compounds, or even if approved, that any of our key io compounds will become commercially successful for all approved indications.
we depend on several key products for most of our revenues, cash flows and earnings.
we derive a majority of our revenue and earnings from several key products. our six prioritized brands comprised approximately 75% of revenues in 2017. growth products such as opdivo and eliquis represented, and are expected to increasingly represent, a significant part of our revenue, earnings and cash flows. a reduction in revenue from any of these products could adversely impact our earnings and cash flows. also, if one of our major products were to become subject to issues such as loss of patent protection, significant changes in demand, formulary access changes, material product liability, unexpected side effects, regulatory proceedings, negative publicity or a significant advancement of competing products, we may incur an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operation or trading price of our stock.
we may experience difficulties or delays in the development and commercialization of new products.
compounds or products may appear promising in development but fail to reach market within the expected or optimal timeframe, or at all. in addition, product extensions or additional indications may not be approved. furthermore, products or indications approved under the u.s. fda's accelerated approval program may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in confirmatory studies and such studies may not be successful. for example, when we announced we would not pursue an accelerated regulatory pathway for the combination of opdivo+yervoy in lung cancer and when we reported negative results from checkmate-026, we experienced negative impacts on our stock price in 2016. developing and commercializing new compounds and products include inherent risks and uncertainties, including (i) due to efficacy and safety concerns, delayed or denied regulatory approvals, delays or challenges with producing products on a commercial scale or excessive costs to manufacture them; (ii) failure to enter into or implement optimal alliances for the development and/or commercialization of new products; (iii) failure to maintain a consistent scope and variety of promising late-stage products; (iv) failure of one or more of our products to achieve or maintain commercial viability; and (v) changes in regulatory approval processes may cause delays or denials of new product approvals.
regulatory approval delays are especially common when a product is expected to have a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, as required by the fda to address significant risk/benefit issues. the inability to bring a product to market or a significant delay in the expected approval and related launch date of a new product could negatively impact our revenues and earnings. in addition, if certain acquired pipeline programs are canceled or we believe their commercial prospects have been reduced, we may recognize material non-cash impairment charges for those programs. finally, losing key molecules and intermediaries or our compound library through a natural or man-made disaster or act of sabotage could negatively impact the product development cycle.
19
we face intense competition from other manufacturers, including for both innovative medicines and lower-priced generic products.
bms is dependent on the market access, uptake and expansion for marketed brands, new product introductions, new indications, product extensions and co-promotional activities with alliance partners, to deliver future growth. competition is keen and includes (i) lower-priced generics and increasingly aggressive generic commercialization tactics, (ii) new competitive products entering the market, particularly in io, (iii) lower prices for other companies' products, real or perceived superior efficacy (benefit) or safety (risk) profiles or other differentiating factors, (iv) technological advances and patents attained by our competitors, (v) clinical study results from our products or a competitor's products that affect the value proposition for our products, (vi) business combinations among our competitors and major third-party payers and (vii) competing interests for external partnerships to develop and bring new products to markets. if we are unable to compete successfully against our competitors' products in the marketplace, this could have a material negative impact on our revenues and earnings.
litigation claiming infringement of intellectual property may adversely affect our future revenues and operating earnings.
third parties may claim that we infringe upon their intellectual property. resolving an intellectual property infringement claim can be costly and time consuming and may require us to enter into license agreements, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms. a successful claim of patent or other intellectual property infringement could subject us to significant damages or an injunction preventing the manufacture, sale, or use of the affected product or products. any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our profitability and financial condition.
adverse outcomes in other legal matters could negatively affect our business.
current or future lawsuits, claims, proceedings and government investigations could preclude or delay the commercialization of our products or could adversely affect our operations, profitability, liquidity or financial condition, after any possible insurance recoveries, where available. such legal matters include (i) intellectual property disputes; (ii) adverse decisions in litigation, including product liability and commercial cases; (iii) anti-bribery regulations, such as the u.s. foreign corrupt practice act or uk bribery act, including compliance with ongoing reporting obligations to the government resulting from any settlements, (iv) recalls or withdrawals of pharmaceutical products or forced closings of manufacturing plants; (v) the failure to fulfill obligations under supply contracts with the government and other customers; (vi) product pricing and promotional matters; (vii) lawsuits and claims asserting, or investigations into, violations of securities, antitrust, federal and state pricing, consumer protection, data privacy and other laws; (viii) environmental, health, safety and sustainability matters; and (ix) tax liabilities resulting from assessments from tax authorities.
we could lose market exclusivity of a product earlier than expected.
in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, the majority of an innovative product's commercial value is realized during its market exclusivity period. in the u.s. and in some other countries, when market exclusivity expires and generic versions are approved and marketed or when biosimilars are introduced (even if only for a competing product), there are usually very substantial and rapid declines in a product's revenues.
market exclusivity for our products is based upon patent rights and certain regulatory forms of exclusivity. the scope of our patent rights varies from country to country and may also be dependent on the availability of meaningful legal remedies in a country. the failure to obtain patent and other intellectual property rights, or limitations on the use or loss of such rights, could be material to us. in some countries, including certain eu member states, basic patent protections for our products may not exist because certain countries did not historically offer the right to obtain specific types of patents and/or we (or our licensors) did not file in those countries. in addition, the patent environment can be unpredictable and the validity and enforceability of patents cannot be predicted with certainty. absent relevant patent protection for a product, once the data exclusivity period expires, generic versions can be approved and marketed.
generic and biosimilar product manufacturers as well as other groups seeking financial gain are also increasingly seeking to challenge patents before they expire, and we could face earlier-than-expected competition for any products at any time. patents covering our key products have been, and are likely to continue to be, subject to patent litigation. for example, in february 2017 one of the eu patents for sprycel was revoked by the opposition division of the epo. we may experience a decline in european revenues upon the entry of generics into the market. refer to "item 8. financial statements-note 18. legal proceedings and contingencies" for further information. in some cases, manufacturers may seek regulatory approval by submitting their own clinical study data to obtain marketing approval or choose to launch a generic product "at risk" before the expiration of the applicable patent(s) and/or before the final resolution of related patent litigation. there is no assurance that a particular product will enjoy market exclusivity for the full time period that appears in the estimates disclosed in this form 10-k or that we assume when we provide our financial guidance. in addition, some countries, such as india, are allowing competitors to manufacture and sell competing generic products, which negatively impacts the protections afforded the company. lower-priced biosimilars for bms biologic products or competing biologics could negatively impact our volumes and prices.
20
increased pricing pressure and other restrictions in the u.s. and abroad from mcos, institutional purchasers, and government agencies and programs, among others, could negatively affect our revenues and profit margins.
our products continue to be subject to increasing pressures across the portfolio from market access, pricing and discounting and other restrictions in the u.s., the eu and other regions around the world, including from (i) rules and practices of mcos and institutional and governmental purchasers; (ii) judicial decisions and changes in laws and regulations for federal healthcare programs such as medicare and medicaid, and other government actions and inquiries at both the federal and state level such as laws that have recently been enacted in california, vermont, nevada and new york that are focused on drug pricing transparency and/or limiting state spending on drugs; (iii) the potential impact of changes to pharmaceutical reimbursement, and increased pricing pressure from medicare part d formularies, medicare part b reimbursement rates to physicians as well as commercial formularies in general; (iv) reimbursement delays; (v) government price erosion mechanisms across europe and in other countries, resulting in deflation for pharmaceutical product pricing; (vi) collection delays or failures to pay in government-funded public hospitals outside the u.s. (vii) the impact on pricing from parallel trade across borders; (viii) other developments in technology and/or industry practices that could impact the reimbursement policies and practices of third-party payers; and (ix) inhibited market access due to real or perceived differences in value propositions for our products compared to competing products.
we are subject to a variety of u.s. and international laws and regulations.
we are currently subject to a number of government laws and regulations and in the future, could become subject to new government laws and regulations. the costs of compliance with such laws and regulations, or the negative results of non-compliance, could adversely affect our business, our operating results and the financial condition of our company; these include (i) additional healthcare reform initiatives in the u.s. or in other countries, including additional mandatory discounts or fees; (ii) new laws, regulations and judicial or other governmental decisions affecting pricing, drug reimbursement, receivable payments, and access or marketing within or across jurisdictions; (iii) changes in intellectual property law; (iv) changes in accounting standards; (v) new and increasing data privacy regulations and enforcement, particularly in the european union and the u.s.; (vi) emerging and new global regulatory requirements for reporting payments and other value transfers to healthcare professionals; and (vii) the potential impact of importation restrictions, legislative and/or other regulatory changes.
changes to tax regulations could negatively impact our earnings.
we are subject to income taxes in the u.s. and various other countries globally. in particular, although the passage of the tax cut and jobs act of 2017 reduced the u.s. tax rate to 21%, our future earnings could be negatively impacted by changes in tax legislation including changing tax rates and tax base such as limiting, phasing-out or eliminating deductions or tax credits, taxing certain excess income from intellectual property, changing rules for earnings repatriations and changing other tax laws in the u.s. or other countries. in addition, the one-time deemed repatriation tax of approximately $2.6 billion will be payable over the next eight years.
third-party royalties represent a significant percentage of our pretax income and operating cash flow.
we have entered into several arrangements which entitle us to potential royalties from third parties for out-licensed intellectual property, commercialization rights and sales-based contingent proceeds related to the divestiture of businesses. in many of these arrangements we have minimal, if any, continuing involvement that contribute to the financial success of those activities. royalties have continued to represent a significant percentage of our pretax income, including royalties related to the divestiture of our erbitux* and diabetes businesses (including the transfer of certain future royalty rights pertaining to amylin, onglyza* and farxiga* product sales), our sanofi alliance, out-licensed intellectual property and the merck patent infringement settlement. pretax income generated from royalties were approximately $1.2 billion in 2017 and is expected to increase in 2018. our pretax income could be adversely affected if the royalty streams decline in future periods.
21
the failure of third parties to meet their contractual, regulatory, and other obligations could adversely affect our business.
we rely on suppliers, vendors, outsourcing partners, alliance partners and other third parties to research, develop, manufacture, commercialize, co-promote and sell our products, manage certain marketing, selling, human resource, finance, it and other business unit and functional services, and meet their contractual, regulatory and other obligations. using these third parties poses a number of risks, such as: (i) they may not perform to our standards or legal requirements, for example, in relation to the outsourcing of significant clinical development activities for innovative medicines to some contract research organizations; (ii) they may not produce reliable results; (iii) they may not perform in a timely manner; (iv) they may not maintain confidentiality of our proprietary information; (v) they may incur a significant cyberattack or business disruption; (vi) disputes may arise with respect to ownership of rights to technology developed with our partners; and (vii) disagreements could cause delays in, or termination of, the research, development or commercialization of the product or result in litigation or arbitration. moreover, some third parties are located in markets subject to political and social risk, corruption, infrastructure problems and natural disasters, in addition to country specific privacy and data security risk given current legal and regulatory environments. the failure of any critical third party to meet its obligations, including for future royalty and milestone payments; adequately deploy business continuity plans in the event of a crisis; and/or satisfactorily resolve significant disagreements with us or address other factors, could have a material adverse impact on our operations and results. in addition, if these third parties violate, or are alleged to have violated, any laws or regulations, including the local pharmaceutical code, u.s. foreign corrupt practice act, uk bribery act and other similar laws and regulations, during the performance of their obligations for us, it is possible that we could suffer financial and reputational harm or other negative outcomes, including possible legal consequences.
failure to execute our business strategy could adversely impact our growth and profitability.
our strategy is focused on delivering innovative, transformational medicines to patients. if we are unable to successfully execute on this strategy, this could negatively impact our future results of operations and market capitalization. in connection with this strategy, we are in the process of evolving our operating model to focus on investment in commercial opportunities against key brands and markets, accelerate the pipeline, streamline operations and realign manufacturing capabilities that broaden biologics capabilities, among other things. our ability to successfully execute our operating model evolution could impact our results. if we are not able to achieve the cost savings we expect, this could negatively impact our operating margin and earnings results. in addition, we may be unable to consistently maintain an adequate pipeline, through internal r&d programs or transactions with third parties, to support future revenue growth. competition among pharmaceutical companies for acquisition and product licensing opportunities is intense, and we may not be able to locate suitable acquisition targets or licensing partners at reasonable prices, or successfully execute such transactions. if we are unable to support and grow our marketed products, successfully execute the launches of newly approved products, advance our late-stage pipeline, manage change from our operating model evolution and manage our costs effectively, our operating results and financial condition could be negatively impacted.
failure to attract and retain highly qualified personnel could affect our ability to successfully develop and commercialize products.
our success is largely dependent on our continued ability to attract and retain highly qualified scientific, technical and management personnel, as well as personnel with expertise in clinical r&d, governmental regulation and commercialization. competition for qualified personnel in the biopharmaceutical field is intense. we cannot be sure that we will be able to attract and retain quality personnel or that the costs of doing so will not materially increase.
any businesses or assets we acquire in the future may underperform, and we may not be able to successfully integrate them into our existing business.
an essential component of our strategy has been business development activities seeking to source innovation externally to supplement our own discovery and development efforts.  as such, we have acquired, or in-licensed, a number of assets and we expect to continue to support our pipeline with compounds or products obtained through licensing and acquisitions. future revenues, profits and cash flows of an acquired company's products, technologies and pipeline candidates, may not materialize due to low product uptake, delayed or missed pipeline opportunities, the inability to capture expected synergies, increased competition, safety concerns, regulatory issues, supply chain problems or other factors beyond our control. for example we discontinued the development of fs102 which was in phase i development for the treatment of breast and gastric cancer, and consequently did not exercise our option to purchase f-star alpha. as a result, we recorded an iprd charge of $75 million. substantial difficulties, costs and delays could result from integrating our acquisitions, including for (i) r&d, manufacturing, distribution, sales, marketing, promotion and information technology activities; (ii) policies, procedures, processes, controls and compliance; and (iii) tax considerations.
22
we could experience difficulties and delays in the manufacturing, distribution and sale of our products.
our product supply and related patient access could be negatively impacted by, among other things: (i) product seizures or recalls or forced closings of manufacturing plants; (ii) our failure, or the failure of any of our suppliers, to comply with cgmp and other applicable regulations or quality assurance guidelines that could lead to manufacturing shutdowns, product shortages or delays in product manufacturing; (iii) manufacturing, quality assurance/quality control, supply problems or governmental approval delays; (iv) the failure of a sole source or single source supplier to provide us with the necessary raw materials, supplies or finished goods within a reasonable timeframe and with required quality; (v) the failure of a third-party manufacturer to supply us with bulk active or finished product on time; (vi) construction or regulatory approval delays for new facilities or the expansion of existing facilities, including those intended to support future demand for our biologics products, such as opdivo; (vii) the failure to meet new and emerging regulations requiring products to be tracked throughout the distribution channels using unique identifiers to verify their authenticity in the supply chain; (viii) other manufacturing or distribution issues, including limits to manufacturing capacity and changes in the types of products produced, such as biologics, physical limitations or other business interruptions; and (ix) disruption in supply chain continuity including from natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism or other external factors over which we have no control impacting one or more of our facilities or at a critical supplier. for example, our new biologics manufacturing facility in cruiserath, ireland is expected to be operational in 2019. a delay in the planned opening of the site could impact the supply of our products or require us to obtain product supply from third parties at a significant cost.
our manufacturing and commercial operations in puerto rico were impacted by the recent hurricanes. our two manufacturing sites sustained some damage but are currently operating at reduced capacity. we continue to work to restore to normal operations. disruption in our ability to operate our puerto rico manufacturing facilities (whether due to problems with the facility itself, the infrastructure and services available on the island, the unavailability of raw materials or supplies from vendors, the unavailability of key staff or otherwise) could materially and adversely affect our ability to supply our products and affect our product sales.
product labeling changes for our marketed products could result in a negative impact on revenues and profit margins.
we or regulatory authorities may need to change the labeling for any pharmaceutical product, including after a product has been marketed for several years. these changes are often the result of additional data from post-marketing studies, head-to-head studies, adverse events reports, studies that identify biomarkers (objective characteristics that can indicate a particular response to a product or therapy) or other studies or post-marketing experience that produce important additional information about a product. new information added to a product's label can affect its risk-benefit profile, leading to potential recalls, withdrawals or declining revenue, as well as product liability claims. sometimes additional information from these studies identifies a portion of the patient population that may be non-responsive to a medicine or would be at higher risk of adverse reactions and labeling changes based on such studies may limit the patient population. the studies providing such additional information may be sponsored by us, but they could also be sponsored by competitors, insurance companies, government institutions, managed care organizations, scientists, investigators, or other interested parties. while additional safety and efficacy information from such studies assist us and healthcare providers in identifying the best patient population for each product, it can also negatively impact our revenues due to inventory returns and a more limited patient population going forward. additionally, certain study results, especially from head-to-head studies, could affect a product's formulary listing, which could also adversely affect revenues.
the illegal distribution and sale by third parties of counterfeit or unregistered versions of our products or stolen products could have a negative impact on our revenues, earnings, reputation and business.
third parties may illegally distribute and sell counterfeit versions of our products, which do not meet our rigorous manufacturing and testing standards. a patient who receives a counterfeit drug may be at risk for a number of dangerous health consequences. our reputation and business could suffer harm as a result of counterfeit drugs sold under our brand name. thefts of inventory at warehouses, plants or while in-transit, which are then not properly stored and are later sold through unauthorized channels, could adversely impact patient safety, our reputation and our business. in addition, diversion of products from their authorized market into other channels may result in reduced revenues and negatively affect our profitability.
23
we are dependent on information technology and our systems and infrastructure face certain risks, including from cybersecurity breaches and data leakage.
we rely extensively on it systems, networks and services, including internet sites, data hosting and processing facilities and tools, physical security systems and other hardware, software and technical applications and platforms, some of which are managed, hosted provided and/or used for third-parties or their vendors, to assist in conducting our business. a significant breakdown, invasion, corruption, destruction or interruption of critical information technology systems or infrastructure, by our workforce, others with authorized access to our systems or unauthorized persons could negatively impact operations. the ever-increasing use and evolution of technology, including cloud-based computing, creates opportunities for the unintentional dissemination or intentional destruction of confidential information stored in our, or our third-party providers', systems, portable media or storage devices. we could also experience a business interruption, theft of confidential information or reputational damage from industrial espionage attacks, malware or other cyber-attacks, which may compromise our system infrastructure or lead to data leakage, either internally or at our third-party providers. although the aggregate impact on our operations and financial condition has not been material to date, we have been the target of events of this nature and expect them to continue as cybersecurity threats have been rapidly evolving in sophistication and becoming more prevalent in the industry. we have invested in industry appropriate protections and monitoring practices of our data and it to reduce these risks and continue to monitor our systems on an ongoing basis for any current or potential threats. we maintain cyber insurance, however, this insurance may not be sufficient to cover the financial, legal, business or reputational losses that may result from an interruption or breach of our systems. there can be no assurance that our continuing efforts will prevent breakdowns or breaches to our or our third-party providers' databases or systems that could adversely affect our business.
adverse changes in u.s., global, regional, local economic and political conditions could adversely affect our profitability.
global economic and political risks pose significant challenges to a company's growth and profitability and are difficult to mitigate. we generated approximately 45% of our revenues outside of the u.s. in 2017. as such, our revenues, earnings and cash flow are exposed to risk from a strengthening u.s. dollar. we have exposure to customer credit risks in europe, south america and other markets including from government-guaranteed hospital receivables in markets where payments are not received on time. we have significant operations in europe, including for manufacturing and distribution. the results of our operations could be negatively impacted by any member country exiting the eurozone monetary union or eu, including the planned exit of the uk from the eu. of note, the exit of the uk from the eu may have an impact on our research, commercial and general business operations in the uk and the eu. in addition, future pension plan funding requirements continue to be sensitive to global economic conditions and the related impact on equity markets. additionally, disruptions in the credit markets or a downgrade of our current credit rating could increase our future borrowing costs and impair our ability to access capital and credit markets on terms commercially acceptable to us, which could adversely affect our liquidity and capital resources or significantly increase our cost of capital. finally, our business, operations may be adversely affected by political volatility, conflicts or crises in individual countries or regions, including terrorist activities or war.
there can be no guarantee that we will pay dividends or repurchase stock.
the declaration, amount and timing of any dividends fall within the discretion of our board of directors. the board's decision will depend on many factors, including our financial condition, earnings, capital requirements, debt service obligations, industry practice, legal requirements, regulatory constraints and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant. a reduction or elimination of our dividend payments or dividend program could adversely affect our stock price. in addition, we could, at any time, decide not to buy back any more shares in the market, which could also adversely affect our stock price.
increased use of social media platforms present risks and challenges.
we are increasing our use of social media to communicate company news and events. the inappropriate and/or unauthorized use of certain media vehicles could cause brand damage or information leakage or could lead to legal implications, including from the improper collection and/or dissemination of personally identifiable information from employees, patients, healthcare professionals or other stakeholders. in addition, negative or inaccurate posts or comments about us on any social networking website could damage our reputation, brand image and goodwill. further, the disclosure of non-public company-sensitive information by our workforce or others through external media channels could lead to information loss. identifying new points of entry as social media continues to expand presents new challenges.

item 7.        management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.
executive summary bristol-myers squibb company is a global specialty biopharmaceutical company whose mission is to discover, develop and deliver innovative medicines that help patients prevail over serious diseases. refer to the summary of abbreviated terms at the end of this 2017 form 10-k for terms used throughout the document.
in 2017, we received 15 approvals for new medicines and additional indications and formulations of currently marketed medicines in major markets (the u.s., eu, japan and china) including multiple regulatory milestone achievements for opdivo. we are committed to investigating opdivo alone and in combination with yervoy and other anti-cancer agents for a wide array of tumor types, including broad programs in lung, head & neck, liver, kidney, bladder and gastric. we continue to believe that the breadth and depth of our io portfolio positions us well for the future. we have 17 new io compounds in clinical development and studies across more than 35 different tumor types. in addition, we advanced certain other non-io r&d programs in our pipeline, including fgf21 for the treatment of nash and tyk-2 inhibitor for the treatment of immune diseases such as psoriasis. we also continued to progress our company transformation initiatives enabling us to invest in our highest priority portfolio opportunities.
in 2017, our revenues increased 7% as a result of higher demand for our prioritized brands including opdivo and eliquis partially offset by increased competition for established brands, primarily daklinza. the $2.04 decrease in gaap eps was due to tax charges attributed to tax reform ($1.76 per share) and to a lesser extent higher license, asset acquisition and restructuring related charges and lower divestiture- related income. these items were partially offset by higher revenues, royalties and licensing income and a patent-infringement settlement. after adjusting for the impact of tax reform and other specified items, non-gaap eps increased $0.18 primarily as a result of higher revenues partially offset by product mix and higher r&d expenses supporting opdivo and other io programs.
in 2016, our revenues increased 17% as a result of higher demand for our prioritized brands including opdivo and eliquis partially offset by the expiration of our u.s. commercialization rights to abilify*, the transfer of erbitux* rights in north america and increased competition for reyataz, sustiva and baraclude in certain markets. the $1.72 increase in gaap eps was due to higher revenues, divestiture-related income and lower license and asset acquisition charges partially offset by higher opdivo related expenses. after adjusting for the impact of divestiture gains, r&d license and asset acquisition charges and other specified items, non-gaap eps increased by $0.82 primarily as a result of higher revenues partially offset by product mix.

we are developing new medicines in the following core therapeutic areas: (1) oncology with a priority in io; (2) immunoscience with priorities in lupus, rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease; (3) cardiovascular with a priority in heart disease and; (4) fibrotic disease with priorities in lung and liver. we continue to advance the next wave of innovative medicines by investing significantly in our pipeline both internally and through business developments activities. in io, we continue to invest in monotherapy studies, combination approaches, and our next wave of early assets. we have entered into several collaboration agreements and expanded others to research and develop opdivo and other approved or investigational oncology agents in combination regimens. we remain focused and well-resourced in our cancer development programs and seek to broaden the use of opdivo in earlier lines of therapy, expand into new tumors, accelerate next wave io mechanisms and develop treatment options for refractory io patients. beyond cancer, we continue to advance our early stage portfolio in immunoscience, cardiovascular, and fibrotic diseases and strengthen our partnerships with a diverse group of companies and academic institutions in new and expanded research activities. we believe our differentiated internal and external focus contributes to the advancing of our pipeline of potentially transformational medicines.
our commercial model has been evolving and revenues from our marketed product portfolio continue to grow which demonstrates strong execution of our strategy. we continue to drive growth of opdivo by expanding into additional indications and tumor types both as a monotherapy and in combination with yervoy and other anti-cancer agents. eliquis continues to grow, leveraging its best in class clinical profile and extensive real world data, and is now the number one novel oral anticoagulant in total prescriptions in the u.s. we are building on the continued success of our other prioritized brands and remain strongly committed to orencia and sprycel. through our operating model transformation, our commercial infrastructure is uniquely leveraged for potential growth.
our operating model continues to evolve and we have been successful in focusing commercial and r&d resources on prioritized brands and markets, strengthening our r&d capabilities in tumor biology, patient selection, and new biomarkers, delivering leaner administrative functions and streamlining our manufacturing network to reflect the importance of biologics in our current and future portfolio. the evolution in our operating model will enable us to deliver the necessary strategic, financial and operational flexibility to invest in the highest priority opportunities within our portfolio.
looking ahead, we will continue to implement our biopharma strategy by driving the growth of key brands, executing product launches, investing in our diverse and innovative pipeline, aided by strategic business development, focusing on prioritized markets, increasing investments in our biologics manufacturing capabilities and maintaining a culture of continuous improvement.
acquisition and licensing arrangements acquisition and licensing arrangements allow us to focus our resources behind our growth opportunities that drive the greatest long-term value. we are focused on the following core therapeutic areas: oncology, including io, immunoscience, cardiovascular and fibrosis. significant arrangements during the past three years are summarized below. refer to "item 8. financial statements-note 4. acquisitions, divestitures and licensing arrangements" for further information.

gtn adjustments are primarily a function of product sales volume, regional and payer channel mix, contractual or legislative discounts and rebates. gtn adjustments are increasing at a higher rate than gross product sales due to higher u.s. eliquis gross product sales, which has a relatively high gtn adjustment percentage as a result of competitive pressures to maintain its position on healthcare payer formularies allowing patients continued access through their medical plans.

opdivo (nivolumab) - a fully human monoclonal antibody that binds to the pd-1 on t and nkt cells that has been approved for several anti-cancer indications including bladder, blood, colon, head and neck, kidney, liver, lung, melanoma and stomach and continues to be investigated across other tumor types and disease areas.
•   u.s. revenues increased in both periods due to higher demand. we expect increased competition for opdivo to continue in the future due to new product entrants and expanded indications.
•   international revenues increased in both periods due to higher demand as a result of launches of additional indications and approvals in new countries.

estimated end-user demand pursuant to the sec consent order described under "-sec consent order", we monitor the level of inventory on hand in the u.s. wholesaler distribution channel and outside of the u.s. in the direct customer distribution channel. we are obligated to disclose products with levels of inventory in excess of one month on hand or expected demand, subject to a de minimis exception. estimated levels of inventory in the distribution channel in excess of one month on hand for the following products were not material to our results of operations as of the dates indicated. at december 31, 2017, daklinza had 1.7 months of inventory on hand in the u.s. as a result of minimum required stock levels to support patient demand. we expect inventory on hand levels of daklinza to exceed one month over the near term. below are international products that had estimated levels of inventory in the distribution channel in excess of one month on hand at september 30, 2017.
dafalgan, an analgesic product sold principally in europe, had 1.2 months of inventory on hand internationally at direct customers compared to also 1.2 months of inventory on hand at june 30, 2017. the level of inventory on hand was primarily attributable to france to support product seasonality.
efferalgan, an analgesic product sold principally in europe, had 1.2 months of inventory on hand internationally at direct customers compared to 0.8 months of inventory on hand at june 30, 2017. the level of inventory on hand was primarily attributable to france to support product seasonality.
fervex, a cold and flu product, had 3.0 months of inventory on hand at direct customers compared to 4.0 months of inventory on hand at june 30, 2017. the level of inventory on hand was attributable to france to support product seasonality.
perfalgan, an analgesic product, had 2.6 months of inventory on hand internationally at direct customers compared to 1.5 months of inventory on hand at june 30, 2017. the level of inventory on hand was primarily in the gulf countries due to extended delivery lead time.
in the u.s., we generally determine our months on hand estimates using inventory levels of product on hand and the amount of out-movement provided by our three largest wholesalers, which account for approximately 95% of total gross sales of u.s. products. factors that may influence our estimates include generic competition, seasonality of products, wholesaler purchases in light of increases in wholesaler list prices, new product launches, new warehouse openings by wholesalers and new customer stockings by wholesalers. in addition, these estimates are calculated using third-party data, which may be impacted by their recordkeeping processes.
our non-u.s. businesses have significantly more direct customers. information on available direct customer product level inventory and corresponding out-movement information and the reliability of third-party demand information varies widely. we limit our direct customer sales channel inventory reporting to where we can influence demand. when this information does not exist or is otherwise not available, we have developed a variety of methodologies to estimate such data, including using historical sales made to direct customers and third-party market research data related to prescription trends and end-user demand. given the difficulties inherent in estimating third-party demand information, we evaluate our methodologies to estimate direct customer product level inventory and to calculate months on hand on an ongoing basis and make changes as necessary. factors that may affect our estimates include generic competition, seasonality of products, price increases, new product launches, new warehouse openings by direct customers, new customer stockings by direct customers and expected direct customer purchases for governmental bidding situations. as such, all of the information required to estimate months on hand in the direct customer distribution channel for non-u.s. business for the year ended december 31, 2017 is not available prior to the filing of this annual report on form 10-k. we will disclose any product with levels of inventory in excess of one month on hand or expected demand, subject to a de minimis exception, in the next quarterly report on form 10-q.

new tax reform legislation in the u.s. was enacted on december 22, 2017 known as the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 (the act). the act moves from a worldwide tax system to a quasi-territorial tax system and comprises broad and complex changes to the u.s. tax code including, but not limited to, (1) reducing the u.s. tax rate from 35% to 21%; (2) adding a deemed repatriation transition tax on certain foreign earnings and profits; (3) generally eliminating u.s. federal income taxes on dividends from foreign subsidiaries; (4) including certain income of controlled foreign companies in u.s. taxable income; (5) creating a new minimum tax referred to as a base erosion anti-abuse income tax; (6) limiting certain research-based credits; and (7) eliminating the domestic manufacturing deduction.
although many aspects of the act are not effective until 2018, additional tax expense of $2.9 billion was recognized in the fourth quarter of 2017 upon enactment of the act. the additional expense increased the effective tax rate by 56.7% and included a $2.6 billion one-time deemed repatriation transition tax on previously untaxed post-1986 foreign earnings and profits (including related tax reserves). those earnings were effectively taxed at a 15.5% rate to the extent that the specified foreign corporations held cash and certain other assets and an 8.0% rate on the remaining earnings and profits. the remaining $285 million of additional tax expense included an adjustment to measure net deferred tax assets at the new u.s. tax rate of 21%.
the accounting for the reduction of deferred tax assets to the 21% tax rate is complete. the tax charge for the deemed repatriation tax is incomplete, but was recorded as a provisional amount as we were able to make a reasonable estimate of this tax. the provisional amounts may change when completed in 2018 upon finalizing untaxed post-1986 foreign earnings and profits and related cash and certain eligible assets of the specified foreign corporations. the provisional amounts may also change if additional guidance of the relevant tax code is released.
excluding the above transitional impacts related to the act, the tax impact attributed to non-deductible r&d charges, divestiture transactions and other specified items increased the effective tax rate by 3.3% in 2017, 1.8% in 2016 and 0.3% in 2015. no tax benefits were attributed to the r&d charges incurred in connection with the acquisitions of ifm, cormorant, padlock, cardioxyl, flexus and the warrant to acquire promedior. lower non-deductible goodwill allocated to business divestitures and higher valuation allowances attributed to capital loss carryforwards released in 2015 impacted the effective tax rate in 2015. in addition, the adoption of amended income tax accounting guidance related to share-based payments and the early adoption of intra-entity transfers of assets other than inventory reduced the effective tax rate by 2.4% in 2017. earnings mix between high and low tax jurisdictions, domestic manufacturing deductions and higher u.s. foreign tax credits resulting from the puerto rico excise tax attributed to most of the remaining changes in the effective tax rates.
prior to the act, the effective income tax rate was typically lower than the u.s. statutory rate of 35% primarily due to earnings for certain of our manufacturing operations in low tax jurisdictions such as switzerland, ireland and puerto rico which were indefinitely reinvested. bms operates under a favorable tax grant in puerto rico not scheduled to expire prior to 2023. although the company continues to assess the broad and complex changes to the u.s. tax code, it currently expects no significant net impact of tax reform on the effective tax rate in 2018. refer to "item 8. financial statements-note 7. income taxes" for further information.
non-gaap financial measures our non-gaap financial measures, including non-gaap earnings and related eps information, are adjusted to exclude certain costs, expenses, gains and losses and other specified items that are evaluated on an individual basis. these items are adjusted after considering their quantitative and qualitative aspects and typically have one or more of the following characteristics, such as being highly variable, difficult to project, unusual in nature, significant to the results of a particular period or not indicative of future operating results. similar charges or gains were recognized in prior periods and will likely reoccur in future periods including restructuring costs, accelerated depreciation and impairment of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, r&d charges in connection with the acquisition or licensing of third party intellectual property rights, divestiture gains or losses, pension, legal and other contractual settlement charges and debt redemption gains or losses, among other items. deferred and current income taxes attributed to these items are also adjusted for considering their individual impact to the overall tax expense, deductibility and jurisdictional tax rates.

non-gaap information is intended to portray the results of our baseline performance, supplement or enhance management, analysts and investors' overall understanding of our underlying financial performance and facilitate comparisons among current, past and future periods. for example, non-gaap earnings and eps information is an indication of our baseline performance before items that are considered by us to not be reflective of our ongoing results. in addition, this information is among the primary indicators we use as a basis for evaluating performance, allocating resources, setting incentive compensation targets and planning and forecasting for future periods. this information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net earnings or diluted eps prepared in accordance with gaap.

cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities held in the u.s. were approximately $4.1 billion at december 31, 2017. most of the remaining $5.2 billion is held primarily in low-tax jurisdictions and is subject to restrictions or withholding taxes in certain jurisdictions. we are subject to a one-time deemed repatriation transition tax of $2.6 billion which will be payable over eight years as a result of u.s. tax reform. however, we expect to have more flexibility in accessing cash and future cash that may be generated in foreign subsidiaries. we believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities together with cash generated from operations and issuance of commercial paper in the u.s. will be sufficient to satisfy our normal cash requirements for at least the next few years, including dividends, capital expenditures, milestone payments, working capital, deemed repatriation transition tax and maturities of long-term debt.
management continuously evaluates the company's capital structure to ensure the company is financed efficiently, which may result in the repurchase of common stock and debt securities, termination of interest rate swap contracts prior to maturity and issuance of debt securities.
the company repurchased $2.5 billion of common stock in 2017 through accelerated share repurchase agreements, rule 10b5-1 plans and open market purchases. the stock repurchases were funded by $1.5 billion of new long-term debt and cash. the company repaid $750 million of long-term debt at maturity and repurchased $337 million of long-term debt in 2017. refer to "item 8. financial statements-note 9. financial instruments and fair value measurements and note 15. equity" for further information.
we issued commercial paper to fund near-term domestic liquidity requirements during 2017. the average amount of commercial paper outstanding was $389 million at a weighted-average rate of 1.17% during 2017. the maximum amount of commercial paper outstanding was $1.3 billion with $299 million outstanding at december 31, 2017.
dividend payments were $2.6 billion in 2017 and $2.5 billion in both 2016 and 2015. dividend decisions are made on a quarterly basis by our board of directors. annual capital expenditures were approximately $1.1 billion in 2017, $1.2 billion in 2016 and $800 million in 2015 and are expected to be approximately $1.0 billion in 2018 and $850 million in 2019. we continue to expand our biologics manufacturing capabilities and other facility-related activities. for example, we are constructing a new large-scale biologics manufacturing facility in ireland that will produce multiple therapies for our growing biologics portfolio when completed in 2019.
our investment portfolio includes non-current marketable securities, which are subject to changes in fair value as a result of interest rate fluctuations and other market factors. our investment policy establishes limits on the amount and time to maturity of investments with any institution. the policy also requires that investments are only entered into with corporate and financial institutions that meet high credit quality standards. refer to "item 8. financial statements-note 9. financial instruments and fair value measurements" for further information.
we currently have three separate revolving credit facilities totaling $5.0 billion from a syndicate of lenders. the facilities provide for customary terms and conditions with no financial covenants. our 364 day $2.0 billion facility expires in march 2018 and our two $1.5 billion facilities were extended to october 2021 and july 2022. our two $1.5 billion, five-year facilities are extendable annually by one year on the anniversary date with the consent of the lenders. no borrowings were outstanding under any revolving credit facility at december 31, 2017 or 2016.
additional regulations in the u.s. could be passed in the future including additional healthcare reform initiatives, further changes to tax laws, additional pricing laws and potential importation restrictions which may reduce our results of operations, operating cash flow, liquidity and financial flexibility. we continue to monitor the potential impact of the economic conditions in certain european and other countries and the related impact on prescription trends, pricing discounts and creditworthiness of our customers. we believe these economic conditions will not have a material impact on our liquidity, cash flow or financial flexibility.

credit ratings bms's long-term and short-term credit ratings assigned by moody's investors service are a2 and prime-1, respectively, with a stable rating outlook. bms's long-term and short-term credit ratings assigned by standard & poor's are a+ and a-1+, respectively, with a stable rating outlook. bms's long-term and short-term credit ratings assigned by fitch are a- and f2, respectively, with a stable rating outlook. our long-term ratings reflect the agencies' opinion that we have a low default risk but are somewhat susceptible to adverse effects of changes in circumstances and economic conditions. our short-term ratings reflect the agencies' opinion that we have good to extremely strong capacity for timely repayment. any credit rating downgrade may affect the interest rate of any debt we may incur, the fair market value of existing debt and our ability to access the capital markets generally.
cash flows the following is a discussion of cash flow activities:

cash flow provided by/(used in):
operating activities                      $5,275              $3,058              $2,105
investing activities                         (66   )           1,480              (1,572   )
financing activities                      (4,077   )          (2,653   )          (3,624   )
operating activities cash flow from operating activities represents the cash receipts and disbursements from all of our activities other than investing and financing activities. operating cash flow is derived by adjusting net earnings for noncontrolling interest, non-cash operating items, gains and losses attributed to investing and financing activities and changes in operating assets and liabilities resulting from timing differences between the receipts and payments of cash and when the transactions are recognized in our results of operations. as a result, changes in cash from operating activities reflect the timing of cash collections from customers and alliance partners; payments to suppliers, alliance partners and employees; customer discounts and rebates; and tax payments in the ordinary course of business. for example, annual employee bonuses are typically paid in the first quarter of the subsequent year. in addition, cash collections are impacted by longer payment terms for certain biologic products in the u.s., primarily certain products including opdivo, yervoy and empliciti (120 days to 150 days). the longer payment terms are used to more closely align with the insurance reimbursement timing for physicians and cancer centers following administration to the patients.
the $2.2 billion change in cash flow from operating activities compared to 2016 was primarily attributable to the following items in addition to increased sales and the timing of cash collections and payments in the ordinary course of business:
•   lower income tax payments of approximately $1.5 billion;
•   out-licensing proceeds of $470 million related to the biogen and roche transactions; and
•   litigation settlement proceeds of $481 million related to merck's pd-1 antibody keytruda* (bms's share).
partially offset by:
•   higher r&amp;d licensing payments of approximately $400 million primarily due to the cytomx, halozyme and nitto denko transactions.
•   higher contributions to pension plans of approximately $300 million.
the $1.0 billion change in cash flow from operating activities compared to 2015 was primarily attributable to the following items in addition to increased sales and the timing of cash collections and payments in the ordinary course of business:
•   the wind-down of the abilify* alliance in 2015 of approximately $700 million; and
•   lower r&amp;d licensing payments of approximately $600 million primarily due to the five-prime and promedior transactions in 2015.
partially offset by:
•   higher income tax payments of approximately $1.4 billion.

investing activities cash requirements from investing activities include cash used for acquisitions, manufacturing and facility-related capital expenditures, purchases of marketable securities with maturities greater than 90 days reduced by proceeds from business divestitures (including royalties) and the sale and maturity of marketable securities.
the $1.5 billion change in cash flow from investing activities compared to 2016 was primarily attributable to:
•   lower net sales of marketable securities with maturities greater than 90 days of $745 million which were essentially offset by changes in cash equivalents;
•   lower business divestiture proceeds of approximately $600 million primarily due to certain otc brands and investigational hiv medicines businesses in 2016; and
•   higher asset acquisition payments of approximately $350 million primarily due to the acquisition of ifm in 2017.
the $3.1 billion change in cash flow from investing activities compared to 2015 was primarily attributable to:
•   higher net sales of marketable securities of approximately $2.1 billion in 2016 which were reinvested in cash and cash equivalents;
•   lower asset acquisition payments of approximately $800 million primarily due to the acquisition of flexus in 2015; and
•   higher business divestiture proceeds of approximately $600 million including royalties and other contingent consideration received subsequent to the divestitures of certain otc brands and investigational hiv medicines businesses in 2016 and the mount vernon, indiana manufacturing facility, ixempra* and mature and other otc product businesses in 2015.
partially offset by:
•   higher capital expenditures of approximately $400 million.
financing activities cash requirements from financing activities include cash used to pay dividends, repurchase common stock and repay long-term debt and other borrowings reduced by proceeds from the exercise of stock options and issuance of long-term debt and other borrowings.
the $1.4 billion change in cash flow from financing activities compared to 2016 was primarily attributable to:
•   higher repurchase of common stock of $2.2 billion primarily due to the accelerated share repurchase agreements.
partially offset by:
•   higher net borrowing activity of $880 million primarily to fund the repurchase of common stock.
the $1.0 billion change in cash flow from financing activities compared to 2015 was primarily attributable to:
•   higher net borrowing activity of approximately $1.3 billion in 2016, primarily due to debt redemptions and reductions in cash overdrafts in 2015.
partially offset by:

in addition to the above, we are committed to an aggregated $17.0 billion of potential future research and development milestone payments to third parties for in-licensing, asset acquisitions and development programs including early-stage milestones of $3.1 billion (milestones achieved through phase iii clinical studies) and late-stage milestones of $10.4 billion (milestones achieved post phase iii clinical studies). payments generally are due and payable only upon achievement of certain developmental and regulatory milestones for which the specific timing cannot be predicted. some of these agreements also provide for sales-based milestones aggregating $3.5 billion that we would be obligated to pay to alliance partners upon achievement of certain sales levels in addition to royalties. we also have certain manufacturing, development and commercialization obligations in connection with alliance arrangements. it is not practicable to estimate the amount of these obligations. refer to "item 8. financial statements-note 3. alliances" for further information regarding our alliances. we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that are material or reasonably likely to become material to our financial condition or results of operations.
sec consent order / fcpa settlement as previously disclosed, on august 4, 2004, we entered into a final settlement with the sec, concluding an investigation concerning certain wholesaler inventory and accounting matters. the settlement was reached through a consent, a copy of which was attached as exhibit 10 to our quarterly report on form 10-q for the period ended september 30, 2004.
under the terms of the consent, we agreed, subject to certain defined exceptions, to limit sales of all products sold to our direct customers (including wholesalers, distributors, hospitals, retail outlets, pharmacies and government purchasers) based on expected demand or on amounts that do not exceed approximately one month of inventory on hand, without making a timely public disclosure of any change in practice. we also agreed in the consent to certain measures that we have implemented including: (a) establishing a formal review and certification process of our annual and quarterly reports filed with the sec; (b) establishing a business risk and disclosure group; (c) retaining an outside consultant to comprehensively study and help re-engineer our accounting and financial reporting processes; (d) publicly disclosing any sales incentives offered to direct customers for the purpose of inducing them to purchase products in excess of expected demand; and (e) ensuring that our budget process gives appropriate weight to inputs that come from the bottom to the top, and not just from the top to the bottom, and adequately documenting that process.
we have established a company-wide policy to limit our sales to direct customers for the purpose of complying with the consent. this policy includes the adoption of various procedures to monitor and limit sales to direct customers in accordance with the terms of the consent. these procedures include a governance process to escalate to appropriate management levels potential questions or concerns regarding compliance with the policy and timely resolution of such questions or concerns. in addition, compliance with the policy is monitored on a regular basis.
we maintain dsas with our u.s. pharmaceutical wholesalers, which account for nearly 100% of our gross u.s. revenues. under the current terms of the dsas, our wholesaler customers provide us with weekly information with respect to months on hand product-level inventories and the amount of out-movement of products. the three largest wholesalers currently account for approximately 95% of our gross u.s. revenues. the inventory information received from our wholesalers, together with our internal information, is used to estimate months on hand product level inventories at these wholesalers. we estimate months on hand product inventory levels for our u.s. business's wholesaler customers other than the three largest wholesalers by extrapolating from the months on hand calculated for the three largest wholesalers. in contrast, our non-u.s. business has significantly more direct customers, limited information on direct customer product level inventory and corresponding out-movement information and the reliability of third-party demand information, where available, varies widely. accordingly, we rely on a variety of methods to estimate months on hand product level inventories for these business units.
we believe the above-described procedures provide a reasonable basis to ensure compliance with the consent.
in addition, as previously disclosed, in october 2015, the company reached a civil settlement with the sec of alleged fcpa violations in which the company agreed to pay approximately $14.7 million in disgorgement, penalties and interest.  as part of the settlement, the company agreed to a two-year self-monitoring period of reporting to the government which concluded in october 2017.
recently issued accounting standards for recently issued accounting standards, refer to "item 8. financial statements-note 1. accounting policies-recently issued accounting standards."
46
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses. our critical accounting policies are those that significantly impact our financial condition and results of operations and require the most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. because of this uncertainty, actual results may vary from these estimates.
revenue recognition our accounting policy for revenue recognition has a substantial impact on reported results and relies on certain estimates. revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the sales price is fixed or determinable, collectability is reasonably assured and title and substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership have transferred (generally upon shipment except in certain eu markets which does not occur until delivery of the products to the customer). revenue is also reduced for gtn sales adjustments discussed below, all of which involve significant estimates and judgment after considering legal interpretations of applicable laws and regulations, historical experience, payer channel mix (e.g. medicare or medicaid), current contract prices under applicable programs, unbilled claims and processing time lags and inventory levels in the distribution channel. estimates are assessed each period and adjusted as required to revise information or actual experience.
gtn adjustments the following categories of gtn adjustments involve significant estimates, judgments and information obtained from external sources. refer to "-total revenues" for further discussion and analysis of each significant category of gtn sales adjustments.
charge-backs and cash discounts our u.s. business participates in programs with government entities, the most significant of which are the u.s. department of defense and the u.s. department of veterans affairs, and other parties, including covered entities under the 340b drug pricing program, whereby pricing on products is extended below wholesaler list price to participating entities. these entities purchase products through wholesalers at the lower program price and the wholesalers then charge us the difference between their acquisition cost and the lower program price. accounts receivable is reduced for the estimated amount of unprocessed charge-back claims attributable to a sale (typically within a two to four week time lag).
in the u.s. and certain other countries, cash discounts are offered as an incentive for prompt payment, generally approximating 2% of the sales price. accounts receivable is reduced for the estimated amount of unprocessed cash discounts (typically within a one month time lag).
medicaid and medicare rebates our u.s. business participates in state government medicaid programs and other qualifying federal and state government programs requiring discounts and rebates to participating state and local government entities. all discounts and rebates provided through these programs are included in our medicaid rebate accrual. medicaid rebates have also been extended to drugs used in managed medicaid plans. the estimated amount of unpaid or unbilled rebates is presented as a liability.
rebates and discounts are offered to managed healthcare organizations in the u.s. managing prescription drug programs and medicare advantage prescription drug plans covering the medicare part d drug benefit. we also pay a 50% point of service discount to the centers for medicare & medicaid services when the medicare part d beneficiaries are in the coverage gap ("donut hole"). the estimated amount of unpaid or unbilled rebates and discounts is presented as a liability.
other rebates, returns, discounts and adjustments other gtn sales adjustments include sales returns and all other programs based on applicable laws and regulations for individual non-u.s. countries as well as rebates offered to managed healthcare organizations in the u.s. to a lesser extent. the non-u.s. programs include several different pricing schemes such as cost caps, volume discounts, outcome-based pricing schemes and pricing claw-backs that are based on sales of individual companies or an aggregation of all companies participating in a specific market. the estimated amount of unpaid or unbilled rebates and discounts is presented as a liability.
47
estimated returns for established products are determined after considering historical experience and other factors including levels of inventory in the distribution channel, estimated shelf life, product recalls, product discontinuances, price changes of competitive products, introductions of generic products, introductions of competitive new products and lower demand following the loe. the estimated amount for product returns is presented as a liability.
estimated returns for new products are determined after considering historical sales return experience of similar products, such as those within the same product line, similar therapeutic area and/or similar distribution model. we defer recognition of revenue until the right of return expires, sufficient historical experience to estimate sales returns is developed in limited circumstances, or when insufficient historical experience with products in a similar therapeutic area, distribution method or other characteristic is available. this typically occurs when the new product is not an extension of an existing line of product or when historical experience with products in a similar therapeutic category is lacking. estimated levels of inventory in the distribution channel and projected demand are also considered in estimating sales returns for new products.
use of information from external sources information from external sources is used to estimate gtn adjustments. our estimate of inventory at the wholesalers are based on the projected prescription demand-based sales for our products and historical inventory experience, as well as our analysis of third-party information, including written and oral information obtained from certain wholesalers with respect to their inventory levels and sell-through to customers and third-party market research data, and our internal information. the inventory information received from wholesalers is a product of their recordkeeping process and excludes inventory held by intermediaries to whom they sell, such as retailers and hospitals.
we have also continued the practice of combining retail and mail prescription volume on a retail-equivalent basis. we use this methodology for internal demand forecasts. we also use information from external sources to identify prescription trends, patient demand and average selling prices. our estimates are subject to inherent limitations of estimates that rely on third-party information, as certain third-party information was itself in the form of estimates, and reflect other limitations including lags between the date as of which third-party information is generated and the date on which we receive third-party information.
retirement benefits accounting for pension and postretirement benefit plans requires actuarial valuations based on significant assumptions for discount rates and expected long-term rates of return on plan assets. in consultation with our actuaries, these significant assumptions and others such as salary growth, retirement, turnover, healthcare trends and mortality rates are evaluated and selected based on expectations or actual experience during each remeasurement date. pension expense could vary within a range of outcomes and have a material effect on reported earnings, projected benefit obligations and future cash funding. actual results in any given year may differ from those estimated because of economic and other factors.
the yield on high quality corporate bonds that coincides with the cash flows of the plans' estimated payouts is used in determining the discount rate. the citi pension discount curve is used for the u.s. plans. the present value of benefit obligations at december 31, 2017 for the u.s. pension plans was determined using a 3.5% discount rate. if the assumed discount rate used in determining the u.s. pension plans' projected benefit obligation at december 31, 2017 was reduced by an additional 1%, the projected benefit obligation would increase by approximately $950 million.
the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is estimated considering expected returns for individual asset classes with input from external advisors. we also consider long-term historical returns including actual performance compared to benchmarks for similar investments. the u.s. plans' pension expense for 2017 was determined using a 7.8% expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. if the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets used in determining the u.s. plans' pension expense for 2017 was reduced by 1%, such expense would increase by $40 million.
for a more detailed discussion on retirement benefits, refer to "item 8. financial statements-note 16. pension, postretirement and postemployment liabilities."
business combinations and divestitures goodwill and other intangible assets acquired in business combinations, licensing and other transactions were $8.1 billion (representing 24% of total assets) at december 31, 2017.
48
accounting for transactions as business combinations and divestitures is significantly different than asset acquisitions and divestitures. for example, acquired iprd is capitalized for business combinations and expensed for asset acquisitions and the fair value of contingent consideration and goodwill are only recognized in business combination transactions. likewise, when a portion of a reporting unit that constitutes a business is divested, goodwill associated with that business is included in the carrying value of the business in determining the gain or loss. derecognition of goodwill does not occur in asset dispositions. as a result, it is important to determine whether a business or an asset or group of assets is acquired or divested. a business is defined in asc 805 - business combinations as an integrated set of inputs and processes that are capable of generating outputs that have the ability to provide a return to its investors or owners. typical inputs include long-lived assets (including intangible assets or rights to use long-lived assets), intellectual property and the ability to obtain access to required resources. typical processes include strategic, operational and resource management processes that are typically documented or evident through an organized workforce.
we consider all of the above factors when determining whether a business was acquired (or divested) as well as the compound's development phase if no commercial products are involved. for example, in evaluating our acquisitions of ifm, cormorant, padlock, cardioxyl and flexus during the past three years, we concluded that no significant processes were transferred to us, thus the transactions were accounted for as asset acquisitions. as a result, the amounts allocated to the lead investigational compounds were expensed and not capitalized. in addition, contingent consideration from potential development, regulatory, approval and sales-based milestones and sales-based royalties were not included in the purchase price. refer to "item 8. financial statements-note 4. acquisitions and divestitures" for further discussion on our acquisitions.
similarly, in evaluating divestitures of our small molecule manufacturing operations in swords, ireland, investigational hiv medicines business, the businesses comprising the alliance with reckitt, the medicines company, valeant pharmaceuticals international, inc., erbitux* and ixempra*, we concluded that all necessary inputs and processes were transferred, and consequently the transactions were accounted for as sales of businesses, which resulted in the allocation of goodwill ($12 million in 2017, $98 million in 2016 and $73 million in 2015) to the carrying value of the businesses in determining the gain on sale. contingent proceeds related to divestitures were not recognized until realized. we also concluded that not all inputs and significant processes to be capable of generating outputs were transferred in our out-licensing arrangements with biogen and roche, and consequently these transactions were not accounted for as sales of businesses in 2017.
long-lived assets other intangible assets, including iprd other intangible assets were $1.2 billion at december 31, 2017, including licenses ($254 million of which $152 million is allocated to unapproved products), developed technology rights ($565 million), capitalized software ($359 million) and iprd ($32 million). intangible assets are assessed for impairment whenever current facts or circumstances warrant a review, although iprd is assessed at least annually. intangible assets are highly vulnerable to impairment charges, particularly newly acquired assets for recently launched products or iprd. these assets are initially measured at fair value and therefore any reduction in expectations used in the valuations could potentially lead to impairment. some of the more common potential risks leading to impairment include competition, earlier than expected loe, pricing pressures, adverse regulatory changes or clinical study results, delay or failure to obtain regulatory approval and additional development costs, inability to achieve expected synergies, higher operating costs, changes in tax laws and other macro-economic changes. the complexity in estimating the fair value of intangible assets in connection with an impairment test is similar to the initial valuation.
considering the high risk nature of research and development and the industry's success rate of bringing developmental compounds to market, impairment charges are likely to occur in future periods. we recognized a $75 million charge in 2017 for f-star alpha's fs102 which was in phase i development for the treatment of breast and gastric cancer and $160 million in 2015 for bms-986020 which was in phase ii development for treatment of ipf. for discussion on iprd impairments, refer to "item 8. financial statements-note 13. goodwill and other intangible assets."
49
property, plant and equipment property, plant and equipment is tested for impairment whenever current facts or circumstances require a review including whether it is more likely than not that the asset will be disposed of prior to its estimated remaining useful life. additionally, these long-lived assets are periodically reviewed to determine if any change in facts or circumstances would result in a change to the estimated useful life of the asset, possibly resulting in the acceleration of depreciation. if such circumstances exist, an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows generated by the asset, or the appropriate grouping of assets, is compared to the carrying value to determine whether an impairment exists at its lowest level of identifiable cash flows. if an asset is determined to be impaired, the loss is measured based on the difference between the asset's fair value and its carrying value. expectations of future cash flows are subject to change based upon the near and long-term production volumes and margins generated by the asset as well as any potential alternative future use. the divestiture of our small molecule active pharmaceutical ingredient manufacturing operations in swords, ireland and sale of our r&d facility in wallingford, connecticut, resulted in $146 million and $79 million in impairment charges, respectively, to reduce the carrying value of assets held-for-sale to their fair value in 2017. accelerated depreciation, impairment and other related charges for certain manufacturing and r&d facilities were $533 million in 2017, $104 million in 2016 and $115 million in 2015. additional charges will continue to occur as a result of the company's restructuring actions announced in the fourth quarter of 2016.
assets held-for-sale the following criteria is considered before concluding assets are classified as held-for-sale; 1) management's commitment to a plan to sell, 2) availability for immediate sale in its present condition, 3) initiation of an active program to identify a buyer, 4) probability of a completed sale within one year, 5) actively marketed for sale at a reasonable price in relation to its current fair value, and 6) likelihood of significant changes to the plan will be made or that the plan will be withdrawn. if all of the criteria is met as of the balance sheet date, the net assets are presented separately in the balance sheet as held-for-sale at the lower of its carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell and is no longer depreciated or amortized while classified as held-for-sale. for example, in evaluating the divestitures of our small molecule manufacturing operations in swords, ireland and our sale of our r&d facility in wallingford, connecticut, we concluded that all the necessary held-for-sale criteria were met in 2017 in a quarterly period prior to the completed sale. in evaluating the divestitures of the investigational hiv medicines business, the businesses comprising the alliances with reckitt and lilly, we concluded that all the necessary held-for-sale criteria were met in 2015.
income taxes valuation allowances are recognized to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. the assessment of whether or not a valuation allowance is required often requires significant judgment including long-range forecasts of future taxable income and evaluation of tax planning initiatives. adjustments to the deferred tax valuation allowances are made to earnings in the period when such assessments are made. our deferred tax assets were $2.3 billion at december 31, 2017 (net of valuation allowances of $2.8 billion) and $4.3 billion at december 31, 2016 (net of valuation allowances of $3.1 billion).
the u.s. federal net operating loss carryforwards were $317 million at december 31, 2017. these carryforwards were acquired as a result of certain acquisitions and are subject to limitations under section 382 of the internal revenue code. the net operating loss carryforwards expire in varying amounts beginning in 2022. the foreign and state net operating loss carryforwards expire in varying amounts beginning in 2018 (certain amounts have unlimited lives).
as discussed more fully in the results of operations section of this md&a, tax charges attributed to the one-time deemed repatriation tax on certain foreign earnings of $2.6 billion were recognized in the fourth quarter of 2017. the accounting for this income tax effect of the act was incomplete as of the issuance date of the financial statements as we did not have all of the necessary information available, prepared and analyzed to complete the accounting. however, we were able to make a reasonable estimate of this tax, which was recorded as a provisional amount. the provisional amount may change when completed in 2018 upon finalizing the 2017 taxable income, untaxed post-1986 foreign earnings and profits and related cash and certain eligible assets of the specified foreign corporations. the provisional amounts may also change if additional interpretations of the relevant tax code are released.
prior to the mead johnson split-off in 2009, the following transactions occurred: (i) an internal spin-off of mead johnson shares while still owned by us; (ii) conversion of mead johnson class b shares to class a shares; and; (iii) conversion of mead johnson & company to a limited liability company. these transactions as well as the split-off of mead johnson through the exchange offer should qualify as tax-exempt transactions under the internal revenue code based upon a private letter ruling received from the internal revenue service related to the conversion of mead johnson class b shares to class a shares, and outside legal opinions.
50
certain assumptions, representations and covenants by mead johnson were relied upon regarding the future conduct of its business and other matters which could affect the tax treatment of the exchange. for example, the current tax law generally creates a presumption that the exchange would be taxable to us, if mead johnson or its shareholders were to engage in transactions that result in a 50% or greater change in its stock ownership during a four year period beginning two years before the exchange offer, unless it is established that the exchange offer were not part of a plan or series of related transactions to effect such a change in ownership. if the internal spin-off or exchange offer were determined not to qualify as a tax exempt transaction, the transaction could be subject to tax as if the exchange was a taxable sale by us at market value.
in addition, a negative basis or excess loss account (ela) existed in our investment in stock of mead johnson prior to these transactions. we received an opinion from outside legal counsel to the effect that it is more likely than not that we eliminated the ela as part of these transactions and do not have taxable income with respect to the ela. the tax law in this area is complex and it is possible that even if the internal spin-off and the exchange offer is tax exempt under the internal revenue code, the irs could assert that we have additional taxable income for the period with respect to the ela. we could be exposed to additional taxes if this were to occur. based upon our understanding of the internal revenue code and opinion from outside legal counsel, a tax reserve of $244 million was established reducing the gain on disposal of mead johnson included in discontinued operations in 2009.
we agreed to certain tax related indemnities with mead johnson as set forth in the tax sharing agreement, including certain taxes related to its business prior to the completion of the ipo and created as part of the restructuring to facilitate the ipo. mead johnson has also agreed to indemnify us for potential tax effects resulting from the breach of certain representations discussed above as well as certain transactions related to the acquisition of mead johnson's stock or assets.
liabilities are established for possible assessments by tax authorities resulting from known tax exposures including, but not limited to, transfer pricing matters, tax credits and deductibility of certain expenses. such liabilities represent a reasonable provision for taxes ultimately expected to be paid and may need to be adjusted over time as more information becomes known.
for discussions on income taxes, refer to "item 8. financial statements-note 1. accounting policies-income taxes" and "-note 7. income taxes."
contingencies in the normal course of business, we are subject to contingencies, such as legal proceedings and claims arising out of our business, that cover a wide range of matters, including, among others, government investigations, shareholder lawsuits, product and environmental liability, contractual claims and tax matters. we recognize accruals for such contingencies when it is probable that a liability will be incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. these estimates are subject to uncertainties that are difficult to predict and, as such, actual results could vary from these estimates.
for discussions on contingencies, refer to "item 8. financial statements-note 1. accounting policies-contingencies," "-note 7. income taxes" and "-note 18. legal proceedings and contingencies."
product and pipeline developments our r&d programs are managed on a portfolio basis from early discovery through late-stage development and include a balance of early-stage and late-stage programs to support future growth. our late stage r&d programs in phase iii development include both investigational compounds for initial indications and additional indications or formulations for marketed products. spending on these programs represent approximately 30-45% of our annual r&d expenses in the last three years. opdivo was the only investigational compound or marketed product that represented greater than 10% of our r&d expenses in the last three years. our late-stage development programs could potentially have an impact on our revenue and earnings within the next few years if regulatory approvals are obtained and products are successfully commercialized. the following are the developments in our marketed products and our late-stage pipeline:

special note regarding forward-looking statements this annual report on form 10-k (including documents incorporated by reference) and other written and oral statements we make from time to time contain certain "forward-looking" statements within the meaning of section 27a of the securities act of 1933 and section 21e of the securities exchange act of 1934. you can identify these forward-looking statements by the fact they use words such as "should", "expect", "anticipate", "estimate", "target", "may", "project", "guidance", "intend", "plan", "believe" and other words and terms of similar meaning and expression in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance. one can also identify forward-looking statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. such forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and involve inherent risks and uncertainties, including factors that could delay, divert or change any of them, and could cause actual outcomes to differ materially from current expectations. these statements are likely to relate to, among other things, our goals, plans and projections regarding our financial position, results of operations, cash flows, market position, product development, product approvals, sales efforts, expenses, performance or results of current and anticipated products and the outcome of contingencies such as legal proceedings and financial results, which are based on current expectations that involve inherent risks and uncertainties, including internal or external factors that could delay, divert or change any of them in the next several years. we have included important factors in the cautionary statements included in this annual report on form 10-k, particularly under "item 1a. risk factors," that we believe could cause actual results to differ materially from any forward-looking statement.
although we believe we have been prudent in our plans and assumptions, no assurance can be given that any goal or plan set forth in forward-looking statements can be achieved and readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such statements, which speak only as of the date made. we undertake no obligation to release publicly any revisions to forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

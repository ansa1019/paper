item 1a.   risk factors investors should carefully consider the risks, uncertainties, and other factors described below, as well as other disclosures in management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations, because they could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results, cash flows, and growth prospects. these risks are not the only risks we face. our business operations could also be affected by additional factors that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial.
we have organized the risk factors into two sections: (1) risks related to our business; and (2) risks related to our indebtedness.
risks related to our business the company has substantial operations and sells a significant portion of our products outside of the u.s. and purchases important components, including final products, from suppliers located outside the u.s. shipments to non-u.s. customers are expected to continue to account for a material portion of net sales. we also expect to continue the use of third-party contract manufacturing services with non-u.s. production and assembly operations for our products.
risks associated with operations, sales, and purchases outside the united states include:
•   fluctuating foreign currency rates could restrict sales, increase costs of purchasing, and impact collection of receivables outside of the u.s.;
•   volatility in foreign credit markets may affect the financial well-being of our customers and suppliers;
•   violations of anti-corruption laws, including the foreign corrupt practices act and the u.k. bribery act could result in large fines and penalties;
•   adverse changes in, or uncertainty of, local business laws or practices, including the following:
•   foreign governments may impose burdensome tariffs, quotas, taxes, trade barriers, or capital flow restrictions;
•   restrictions on the export or import of technology may reduce or eliminate the ability to sell in or purchase from certain markets;
•   political and economic instability may reduce demand for our products or put our non-u.s. assets at risk;
•   potentially limited intellectual property protection in certain countries may limit recourse against infringing on our products or cause us to refrain from selling in certain geographic territories;
•   staffing may be difficult along with higher turnover at international operations;
•   a government controlled exchange rate and limitations on the convertibility of currencies, including the chinese yuan;
•   transportation delays and customs related delays that may affect production and distribution of our products;
10
•   effectively managing and overseeing operations that are distant and remote from corporate headquarters may be difficult; and
•   integration and enforcement of laws varies significantly among jurisdictions and may change significantly over time.
the company may not be able to continue to develop products or solutions to address user needs effectively in an industry characterized by ongoing change. to be successful, we must adapt to rapidly changing technological and application needs by continually improving our products, as well as introducing new products and services, to address user demands.
the company's industry is characterized by:
•   evolving industry standards;
•   frequent new product and service introductions;
•   evolving distribution channels;
•   increasing demand for customized product and software solutions;
•   changing customer demands; and
•   changing security protocols.
future success will depend on our ability to effectively and economically adapt in this evolving environment. we could incur substantial costs if we must modify our business to adapt to these changes, and may even be unable to adapt to these changes.
the company participates in a competitive industry, which may become more competitive. competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technology and changes in customer requirements. we face significant competition in developing and selling our products and solutions. to remain competitive, we believe we must continue to effectively and economically provide:
•   technologically advanced systems that satisfy user demands;
•   superior customer service;
•   high levels of quality and reliability; and
•   dependable and efficient distribution networks.
we cannot assure we will be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors. increased competition in mobile computing products, data capture products, printers, or supplies may result in price reductions, lower gross profit margins, and loss of market share, and could require increased spending on research and development, sales and marketing, and customer support. some competitors may make strategic acquisitions or establish cooperative relationships with suppliers or companies that produce complementary products, which may create additional pressures on our competitive position in the marketplace.
the company is vulnerable to the potential difficulties associated with the increase in the complexity of our business. we have grown rapidly over the last several years through the acquisition and worldwide growth. this growth has caused increased complexities in the business. we believe our future success depends in part on our ability to manage our growth and increased complexities of our business. the following factors could present difficulties to us:
•   managing our distribution channel partners;
•   managing our contract manufacturing and supply chain;
•   manufacturing an increased number of products;
•   increased administrative and operational burden;
•   maintaining and improving information technology infrastructure to support growth;
•   increased logistical problems common to complex, expansive operations;
•   increasing international operations; and
•   attract, develop and retain individuals with the requisite technical expertise to develop new technologies and introduce new products and solutions.
inability to consummate future acquisitions at appropriate prices could negatively impact our growth rate and stock price. our ability to expand revenues, earnings, and cash flow depends in part upon our ability to identify and successfully acquire and integrate businesses at appropriate prices and to realize anticipated synergies. acquisitions can be difficult to identify and consummate due to competition among prospective buyers and the need to satisfy applicable closing conditions and obtain antitrust and other regulatory approval on acceptable terms.
11
the company could encounter difficulties in any acquisition it undertakes, including unanticipated integration problems and business disruption. acquisitions could also dilute stockholder value and adversely affect operating results. we may acquire or make investments in other businesses, technologies, services, or products. an acquisition may present business issues which are new to us. the process of integrating any acquired business, technology, service, or product into our operations may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures. integration of an acquired company also may consume considerable management time and attention, which could otherwise be available for ongoing operations and the further development of our existing business. these and other factors may result in benefits of an acquisition not being fully realized.
acquisitions also may involve a number of risks, including:
•   difficulties and uncertainties in retaining the customers or other business relationships from the acquired entities;
•   the loss of key employees of acquired entities;
•   the ability of acquired entities to fulfill their customers' obligations;
•   the discovery of unanticipated issues or liabilities;
•   pre-closing and post-closing acquisition-related earnings charges could adversely impact operating results and cash flows in any given period, and the impact may be substantially different from period to period;
•   the failure of acquired entities to meet or exceed expected returns could result in impairment of goodwill or intangible assets acquired;
•   the acquired entities' ability to implement internal controls and accounting systems necessary to be compliant with requirements applicable to public companies subject to sec reporting, which could result in misstated financial reports; and
•   future acquisitions could result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities or the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities.
infringement by the company or our suppliers on the proprietary rights of others could put us at a competitive disadvantage, and any related litigation could be time consuming and costly. third parties may claim that we or our suppliers violated their intellectual property rights. to the extent of a violation of a third-party's patent or other intellectual property right, we may be prevented from operating our business as planned, and may be required to pay damages, to obtain a license, if available, or to use a non-infringing method, if possible, to accomplish our objectives. any of these claims, with or without merit, could result in costly litigation and divert the attention of key personnel. if such claims are successful, they could result in costly judgments or settlements. also, as new technologies emerge the intellectual property rights of parties in such technologies can be uncertain. as a result, our products involving such technologies may have higher risk of claims of infringement of the intellectual proprietary rights of third parties.
the inability to protect intellectual property could harm our reputation, and our competitive position may be materially damaged. our intellectual property is valuable and provides us with certain competitive advantages. we use copyrights, patents, trademarks, trade secrets, and contracts to protect these proprietary rights. despite these precautions, third parties may be able to copy or reproduce aspects of our intellectual property and our products or, without authorization, to misappropriate and use information, which we regard as trade secrets. additionally, the intellectual property rights we obtain may not be sufficient to provide us with a competitive advantage and may be successfully challenged, invalidated, circumvented, or infringed. in any infringement litigation that the company may undertake to protect our intellectual property, any award of monetary damages may be unlikely or very difficult to obtain, and any such award we may receive may not be commercially valuable. furthermore, efforts to enforce or protect our proprietary rights may be ineffective and could result in the invalidation or narrowing of the scope of our intellectual property and incurring substantial litigation costs. because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of the company's confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation. some aspects of our business and services also rely on technologies, software, and content developed by or licensed from third parties, and we may not be able to maintain our relationships with such third parties or enter into similar relationships in the future on reasonable terms or at all.
we currently use third party and/or open source operating systems and associated application ecosystems in certain of our products. such parties ceasing continued development of the operating system or restricting our access to such operating system could adversely impact our business and financial results. we are dependent on third-parties' continued development of operating systems, software application ecosystem infrastructures, and such third-parties' approval of our implementations of their operating system and associated applications. if such parties cease to continue development or support of such operating systems or restrict our access to such operating systems, we would be required to change our strategy for such devices. as a result, our financial results could be negatively impacted because a resulting shift away from the operating systems we currently use and the associated applications ecosystem could be costly and difficult. a strategy shift could increase the burden of development on the company and potentially create a gap in our portfolio for a period of time, which could competitively disadvantage us.
12
cybersecurity incidents could disrupt business operations. like many companies, we continually strive to meet industry information security standards relevant to our business. we periodically perform vulnerability assessments, remediate vulnerabilities, review log/access, perform system maintenance, manage network perimeter protection, implement and manage disaster recovery testing, and provide periodic educational sessions to our employees to foster awareness of schemes to access sensitive information. a cybersecurity incident could include an attempt to gain unauthorized access to digital systems for purposes of misappropriating assets or sensitive information, corrupting data, or causing operational disruption. "phishing" and other types of attempts to obtain unauthorized information or access are often sophisticated and difficult to detect or defeat.
a cybersecurity incident, including deliberate attacks and unintentional events, may lead to a material disruption of our core business systems, the loss or corruption of confidential business information and/or the disclosure of personal data that in each case could result in an adverse business impact, as well as, possible damage to our brand. this could also lead to a public disclosure or theft of private intellectual property and a possible loss of customer confidence.
while we have experienced and expect to continue to experience these types of threats and incidents, there have been no material incidents incurred to-date at the company. if our core business operations, or that of one of our third-party service providers, were to be breached, this could affect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of our systems and data. while we continue to perform security due diligence, there is always the possibility of a significant breach affecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of our systems and/or data.
our products that are deployed in customer environments also have the possibility of being breached, which could result in damage to a customer's confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the customer's data and systems. it is possible that such a breach could result in delays in, or loss of market acceptance of, our products and services; diversion of our resources; injury to our reputation; increased service and warranty expenses; and payment of damages. to date, we have had no material incidents related to the security on our products.
laws and regulations relating to the handling of personal data may result in increased costs, legal claims, or fines against the company. as part of our operations, the company collects, uses, stores, and transfers personal data of third parties and employees in and across jurisdictions. the governing bodies in such jurisdictions have adopted or are considering adopting laws and regulations regarding the collection, use, transfer, storage and disclosure of personal data obtained from third parties and employees; for example, general data protection regulation effective may 2018. these laws may result in burdensome or inconsistent requirements affecting the collection, use, storage, transfer and disclosure of our third party and employee personal data. compliance may require changes in services, business practices, or internal systems that result in increased costs, lower revenue, reduced efficiency, or greater difficulty in competing with foreign-based firms. failure to comply with existing or new rules may result in claims against the company or significant penalties or orders to stop the alleged noncompliant activity.
we may incur liabilities as a result of product failures due to actual or apparent design or manufacturing defects. we may be subject to product liability claims, which could include claims for property or economic damage or personal injury, in the event our products present actual or apparent design or manufacturing defects. such design or manufacturing defects may occur not only in our own designed products but also in components provided by third party suppliers. we generally have insurance protection against property damage and personal injury liabilities and also seek to limit such risk through product design, manufacturing quality control processes, product testing and contractual indemnification from suppliers. however, due to the large and growing size of the company's installed product base, a design or manufacturing defect involving this large installed product base could result in product recalls or customer service costs that could have material adverse effects on our financial results.
defects or errors in the company's software products could harm our reputation, result in significant cost to us, and impair our ability to market such products. our software may contain undetected errors, defects, or bugs. although we have not suffered significant harm from any errors, defects, or bugs to date, we may discover significant errors, defects, or bugs in the future that we may not be able to correct or correct in a timely manner. it is possible that errors, defects, or bugs will be found in our existing or future software products and related services with the possible results of delays in, or loss of market acceptance of, our products and services, diversion of our resources, injury to our reputation, increased service and warranty expenses, and payment of damages.
we depend on the ongoing services of our senior management and the ability to attract and retain key personnel. the future success of the company is substantially dependent on the continued services and continuing contributions of senior management and other key personnel. the ability to attract, retain, and motivate highly skilled employees is important to our long-term success. competition for skill sets in certain functions within our industry is intense, and we may be unable to retain key employees or attract, assimilate, or retain other highly qualified employees in the future. any disruption in the services of senior management or our ability to attract and retain key personnel may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
13
terrorist attacks or war could lead to further economic instability and adversely affect the company's stock price, operations, and profitability. the terrorist attacks that occurred in the united states on september 11, 2001 caused major instability in the u.s. and other financial markets. since then, a number of significant acts of terrorism have occurred, and war continues in the middle east, all of which may contribute to instability in financial markets. additional acts of terrorism and current and future war risks could have a similar impact. any such attacks could, among other things, cause further instability in financial markets and could directly, or indirectly through reduced demand, negatively affect our facilities and operations or those of our customers or suppliers.
the impact of potential changes in customs and trade policies in the united states and the potential corresponding actions by other countries in which the company does business could adversely affect our financial performance. the u.s. government has made proposals that are intended to address trade imbalances, which include encouraging increased production in the united states. these proposals could result in increased customs duties and the renegotiation of some u.s. trade agreements. the company imports a significant percentage of our products into the united states, and an increase in customs duties with respect to these imports could negatively impact the company's financial performance. if such customs duties are implemented, it also may cause the u.s.' trading partners to take actions with respect to u.s. imports or u.s. investment activities in their respective countries. any potential changes in trade policies in the united states and the potential corresponding actions by other countries in which the company does business could adversely affect the company's financial performance. given the level of uncertainty over which provisions will be enacted, the company cannot predict with certainty the impact of the proposals.
the effects of the tax cuts and jobs act on our business have not yet been fully analyzed and could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. on december 22, 2017, u.s. president donald trump signed into law the tax cuts and jobs act (the "tcja") that significantly reforms the internal revenue code of 1986, as amended. the tcja, among other things, includes changes to u.s. federal corporate income tax rate, imposes significant additional limitations on the deductibility of interest, allows for the accelerated expensing of capital expenditures, and puts into effect the migration from a "worldwide" system of taxation to a territorial system. we continue to analyze the impact the tcja may have on the company's business. notwithstanding the reduction in the u.s federal corporate income tax rate, the overall impact of the tcja is uncertain, and the company's business and financial condition could be adversely affected. we describe the estimated impact of the tcja on our business where appropriate throughout this form 10-k, and specifically in note 12, income taxes in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this form 10-k.
taxing authority challenges may lead to tax payments exceeding current reserves. we are subject to, and may become subject to, ongoing tax examinations in various jurisdictions. as a result, we may record incremental tax expense based on expected outcomes of such matters. in addition, we may adjust previously reported tax reserves based on expected results of these examinations. such adjustments could result in an increase or decrease to the company's effective tax rate and cash flows. future changes in tax law in various jurisdictions around the world and income tax holidays could have a material impact on our effective tax rate, foreign rate differential, future income tax expense, and cash flows.
forecasting our estimated annual effective tax rate is complex and subject to uncertainty, and there may be material differences between our forecasted and actual tax rates. forecasts of our income tax position and effective tax rate are complex, subject to uncertainty and periodic updates because our income tax position for each year combines the effects of a mix of profits earned and losses incurred by us in various tax jurisdictions with a broad range of income tax rates, as well as changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, the impact of various accounting rules and changes to these rules and tax laws, the results of examinations by various tax authorities, and the impact of any acquisition, business combination, disposition or other reorganization, or financing transaction.
as a multinational corporation, we conduct our business in many countries and are subject to taxation in many jurisdictions. the taxation of our business is subject to the application of multiple and sometimes conflicting tax laws and regulations, as well as multinational tax conventions. many countries are adopting revisions to their respective tax laws based on the on-going reports issued by the organization for economic co-operation and development ("oecd")/g20 base erosion and profit shifting ("beps") project, which, if enacted, could materially impact our tax liability due to our organizational structure and significant operations outside of the u.s. our effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic distribution of our worldwide earnings or losses resulting from our structure and operating model, the tax regulations and tax holidays in each geographic region, and the availability of tax credits and carry-forwards. the application of tax laws and regulations is subject to legal and factual interpretation, judgment, and uncertainty. tax laws themselves are subject to change as a result of changes in fiscal policy, changes in legislation, and the evolution of regulations and court rulings. consequently, taxing authorities may impose tax assessments or judgments against us that could materially impact our tax liability and/or our effective income tax rate.
14
economic conditions and financial market disruptions may adversely affect our business and results of operations. adverse economic conditions or reduced information technology spending may adversely impact our business. general disruption of financial markets and a related general economic downturn could adversely affect our business and financial condition through a reduction in demand for our products by our customers. if a slowdown were severe enough, it could require further impairment testing and write-downs of goodwill and other intangible assets. cost reduction actions may be necessary and might lead to restructuring charges. a tightening of financial credit could adversely affect our customers, suppliers, outsourced manufacturers, and channel partners (e.g., distributors and resellers) from obtaining adequate credit for the financing of significant purchases. an economic downturn could also result in a decrease in or cancellation of orders for our products and services; negatively impacting the ability to collect accounts receivable on a timely basis; result in additional reserves for uncollectible accounts receivable; and require additional reserves for inventory obsolescence. higher volatility and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates for the u.s. dollar against currencies such as the euro, the british pound, the chinese yuan, and the brazilian real could negatively impact product sales, margins, and cash flows.
a natural disaster may cause supply disruptions that could adversely affect our business and results of operations. natural disasters may occur in the future, and the company is not able to predict to what extent or duration any such disruptions will have on our ability to maintain ordinary business operations. the consequences of an unfortunate natural disaster may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
zebra could be adversely impacted by the united kingdom's withdrawal from the european union. zebra maintains its european regional headquarters and a label converting facility in the u.k. and has significant operations and sales throughout europe. although the u.k. has formally notified the e.u. of its intention to withdraw, such notice only triggered a two-year period ending in march 2019 to negotiate the terms of the withdrawal, which period could be followed by a transition period. because the terms of the u.k.'s withdrawal are uncertain, we are unable at this time to determine the impact on zebra's operations and business in the u.k. and europe. since the u.k.'s referendum in june 2016 to withdraw from the e.u., markets have been more volatile, including fluctuations in the british pound, that could adversely impact zebra's operating costs in the u.k. such market volatility could also cause customers to alter or delay buying decisions that would adversely impact zebra's sales in the u.k. and throughout europe. a significant portion of our business involves cross border transactions throughout the region. the future trade relationship between the u.k. and the e.u. could adversely impact zebra's operations in the region by increasing costs on or importation requirements on shipments between our distribution center in the netherlands and customers in the u.k. or between our facility in the u.k. and customers in the e.u.
we are exposed to risks under large, multi-year system and solutions and services contracts that may negatively impact our business. we enter into large, multi-year system and solutions and services contracts with our customers. this exposes us to risks, including among others: (i) technological risks, especially when the contracts involve new technology; (ii) financial risks, including the estimates inherent in projecting costs associated with large, long-term contracts and the related impact on operating results; and (iii) cyber security risk, especially in managed services contracts with customers that process personal data. recovery of front loaded capital expenditures in long-term managed services contracts with customers is dependent on the continued viability of such customers. the insolvency of customers could result in a loss of anticipated future revenue attributable to that program or product, which could have an adverse impact on our profitability.
we enter into fixed-price contracts that could subject us to losses in the event we fail to properly estimate our costs. if our initial cost estimates are incorrect, we can lose money on these contracts. because many of these contracts involve new technologies and applications and require the company to engage subcontractors and can last multiple years, unforeseen events, such as technological difficulties, fluctuations in the price of raw materials, problems with our subcontractors or suppliers and other cost overruns, can result in the contract pricing becoming less favorable or even unprofitable to us and have an adverse impact on our financial results. in addition, a significant increase in inflation rates could have an adverse impact on the profitability of longer-term contracts.
we utilize the services of subcontractors to perform under many of our contracts and the inability of our subcontractors to perform in a timely and compliant manner could negatively impact our performance obligations as the prime contractor. we engage subcontractors on many of our contracts and as we expand our global solutions and services business, our use of subcontractors has and will continue to increase. our subcontractors may further subcontract performance and may supply third-party products and software. we may have disputes with our subcontractors, including disputes regarding the quality and timeliness of work performed by the subcontractor or our subcontractors and the functionality, warranty and indemnities of products, software, and services supplied by our subcontractor. we are not always successful in passing along customer requirements to our subcontractors, and thus in some cases may be required to absorb contractual risks from our customers without corresponding back-to-back coverage from our subcontractor. our subcontractors may not be able to acquire or maintain the quality of the materials, components, subsystems and services they supply, or secure preferred warranty and indemnity coverage from their suppliers which might result in greater product returns, service problems, warranty claims and costs and regulatory compliance issues and could harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
15
over the last several years we have outsourced portions of certain business operations such as repair, distribution, engineering services and information technology services and may outsource additional business operations, which limits our control over these business operations and exposes us to additional risk as a result of the actions of our outsource partners. when we outsource certain business operations, we are not able to directly control these activities. our outsource partners may not prioritize our business over that of their other customers and they may not meet our desired level of service, cost reductions, or other metrics. in some cases, their actions may result in our being found to be in violation of laws or regulations like import or export regulations. as many of our outsource partners operate outside of the u.s., our outsourcing activity exposes us to information security vulnerabilities and increases our global risks. in addition, we are exposed to the financial viability of our outsource partners. once a business activity is outsourced, we may be contractually prohibited from, or may not practically be able to, bring such activity back within the company or move it to another outsource partner. the actions of our outsource partners could result in reputational damage to us and could negatively impact our financial results.
failure of our suppliers, subcontractors, distributors, resellers, and representatives to use acceptable legal or ethical business practices could negatively impact our business. it is our policy to require suppliers, subcontractors, distributors, resellers, and third-party sales representatives ("tpsrs") to operate in compliance with applicable laws, rules, and regulations regarding working conditions, employment practices, environmental compliance, anti-corruption, and trademark and copyright licensing. however, we do not control their labor and other business practices. if one of our suppliers, subcontractors, distributors, resellers, or tpsrs violates labor or other laws or implements labor or other business practices that are regarded as unethical, the shipment of finished products to us could be interrupted, orders could be canceled, relationships could be terminated, and our reputation could be damaged. if one of our suppliers or subcontractors fails to procure necessary license rights to trademarks, copyrights, or patents, legal action could be taken against us that could impact the saleability of the company's products and expose us to financial obligations to a third-party. any of these events could have a negative impact on our sales and results of operations.
we rely on third-party dealers, distributors, and resellers to sell many of our products. in addition to our own sales force, we offer our products through a variety of third-party dealers, distributors, and resellers. these third-parties may also market other products that compete with our products. failure of one or more of our dealers, distributors, or resellers to effectively promote our products could affect our ability to bring products to market and have a negative impact on our results of operations. as the company refines our channel program, some of our third-party dealers, distributors or resellers may exit the program due to modifications to the program structure, thereby reducing our ability to bring products to market and have a negative impact on our results of operations.
some of these third-parties are smaller and more likely to be impacted by a significant decrease in available credit that could result from a weakness in the financial markets. if credit pressures or other financial difficulties result in insolvency for third-party dealers, distributors, or retailers and we are unable to successfully transition end-customers to purchase our products from other third-parties or from us directly, it may cause, and in some cases, has caused, a negative impact on our financial results.
final assembly of certain of our products is performed by third-party electronics manufacturers. we may be dependent on these third-party electronics manufacturers as a sole-source of supply for the manufacture of such products. a failure by such manufacturers to provide manufacturing services to us as we require, or any disruption in such manufacturing services up to and including a catastrophic shut-down, may adversely affect our business results. because we rely on these third-party electronics manufacturers to manufacture our products, we may incur increased business continuity risks. we are not able to exercise direct control over the assembly or related operations of certain of our products. if these third-party manufacturers experience business difficulties or fail to meet our manufacturing needs, then we may be unable to satisfy customer product demands, lose sales, and be unable to maintain customer relationships. longer production lead times may result in shortages of certain products and inadequate inventories during periods of unanticipated higher demand. without such third parties continuing to manufacture our products, we may have no other means of final assembly of certain of our products until we are able to secure the manufacturing capability at another facility or develop an alternative manufacturing facility. this transition could be costly and time consuming.
although we carry business interruption insurance to cover lost sales and profits in an amount it considers adequate, in the event of supply disruption, this insurance does not cover all possible situations. in addition, the business interruption insurance would not compensate us for the loss of opportunity and potential adverse impact, both short-term and long-term, on relations with our existing customers going forward.
our future operating results depend on our ability to purchase a sufficient amount of materials, parts, and components, as well as services and software to meet the demands of customers. we source some of our components from sole source suppliers. any disruption to our suppliers or significant increase in the price of supplies could have a negative impact on our results of operations. our ability to meet customers' demands depends, in part, on our ability to obtain in a timely manner an adequate
16
delivery of quality materials, parts, and components, as well as services and software from our suppliers. in addition, certain supplies are available only from a single source or limited sources and we may not be able to diversify sources in a timely manner. if demand for our products or services increases from our current expectations or if suppliers are unable to meet our demand for other reasons, including as a result of natural disasters or financial issues, we could experience an interruption in supplies or a significant increase in the price of supplies that could have a negative impact on our business. we have experienced shortages in the past that have negatively impacted our results of operations and may experience such shortages in the future. credit constraints at our suppliers could cause us to accelerate payment of accounts payable by us, impacting our cash flow.
in addition, our current contracts with certain suppliers may be canceled or not extended by such suppliers and, therefore, not afford us with sufficient protection against a reduction or interruption in supplies. moreover, in the event any of these suppliers breach their contracts with us, our legal remedies associated with such a breach may be insufficient to compensate us for any damages it may suffer.
the unfavorable outcome of any pending or future litigation, arbitration, or administrative action could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. from time to time we are a party to litigation, arbitration, or administrative actions. our financial results and reputation could be negatively impacted by unfavorable outcomes to any pending or future litigation or administrative actions, including those related to the foreign corrupt practices act, the u.k. bribery act, or other anti-corruption laws. there can be no assurances as to the favorable outcome of any litigation or administrative proceedings. in addition, it can be very costly to defend litigation or administrative proceedings and these costs could negatively impact our financial results.
it is important that we are able to obtain many different types of insurance, and if we are not able to obtain insurance or exhaust our coverage we may be forced to retain the risk. we have many types of insurance coverage and are also self-insured for some risks and obligations. while the cost and availability of most insurance is stable, there are still certain types and levels of insurance that remain difficult to obtain, such as professional liability insurance, which is expensive to obtain for the amount of coverage often requested by certain customers. as we grow our global solutions and services business, we are being asked to obtain higher amounts of professional liability insurance, which could result in higher costs to do business. natural disasters and certain risks arising from securities claims, professional liability, and public liability are potential self-insured events that could negatively impact our financial results. in addition, while we maintain insurance for certain risks, the amount of our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all claims or liabilities, and we may be forced to bear substantial costs from an accident, incident, or claim.
we are subject to a wide range of product regulatory and safety, consumer, worker safety, and environmental laws. our operations and the products we manufacture and/or sell are subject to a wide range of product regulatory and safety, consumer, worker safety, and environmental laws and regulations. compliance with such existing or future laws and regulations could subject us to future costs or liabilities, impact our production capabilities, constrict our ability to sell, expand or acquire facilities, restrict what products and services we can offer, and generally impact our financial performance. some of these laws are environmental and relate to the use, disposal, remediation, emission and discharge of, and exposure to hazardous substances. these laws often impose liability and can require parties to fund remedial studies or actions regardless of fault. we continue to incur disposal costs and have ongoing remediation obligations. environmental laws have tended to become more stringent over time and any new obligations under these laws could have a negative impact on our operations or financial performance.
laws focused on the energy efficiency of electronic products and accessories; recycling of both electronic products and packaging; reducing or eliminating certain hazardous substances in electronic products; and the transportation of batteries continue to expand significantly. laws pertaining to accessibility features of electronic products, standardization of connectors and power supplies, the transportation of lithium-ion batteries, and other aspects are also proliferating. there are also demanding and rapidly changing laws around the globe related to issues such as product safety, radio interference, radio frequency radiation exposure, medical related functionality, and consumer and social mandates pertaining to use of wireless or electronic equipment. these laws, and changes to these laws, could have a substantial impact on whether we can offer certain products, solutions, and services, and on what capabilities and characteristics our products or services can or must include.
these laws impact our products and negatively affect our ability to manufacture and sell products competitively. we expect these trends to continue. in addition, we anticipate that it will see increased demand to meet voluntary criteria related to reduction or elimination of certain constituents from products, increasing energy efficiency, and providing additional accessibility.
section 404 of the sarbanes-oxley act of 2002 requires us to document and test our internal controls over financial reporting and to report on our assessment as to the effectiveness of these controls. any negative reports concerning our internal controls

could adversely affect our future results of operations and financial condition. we may discover areas of our internal controls that need improvement. we cannot be certain that any remedial measures we take will ensure appropriate implementation and maintenance of adequate internal controls over the financial reporting processes and reporting in the future. we may incur significant additional costs in order to ensure we adequately remediate any weaknesses identified in our internal control environment, which, in turn, would reduce our earnings. implementing any remedial measures may be complicated by the limited timeframe in which to implement such measures, and the possibility that implementation of such measures may require a substantial amount of work and time by our personnel.
any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or difficulties encountered in their implementation, could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. if we are unable to conclude that we have effective internal controls over financial reporting, or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to provide us with an unqualified report regarding the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting, investors could lose confidence in the reliability of our financial statements. failure to comply with section 404 of the sarbanes-oxley act of 2002 could potentially subject us to sanctions or investigations by the sec, or other regulatory authorities. in addition, failure to comply with our reporting obligations with the sec may cause an event of default to occur under the debt agreements, or similar instruments governing any debt we or our subsidiaries incur in the future.
we could be adversely impacted by changes in accounting standards and subjective assumptions, estimates and judgments by management related to complex accounting matters. generally accepted accounting principles and related accounting pronouncements, implementation guidelines, and interpretations with regard to a wide range of matters that are relevant to our businesses, including, but not limited to, revenue recognition, asset impairment, impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets, inventories, customer rebates and other customer consideration, tax matters, and litigation and other contingent liabilities are highly complex and involve many subjective assumptions, estimates, and judgments. changes in these rules or their interpretation or changes in underlying assumptions, estimates, or judgments could significantly change our reported or expected financial performance or financial condition. new accounting guidance may also require systems and other changes that could increase our operating costs and/or change our financial statements. for example, implementing future accounting guidance related to revenue, accounting for leases and other areas could require us to make significant changes to our accounting systems, impact to existing credit agreements and could result in adverse changes to our financial statements.
risks related to our indebtedness in connection with the acquisition, we incurred substantial debt obligations. our total outstanding debt for borrowed money was approximately $3.25 billion on october 27, 2014. at december 31, 2017, the remaining principal amount of indebtedness was $2.2 billion, gross of unamortized discounts and debt issuance costs. in addition, subject to restrictions in agreements governing our existing and future indebtedness, we may incur additional indebtedness. our substantial level of indebtedness could have important consequences, including the following:
•   we may experience difficulty in satisfying our obligations with respect to our existing indebtedness or future indebtedness;
•   our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or general corporate purposes may be impaired;
•   we plan to use a substantial portion of cash flow from operations to pay interest and principal on our indebtedness, which may reduce the funds available to ourselves for other purposes, such as acquisitions and capital expenditures;
•   we may be at a competitive disadvantage with reduced flexibility in planning for, or responding to, changing conditions in the industry, including increased competition; and
•   we may be more vulnerable to economic downturns and adverse developments in the business.
we expect to fund our expenses and to pay the principal and interest on our indebtedness from cash flow from operations. our ability to meet our expenses and to pay principal and interest on our indebtedness when due depends on our future performance, which will be affected by financial, business, economic, and other factors. we will not be able to control many of these factors, such as economic conditions in the markets where we operate and pressure from competitors.
despite our indebtedness, we may need to incur substantially more indebtedness and take other actions that could further exacerbate the risk associated with our existing indebtedness. at december 31, 2017, the remaining principal amount of indebtedness was $2.2 billion, gross of unamortized discounts and debt issuance costs. in addition to our current financing activities, we may need to incur substantially more indebtedness in the future, resulting in higher leverage. subject to the limits contained in our debt agreements, we may incur additional indebtedness from time to time to finance working capital, capital expenditures, investments or acquisitions, or for other purposes. to the extent we incur additional indebtedness, the risks associated with our substantial indebtedness will be exacerbated.

our use of derivative financial instruments to reduce interest rate risk may result in added volatility in our quarterly operating results. we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. however, we do utilize derivative financial instruments to reduce interest rate risk associated with our indebtedness. to manage variable interest rate risk, we entered into forward interest rate swap agreements, which will effectively convert a portion of our indebtedness into a fixed rate loan. under generally accepted accounting principles, the fair values of the swap contracts, which will either be amounts receivable from or payable to counterparties, are reflected as either assets or liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. we record our fair value change in our consolidated statements of operations, as a component of "other, net" if not hedged. the associated impact on our quarterly operating results is directly related to changes in prevailing interest rates. if interest rates increase, we would have a non-cash gain on the swaps, and vice versa in the event of a decrease in interest rates. consequently, these swap contracts introduce complexity to our operating results.
restrictive covenants in the debt agreements may limit our current and future operations, particularly our ability to respond to changes in our business or to pursue our business strategies. the debt agreements contain, and instruments governing any future indebtedness may contain, a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions, including restrictions on our ability to take actions that we believe may be in our interest. we expect these covenants will limit our ability to:
•   incur additional indebtedness or guarantees;
•   pay dividends or make other distributions or repurchase or redeem our stock or prepay or redeem certain indebtedness;
•   sell or dispose of assets and issue capital stock of restricted subsidiaries;
•   incur liens or enter into sale-leaseback transactions;
•   enter into agreements restricting our subsidiaries' ability to pay dividends;
•   enter into transactions with affiliates;
•   engage in new lines of business;
•   consolidate, merge or enter into other fundamental changes;
•   make loans, investments and/or acquisitions; and
•   enter into amendments or modifications of certain material subordinated debt agreements or organizational documents.
additionally, the debt instruments entered into to fund a portion of the acquisition requires us to maintain in certain circumstances compliance with a consolidated total secured net leverage ratio. our ability to comply with this ratio may be affected by events beyond our control, and we cannot assure you that we will meet this ratio. the restrictions could adversely affect our ability to:
•   finance operations;
•   make needed capital expenditures;
•   make strategic acquisitions or investments or enter into alliances;
•   withstand a future downturn in our business or the economy in general;
•   engage in business activities, including future opportunities, that may be in our interest; and
•   plan for or react to market conditions or otherwise execute our business strategies.
a breach of any of the covenants contained in the debt agreements (including an inability to comply with the financial maintenance covenants) that is not remedied within the applicable cure period, if any, would result in an event of default under the debt agreements. if, when required, we are unable to repay or refinance our indebtedness or amend the covenants contained in the debt agreements, or if a default otherwise occurs that is not cured or waived, the lenders or holders of our debt could elect to declare all borrowings outstanding, together with accrued interest and other fees, to be immediately due and payable or institute foreclosure proceedings against those assets that secure the borrowings. should the outstanding obligations be accelerated and become due and payable because of any failure to comply with the applicable covenants in the future, we would be required to search for alternative measures to finance current and ongoing obligations of our business. there can be no assurance that such financing will be available on acceptable terms, if at all. any of these scenarios could adversely impact our liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.
a significant amount of cash will be required to service our indebtedness. our ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness and to fund working capital needs, general corporate expenditures and planned capital expenditures depends on our ability to generate a significant amount of cash. this, to a certain extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, business, legislative, regulatory, and other factors that are beyond our control.
if our business does not generate sufficient cash flows from operations or if future borrowings are not available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs, we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before the maturity thereof, sell assets, reduce or delay capital investments, or seek to raise additional capital, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our operations. in addition, we may not be able to affect
19
any of these actions, if necessary, on commercially reasonable terms or at all. our ability to restructure or refinance our indebtedness will depend on the condition of the capital and debt markets and our financial condition at such time. any refinancing of our indebtedness could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict business operations. the terms of anticipated or future debt instruments may limit or prevent us from taking any of these actions. in addition, any failure to make scheduled payments of interest and/or principal on outstanding indebtedness would likely result in a reduction of our credit rating, which could harm our ability to access additional capital on commercially reasonable terms or at all. our inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt service obligations, or to refinance or restructure our obligations on commercially reasonable terms or at all, would have an adverse effect, which could be material, on our business, financial condition and results of operations, as well as on our ability to satisfy the obligations in respect of our indebtedness.
item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the company is a global leader respected for innovative eai solutions in the automatic information and data capture solutions industry. we design, manufacture, and sell a broad range of products that capture and move data, including: mobile computers; barcode scanners and imagers; rfid readers; specialty printers for barcode labeling and personal identification; rtls; related accessories and supplies, such as self-adhesive labels and other consumables; and software utilities and applications. we also provide a full range of services, including maintenance, technical support, and repair, managed and professional services, including cloud-based subscriptions. end-users of our products and services include those in the retail and e-commerce, transportation and logistics, manufacturing, healthcare, hospitality, warehouse and distribution, energy and utilities, government and education enterprises around the world. benefits of our solutions include improved efficiency and workflow management, increased productivity and asset utilization, real-time, actionable enterprise information, and better customer experiences. we provide our products and services globally through a direct sales force and an extensive network of partners. we provide products and services in over 180 countries, with 114 facilities and approximately 7,000 employees worldwide.
segments the company's operations consist of two reportable segments: asset intelligence & tracking ("ait") and enterprise visibility & mobility ("evm").  in january 2018, the company changed the names of the reportable segments to better reflect business operations: (1) asset intelligence & tracking ("ait"), formerly legacy zebra, comprised of barcode and card printing, location solutions, supplies, and services; and (2) enterprise visibility & mobility ("evm"), formerly enterprise, comprised of mobile computing, data capture, rfid, and services.
asset intelligence & tracking the ait segment is an industry leader in barcode printing and asset tracking technologies. its major product lines include barcode and card printers, supplies, services and location solutions. industries served include retail and e-commerce, transportation and logistics, manufacturing, healthcare, and other end markets within the following regions: north america; europe, middle east, and africa; asia-pacific; and latin america.
enterprise visibility & mobility the evm segment is an industry leader in automatic information and data capture solutions. its major product lines include mobile computing, data capture, rfid, and services. industries served include retail and e-commerce, transportation and logistics, manufacturing, healthcare, and other end markets within the following regions: north america; europe, middle east, and africa; asia-pacific; and latin america.
geographic information for the year ended december 31, 2017, the company recorded $3.7 billion of net sales in its consolidated statements of operations, of which approximately 48.3% were attributable to north america; approximately 32.8% were attributable to europe, middle east, and africa ("emea"); and other foreign locations accounted for the remaining 18.9%. net sales attributable from each region are relatively consistent with the prior year period.
acquisition and integration in october 2014, the company acquired the enterprise business ("enterprise"), from motorola solutions, inc. ("msi") (the "acquisition") and began integration activities focused on creating "one zebra". our integration priorities centered on maintaining business continuity while identifying and implementing cost synergies, operating efficiencies, and integration of functional organizations and processes. another key focus of the integration was to exit msi-provided transition service agreements ("tsas") related primarily to it systems and support services. these tsas were an interim measure to continue the operations of the enterprise business without disruption while integration activities were completed. the company substantially completed its integration activities, including the implementation of a common enterprise resource planning system and has exited the last tsas with msi.
restructuring programs in the first quarter 2017, the company's executive leadership approved an initiative to continue the company's efforts to increase operational efficiency (the "productivity plan"). the company expects the productivity plan to build upon the exit and restructuring initiatives specific to the acquisition of the enterprise business ("enterprise") from motorola solutions, inc. in october 2014, (the "acquisition plan"). actions under the productivity plan include organizational design changes, process improvements and automation. implementation of actions identified through the productivity plan is expected to be substantially complete by december 2018. exit and restructuring costs are not included in the operating results of our segments as they are not deemed to impact the specific segment measures as reviewed by our chief operating decision maker and
24
therefore are reported as a component of corporate, eliminations. see note 15, segment information and geographic data in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form 10-k for further information.
total exit and restructuring charges of $12 million life-to-date and year-to-date specific to the productivity plan have been recorded through december 31, 2017 and relate to severance and related benefits, lease exit costs and other expenses. total remaining charges associated with this plan are expected to be in the range of $8 million to $12 million with activities expected to be substantially complete by the end of fiscal 2018.
total exit and restructuring charges of $69 million life-to-date specific to the acquisition plan have been recorded through december 31, 2017 and include severance and related benefits, lease exit costs and other expenses. charges related to the acquisition plan for the twelve-month period ended december 31, 2017 and 2016, were $4 million and $19 million, respectively. the company has substantially completed the activities associated with the acquisition plan.
see note 5, costs associated with exit and restructuring activities in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form 10-k for further information.
impact of u.s. tax reform the company is in the process of analyzing the impact of the tax cut and jobs act ("tcja" or "the act") signed into law on december 22, 2017 and has provisionally provided income tax expense of $72 million, including remeasurement of its net deferred tax assets at 21% of $35 million and the one-time transition tax of $37 million. the one-time transition tax impact has been reduced by approximately $10 million of income tax credit carryfowards, resulting in an estimated cash tax liability of $26 million, of which $2 million has been classified as a short term liability and $24 million as a long term liability, both to be remitted over the next eight years as follows (in millions):
one-time transition tax - payments due for calendar year tax returns
2017                                          2018                2019                2020                2021                2022                2023                2024
unremitted earnings payments        $2                  $2                  $2                  $2                  $2                  $4                  $5                  $7
the company expects that the greatest factor impacting its future effective tax rate is the federal reduction in the tax rate from 35% to 21%. primarily due to uncertainties in the interpretation of the one-time transition tax rules and the determination of cash or other specified assets, the december 31, 2017 effective tax rate could differ materially from the amount disclosed in the financial statements. as permitted, the company will update the estimates disclosed herein on a quarterly basis throughout 2018. see note 12, income taxes in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form 10-k for further information.
the company has reviewed the impact of other provisions of the act which took effect on january 1, 2018 and after. based on current operations, we estimate that the company will be subject to the global intangible low-taxed income and the deduction for foreign-derived intangible income provisions of the act. we estimate that the new limitations which defer u.s. interest deductions in excess of 30% of adjusted taxable income will not be applicable. additionally, the company will no longer be able to deduct compensation for its covered employees which exceeds the limitation under internal revenue code section 162(m).

(1) the company sold the wireless lan business in october 2016. the company excludes the impact of the net sales of this business in the prior year period when computing organic net sales growth.
(2) operating results reported in u.s. dollars are affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. foreign currency translation impact represents the difference in results that are attributable to fluctuations in the currency exchange rates used to convert the results for businesses where the functional currency is not the u.s. dollar. this impact is calculated by translating, for certain currencies, the current period results at the currency exchange rates used in the comparable prior year period, rather than the exchange rates in effect during the current period. in addition, we exclude the impact of the company's foreign currency hedging program in both the current and prior year periods.
(3) amounts included in corporate, eliminations consist of purchase accounting adjustments not reported in segments related to the acquisition.
2017 compared to 2016
net sales increased by $148 million or 4.1% compared with the prior year period. the increase in net sales was due to higher hardware sales in north america, emea, and latin america, offset by lower hardware sales in asia-pacific. the increase in hardware sales was largely attributable to increased sales of mobile computing, data capture, and barcode printing products, partially offset by the impact of the divestiture of the wireless lan business in october 2016. services sales were lower primarily due to the impact of the wireless lan divestiture. consolidated organic net sales growth was 6.5%, reflecting growth in all four geographic regions, most notably in emea and north america, and latin america.
gross margin as a percent of sales was 45.9%, or flat compared to the prior year. this reflects an increase in gross margin in the evm segment primarily due to changes in business mix and improved product costs, offset by lower ait segment gross margin driven primarily by higher overhead and services costs, and increased customer sales incentives.
operating expenses for the year ended december 31, 2017 and 2016, were $1.4 billion, or 37.3% of net sales and $1.6 billion or 43.7% of net sales, respectively. the reduction in operating expenses was primarily due to impairment charges related to the disposal of the company's wireless lan business in the prior year period, lower acquisition and integration costs, and lower amortization of intangible assets. during 2017, the company substantially completed its integration activities, including the implementation of a common enterprise resource planning system, associated with the acquisition. the company also exited the transition services agreements with motorola solutions. the decrease in amortization of intangible assets was due to certain assets reaching full amortization in 2017. exit and restructuring costs were also lower than the year-ago period due to the prior year charges that included costs associated with the divestiture of the wireless lan business. research and development costs were higher primarily due to increased incentive compensation expense associated with improved financial performance partially offset by the impact of the divestiture of the wireless lan business. general and administrative expenses were lower compared to the prior year period due primarily to reduced facility and it expenses, professional fees, and employee benefits costs, as well as the impact of the divestiture of the wireless lan business being offset partially by increased incentive compensation expense associated with improved financial performance.
operating income increased $242 million compared to the prior year. the increase was due to the decline in operating expenses as well as the increase in sales and gross profit.
interest expense was $227 million for the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to $193 million in the prior year. the increase over the prior year was driven by the payments for early debt extinguishment of $65 million and accelerated amortization of debt issuance costs related to the redemption of senior notes of $16 million offset, in part, by the impact of early repayments of debt and lower interest rates.
other non-operating expenses decreased $5 million to $6 million for the year ended december 31, 2017. this decrease is driven by long-term investment impairments of $1 million in the current year compared to $7 million in the prior year.
the company recognized tax expense of $71 million and $8 million for the period ending december 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. the company's effective tax rates were 80.7% and (6.2)% as of december 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. the company's effective tax rate was higher than the federal statutory rate of 35% primarily due to deferred income taxed on the outbound transfer of u.s. assets, an increase in uncertain tax benefits, increased valuation allowance for its foreign deferred tax assets, foreign non-deductible expenses, the one-time transition tax and remeasurement of its net u.s. deferred tax assets under u.s. tax reform. these increases were partially offset by the benefit of lower tax rates in foreign jurisdictions, recognition of deferred tax assets on intercompany asset transfers, the generation of tax credits in the current year, and deductions from vesting of equity compensation.
2016 compared to 2015
27
net sales decreased by $76 million or 2.1% compared with the prior year period. the decline in net sales is due to lower hardware sales in north america, emea, and latin america, including the unfavorable impact of foreign currency changes, partially offset by higher hardware sales in asia-pacific. the decline in hardware sales is largely attributable to lower sales of barcode printer, data capture, wireless lan products, and location solutions. organic net sales increased 0.4% compared to the prior year period, reflecting growth in asia-pacific and north america, offset by declines in emea, and latin america.
gross margin as a percent of sales was 45.9% compared to the prior year period of 45.0%. this improvement in gross margin reflects an increase in the evm segment gross margin primarily due to lower services and hardware product costs. ait segment gross margin decreased primarily due to lower sales demand and the impact of incentive programs, including the concessions to distributors of printer products imported into china, partially offset by product cost improvements.
operating expenses for the year ended december 31, 2016 and 2015, were $1.6 billion, or 43.7% and 44.0% of net sales, respectively. the reduction in operating expenses as a percentage of net sales reflects the company's continued focus on improving operating efficiency and controlling expenses. selling and marketing expenses were lower compared to the prior year due to the full-year impact of staff reductions implemented in 2015 and lower discretionary expenses and promotional spending. the decrease in research and development costs was primarily due to a reduction in headcount and other third-party resources, the impact from the divestiture of the wireless lan business, and shifting of headcount to lower cost engineering locations. the increase in general and administrative costs was primarily due to higher it related expenses, including increased support and maintenance costs for it infrastructure and business systems as we exit transition services agreements with motorola solutions, and increased legal fees and litigation related expenses. the decrease in amortization of intangibles was due to impairment charges taken in the current year along with other intangible assets becoming fully amortized. impairment of goodwill and other intangibles of $62 million was recorded during the third quarter related to the wireless lan business divestiture. the company has made significant progress on its integration activities associated with the acquisition, including exiting many transition services agreements with motorola solutions. this has resulted in a decline in acquisition and integration costs compared to the prior year period. exit and restructuring costs were lower due to a reduced level of restructuring activity as the company progresses with its restructuring plan related to the acquisition, partially offset by expenses associated with the company's divestiture of its wireless lan business.
operating income increased $43 million or 116.2% compared to the prior year. the increase was primarily due to the decline in operating expenses.
the company conducts business in multiple currencies throughout the world, thus has exposure to movements in foreign exchange rates with regard to non-functional denominated revenue, cash assets, and cash liabilities. as a result of these exposures, the company recognized a foreign exchange loss of $5 million for 2016.
interest expense was $193 million for the year ended december 31, 2016, flat compared to the prior year. early repayments of debt resulted in accelerated amortization costs while debt refinancing savings were offset by closing costs of the refinancing.
other non-operating expenses increased $10 million to $11 million for the year ended december 31, 2016. this increase is driven by long-term investment impairments of $7 million and an increase in accelerated loan discount amortization of $3 million due to the debt refinancing. see note 8, long-term debt for further information on the debt refinancing amendments.
in the period ending december 31, 2016, the company recognized tax expense of $8 million compared to a tax benefit of $22 million for 2015. the company's effective tax rates were (6.2)% and 12.2% as of december 31, 2016 and december 31, 2015, respectively. the company's effective tax rate was lower than the federal statutory rate of 35% primarily due to deferred income taxed on the outbound transfer of u.s. assets, pre-tax losses in the united states, and the rate differential between u.s. and foreign jurisdictions.
results of operations by segment the following commentary should be read in conjunction with the financial results of each operating business segment as detailed in note 15, segment information and geographic data in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this form 10-k. the segment results exclude purchase accounting adjustments, amortization of intangible assets, acquisition and integration costs, impairment of goodwill and intangibles, and exit and restructuring costs.

2017 compared to 2016
ait net sales for the period ending december 31, 2017 increased $64 million or 5.1% compared to prior year period. the increase in net sales was largely driven by higher sales of barcode and card printers, primarily in the emea and asia-pacific regions. sales of supplies and services were also higher than the prior year. the year-on-year growth also reflects a price concession to distributors of barcode printer products imported into china in the third quarter of 2016. during 2017, no additional price concession provisions were required and a reduction of the 2016 provision was recorded due to a change in import classification for barcode printers. ait organic net sales growth for the year-ended december 31, 2017 was 4.6%.
gross margin as a percentage of sales was 48.8% compared to 49.7% for comparable prior year period. the decrease in gross margin reflects higher overhead costs, including freight and costs associated with our regional distribution center transitions, higher services costs and increased customer sales incentives offset partially by lower provisions for price concessions to distributors of barcode printer products imported into china.
operating income increased 8.3% as a result of increased net sales and gross profit. operating expenses were comparable to the prior year period.
2016 compared to 2015
ait net sales for the period ending december 31, 2016 decreased $39 million or 3.0% compared to prior year period. the decline in net sales was primarily due to lower net sales of barcode printers and location solutions, and the unfavorable impact of foreign currency changes, most notably in emea which was partially offset by an increase in sales of supplies. the barcode printer sales decline was primarily due to lower sales in north america and emea. ait organic net sales declined compared to the prior year period by 1.2%.
gross margin as a percentage of sales was 49.7% compared to 50.9% for comparable prior year period. the decrease in gross margin included impacts from lower sales of barcode printers, the impact of incentive programs, including the concession to distributors of printer products imported into china, costs associated with the relocation of north american distribution operations, and the unfavorable impact of foreign currency changes. these factors were partially offset by manufacturing cost improvements in supplies and lower hardware product costs.
operating income declined 7.0% as a result of lower net sales and gross profit, partially offset by lower operating expenses.

the change in our cash and cash equivalents balance is reflective of the following:
2017 vs. 2016
cash flows from operations increased $98 million during 2017 to $478 million. this improvement was driven by an increase in net earnings of $154 million, partially offset by a decline in working capital primarily related to higher inventory levels and lower accounts payable. net inventory increased primarily as a result of growth in the business and changes in product mix, an increased backlog level compared to the prior year, and our recent transition to a new distribution model for our european operations. in addition, the prior year working capital benefited from the successful renegotiation of longer payment terms with vendors.
net cash used in the purchase of property, plant and equipment declined $27 million as compared to the prior year, as capital expenditures related to the acquisition integration were substantially completed in 2016. the prior year investing activities also included net cash proceeds of $39 million related to the sale of the wireless lan business.
net cash used in financing activities during 2017 consisted of proceeds related to the a&r credit agreement for term loan a of $688 million, a draw on the revolving credit facility of $275 million, and proceeds related to the receivables financing facility of $145 million. these proceeds were primarily used to redeem $1.1 billion in principal of the 7.25% senior notes, maturing october 2022. the company also had debt principal prepayments on term loan a and term loan b of $502 million and on the receivables financing facility of $10 million. as part of the repricing of term loan b, a portion of the debt was deemed to be modified and therefore, the company included $263 million in proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt, offset by $263 million in payments of long-term debt within the consolidated statements of cash flows.
2016 vs. 2015
cash flows from operations increased $258 million during 2016 to $380 million. this improvement was driven by lower net losses of $21 million, which included significant non-cash drivers of a lower deferred income tax benefit of $98 million and asset impairment for goodwill, intangibles and other assets of $69 million, primarily related to the wireless lan business divestiture. additionally, the company had improved working capital related items of $90 million during 2016. working capital
31
related improvements consisted primarily of accounts payable increases due to the company successfully renegotiating longer payment terms with vendors being partially offset by an increase in income tax cash outflows.
net cash used in investing activities during 2016 included capital expenditures of $77 million compared to $122 million in 2015. the decrease consisted primarily of a reduction in integration and real estate related capital expenditures. this was offset somewhat by the sale of the wireless lan business resulting in net cash received of $39 million.
net cash used in financing activities during 2016 consisted primarily of early debt principal repayments of $382 million under the term loan compared to early debt principal repayments of $165 million in the comparable prior year period. resulting from the debt refinancing amendments entered into during fiscal 2016, the company recognized $102 million of proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt, offset by $102 million in payments of long-term debt within the consolidated statements of cash flows. additionally, proceeds received from the exercise of stock options and employee stock purchase plan purchases ("espp") were $11 million in 2016 compared to $17 million in 2015 reflecting decreased option exercises and stock purchase plan purchases. the taxes paid related to the net share settlement of equity awards were $8 million in 2016 compared to $13 million in 2015 reflecting decreased stock exercises.

credit facilities on july 26, 2017, the company entered into the a&r credit agreement, which amended, modified and added provisions to the company's previous credit agreement. the a&r credit agreement provides for a term loan a of $688 million and increased the existing revolving credit facility from $250 million to $500 million. the company incurred and capitalized debt issuance costs of $5 million related to term loan a and the increased revolving credit facility under the a&r credit agreement.
in addition, as part of the a&r credit agreement, the company partially paid down and repriced its term loan b. the a&r credit agreement also lowered the index rate spread for libor loan from libor + 250 bp to libor + 200 bp for its term loan b.
in accounting for the early termination and repricing of term loan b, the company applied the provisions of asc 470-50, modifications and extinguishments ("asc 470-50"). the evaluation of the accounting under asc 470-50 was done on a creditor by creditor basis in order to determine if the terms of the debt were substantially different and, as a result, whether to apply modification or extinguishment accounting. the company determined that the terms of the debt were not substantially different for approximately 80.4% of the lenders, and applied modification accounting. for the remaining 19.6% of the lenders, extinguishment accounting was applied. certain lenders elected not to participate in the debt repricing, which resulted in a debt principal prepayment of $75 million of the company's outstanding debt balance. the debt repricing transaction also resulted in one-time pre-tax charges including third-party fees for arranger, legal and other services and accelerated discount and amortization of debt issuance costs on the debt principal prepayment of approximately $6 million. these costs are reflected as non-operating expenses in other, net on the company's consolidated statements of operations.
as of december 31, 2017, the term loan a interest rate was 3.35%, and the term loan b interest rate was 3.37%. borrowings under the term loan b, as amended, bear interest at a variable rate subject to a floor of 2.75%. the facility allows for interest payments payable monthly or quarterly on term loan a and quarterly on term loan b. the company has entered into interest

the revolving credit facility is available for working capital and other general corporate purposes including letters of credit. the amount (including letters of credit) cannot exceed $500 million. as of december 31, 2017, the company had letters of credit totaling $5 million, which reduced funds available for other borrowings under the revolving credit facility to $495 million. the revolving credit facility will mature and the related commitments will terminate on july 27, 2021.
borrowings under the revolving credit facility bear interest at a variable rate plus an applicable margin. as of december 31, 2017, the revolving credit facility had an average interest rate of 3.39%. the facility allows for interest payments payable monthly or quarterly. as of december 31, 2017, the company had borrowings of $275 million against the revolving credit facility. there were no borrowings against the revolving credit facility in the prior year comparable period.
senior notes during fiscal 2017, the company used proceeds from term loan a, the revolving credit facility and the receivables financing facility to redeem $1.1 billion in outstanding principal of the 7.25% senior notes (the "senior notes"), maturing october 2022. in accounting for the early termination of senior notes, the company applied the provisions of asc 470-50, modifications and extinguishments ("asc 470-50"). based on the terms of the debt, the company concluded extinguishment accounting was appropriate to apply. the company recognized a $65 million make whole premium, which was recorded as interest expense, net on the company's consolidated statements of operations. the company also recognized accelerated debt issuance costs of $16 million which were recorded as interest expense, net on the company's consolidated statements of operations.
receivables financing facility on december 1, 2017, a wholly-owned, bankruptcy-remote, special-purpose entity ("spe") of the company entered into the receivables purchase agreement, which provides for a receivables financing facility of up to $180 million. the spe utilizes the receivables financing facility in the normal course of business as part of its management of cash flows. under its committed receivables financing facility, a subsidiary of the company sells its domestically originated accounts receivables at fair value, on a revolving basis, to the spe which was formed for the sole purpose of buying the receivables. the spe, in turn, pledges a valid and perfected first-priority security interest in the pool of purchased receivables to a financial institution for borrowing purposes. the subsidiary retains an ownership interest in the pool of receivables that are sold to the spe and services those receivables. accordingly, the company has determined that these transactions do not qualify for sale accounting under asc 860, transfers and servicing of financial assets, and has, therefore, accounted for the transactions as secured borrowings.
at december 31, 2017, the company's consolidated balance sheets included $421 million of receivables that were pledged and $135 million of associated liabilities. the spe borrowed $145 million on the receivables financing facility and repaid $10 million in 2017. in 2017, the company recorded expenses related to its receivables financing facility of $1 million as interest expense, net on the company's consolidated statements of operations. the receivables financing facility will mature on november 29, 2019.
borrowings under the receivables financing facility bear interest at a variable rate plus an applicable margin. as of december 31, 2017, the receivables financing facility had an average interest rate of 2.35% and requires monthly interest payments.
both the revolving credit facility and receivables financing facility include terms and conditions that limit the incurrence of additional borrowings and require that certain financial ratios be maintained at designated levels.

historically, significant portions of our cash inflows were generated by our operations. we currently expect this trend to continue throughout 2018. we believe that our existing cash and investments, borrowings available under our revolving credit facility and receivables financing facility, together with cash flows expected from operations will be sufficient to meet expected operating, capital expenditure and debt obligation requirements for the next 12 months.
certain domestic subsidiaries of the company (the "guarantor subsidiaries") guarantee the term loans and the revolving credit facility on a senior basis: for the period ended december 31, 2017, the non-guarantor subsidiaries would have (a) accounted for 57.3% of our total revenue and (b) held 86.9% or $4.3 billion of our total assets and approximately 87.6% or $3.0 billion of our total liabilities including trade payables but excluding intercompany liabilities.

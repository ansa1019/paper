item 1a. risk factors.
the following risk factors should be read carefully in connection with evaluating our business and the forward-looking statements contained in this annual report on form 10-k. any of the following risks could materially adversely affect our business, our results of operations, our cash flows, our financial position and the actual outcome of matters as to which forward-looking statements are made in this annual report on form 10-k.
we (1) may from time to time make written or oral forward-looking statements, including earnings guidance and other statements contained in filings with the sec, reports to security
_____________________________________________________
(1) this section uses the terms "we," "our" and "us" when it is not necessary to distinguish among altria group, inc. and its various operating subsidiaries or when any distinction is clear from the context.

holders, press releases and investor webcasts. you can identify these forward-looking statements by use of words such as "strategy," "expects," "continues," "plans," "anticipates," "believes," "will," "estimates," "forecasts," "intends," "projects," "goals," "objectives," "guidance," "targets" and other words of similar meaning. you can also identify them by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts.
we cannot guarantee that any forward-looking statement will be realized, although we believe we have been prudent in our plans, estimates and assumptions. achievement of future results is subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions that may prove to be inaccurate. should known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying estimates or assumptions prove inaccurate, actual results could vary materially from those anticipated, estimated or projected. you should bear this in mind as you consider forward-looking statements and whether to invest in or remain invested in altria group, inc.'s securities. in connection with the "safe harbor" provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995, we are identifying important factors that, individually or in the aggregate, could cause actual results and outcomes to differ materially from those contained in, or implied by, any forward-looking statements made by us; any such statement is qualified by reference to the following cautionary statements. we elaborate on these and other risks we face throughout this document, particularly in the "business environment" sections preceding our discussion of the operating results of our subsidiaries' businesses below in item 7. you should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all risk factors. consequently, you should not consider the following to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties. we do not undertake to update any forward-looking statement that we may make from time to time except as required by applicable law.
unfavorable litigation outcomes could materially adversely affect the consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position of altria group, inc., or the businesses of one or more of its subsidiaries.
legal proceedings covering a wide range of matters are pending or threatened in various united states and foreign jurisdictions against altria group, inc. and its subsidiaries, including pm usa and ust and its subsidiaries, as well as their respective indemnitees. various types of claims may be raised in these proceedings, including product liability, consumer protection, antitrust, tax, contraband-related claims, patent infringement, employment matters, claims for contribution and claims of competitors and distributors.
litigation is subject to uncertainty and it is possible that there could be adverse developments in pending or future cases. an unfavorable outcome or settlement of pending tobacco-related or other litigation could encourage the commencement of additional litigation. damages claimed in some tobacco-related or other litigation are significant and, in certain cases, have ranged in the billions of dollars. the variability in pleadings in multiple jurisdictions, together with the actual experience of management in litigating claims, demonstrate that the monetary relief that may be specified in a lawsuit bears little relevance to the ultimate outcome. in certain cases, plaintiffs claim that defendants' liability is joint and several. in such cases, altria group, inc. or its subsidiaries may face the risk that one or more co-defendants decline or otherwise fail to participate in the bonding required for an appeal or to pay their proportionate or jury-allocated share of a judgment.  as a result, altria group, inc. or its subsidiaries under certain circumstances may have to pay more than their proportionate share of any bonding- or judgment-related amounts. furthermore, in those cases where plaintiffs are successful, altria group, inc. or its subsidiaries may also be required to pay interest and attorneys' fees.
although pm usa has historically been able to obtain required bonds or relief from bonding requirements in order to prevent plaintiffs from seeking to collect judgments while adverse verdicts have been appealed, there remains a risk that such relief may not be obtainable in all cases. this risk has been substantially reduced given that 47 states and puerto rico now limit the dollar amount of bonds or require no bond at all. as discussed in note 18. contingencies to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 ("note 18"), tobacco litigation plaintiffs have challenged the constitutionality of florida's bond cap statute in several cases and plaintiffs may challenge state bond cap statutes in other jurisdictions as well. such challenges may include the applicability of state bond caps in federal court. although we cannot predict the outcome of such challenges, it is possible that the consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position of altria group, inc., or the businesses of one or more of its subsidiaries, could be materially adversely affected in a particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year by an unfavorable outcome of one or more such challenges.
in certain litigation, altria group, inc. and its subsidiaries may face potentially significant non-monetary remedies, which may cause reputational harm. for example, in the lawsuit brought by the united states department of justice, discussed in detail in note 18, the district court did not impose monetary penalties but ordered significant non-monetary remedies, including the issuance of "corrective statements" that altria group, inc. and pm usa began making in various media in the fourth quarter of 2017.
altria group, inc. and its subsidiaries have achieved substantial success in managing litigation. nevertheless, litigation is subject to uncertainty, and significant challenges remain.
it is possible that the consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position of altria group, inc., or the businesses of one or more of its subsidiaries, could be materially adversely affected in a particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year by an unfavorable outcome or settlement of certain pending litigation. altria group, inc. and each of its subsidiaries named as a defendant believe, and each has been so advised by counsel handling the respective cases, that it has valid defenses to the litigation pending against it, as well as valid bases for appeal of adverse verdicts. each of the companies has defended, and will continue to defend, vigorously against litigation challenges. however, altria group, inc. and its subsidiaries may enter into
5
settlement discussions in particular cases if they believe it is in the best interests of altria group, inc. to do so. see item 3. legal proceedings of this annual report on form 10-k ("item 3"), note 18 and exhibits 99.1 and 99.2 to this annual report on form 10-k for a discussion of pending tobacco-related litigation.
significant federal, state and local governmental actions, including actions by the fda, and various private sector actions may continue to have an adverse impact on our tobacco subsidiaries' businesses and sales volumes.
as described in tobacco space - business environment in item 7, our cigarette subsidiaries face significant governmental and private sector actions, including efforts aimed at reducing the incidence of tobacco use and efforts seeking to hold these subsidiaries responsible for the adverse health effects associated with both smoking and exposure to environmental tobacco smoke. these actions, combined with the diminishing social acceptance of smoking, have resulted in reduced cigarette industry volume, and we expect that these factors will continue to reduce cigarette consumption levels.
actions by the fda and other federal, state or local governments or agencies, including those specific actions described in tobacco space - business environment in item 7, may impact the adult tobacco consumer acceptability of or access to tobacco products (for example, through product standards), limit adult tobacco consumer choices, delay or prevent the launch of new or modified tobacco products or products with claims of reduced risk, require the recall or other removal of tobacco products from the marketplace (for example as a result of product contamination, a determination by the fda that one or more tobacco products do not satisfy the statutory requirements for substantial equivalence, or because the fda requires that a modification to a currently-marketed tobacco product proceed through the pre-market review process), restrict communications to adult tobacco consumers, restrict the ability to differentiate tobacco products, create a competitive advantage or disadvantage for certain tobacco companies, impose additional manufacturing, labeling or packing requirements, interrupt manufacturing or otherwise significantly increase the cost of doing business, or restrict or prevent the use of specified tobacco products in certain locations or the sale of tobacco products by certain retail establishments. any one or more of these actions may have a material adverse impact on the business, consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position of altria group, inc. and its tobacco subsidiaries. see tobacco space - business environment in item 7 for a more detailed discussion.
tobacco products are subject to substantial taxation, which could have an adverse impact on sales of the tobacco products of altria group, inc.'s tobacco subsidiaries.
tobacco products are subject to substantial excise taxes, and significant increases in tobacco product-related taxes or fees have been proposed or enacted and are likely to continue to be proposed or enacted within the united states at the state, federal and local levels. tax increases are expected to continue to have an adverse impact on sales of the tobacco products of our tobacco subsidiaries through lower consumption levels and the potential shift in adult consumer purchases from the premium to the non-premium or discount segments or to other low-priced or low-taxed tobacco products or to counterfeit and contraband products. such shifts may have an adverse impact on the reported share performance of tobacco products of altria group, inc.'s tobacco subsidiaries. for further discussion, see tobacco space - business environment - excise taxes in item 7.
our tobacco businesses face significant competition within their categories and their failure to compete effectively could have an adverse effect on the consolidated results of operations or cash flows of altria group, inc., or the business of altria group, inc.'s tobacco subsidiaries.
each of altria group, inc.'s tobacco subsidiaries operates in highly competitive tobacco categories. significant methods of competition include product quality, taste, price, product innovation, marketing, packaging, distribution and promotional activities.  a highly competitive environment could negatively impact the profitability, market share and shipment volume of our tobacco subsidiaries, which could have an adverse effect on the consolidated results of operations or cash flows of altria group, inc.
pm usa also faces competition from lowest priced brands sold by certain united states and foreign manufacturers that have cost advantages because they are not parties to settlements of certain tobacco litigation in the united states. these settlements, among other factors, have resulted in substantial cigarette price increases. these manufacturers may fail to comply with related state escrow legislation or may avoid escrow deposit obligations on the majority of their sales by concentrating on certain states where escrow deposits are not required or are required on fewer than all such manufacturers' cigarettes sold in such states. additional competition has resulted from diversion into the united states market of cigarettes intended for sale outside the united states, the sale of counterfeit cigarettes by third parties, the sale of cigarettes by third parties over the internet and by other means designed to avoid collection of applicable taxes, and imports of foreign lowest priced brands. usstc faces significant competition in the smokeless tobacco category and has experienced consumer down-trading to lower-priced brands. in the cigar category, additional competition has resulted from increased imports of machine-made large cigars manufactured offshore.
altria group, inc. and its subsidiaries may be unsuccessful in anticipating changes in adult consumer preferences, responding to changes in consumer purchase behavior or managing through difficult competitive and economic conditions.
each of our tobacco and wine subsidiaries is subject to intense competition and changes in adult consumer preferences. to be successful, they must continue to:
▪   promote brand equity successfully;
6
▪   anticipate and respond to new and evolving adult consumer preferences;
▪   develop, manufacture, market and distribute products that appeal to adult consumers (including, where appropriate, through arrangements with, or investments in, third parties);
▪   improve productivity; and
▪   protect or enhance margins through cost savings and price increases.
see tobacco space - business environment - summary in item 7 for additional discussion concerning evolving adult tobacco consumer preferences, including e-vapor products. growth of this product category could contribute to reductions in cigarette consumption levels and cigarette industry sales volume and could adversely affect the growth rates of other tobacco products.
the willingness of adult consumers to purchase premium consumer product brands depends in part on economic conditions. in periods of economic uncertainty, adult consumers may purchase more discount brands and/or, in the case of tobacco products, consider lower-priced tobacco products, which could have a material adverse effect on the business, consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position of altria group, inc. and its subsidiaries. while our tobacco and wine subsidiaries work to broaden their brand portfolios to compete effectively with lower-priced products, the failure to do so could negatively impact our companies' ability to compete in these circumstances.
our financial services business (conducted through pmcc) holds investments in finance leases, principally in transportation (including aircraft), power generation, real estate and manufacturing equipment. its lessees are subject to significant competition and uncertain economic conditions. if parties to pmcc's leases fail to manage through difficult economic and competitive conditions, pmcc may have to increase its allowance for losses, which would adversely affect our earnings.
altria group, inc.'s tobacco subsidiaries may be unsuccessful in developing and commercializing adjacent products or processes, including innovative tobacco products that may reduce the health risks associated with current tobacco products and that appeal to adult tobacco consumers, which may have an adverse effect on their ability to grow new revenue streams and/or put them at a competitive disadvantage.
altria group, inc. and its subsidiaries have growth strategies involving moves and potential moves into adjacent products or processes, including innovative tobacco products. some innovative tobacco products may reduce the health risks associated with current tobacco products, while continuing to offer adult tobacco consumers (within and outside the united states) products that meet their taste expectations and evolving preferences. examples include tobacco-containing and nicotine-containing products that reduce or eliminate exposure to cigarette smoke and/or constituents identified by public health authorities as harmful. these efforts may include arrangements with, or investments in, third parties. our tobacco subsidiaries may not succeed in their efforts to introduce such new products, which would have an adverse effect on the ability to grow new revenue streams.
further, we cannot predict whether regulators, including the fda, will permit the marketing or sale of products with claims of reduced risk to adult consumers, the speed with which they may make such determinations or whether regulators will impose an unduly burdensome regulatory framework on such products. nor can we predict whether adult tobacco consumers' purchasing decisions would be affected by reduced risk claims if permitted. adverse developments on any of these matters could negatively impact the commercial viability of such products.
if our tobacco subsidiaries do not succeed in their efforts to develop and commercialize innovative tobacco products or to obtain regulatory approval for the marketing or sale of products with claims of reduced risk, but one or more of their competitors do succeed, our tobacco subsidiaries may be at a competitive disadvantage.
significant changes in tobacco leaf price, availability or quality could have an adverse effect on the profitability and business of altria group, inc.'s tobacco subsidiaries.
any significant change in tobacco leaf prices, quality or availability could adversely affect our tobacco subsidiaries' profitability and business. for further discussion, see tobacco space - business environment - price, availability and quality of agricultural products in item 7.
because altria group, inc.'s tobacco subsidiaries rely on a few significant facilities and a small number of key suppliers, an extended disruption at a facility or in service by a supplier could have a material adverse effect on the business, the consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position of altria group, inc. and its tobacco subsidiaries.
altria group, inc.'s tobacco subsidiaries face risks inherent in reliance on a few significant facilities and a small number of key suppliers. a natural or man-made disaster or other disruption that affects the manufacturing operations of any of altria group, inc.'s tobacco subsidiaries or the operations of any key suppliers of any of altria group, inc.'s tobacco subsidiaries, including as a result of a key supplier's unwillingness to supply goods or services to a tobacco company, could adversely impact the operations of the affected subsidiaries. an extended disruption in operations experienced by one or more of altria group, inc.'s subsidiaries or key suppliers could have a material adverse effect on the business, the consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position of altria group, inc. and its tobacco subsidiaries.
altria group, inc.'s subsidiaries could decide or be required to recall products, which could have a material adverse effect on the business, reputation, consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position of altria group, inc. and its subsidiaries.
7
in addition to a recall required by the fda, as referenced above, our subsidiaries could decide, or laws or regulations could require them, to recall products due to the failure to meet quality standards or specifications, suspected or confirmed and deliberate or unintentional product contamination, or other adulteration, product misbranding or product tampering. in january 2017, usstc announced that it was voluntarily recalling certain of its smokeless tobacco products manufactured at a usstc facility due to product tampering. usstc recorded a charge during the first quarter of 2017 related to this recall. while this charge was not material to altria group, inc.'s financial statements, future recalls (if any) could have a material adverse effect on the business, reputation, consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position of altria group, inc. and its subsidiaries.
altria group, inc. may be unable to attract and retain the best talent due to the impact of decreasing social acceptance of tobacco usage and tobacco control actions.
our ability to implement our strategy of attracting and retaining the best talent may be impaired by the impact of decreasing social acceptance of tobacco usage and tobacco regulation and control actions. the tobacco industry competes for talent with the consumer products industry and other companies that enjoy greater societal acceptance.  as a result, we may be unable to attract and retain the best talent.
acquisitions or other events may adversely affect altria group, inc.'s credit rating, and altria group, inc. may not achieve its anticipated strategic or financial objectives of a transaction.
from time to time, altria group, inc. considers acquisitions and may engage in confidential acquisition negotiations that are not publicly announced unless and until those negotiations result in a definitive agreement. although we seek to maintain or improve our credit ratings over time, it is possible that completing a given acquisition or the occurrence of other events could negatively impact our credit ratings or the outlook for those ratings. any such change in ratings or outlook may negatively affect the amount of credit available to us and may also increase our costs and adversely affect our earnings or our dividend rate.
furthermore, acquisition opportunities are limited, and acquisitions present risks of failing to achieve efficient and effective integration, strategic objectives and anticipated revenue improvements and cost savings. there can be no assurance that we will be able to acquire attractive businesses on favorable terms or that we will realize any of the anticipated benefits from an acquisition.
disruption and uncertainty in the debt capital markets could adversely affect altria group, inc.'s access to the debt capital markets, earnings and dividend rate.
access to the debt capital markets is important for us to satisfy our liquidity and financing needs. disruption and uncertainty in the credit and debt capital markets and any resulting adverse impact on credit availability, pricing, credit terms or credit rating may negatively affect the amount of credit available to us and may also increase our costs and adversely affect our earnings or our dividend rate.
altria group, inc. may be required to write down intangible assets, including goodwill, due to impairment, which would reduce earnings.
we periodically calculate the fair value of our reporting units and intangible assets to test for impairment. this calculation may be affected by several factors, including general economic conditions, regulatory developments, changes in category growth rates as a result of changing adult consumer preferences, success of planned new product introductions, competitive activity and tobacco-related taxes. certain events can also trigger an immediate review of intangible assets. if an impairment is determined to exist in either situation, we will incur impairment losses, which will reduce our earnings.
competition, unfavorable changes in grape supply and new governmental regulations or revisions to existing governmental regulations could adversely affect ste. michelle's wine business.
ste. michelle's business is subject to significant competition, including from many large, well-established domestic and international companies. the adequacy of ste. michelle's grape supply is influenced by consumer demand for wine in relation to industry-wide production levels as well as by weather and crop conditions, particularly in eastern washington. supply shortages related to any one or more of these factors could increase production costs and wine prices, which ultimately may have a negative impact on ste. michelle's sales. in addition, federal, state and local governmental agencies regulate the alcohol beverage industry through various means, including licensing requirements, pricing, labeling and advertising restrictions, and distribution and production policies. new regulations or revisions to existing regulations, resulting in further restrictions or taxes on the manufacture and sale of alcoholic beverages, may have an adverse effect on ste. michelle's wine business. for further discussion, see wine segment - business environment in item 7.
the failure of altria group, inc.'s information systems or service providers' information systems to function as intended, or cyber-attacks or security breaches, could have a material adverse effect on the business, reputation, consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position of altria group, inc. and its subsidiaries.
altria group, inc. and its subsidiaries rely extensively on information systems, many of which are managed by third-party service providers (such as cloud providers), to support a variety of business processes and activities, including: complying with regulatory, legal, financial reporting and tax requirements; engaging in marketing and e-commerce activities; managing and improving the effectiveness of our operations; manufacturing and distributing our products; collecting and storing sensitive data and confidential information; and communicating internally and externally with employees, investors, suppliers, trade customers,
8
adult consumers and others. we continue to make investments in administrative, technical and physical safeguards to protect our information systems and data from cyber-threats, including human error and malicious acts. our safeguards include employee training, testing and auditing protocols, backup systems and business continuity plans, maintenance of security policies and procedures, monitoring of networks and systems, and third-party risk management.
to date, interruptions of our information systems have been infrequent and have not had a material impact on our operations. however, because technology is increasingly complex and cyber-attacks are increasingly sophisticated and more frequent, there can be no assurance that such incidents will not have a material adverse effect on us in the future. failure of our systems or service providers' systems to function as intended, or cyber-attacks or security breaches, could result in loss of revenue, assets, personal data, intellectual property, trade secrets or other sensitive and confidential data, violation of applicable privacy and data security laws, damage to the reputation of our companies and their brands, operational disruptions, legal challenges and significant remediation and other costs to altria group, inc. and its subsidiaries.
unfavorable outcomes of any governmental investigations could materially affect the businesses of altria group, inc. and its subsidiaries.
from time to time, altria group, inc. and its subsidiaries are subject to governmental investigations on a range of matters. we cannot predict whether new investigations may be commenced or the outcome of any such investigation, and it is possible that our business could be materially adversely affected by an unfavorable outcome of a future investigation.
expanding international business operations subjects altria group, inc. and its subsidiaries to various united states and foreign laws and regulations, and violations of such laws or regulations could result in reputational harm, legal challenges and/or significant costs.
while altria group, inc. and its subsidiaries are primarily engaged in business activities in the united states, they do engage (directly or indirectly) in certain international business activities that are subject to various united states and foreign laws and regulations, such as the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act and other laws prohibiting bribery and corruption.  although we have a code of conduct and a compliance system designed to prevent and detect violations of applicable law, no system can provide assurance that it will always protect against improper actions by employees or third parties. violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could result in reputational harm, legal challenges and/or significant costs.
altria group, inc.'s reported earnings from and carrying value of its equity investment in ab inbev and the dividends paid by ab inbev on shares owned by altria group, inc. may be adversely affected by unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates and other factors.
for purposes of financial reporting, the earnings from and carrying value of our equity investment in ab inbev are translated into u.s. dollars from various local currencies. in addition, ab inbev pays dividends in euros, which we convert into u.s. dollars. during times of a strengthening u.s. dollar against these currencies, our reported earnings from and carrying value of our equity investment in ab inbev will be reduced because these currencies will translate into fewer u.s. dollars and the dividends that we receive from ab inbev will convert into fewer u.s. dollars.
dividends and earnings from and carrying value of our equity investment in ab inbev are also subject to the risks encountered by ab inbev in its business. we cannot provide any assurance that ab inbev will successfully execute its business plans and strategies. earnings from and carrying value of our equity investment in ab inbev are also subject to fluctuations in ab inbev's stock price, for example through mark-to-market losses on ab inbev's derivative financial instruments used to hedge certain share commitments.
we received a substantial portion of our consideration from the transaction in the form of restricted shares subject to a five-year lock-up. furthermore, if our percentage ownership in ab inbev were to decrease below certain levels, we may be subject to additional tax liabilities, suffer a reduction in the number of directors that we can have appointed to the ab inbev board of directors and be unable to account for our investment under the equity method of accounting.
upon completion of the transaction, we received a substantial portion of our consideration in the form of restricted shares that cannot be sold or transferred for a period of five years following the transaction, subject to limited exceptions. these transfer restrictions will require us to bear the risks associated with our investment in ab inbev for a five-year period that expires on october 10, 2021. further, in the event that our ownership percentage in ab inbev were to decrease below certain levels, we may be subject to additional tax liabilities, the number of directors that we have the right to have appointed to the ab inbev board of directors could be reduced from two to one or zero and our use of the equity method of accounting for our investment in ab inbev could be challenged.
our tax treatment of the transaction consideration may be challenged and the tax treatment of ab inbev dividends may not be as favorable as altria group, inc. anticipates.
while we expect the equity consideration that we received from the transaction to qualify for tax-deferred treatment, we cannot provide any assurance that federal and state tax authorities will not challenge the expected tax treatment and, if they do, what the outcome of any such challenge will be. in addition, there is a risk that the tax treatment of the dividends altria group, inc. expects to receive from ab inbev may not be as favorable as altria group, inc. anticipates.
item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the other sections of this annual report on form 10-k, including the consolidated financial statements and related notes contained in item 8, and the discussion of cautionary factors that may affect future results in item 1a.
description of the company at december 31, 2017, altria group, inc.'s wholly-owned subsidiaries included pm usa, which is engaged in the manufacture and sale of cigarettes in the united states; middleton, which is engaged in the manufacture and sale of machine-made large cigars and pipe tobacco and is a wholly-owned subsidiary of pm usa; nat sherman, which is engaged in the manufacture and sale of super premium cigarettes and the sale of premium cigars; and ust, which through its wholly-owned subsidiaries, including usstc and ste. michelle, is engaged in the manufacture and sale of smokeless tobacco products and wine. altria group, inc.'s other operating companies included nu mark, a wholly-owned subsidiary that is engaged in the manufacture and sale of innovative tobacco products, and pmcc, a wholly-owned subsidiary that maintains a portfolio of finance assets, substantially all of which are leveraged leases. other altria group, inc. wholly-owned subsidiaries included altria group distribution company, which provides sales and distribution services to certain altria group, inc. operating subsidiaries, and altria client services llc, which provides various support services in areas, such as legal, regulatory, consumer engagement, finance, human resources and external affairs to altria group, inc. and its subsidiaries. in addition, nu mark, middleton and nat sherman use third-party arrangements in the manufacture of their products. altria group, inc.'s access to the operating cash flows of its wholly-owned subsidiaries consists of cash received from the payment of dividends and distributions, and the payment of interest on intercompany loans by its subsidiaries. at december 31, 2017, altria group, inc.'s principal wholly-owned subsidiaries were not limited by long-term debt or other agreements in their ability to pay cash dividends or make other distributions with respect to their equity interests.
at september 30, 2016, altria group, inc. had an approximate 27% ownership of sabmiller, which altria group, inc. accounted for under the equity method of accounting. in october 2016, legacy ab inbev completed the transaction, and ab inbev became the holding company for the combined sabmiller and legacy ab inbev businesses. upon completion of the transaction, altria group, inc. had a 9.6% ownership of ab inbev based on ab inbev's shares outstanding. subsequently, altria group, inc. purchased approximately 12 million ordinary shares of ab inbev, increasing altria group, inc.'s ownership to approximately 10.2% at december 31, 2016. at december 31, 2017, altria group, inc. had an approximate 10.2% ownership of ab inbev, which altria group, inc. accounts for under the equity method of accounting using a one-quarter lag. as a result of the one-quarter lag and the timing of the completion of the transaction, no earnings from altria group, inc.'s equity investment in ab inbev were recorded for the year ended december 31, 2016. altria group, inc. receives cash dividends on its interest in ab inbev if and when ab inbev pays such dividends. for further discussion, see note 6. investment in ab inbev/sabmiller to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 ("note 6").
altria group, inc.'s reportable segments are smokeable products, smokeless products and wine. the financial services and the innovative tobacco products businesses are included in an all other category due to the continued reduction of the lease portfolio of pmcc and the relative financial contribution of altria group, inc.'s innovative tobacco products businesses to altria group, inc.'s consolidated results.
in january 2017, altria group, inc. acquired nat sherman, which joined pm usa and middleton as part of altria group, inc.'s smokeable products segment.

▪   fewer shares outstanding: fewer shares outstanding during 2017 compared with 2016 were due primarily to shares repurchased by altria group, inc. under its share repurchase program.
▪   change in tax rate: the change in tax rate was driven primarily by no tax being due on the dividends altria group, inc. received from ab inbev during 2017 as a result of a deemed repatriation tax associated with the tax reform act (as defined below). for further discussion, see note 14. income taxes to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 ("note 14").
▪   operations: the increase of $474 million in operations shown in the table above was due primarily to higher income from the smokeable products and smokeless products segments.
for further details, see the consolidated operating results and operating results by business segment sections of the following discussion and analysis.
2018 forecasted results in february 2018, altria group, inc. forecasted that its 2018 full-year adjusted diluted eps growth rate is expected to be in the range of 15% to 19% over 2017 full-year adjusted diluted eps. this forecasted growth rate excludes the income and expense items in the table below. altria group, inc.'s 2018 guidance reflects investments in focus areas for long-term growth, including innovative product development and launches, regulatory science, brand equity, retail fixtures and future retail concepts. altria group, inc. expects its 2018 full-year adjusted effective tax rate will be in a range of approximately 23% to 24%.
altria group, inc.'s full-year adjusted diluted eps guidance and full-year forecast for its adjusted effective tax rate exclude the impact of certain income and expense items that management believes are not part of underlying operations. these items may include, for example, loss on early extinguishment of debt, restructuring charges, gain on the transaction, ab inbev/sabmiller special items, certain tax items, charges associated with tobacco and health litigation items, and resolutions of certain non-participating manufacturer ("npm") adjustment disputes under the 1998 master settlement agreement (such dispute resolutions are referred to as "npm adjustment items" and are more fully described in health care cost recovery litigation - npm adjustment disputes in note 18).
altria group, inc.'s management cannot estimate on a forward-looking basis the impact of certain income and expense items, including those items noted in the preceding paragraph, on altria group, inc.'s reported diluted eps and reported effective tax rate because these items, which could be significant, may be infrequent, are difficult to predict and may be highly variable. as a result, altria group, inc. does not provide a corresponding united states generally accepted accounting principles ("u.s. gaap") measure for, or reconciliation to, its adjusted diluted eps guidance or its adjusted effective tax rate forecast.
in addition, the factors described in item 1a represent continuing risks to this forecast.

altria group, inc. reports its financial results in accordance with u.s. gaap. altria group, inc.'s management reviews certain financial results, including diluted eps, on an adjusted basis, which excludes certain income and expense items, including those items noted above. altria group, inc.'s management does not view any of these special items to be part of altria group, inc.'s underlying results as they may be highly variable, may be infrequent, are difficult to predict and can distort underlying business trends and results. altria group, inc.'s management also reviews income tax rates on an adjusted basis. altria group, inc.'s adjusted effective tax rate may exclude certain tax items from its reported effective tax rate. altria group, inc.'s management believes that adjusted financial measures provide useful additional insight into underlying business trends and results and provide a more meaningful comparison of year-over-year results. adjusted financial measures are used by management and regularly provided to the codm for planning, forecasting and evaluating business and financial performance, including allocating resources and evaluating results relative to employee compensation targets. these adjusted financial measures are not consistent with u.s. gaap and may not be calculated the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies. these adjusted financial measures should thus be considered as supplemental in nature and not considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with u.s. gaap.
discussion and analysis critical accounting policies and estimates note 2 includes a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of altria group, inc.'s consolidated financial statements. in most instances, altria group, inc. must use an accounting policy or method because it is the only policy or method permitted under u.s. gaap.
the preparation of financial statements includes the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. if actual amounts are ultimately different from previous estimates, the revisions are included in altria group, inc.'s consolidated results of operations for the period in which the actual amounts become known. historically, the aggregate differences, if any, between altria group, inc.'s estimates and actual amounts in any year have not had a significant impact on its consolidated financial statements.
the following is a review of the more significant assumptions and estimates, as well as the accounting policies and methods, used in the preparation of altria group, inc.'s consolidated financial statements:
▪consolidation: the consolidated financial statements include altria group, inc., as well as its wholly-owned and majority-owned subsidiaries. investments in which altria group, inc. has the ability to exercise significant influence are accounted for under the equity method of accounting. all intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated.
▪revenue recognition: altria group, inc.'s businesses recognize revenues, net of sales incentives and sales returns, and including shipping and handling charges billed to customers, upon shipment of goods when title and risk of loss pass to customers. payments received in advance of revenue recognition are deferred and recorded in other accrued liabilities until revenue is recognized. altria group, inc.'s businesses also include excise taxes billed to customers in net revenues. shipping and handling costs are classified as part of cost of sales.
▪depreciation, amortization, impairment testing and asset valuation: altria group, inc. depreciates property, plant and equipment and amortizes its definite-lived intangible assets using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. machinery and equipment are depreciated over periods up to 25 years, and buildings and building improvements over periods up to 50 years. definite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives up to 25 years.
altria group, inc. reviews long-lived assets, including definite-lived intangible assets, for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be fully recoverable. altria group, inc. performs undiscounted operating cash flow analyses to determine if an impairment exists. these analyses are affected by general economic conditions and projected growth rates. for purposes of recognition and measurement of an impairment for assets held for use, altria group, inc. groups assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which cash flows are separately identifiable. if an impairment is determined to exist, any related impairment loss is calculated based on fair value. impairment losses on assets to be disposed of, if any, are based on the estimated proceeds to be received, less costs of disposal. altria group, inc. also reviews the estimated remaining useful lives of long-lived assets whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate the lives may have changed.
16
substantially all of the goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets recorded by altria group, inc. at december 31, 2017 relate to the acquisitions of nat sherman in 2017, green smoke in 2014, ust in 2009 and middleton in 2007. altria group, inc. conducts a required annual review of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for potential impairment, and more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would require altria group, inc. to perform an interim review. if the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its fair value, goodwill is considered impaired. the amount of impairment loss is measured as the difference between the carrying value and the implied fair value. if the carrying value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value, the indefinite-lived intangible asset is considered impaired and is reduced to fair value. for substantially all goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, the fair values are determined using discounted cash flows.
goodwill by reporting unit and indefinite-lived intangible assets at december 31, 2017 were as follows:

during 2017, 2016 and 2015, altria group, inc. completed its quantitative annual impairment test of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, and no impairment charges resulted. at december 31, 2017, the estimated fair values of all reporting units and the indefinite-lived intangible assets within those reporting units substantially exceeded their carrying values, except for the columbia crest trademark within the wine reporting unit. at december 31, 2017, the fair value of the columbia crest trademark exceeded its book value of $54 million by approximately 9%. results for columbia crest in 2017 were negatively impacted by increased competitive activity and continued trade inventory reductions.
in 2017, altria group, inc. used an income approach to estimate the fair values of substantially all of its reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets. the income approach reflects the discounting of expected future cash flows to their present value at a rate of return that incorporates the risk-free rate for the use of those funds, the expected rate of inflation and the risks associated with realizing expected future cash flows. the weighted-average discount rate used in performing the valuations was approximately 9%.
in performing the 2017 discounted cash flow analysis, altria group, inc. made various judgments, estimates and assumptions, the most significant of which were volume, income, growth rates and discount rates. the analysis incorporated assumptions used in altria group, inc.'s long-term financial forecast, which is used by altria group, inc.'s management to evaluate business and financial performance, including allocating resources and evaluating results relative to setting employee compensation targets. the assumptions incorporated the highest and best use of altria group, inc.'s indefinite-lived intangible assets and also included perpetual growth rates for periods beyond the long-term financial forecast. the perpetual growth rate used in performing all of the valuations was 2%. fair value calculations are sensitive to changes in these estimates and assumptions, some of which relate to broader macroeconomic conditions outside of altria group, inc.'s control.
although altria group, inc.'s discounted cash flow analysis is based on assumptions that are considered reasonable and based on the best available information at the time that the discounted cash flow analysis is developed, there is significant judgment used in determining future cash flows. the following factors have the most potential to impact expected future cash flows and, therefore, altria group, inc.'s impairment conclusions: general economic conditions; federal, state and local regulatory developments; category growth rates; consumer preferences; success of planned product expansions; competitive activity; and income and tobacco-related taxes. for further discussion of these factors, see operating results by business segment - tobacco space - business environment below.
while altria group, inc.'s management believes that the estimated fair values of each reporting unit and indefinite-lived intangible asset are reasonable, actual performance in the short-term or long-term could be significantly different from forecasted performance, which could result in impairment charges in future periods.
for additional information on goodwill and other intangible assets, see note 3.
▪marketing costs: altria group, inc.'s businesses promote their products with consumer engagement programs, consumer incentives and trade promotions. such programs include discounts, coupons, rebates, in-store display incentives, event marketing and volume-based incentives. consumer engagement programs are expensed as incurred. consumer incentive and trade promotion activities are recorded as a reduction of revenues, a portion of which is based on amounts estimated as being due to wholesalers, retailers and consumers at the end of a period, based principally on historical volume, utilization and redemption rates. for interim reporting purposes, consumer engagement programs and certain consumer incentive expenses are charged to operations as a percentage of sales, based on estimated sales and related expenses for the full year.
▪contingencies: as discussed in note 18 and item 3, legal proceedings covering a wide range of matters are pending or threatened in various united states and foreign jurisdictions against altria group, inc. and its subsidiaries, including pm usa and ust and its subsidiaries, as well as their respective indemnitees. in 1998, pm usa and certain other u.s. tobacco product manufacturers entered into the 1998 master settlement
17
agreement (the "msa") with 46 states and various other governments and jurisdictions to settle asserted and unasserted health care cost recovery and other claims. pm usa and certain other u.s. tobacco product manufacturers had previously entered into agreements to settle similar claims brought by mississippi, florida, texas and minnesota (together with the msa, the "state settlement agreements"). pm usa's portion of ongoing adjusted payments and legal fees is based on its relative share of the settling manufacturers' domestic cigarette shipments, including roll-your-own cigarettes, in the year preceding that in which the payment is due. in addition, pm usa, middleton, nat sherman and usstc are subject to quarterly user fees imposed by the fda as a result of the fsptca. payments under the state settlement agreements and the fda user fees are based on variable factors, such as volume, operating income, market share and inflation, depending on the subject payment. altria group, inc.'s subsidiaries account for the cost of the state settlement agreements and fda user fees as a component of cost of sales. altria group, inc.'s subsidiaries recorded approximately $4.7 billion, $4.9 billion and $4.8 billion of charges to cost of sales for the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, in connection with the state settlement agreements and fda user fees.
altria group, inc. and its subsidiaries record provisions in the consolidated financial statements for pending litigation when they determine that an unfavorable outcome is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. at the present time, while it is reasonably possible that an unfavorable outcome in a case may occur, except to the extent discussed in note 18 and item 3: (i) management has concluded that it is not probable that a loss has been incurred in any of the pending tobacco-related cases; (ii) management is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome in any of the pending tobacco-related cases; and (iii) accordingly, management has not provided any amounts in the consolidated financial statements for unfavorable outcomes, if any. litigation defense costs are expensed as incurred and included in marketing, administration and research costs in the consolidated statements of earnings.
▪employee benefit plans: as discussed in note 16. benefit plans to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 ("note 16"), altria group, inc. provides a range of benefits to its employees and retired employees, including pension, postretirement health care and postemployment benefits. altria group, inc. records annual amounts relating to these plans based on calculations specified by u.s. gaap, which include various actuarial assumptions as to discount rates, assumed rates of return on plan assets, mortality, compensation increases, turnover rates and health care cost trend rates. altria group, inc. reviews its actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and makes modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when it is deemed appropriate to do so. any effect of the modifications is generally amortized over future periods.
altria group, inc. recognizes the funded status of its defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans on the consolidated balance sheet and records as a component of other comprehensive earnings (losses), net of deferred income taxes, the gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that have not been recognized as components of net periodic benefit cost. the gains or losses and prior service costs or credits recorded as components of other comprehensive earnings (losses) are subsequently amortized into net periodic benefit cost in future years.
at december 31, 2017, altria group, inc.'s discount rate assumptions for its pension and postretirement plans obligations decreased from 4.1% to 3.7% at december 31, 2017. altria group, inc. presently anticipates an increase of approximately $30 million in its 2018 pre-tax pension and postretirement expense versus 2017, excluding amounts in each year related to termination, settlement and curtailment. this anticipated increase is due primarily to higher amortization of unrecognized losses, driven by the impact of lower discount rates, partially offset by the expected return on postretirement assets resulting from the december 2017 $270 million contribution to fund certain postretirement benefits. assuming no change to the shape of the yield curve, a 50 basis point decrease in altria group, inc.'s discount rates would increase altria group, inc.'s pension and postretirement expense by approximately $53 million, and a 50 basis point increase in altria group, inc.'s discount rates would decrease altria group, inc.'s pension and postretirement expense by approximately $49 million. similarly, a 50 basis point decrease (increase) in the expected return on plan assets would increase (decrease) altria group, inc.'s pension and postretirement expense by approximately $38 million. see note 16 for a sensitivity discussion of the assumed health care cost trend rates.
▪income taxes: significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions and in evaluating tax positions. altria group, inc.'s deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities, using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. altria group, inc. records a valuation allowance when it is more-likely-than-not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized.
altria group, inc. recognizes a benefit for uncertain tax positions when a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return is more-likely-than-not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities. the amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. altria group, inc. recognizes accrued interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions as part of the provision for income taxes in its consolidated statements of earnings.
altria group, inc. recognized income tax benefits and charges in the consolidated statements of earnings during 2017, 2016 and 2015 as a result of various tax events, including the impact of the tax reform act (as defined below).
18
on december 22, 2017, the u.s. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act (the "tax reform act"). the main provisions of the tax reform act that impact altria group, inc. include: (i) a reduction in the u.s. federal statutory corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective january 1, 2018, and (ii) changes in the treatment of foreign-source income, commonly referred to as a modified territorial tax system.
the transition to a modified territorial tax system required altria group, inc. to record a deemed repatriation tax and an associated tax basis benefit in 2017. the tax impact related to the tax basis benefit and the deemed repatriation tax was based on provisional estimates as of january 18, 2018, substantially all of which were related to altria group, inc.'s share of ab inbev's accumulated earnings and associated taxes. altria group, inc. may be required to adjust these provisional estimates based on (i) additional guidance related to, or interpretation of, the tax reform act and associated tax laws and (ii) additional information to be received from ab inbev, including information regarding ab inbev's accumulated earnings and associated taxes for the 2016 and 2017 tax years. this additional guidance and information could result in increases or decreases to the provisional estimates, which may be significant in relation to these estimates. altria group, inc. will record any such adjustments in 2018.

as discussed further in note 15, the codm reviews operating companies income to evaluate the performance of, and allocate resources to, the segments. operating companies income for the segments is defined as operating income before general corporate expenses and amortization of intangibles. management believes it is appropriate to disclose this measure to help investors analyze the business performance and trends of the various business segments.
the following events that occurred during 2017, 2016 and 2015 affected the comparability of statement of earnings amounts.
▪gain on ab inbev/sabmiller business combination: for the year ended december 31, 2017, altria group, inc. recorded pre-tax gains of $445 million related to the planned completion of the remaining ab inbev divestitures of certain sabmiller assets and businesses in connection with legacy ab inbev obtaining necessary regulatory clearances for the transaction. as a result of the transaction, for the year ended december 31, 2016, altria group, inc. recorded a pre-tax gain of approximately $13.9 billion. for further discussion, see note 6.
▪npm adjustment items:  for the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, pre-tax expense (income) for npm adjustment items was recorded in altria group, inc.'s consolidated statements of earnings as follows:
(in millions)                             2017            2016          2015

the amounts shown in the table above for the smokeable products segment were recorded by pm usa as increases (reductions) to costs of sales, which decreased (increased) operating companies income in the smokeable products segment. for further discussion, see health care cost recovery litigation - npm adjustment disputes in note 18.
▪tobacco and health litigation items: for the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, pre-tax charges related to certain tobacco and health litigations items were recorded in altria group, inc.'s consolidated statements of earnings as follows:

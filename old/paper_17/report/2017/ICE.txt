risk factors" included elsewhere in this annual report.
the implementation of new laws or regulations or the uncertainty around potential changes may impact participation in our markets, or the demand for our clearing and data services either favorably or unfavorably. many of the recent changes with regard to global financial reform have emphasized the importance of transparent markets, centralized clearing and access to data, all of which are important aspects of our product offering. however, some of the proposed rules have yet to be implemented and some rules that have already been partially implemented on january 3, 2018 are being reconsidered. in addition, some of the global regulations have
44
not been fully harmonized and several of the mifid ii regulations are inconsistent with u.s. rules. as this is established, legislative and regulatory actions may change the way we conduct our business and may create uncertainty for market participants, which could affect trading volumes or demand for market data. as a result, it is difficult to predict all of the effects that the legislation and its implementing regulations will have on us. as discussed more fully in item 1 "- business - regulation" included elsewhere in this annual report, the implementation of mifid ii and other regulations may result in operational, regulatory and/or business risk.
in recent years, low interest rates and uncertainty in the financial markets continued to reflect the impact of a relatively slow or yet to occur global economic recovery. lower growth in asia and the eu may also continue to affect global financial markets. in addition, economic and regulatory uncertainty, coupled with periods of high market volatility around geopolitical events, low interest rates and low natural gas prices, has affected our clients' activities in recent years. the duration of these trends will determine the continued impact on our business across trading and listings. we have diversified our business so that we are not dependent on volatility or trading activity in any one asset class. in addition, we have increased our portion of non-transaction and clearing revenues from 21% in 2013 to 58% in 2017. this non-transaction revenue includes data services, listings and other revenues. we continue to focus on our strategy to grow each of our revenue streams, as well as on our company-wide expense reduction initiatives and our synergies in connection with our acquisitions in order to mitigate these uncertainties and to build on our growth opportunities by leveraging our proprietary data, clearing and markets.
many of the data products and services we sell are required for our clients' business operations regardless of market volatility or shifts in business profitability levels. we anticipate that there will continue to be growth in the financial information services sector driven by a number of global trends, including the following: increasing global regulatory demands; greater use of fair value accounting standards and reliance on independent valuations; greater emphasis on risk management; market fragmentation driven by regulatory changes; the move to passive investing and indexation; ongoing growth in the size and diversity of financial markets; increased electronification of fixed income and other less automated markets; the development of new data products; the demand for greater data capacity and connectivity; new entrants; and increasing demand for outsourced services by financial institutions. we contract with clients through data fixed-fee subscriptions, variable fees based on usage or a combination of fixed-fee subscription and usage-based fees. in addition, some of our data services generate one-time or non-recurring revenue, such as one-time purchases of historical data, set-up services or implementation fees.
segment reporting we operate two business segments: our trading and clearing segment and our data and listings segment. this presentation is reflective of how our chief operating decision maker reviews and operates our business. our trading and clearing segment comprises our transaction-based execution and clearing businesses. our data and listings segment comprises our subscription-based data services and securities listings businesses. our chief operating decision maker does not review total assets, intersegment revenues/expenses or statements of income below operating income by segments; therefore, such information is not presented below.
while revenues are allocated directly to segments, a significant portion of our operating expenses are not solely related to a specific segment because the expenses serve functions that are necessary for the operation of both segments. because these expenses do not relate to a single segment, we have employed a reasonable allocation method to allocate expenses between the segments for presentation purposes. we have elected to use a pro-rata revenue approach as the allocation method for the expenses that do not relate solely to one segment. further, precise allocation of expenses to specific revenue streams within these segments is not reasonably possible. accordingly, we did not allocate expenses to specific revenue streams within the segments.
certain prior year's segment expenses for 2016 have been reclassified to conform to our current year's segment financial statement presentation. this reclassification increased the operating expenses for the data and listings segment by $55 million, while decreasing the operating expenses for the trading and clearing segment by the same amount.

transaction and clearing revenues overview our transaction and clearing revenues are reported on a net basis, except for the nyse transaction-based expenses discussed below, and consist of fees collected from our derivatives, cash equities and equity options trading and derivatives clearing. in our derivatives markets, we earn transaction and clearing revenues from both counterparties to each contract that is traded and/or cleared, and in our equity and equity options markets, we receive trade execution fees as well as routing fees related to orders in our markets which are routed to other markets for execution.
rates per-contract are driven by the number of contracts or securities traded and the fees charged per contract, net of certain rebates. our per-contract transaction and clearing revenues will depend upon many factors, including, but not limited to, market conditions, transaction and clearing volume, product mix, pricing, applicable revenue sharing and market making agreements, and new product introductions. because transaction and clearing revenues are generally assessed on a per-contract basis, revenues and profitability fluctuate with changes in contract volume and due to product mix.
for the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, 20%, 19% and 20%, respectively, of our trading and clearing segment revenues, less transaction-based expenses, were billed in pounds sterling or euros. as the pound sterling or euro exchange rate changes, the u.s. equivalent of revenues denominated in foreign currencies changes accordingly. due to the weakening of the pound sterling and euro the last two years compared to the u.s. dollar, our trading and clearing segment revenues, less transaction-based expenses, were lower by $14 million for the year ended december 31, 2017 from the comparable period in 2016, and were lower by $35 million for the year ended december 31, 2016 from the comparable period in 2015. see item 7(a) "- quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk - foreign currency exchange rate risk" below for additional information on the impact of currency fluctuations.
our transaction and clearing fees are presented net of rebates. we recorded rebates of $749 million, $674 million and $563 million for the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. we offer rebates in certain of our markets primarily to support market liquidity and trading volume by providing qualified participants in those markets a discount to the applicable commission rate. such rebates are calculated based on volumes traded. the increase in the rebates is due primarily to an increase in the number of participants in the rebate programs offered on various contracts, an increase in our traded volume and an increase in the number of rebate programs.
commodities markets we operate global crude oil and refined oil futures markets, including the ice brent, ice wti and ice gasoil futures and options contracts, as well as over 500 refined oil futures products that relate to our benchmark futures contracts and other key price benchmarks. the ice brent crude contract is relied upon by a broad range of global market participants, including oil producing nations and multinational companies, to price and hedge their crude oil production and consumption. ice gasoil is a key refined
47
oil benchmark in europe and asia. total oil volume and revenues increased 14% and 12%, respectively, for the year ended december 31, 2017, from the comparable period in 2016, and increased 12% and 10%, respectively, for the year ended december 31, 2016, from the comparable period in 2015. crude oil revenues grew at a slightly lower rate due to customer and product mix.
in 2017, ice brent crude futures and options contracts were traded at record levels for the twenty-first consecutive year. ice brent crude futures and options volume increased 15% for the year ended december 31, 2017, from the comparable period in 2016, and increased 15% for the year ended december 31, 2016, from the comparable period in 2015. ice wti crude futures and options volume increased 14% for the year ended december 31, 2017, from the comparable period in 2016, and increased 16% for the year ended december 31, 2016, from the comparable period in 2015. ice brent crude and ice wti crude futures and options volume increased primarily due to increased oil price volatility related to shifting supply and demand dynamics globally; broader market volatility in oil products, equities and foreign exchange rates; acts of central governments; outcomes of elections; and uncertainty around the organization of petroleum exporting countries, or opec, policy.
our global natural gas futures and options volume declined 1% and revenues decreased 1% for the year ended december 31, 2017, from the comparable period in 2016, respectively, and volume declined 2% and revenues increased 4% for the year ended december 31, 2016, from the comparable period in 2015, respectively. global natural gas revenues decreased in 2017 primarily due to the impact of foreign currency translation in our european natural gas products. global natural gas volume declined in 2016 primarily due to lower price volatility related to high natural gas supplies but revenues increased due to geographic product mix.
total volume and revenues in our agricultural and metals futures and options markets decreased 7% and 5%, respectively, for the year ended december 31, 2017, from the comparable period in 2016, and increased 11% and 8%, respectively, for the year ended december 31, 2016, from the comparable period in 2015. the decreases in agricultural volume in 2017 were primarily driven by the reduced price volatility in 2017 compared to the higher price volatility in 2016. the increases in agricultural volume in 2016 were primarily driven by increased price volatility due to changing supply and demand expectations largely related to weather and production levels.
financial markets interest rates and other financial futures and options volume and revenues increased 15% and 2%, respectively, for the year ended december 31, 2017, from the comparable period in 2016, and volume increased 10% and revenues decreased 6%, respectively, for the year ended december 31, 2016, from the comparable period in 2015. interest rate futures and options volume increased in 2017 primarily due to expectations for heightened central bank activity during 2017, and volume increased in 2016 primarily due to uncertainty around central bank actions, economic data during 2016, and the u.k.'s decision to exit the eu. interest rate futures and options revenues increased less than traded volumes in 2017 and in 2016 primarily due to the impact of foreign currency translation and increased market making rebates that apply at higher volume levels.
cash equities handled volume decreased 17% for the year ended december 31, 2017, from the comparable period in 2016, primarily due to a reduction in u.s. equities market volatility during 2017 compared to the prior year. cash equities handled volume increased 6% for the year ended december 31, 2016, from the comparable period in 2015, primarily due to increased market volatility throughout 2016. cash equities revenues, net of transaction-based expenses, were $196 million, $223 million and $220 million for the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
equity options volume decreased 13% for the year ended december 31, 2017, compared to the same period in 2016, and decreased 5% for the year ended december 31, 2016, from the comparable period in 2015. equity options revenues, net of transaction-based expenses, were $90 million, $98 million and $112 million for the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. equity options volume and revenues decreased the last several years primarily due to lower u.s. equity market volatility in 2017 and the restructuring of the nyse american options business. while revenues declined the last several years, the overall financial contribution of equity options was consistent with the prior years due to the retention of a higher percentage of profits from nyse american options driven by our repurchase of the equity in the exchange from the minority shareholders.
cds clearing revenues were $113 million, $107 million and $100 million for the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. the notional value of cds cleared during the same periods were $11.5 trillion, $11.5 trillion and $11.9 trillion, respectively. buy-side participation at our u.s. cds clearing house, ice clear credit, reached record levels in terms of number of participants and notional cleared due to increased participation from both u.s. and european buy-side customers due to greater regulatory certainty, the breadth of products offered, and cost efficient margining in the u.s. relative to europe.
cds trade execution revenues were $27 million, $36 million and $49 million for the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. cds trading remains muted due to financial reform and lower volatility in corporate credit markets. the
48
decrease in the cds trade execution revenues for the year ended december 31, 2017 is also impacted by the sale and discontinuance of our u.s. and u.k. cds voice brokerage operations in the third quarter of 2016.
other revenues other revenues primarily include interest income on certain clearing margin deposits, regulatory penalties and fines, fees for use of our facilities, regulatory fees charged to member organizations of our u.s. securities exchanges, designated market maker service fees, exchange membership fees and agricultural grading and certification fees. the increase in other revenues for the year ended december 31, 2017, from the comparable period in 2016, is primarily due to a $6 million breakup fee received in the third quarter of 2017 related to the termination of the derivatives clearing agreement with euronext, under which ice clear netherlands was to provide clearing of euronext's financial and commodity derivatives.

open interest is the aggregate number of contracts (long or short) that clearing members hold either for their own account or on behalf of their clients. open interest refers to the total number of contracts that are currently open - in other words, contracts that have been traded but not yet liquidated by either an offsetting trade, exercise, expiration or assignment. open interest is also a measure of the future activity remaining to be closed out in terms of the number of contracts that members and their clients continue to hold in the particular contract and by the number of contracts held for each contract month listed by the exchange. the following charts and table presents our year-end open interest for our futures and options contracts (in thousands, except for

for nyse cash equities, market share declined during 2017 due to historically low volatility driving more trading to off-exchange trading venues, particularly dark pools. for nyse equity options, market share decreased due to a strategic focus on maximizing revenues in an extremely competitive environment.
transaction-based expenses our equities and equity options markets pay fees to the sec pursuant to section 31 of the exchange act. section 31 fees are recorded on a gross basis as a component of transaction and clearing fee revenue. these section 31 fees are designed to recover the government's costs of supervising and regulating the securities markets and securities professionals. we, in turn, collect activity assessment fees, which are included in transaction and clearing revenues in our consolidated statements of income, from member organizations clearing or settling trades on the equities and options exchanges and recognize these amounts when invoiced. the activity assessment fees are designed so that they are equal to the section 31 fees that are included in transaction-based expenses in our consolidated statements of income. as a result, activity assessment fees and the corresponding section 31 fees do not have an impact on our net income. activity assessment fees received are included in cash at the time of receipt and, as required by law, the amount due to the sec is remitted semi-annually and recorded as an accrued liability until paid. as of december 31, 2017, the accrued liability related to the un-remitted sec section 31 fees was $128 million.
we also incur liquidity payments made to cash and options trading customers and routing charges made to other exchanges that are included in transaction-based expenses. we incur routing charges when we do not have the best bid or offer in the market
51
for a security that a customer is trying to buy or sell on one of our securities exchanges. in that case, we route the customer's order to the external market center that displays the best bid or offer. the external market center charges us a fee per share (denominated in tenths of a cent per share) for routing to its system. we record routing charges on a gross basis as a component of transaction and clearing fee revenue.
operating expenses, operating income and operating margin our trading and clearing segment operating expenses decreased $46 million for the year ended december 31, 2017, from the comparable period in 2016, and decreased $90 million for the year ended december 31, 2016, from the comparable period in 2015 (with the 2016 decrease being partially offset by the $33 million creditex customer relationship intangible asset impairment expense recorded in september 2016). see "- consolidated operating expenses" below for a discussion of the significant changes in our operating expenses.

the data and listings segment represents subscription-based, or recurring, revenues from data services and listings services offered across our trading and clearing businesses and ice data services. through ice data services, we generate revenues from a range of market data services, including the dissemination of our exchange and evaluated pricing data and analytics, desktops, connectivity and market data. through nyse, nyse american and nyse arca, we generate listings revenue related to the provision of listings services for public companies and etfs, and related corporate actions for listed companies.
for the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, 10%, 12% and 4%, respectively, of our data and listings segment revenues were billed in pounds sterling or euros (all relating to our data services revenues). as the pound sterling or euro exchange rate changes, the u.s. equivalent of revenues denominated in foreign currencies changes accordingly. due to the weakening of the pound sterling and euro the last two years compared to the u.s. dollar, our data services revenues were lower by $8 million for the year ended december 31, 2017 from the comparable period in 2016, and were lower by $24 million for the year ended december 31, 2016 from the comparable period in 2015.
data services revenues our pricing and analytics services consist of an extensive set of independent evaluated pricing services focused primarily on fixed income and international equity securities, valuation services, reference data, market data, end of day pricing, fixed income, equity portfolio analytics and risk management analytics. we also serve as an administrator of regulated benchmarks. our index services offer a range of products across fixed income, energy, equities, etfs and other asset classes to provide the methodology, pricing and licensing of indices and benchmarks.
our exchange data revenues primarily represent subscription fees for the provision of our market data that is created from activity on our exchanges, which is driven by the products and technology we develop to deliver real-time views of markets and related information. in our derivatives markets, exchange data revenues relate to subscription fees charged for customer and license access from third party data vendors, or quote vendors such as thomson reuters corporation and bloomberg, and from end users, as well as view-only data access, direct access services, terminal access, daily indices, forward curves, and end of day reports.
we also earn exchange data revenues relating to our cash equity and options markets, and related data services. we collect cash trading market data fees principally for consortium-based data products and, to a lesser extent, for nyse proprietary data
53
products. consortium-based data fees are determined by the securities industry plans and are charged to vendors based on their redistribution of data. consortium-based data revenues (net of administrative costs) are distributed to participating securities markets on the basis of a formula set by the sec under regulation nms. last trade prices and quotes in nyse-listed, nyse american-listed, and nyse arca-listed securities are disseminated through "tape a" and "tape b," which constitute the majority of our revenues from consortium-based market data revenues.
our desktop and connectivity services comprise technology-based information platforms, feeds and connectivity solutions. these include trading applications, desktop solutions, data feeds and infrastructure to support trading, voice brokers and investment functions. our desktop and web-based applications deliver real-time market information, analytical and decision support tools to support trading and investment decisions. through our consolidated feeds, clients receive market data from global exchanges, trading venues, news and data sources for exchange-traded and otc markets. our services offer clients a secure, resilient, private multi-participant network that provides access to global exchanges and content service providers. our infrastructure managed services solution also offers colocation space, direct exchange access, proximity hosting and support services that enable access to real-time exchange data, and facilitates low latency, secure electronic market access.
our data services revenues increased the last two years primarily due to the strong retention rate of existing customers, the addition of new customers, increased purchases by existing customers, the development of new and enhanced products serving the need for an expanded range of data, regulatory compliance and analytics solutions, and our acquisitions of interactive data and trayport in december 2015 and of securities evaluations and credit market analysis in october 2016. these increases were partially offset by the impact of foreign currency translation and the divestitures of idms and trayport in our desktop and connectivity business. we recognized $1.1 billion in data services revenues for interactive data, trayport, securities evaluations and credit market analysis during the year ended december 31, 2016, compared to $50 million in data services revenues for interactive data and trayport from the comparable period in 2015, subsequent to their acquisitions dates.
organic annual subscription value organic annual subscription value, or asv, represents, at a point in time, the data services revenues subscribed for the succeeding twelve months. asv does not include new sales, contract terminations or price changes that may occur during that twelve-month period. asv also does not include certain data services revenue streams that are not subscription-based. asv is adjusted for material acquisitions, divestitures or discontinued businesses to provide an organic view of comparable performance on a year over year basis at a beginning of the quarter. thus, while it is an indicative forward-looking metric, it does not provide a growth forecast of the next twelve months of data services revenues.
as of december 31, 2017, asv was $1.8 billion, a 6% increase compared to asv of $1.7 billion as of december 31, 2016. underpinning this growth is strength in both our pricing and analytics business and our connectivity services.
listings revenues we recognize listings revenues in our securities markets from fees applicable to companies listed on our cash equities exchanges - original listing fees and annual listing fees. original listing fees consist of two components: initial listing fees and fees related to corporate actions. initial listing fees, subject to a minimum and maximum amount, are based on the number of shares that a company initially lists. initial listing fees are recognized as revenue on a straight-line basis over estimated service periods of nine years for nyse and five years for nyse arca and nyse american. u.s. companies pay annual fees based on the number of outstanding shares the company has and non-u.s. companies pay annual fees based on the number of outstanding shares the company has issued or held in the u.s. annual fees are recognized as revenue on a pro rata basis over the calendar year, and generally received as cash in the first quarter of the year.
in addition, we earn corporate actions-related listing fees in connection with actions involving the issuance of new shares, such as stock splits, rights issues and sales of additional securities, as well as mergers and acquisitions. corporate actions-related listing fees are recognized as revenue on a straight-line basis over estimated service periods of six years for nyse and three years for nyse arca and nyse american. unamortized balances are recorded as deferred revenue in our consolidated balance sheet.
operating expenses, operating income and operating margin our data and listings segment operating expenses decreased $36 million for the year ended december 31, 2017, from the comparable period in 2016, and increased $834 million for the year ended december 31, 2016, from the comparable period in 2015. the increase in 2016 primarily relates to $812 million in operating expenses recognized relating to interactive data, trayport, securities evaluations and credit market analysis for the year ended december 31, 2016, compared to $39 million in operating expenses recognized relating to interactive data, trayport, securities evaluations and credit market analysis for the comparable period in 2015 (both excluding acquisition-related transaction and integration costs). see "- consolidated operating

expenses" below for further details on the interactive data, trayport, securities evaluations and credit market analysis operating expenses and for a discussion of the other significant changes in our operating expenses.
our data and listings segment operating income increased $140 million for the year ended december 31, 2017, from the comparable period in 2016, and increased $287 million for the year ended december 31, 2016, from the comparable period in 2015. data and listings segment operating margins were 41%, 37% and 47% for the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. the operating income and operating margin increases in 2017 were driven by the revenue increases discussed above and operating expense decreases discussed below.
our data and listings segment adjusted operating expenses were $1.2 billion, $1.2 billion and $556 million for the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. our data and listings segment adjusted operating income was $1.3 billion, $1.2 billion and $720 million for the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. our data and listings segment adjusted operating margins were 51%, 49% and 56% for the years for the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. see "- non-gaap financial measures" below.
consolidated operating expenses the majority of our operating expenses do not vary directly with changes in our volume and revenues, except for certain technology and communication expenses and a portion of our compensation expense that is tied directly to our data sales or overall financial performance, as discussed below. the following chart and table present our consolidated operating expenses (dollars in millions):

we expect our operating expenses to increase in absolute terms in future periods in connection with our acquisitions and growth of our business, and to vary from year to year based on the type and level of our acquisitions, our integrations and other investments.
for the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, 14%, 18% and 12%, respectively, of our consolidated operating expenses were incurred in pounds sterling or euros. as the pound sterling or euro exchange rate changes, the u.s. equivalent of operating expenses denominated in foreign currencies changes accordingly. due to the weakening of the pound sterling and euro the last two years compared to the u.s. dollar, our consolidated operating expenses were lower by $14 million for the year ended december 31, 2017 from the comparable period in 2016, and were lower by $40 million for the year ended december 31, 2016 from the comparable period in 2015. see item 7(a) "- quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk - foreign currency exchange rate risk" below for additional information on the impact of currency fluctuations.
compensation and benefits expenses compensation and benefits expense is our most significant operating expense and includes non-capitalized employee wages, bonuses, non-cash or stock compensation, certain severance costs, benefits and employer taxes. the bonus component of our compensation and benefits expense is based on both our financial performance and the individual employee performance and the performance-based restricted stock compensation expense is also based on our financial performance. therefore, our compensation and benefits expense will vary year to year based on our financial performance and fluctuations in the number of employees.
as of december 31, 2017 we had 4,952 employees, compared to 5,631 employees as of december 31, 2016 and 5,549 employees as of december 31, 2015. our employee headcount decreased as of december 31, 2017 primarily due to the divestitures in 2017 of idms, trayport and nyse governance services, and employee terminations in connection with our integration of interactive data, partially offset by the acquisitions of ngx and tmx atrium in 2017. our employee headcount increased as of december 31, 2016 and 2015 primarily due to acquisitions of securities evaluations, credit market analysis, interactive data and trayport during 2016 and 2015, converting contractor roles to employees at nyse, and hiring for clearing, technology, regulation and compliance. see "- recent developments" above.
compensation and benefits expenses increased for the year ended december 31, 2016, from the comparable period in 2015, primarily due to the increases in our employee headcount. we recognized $342 million in compensation and benefits expenses relating to the interactive data, trayport, securities evaluations and credit market analysis acquisitions during the year ended december 31, 2016, compared to $17 million in compensation and benefits expenses relating to the interactive data and trayport acquisitions during the year ended december 31, 2015, subsequent to their acquisitions.
we recorded $17 million, $33 million and $20 million in nyse and interactive data employee severance costs during the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, with such costs included in the acquisition-related transaction and integration costs discussed below and primarily related to executive departures. in addition, we incurred non-acquisition-related employee severance costs of $21 million, $10 million and $3 million for the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
non-cash compensation expenses recognized in our consolidated financial statements for employee stock options and restricted stock were $135 million, $123 million and $111 million for the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. the increase in non-cash compensation expenses in 2017 primarily relates to the integration of the interactive data employees into the ice non-cash incentive plans, and the increase in 2016 primarily relates to a greater number of employees receiving non-cash awards due to the headcount increases discussed above.
professional services expenses this expense includes fees for consulting services received on strategic and technology initiatives, temporary labor, as well as regulatory, legal and accounting fees. this expense may fluctuate as a result of changes in consulting and technology services, temporary labor, and regulatory, accounting and legal proceedings.
professional services expenses decreased the last two years primarily due to the continued reduction in professional services and contractors at nyse. we eliminated or replaced certain contractor positions with full-time employees at nyse in 2016 and 2015. in addition, during the year ended december 31, 2016, we recorded a credit from a third party service provider related to fees charged during 2015, and we incurred lower legal fees during the year ended december 31, 2016, from the comparable period in 2015. legal fees, which are included in professional services expenses, primarily related to class action lawsuits in which nyse is a defendant. these decreases were partially offset by professional services expenses incurred by interactive data, trayport, securities evaluations and credit market analysis following their acquisitions in 2016 and 2015.
acquisition-related transaction and integration costs we incurred $36 million in acquisition-related transaction and integration costs during the year ended december 31, 2017, primarily relating to our integrations of interactive data, securities evaluations and credit market analysis and our acquisitions of
56
bondpoint, tmx atrium, bofaml indices and nyse national. of this amount, $11 million was primarily related to the acquisitions. we incurred $25 million for interactive data, securities evaluations and credit market analysis integration costs during the year ended december 31, 2017, primarily relating to employee and lease termination costs and professional services costs.
we incurred $80 million in acquisition-related transaction and integration costs during the year ended december 31, 2016, primarily relating to our integrations of interactive data and nyse, legal and professional fees related to the trayport cma review, our investment in merscorp holdings, inc., owner of mortgage electronic registrations systems, inc., or collectively mers, our acquisitions of securities evaluations and credit market analysis, and various other potential and discontinued acquisitions. of this amount, $41 million was primarily related to the acquisitions and other transaction costs. we incurred $39 million for interactive data and nyse integration costs during the year ended december 31, 2016, primarily relating to employee and lease termination costs and professional services costs. as of december 31, 2016, the integration of nyse has been completed and we will no longer include any nyse integration costs in the future.
we incurred $88 million in acquisition-related transaction and integration costs during the year ended december 31, 2015, primarily relating to our acquisitions of interactive data and trayport and the integration of nyse. of this amount, $46 million was primarily related to the acquisition costs. we incurred $42 million for nyse integration costs during the year ended december 31, 2015, primarily relating to employee and lease termination costs and professional services costs.
we expect to continue to explore and pursue various potential acquisitions and other strategic opportunities to strengthen our competitive position and support our growth. as a result, we may incur acquisition-related transaction costs in future periods. see "- non-gaap financial measures" below.
technology and communication expenses technology support services consist of costs for running our wholly-owned data centers, hosting costs paid to third-party data centers, and maintenance of our computer hardware and software required to support our technology. these costs are driven by system capacity, functionality and redundancy requirements. communication expenses consist of costs for network connection for our electronic platforms, telecommunications costs, and fees paid for access to external market data. this expense also includes licensing and other fee agreement expenses which may be impacted by growth in electronic contract volume, our capacity requirements, changes in the number of telecommunications hubs and connections with customers to access our electronic platforms directly.
technology and communications expenses increased the last two years primarily due to technology expenses incurred by interactive data, trayport, securities evaluations and credit market analysis following their acquisitions in 2016 and 2015. in addition, during the last two years, we incurred increased hardware and software support costs related to our trading and clearing platforms and our data services.
rent and occupancy expenses this expense consists of costs related to leased and owned property including rent, maintenance, real estate taxes, utilities and other related costs. we have significant operations located in and around atlanta, new york and london with smaller offices located throughout the world. see item 2 "- properties" above for additional information regarding our leased and owned property.
the increase in rent and occupancy expenses for the year ended december 31, 2016, from the comparable period in 2015, is primarily due to rent and occupancy expenses relating to interactive data, trayport, securities evaluations and credit market analysis subsequent to their acquisitions. excluding the impact of the acquisitions, rent and occupancy expenses decreased the last two years primarily due to reduced rent and occupancy costs realized due to the continued consolidation of our atlanta, new york and london office locations.
selling, general and administrative expenses this expense relates to expenses from marketing, advertising, public relations, insurance, bank service charges, dues and subscriptions, travel and entertainment, non-income taxes and other general and administrative costs.
selling, general and administrative expenses increased for the year ended december 31, 2017, from the comparable period in 2016, primarily due to the acquisitions of securities evaluations and credit market analysis and $14 million in accruals relating to ongoing investigations and inquiries during the year ended december 31, 2017. refer to note 14 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes, which are included elsewhere in this annual report, for more information on the ongoing investigations and inquiries. selling, general and administrative expenses increased for the year ended december 31, 2016, from the comparable period in 2015, primarily due to selling, general and administrative expenses incurred by interactive data, trayport, securities evaluations and credit market analysis following their acquisitions in 2016 and 2015. excluding the impact of the acquisitions, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased the last two years primarily due to the release of non-income tax-related reserves and lower marketing expenses.
57
depreciation and amortization expenses depreciation and amortization expense results from depreciation of long-lived assets such as buildings, leasehold improvements, planes, furniture, fixtures and equipment over their estimated useful lives. this expense includes amortization of intangible assets obtained in our acquisitions of businesses, as well as on various licensing agreements, over their estimated useful lives. intangible assets subject to amortization consist primarily of customer relationships, trading products with finite lives and technology. this expense also includes amortization of internally developed and purchased software over their estimated useful lives.
we recorded amortization expenses on the intangible assets acquired as part of our acquisitions, as well as on the other intangible assets, of $272 million, $323 million and $160 million for the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. the decrease in the amortization expenses recorded on the intangible assets for the year ended december 31, 2017, from the comparable period in 2016, is primarily due to a reduction in amortization expenses recorded on intangible assets which became fully amortized (primarily related to certain of the nyse intangible assets) and the divestitures of trayport and nyse governance services, partially offset by amortization expenses recorded on the securities evaluations, credit market analysis, ngx and tmx atrium intangible assets. the increase in the amortization expenses recorded on the intangible assets for the year ended december 31, 2016, from the comparable period in 2015, is primarily due to amortization expenses recorded on the interactive data, trayport, securities evaluations and credit market analysis intangible assets, following their acquisitions.
in addition, we recognized a net loss of $6 million on the sale of nyse governance services, which was recorded in depreciation and amortization expenses for the year ended december 31, 2017 (see "- recent developments" above), and we recorded an impairment of the creditex customer relationship intangible asset of $33 million, which was recorded in depreciation and amortization expenses for the year ended december 31, 2016. in august 2016, we sold certain of creditex's u.s. voice brokerage operations to tullett prebon. during the third quarter of 2016, we discontinued creditex's u.k. voice brokerage operations. we continue to operate creditex's electronically traded markets and systems, post-trade connectivity platforms and intellectual property. in connection with the divestiture of the voice brokerage business, it was determined that the carrying value of the cds creditex customer relationship intangible asset was not fully recoverable and an impairment of the asset was recorded in september 2016 for $33 million.
we recorded depreciation expenses on our fixed assets of $257 million, $254 million and $213 million for the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, with the increase in 2016 primarily relating to our acquisitions of interactive data, trayport, securities evaluations and credit market analysis.
consolidated non-operating income (expenses)
income and expenses incurred through activities outside of our core operations are considered non-operating. the following tables present our non-operating income (expenses) (dollars in millions):

interest expense increased for the year ended december 31, 2017, from the comparable period in 2016, primarily due to interest expense that we recognized relating to the $1.0 billion in senior notes issued in august 2017, partially offset by the repayment of $850 million of the 2.00% senior unsecured fixed rate notes due in october 2017, or the nyse notes, in september 2017. interest expense increased for the year ended december 31, 2016, from the comparable period in 2015, primarily due to the interest expense we recognized on the additional debt incurred to finance the interactive data acquisition in december 2015. see "- debt" below.
on december 14, 2017, we sold trayport to tmx group for £550 million ($733 million based on the pound sterling/u.s. dollar exchange rate of 1.3331 as of december 14, 2017). we recognized a net gain of $110 million on the divestiture of trayport, which was recorded as other income for the year ended december 31, 2017. see "- recent developments - divestiture of trayport and the acquisitions of ngx and shorcan energy" above.
in connection with cetip's merger with bm&fbovespa s.a., now b3, and its subsequent sale, we recognized a $176 million realized investment gain in other income for the year ended december 31, 2017 and we recognized $9 million in foreign exchange losses and transaction expenses in other expense for the year ended december 31, 2017. see "- recent developments - cetip

investment gain" above. we recognized dividend income received relating to our investment in cetip in other income, which was $5 million, $17 million and $16 million for the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. we no longer receive any dividends from cetip subsequent to its sale in the first quarter of 2017.
we account for our investments in mers and the options clearing corporation, or occ, as equity method investments. we recognized $36 million, $25 million and $6 million in equity income related to these investments during the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, as other income.
we incurred foreign currency transaction losses of $4 million, $1 million and $14 million for the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. this was primarily attributable to the fluctuations of the pound sterling and euro relative to the u.s. dollar. foreign currency gains and losses are recorded in other income (expense) and relate to the settlement of foreign currency assets, liabilities and payables that occur through our foreign operations that are received in non-functional currencies due to the increase or decrease in the period-end foreign currency exchange rates between periods. see item 7a "- quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk - foreign currency exchange rate risk" included elsewhere in this annual report for more information on these items.
we recognized interest income on our investments of $8 million, $3 million and $6 million during the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, which were recorded as other income. during the year ended december 31, 2015, we incurred $15 million in settlements and accruals for various outstanding legal matters (net of insurance proceeds), which was recorded in other expense.
for consolidated subsidiaries in which our ownership is less than 100%, and for which we have control over the assets, liabilities and management of the entity, the outside stockholders' interests are shown as non-controlling interest in our consolidated financial statements. as of december 31, 2016, non-controlling interest included those related to the operating results of our cds clearing subsidiaries in which non-ice limited partners held a 42.5% net profit sharing interest; ice endex in which gasunie held a 21% ownership interest; and ice clear netherlands in which abn amro clearing held a 25% ownership interest. for both ice endex and ice clear netherlands, in addition to the non-controlling interest reported in the consolidated statements of income, we reported redeemable non-controlling interest in the consolidated balance sheets which represents the minority interest redemption fair value for each company.
during june 2017, we purchased both gasunie's 21% minority ownership interest in ice endex and abn amro clearing's 25% minority ownership interest in ice clear netherlands. subsequent to these acquisitions, we own 100% of ice endex and ice clear netherlands and will no longer include any non-controlling interest amounts for ice endex and ice clear netherlands in our consolidated financial statements. during the year ended december 31, 2017, we purchased 12.6% of the net profit sharing interest in our cds clearing subsidiaries from several non-ice limited partners and the remaining non-ice limited partners hold a 29.9% net profit sharing interest in our cds clearing subsidiaries as of december 31, 2017.
consolidated income tax provision consolidated income tax expense (benefit) was $(25) million, $580 million and $358 million for the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. the change in consolidated income tax expense (benefit) between years is primarily due to the tax impact of changes in our pre-tax income and the changes in our effective tax rate each year. our effective tax rate was (1)%, 29% and 22% for the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. the effective tax rates for the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 are lower than the federal statutory rate primarily due to favorable u.s. and u.k. tax law changes and favorable foreign income tax rate differentials, partially offset by state income taxes. favorable foreign income tax rate differentials result primarily from lower income tax rates in the u.k. and various other lower tax jurisdictions as compared to the historical income tax rates in the u.s.
during the fourth quarter of 2015, the u.k. reduced their corporate income tax rate from 20% to 19% effective april 1, 2017 and to 18% effective april 1, 2020. during the third quarter of 2016, the u.k. further reduced their corporate income tax rate from 18% to 17% effective april 1, 2020. during december 2017, the tcja reduced the u.s. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective january 1, 2018. see "- recent developments" above. the reduction in u.s. and u.k. corporate income tax rates resulted in deferred tax benefits in the respective periods of enactment. the impact of the deferred tax benefits for the u.s. and u.k. corporate income tax rate reductions for the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 lowered the effective tax rates by 30%, 2% and 4%, respectively, and resulted in deferred tax benefits of $764 million, $34 million and $60 million, respectively.
the decrease in the effective tax rate for the year ended december 31, 2017, from the comparable period in 2016, is primarily due to the deferred tax benefit associated with the future u.s. income tax rate reduction and tax benefits associated with a divestiture in the second quarter of 2017, partially offset by the deferred tax benefit from the u.k. corporate income tax reduction in the third quarter of 2016, additional tax expense from an illinois corporate income tax rate increase enacted in the third quarter of 2017, and an income tax expense increase due to a relatively higher u.s. mix of income in 2017. the increase in the effective tax rate for the year ended december 31, 2016, from the comparable period in 2015, is primarily due to the tax impact of foreign versus u.s. based pre-tax income, lower deferred tax benefits associated with the future u.k. income tax rate reductions, and greater favorable settlements with
59
various taxing authorities in 2015, partially offset by a tax benefit from the early adoption of asu 2016-09 in 2016. see note 12 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes, which are included elsewhere is this annual report, for additional information on these tax items.
quarterly results of operations the following quarterly unaudited consolidated statements of income data has been prepared on substantially the same basis as our audited consolidated financial statements and includes all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for the fair presentation of our consolidated results of operations for the quarters presented. the historical results for any quarter do not necessarily indicate the results expected for any future period. this unaudited condensed consolidated quarterly data should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report. the following table sets forth quarterly consolidated statements of income data (in millions):

(1) the increase in the depreciation and amortization expenses for the three months ended september 30, 2016 is primarily due to the $33 million creditex customer relationship intangible asset impairment. see "- consolidated operating expenses" above.
(2) other income (expense), net for the three months ended december 31, 2017 includes a $110 million gain on our sale of trayport, and for the three months ended march 31, 2017, includes a $176 million realized investment gain in connection with the sale of our investment in cetip. see "- recent developments" above.
(3) the decrease in the income tax expenses for the three months ended december 31, 2017 is primarily due to a $764 million deferred tax benefit associated with future u.s. income tax reductions, the decrease for the three months ended june 30, 2017 is primarily due to the tax benefit associated with a divestiture, and the decrease for the three months ended september 30, 2016 is primarily due to a deferred tax benefit associated with future u.k. income tax rate reductions. see "- consolidated income tax provision" above.

liquidity and capital resources below are charts that reflect our capital allocation. the acquisition and integration costs in the chart below includes both the net cash paid for the acquisitions and the acquisition-related transaction and integration costs in each year.
we have financed our operations, growth and cash needs primarily through income from operations and borrowings under our various debt facilities. our principal capital requirements have been to fund capital expenditures, working capital, strategic acquisitions and investments, stock repurchases, dividends to our shareholders and the continued development of our technology platforms that support our businesses. we believe that our cash on hand and cash flows from operations will be sufficient to repay our outstanding debt as it matures. in the future, we may need to incur additional debt or issue additional equity securities, which we may be unable to do or to do on favorable terms. see "- future capital requirements" below.
our commercial paper program enables us to borrow efficiently at reasonable short-term interest rates and provides us with the flexibility to de-lever using our strong annual cash flows from operating activities whenever our leverage becomes elevated as a result of investment or acquisition activities. we reduced our outstanding commercial paper during the year ended december 31, 2017 by $409 million, primarily using net cash proceeds received from the sale of our investment in cetip, the sale of trayport and cash flows from operations, partially offset by acquisitions and investments we made in 2017. see "- debt" below.
see "- recent developments" above for a discussion of the acquisitions and investments that we made during the year ended december 31, 2017. these cash acquisitions and investments were funded from borrowing under our commercial paper program, cash flows from operations and a portion of the proceeds received from our divestitures during the year ended december 31, 2017.
upon maturity of old issuances of commercial paper and to the extent old issuances are not repaid by cash on hand, we are exposed to the rollover risk of not being able to issue new commercial paper. to mitigate the rollover risk, we maintain an undrawn back-stop bank revolving credit facility for an aggregate amount equaling at any time the amount issued under our commercial paper program. if we were not able to issue new commercial paper, we have the option of drawing on the back-stop revolving facility, however electing to do so would result in higher interest expense. see "- debt" below.
consolidated cash and cash equivalents were $535 million and $407 million as of december 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. we had $1.0 billion and $943 million in short-term and long-term restricted cash and cash equivalents as of december 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively and $432 million in long-term investments as of december 31, 2016 (relating to our investment in cetip, which was sold in 2017). we consider all short-term, highly-liquid investments with original maturity dates of three months or less to be cash equivalents. we classify all investments with original maturity dates in excess of three months but less than one year as short-term investments and all investments that we intend to hold for more than one year as long-term investments. cash and investments that are

not available for general use, either due to regulatory requirements or through restrictions in specific agreements, are classified as restricted cash and investments.
as of december 31, 2017, the amount of unrestricted cash held by our non-u.s. subsidiaries was $325 million. while we consider our non-u.s. earnings to be indefinitely reinvested overseas, if these cash balances are needed for our operations in the u.s., any repatriation by way of dividend may be subject to both u.s. federal and state income taxes, as adjusted for any non-u.s. tax credits. such dividends may not be subject to u.s. federal tax under the tcja and we will continue to monitor both federal and state interpretations, guidance and regulations concerning u.s. tax reform. however, we do not have any current needs or foreseeable future needs or other plans to repatriate cash by way of dividends from our non-u.s. subsidiaries. we will continue to evaluate our indefinite reinvestment assertion in light of any further u.s. tax reform developments.
our cash and cash equivalents and financial investments are managed as a global treasury portfolio of non-speculative financial instruments that are readily convertible into cash, such as overnight deposits, term deposits, money market funds, mutual funds for treasury investments, short duration fixed income investments and other money market instruments, thus ensuring high liquidity of financial assets. we may invest a portion of our cash in excess of short-term operating needs in investment-grade marketable debt securities, including government or government-sponsored agencies and corporate debt securities.
certain of these investments, with an original maturity of greater than three months, will be classified as available-for-sale in accordance with relevant accounting standards. available-for-sale investments are carried at their fair values with unrealized gains and losses, reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. realized gains and losses, and declines in value deemed to be other-than-temporary on available-for-sale investments, are recognized currently in earnings. we do not have any investments classified as held-to-maturity or trading.
during the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, we repurchased 14,966,616 shares, 902,920 shares and 14,343,845 shares, respectively, of our outstanding common stock at a cost of $949 million, $50 million and $660 million, respectively. the shares repurchased are held in treasury stock. these repurchases were completed on the open market and under our rule 10b5-1 trading plan. in connection with our acquisition of interactive data during the fourth quarter of 2015, we suspended our stock repurchase plan for a period of time. the timing and extent of future repurchases that are not made pursuant to a rule 10b5-1 trading plan will be at our discretion and will depend upon many conditions. our management periodically reviews whether or not to be active in repurchasing our stock. in making a determination regarding any stock repurchases, we consider multiple factors. the factors may include: overall stock market conditions, our common stock price movements, the remaining amount authorized for repurchases by our board of directors, the potential impact of a stock repurchase program on our corporate debt ratings, our expected free cash flow and working capital needs, our current and future planned strategic growth initiatives, and other potential uses of our cash and capital resources.
in august 2016, our board of directors approved an aggregate of $1.0 billion for future repurchases of our common stock with no fixed expiration date. in september 2017, our board of directors approved an aggregate of $1.2 billion for future repurchases of our common stock with no fixed expiration date that becomes effective as of january 1, 2018. we expect funding for any share repurchases to come from our operating cash flow or borrowings under our debt facilities or our commercial paper program.
repurchases may be made from time to time on the open market, through established trading plans, in privately-negotiated transactions or otherwise, in accordance with all applicable securities laws, rules and regulations. we have entered into a rule 10b5-1 trading plan, as authorized by our board of directors, to govern some or all of the repurchases of our shares of common stock. we may discontinue the stock repurchases at any time and may amend or terminate the rule 10b5-1 trading plan at any time. the approval of our board of directors for the share repurchases does not obligate us to acquire any particular amount of our common stock. in addition, our board of directors may increase or decrease the amount of capacity we have for repurchases from time to time.

the fasb has issued asu 2016-18, statement of cash flows: restricted cash, that requires entities to show the changes in the total of cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and cash equivalents in the statement of cash flows. as a result, entities will no longer present transfers between cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash and cash equivalents in the statement of cash flows. in the fourth quarter of 2017, we adopted asu 2016-18 and reclassified changes in restricted cash from cash flow provided by (used in) investing activities to the total change in beginning-of-year and end-of-year total amounts shown on the consolidated statements of cash flows for the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015. this new standard is a change in cash flow statement presentation only. refer to note 2 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes, which are included elsewhere in this annual report, for more information on the impact of the adoption of asu 2016-18.
operating activities net cash provided by operating activities primarily consists of net income adjusted for certain non-cash items, including depreciation and amortization and the effects of changes in working capital. fluctuations in net cash provided by operating activities are primarily attributable to increases and decreases in our net income between periods and due to fluctuations in working capital.
the $64 million decrease in net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december 31, 2017, from the comparable period in 2016, is primarily due to a $136 million contribution that was made to our pension plan in september 2017, compared to a $10 million contribution that was made to our pension plan in september 2016. the pension contribution in september 2017 allowed us to reach 99% funding of our pension obligation and allowed us to immunize the liability against future market fluctuations. for additional information on our pension plan, refer to note 15 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes, which are included elsewhere in this annual report.
the $838 million increase in net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december 31, 2016, from the comparable period in 2015, is primarily due to $393 million in cash provided by operating activities for interactive data, trayport, securities evaluations and credit market analysis for the year ended december 31, 2016, increase in the net income of our historical income statement excluding the acquisitions, and other fluctuations in working capital (including the impact of the increase in cash paid for income taxes in 2015).

we paid cash for acquisitions, net of cash acquired, of $423 million, $425 million and $3.8 billion, respectively, for the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, primarily relating to the ngx, shorcan energy, bofaml indices and tmx atrium acquisitions during the year ended december 31, 2017, the securities evaluations and credit market analysis acquisitions during the year ended december 31, 2016, and the interactive data acquisition during the year ended december 31, 2015. we received cash from our divestitures of $761 million during the year ended december 31, 2017, relating to the sales of trayport, idms and nyse governance services. we received net cash proceeds from the sale of our investment in cetip of $438 million. we made purchases of cost and equity method investments of $327 million, $70 million and $60 million during the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, relating to our investments in euroclear, mers and occ. see "- recent developments" above for more details on these acquisitions, divestitures and investments. we received proceeds from term deposits of $1.1 billion during the year ended december 31, 2015 relating to the repayments of outstanding debt.
capital expenditures were $220 million, $250 million and $190 million for the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and we had capitalized software development expenditures of $137 million, $115 million and $87 million for the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. the capital expenditures primarily relate to hardware purchases to continue the development and expansion of our electronic platforms, data services and clearing houses and leasehold improvements associated

with the new and renovated office spaces in atlanta, new york and london. the software development expenditures primarily relate to the continued development and expansion of our electronic trading platforms, data services and clearing houses.

amended credit facility we had previously entered into a $3.4 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility, or the credit facility, with a maturity date of november 13, 2020, pursuant to a credit agreement with wells fargo bank, n.a., or wells fargo, as administrative agent, issuing lender and swing-line lender, bank of america, n.a., as syndication agent, backup administrative agent and swing-line lender, and the lenders party thereto. on august 18, 2017, we agreed with the lenders to, amongst other items, extend the maturity date to august 18, 2022, herein referred to as the amended credit facility. the amended credit facility includes an option for us to propose an increase in the aggregate amount available for borrowing by up to $975 million, subject to the consent of the lenders funding the increase and certain other conditions.
64
other amendments within the amended credit facility include, but are not limited to, (i) eliminating the step-up in the commitment fee ratings-based grid that was scheduled to take effect in april 2019, (ii) removing ice europe parent limited as a party to the credit agreement, (iii) removing the guaranty by ice in respect of ice europe parent limited, (iv) increasing the maximum leverage ratio to 3.50:1.00, and (v) up to two times, increasing the maximum leverage ratio from 3.50:1.00 to 4.00:1.00 for a period of one year following a material acquisition.
no amounts were outstanding under the amended credit facility as of december 31, 2017. amounts borrowed under the amended credit facility may be prepaid at any time without premium or penalty. the amended credit facility provides for a $3.4 billion multi-currency revolving facility, with sub-limits for non-dollar borrowings and letters of credit and with a swing-line facility available on a same-day basis. of the $3.4 billion that is currently available for borrowing under the amended credit facility, $1.2 billion is required to back-stop the amount outstanding under our commercial paper program as of december 31, 2017 and $100 million is required to support certain subsidiary clearing house commitments. the amount required to back-stop the amounts outstanding under the commercial paper program will fluctuate as we increase or decrease our commercial paper borrowings. the remaining $2.1 billion available under the amended credit facility as of december 31, 2017 is available to us to use for working capital and general corporate purposes including, but not limited to, acting as a back-stop to future increases in the amounts outstanding under the commercial paper program.
borrowings under the amended credit facility will bear interest on the principal amount outstanding at either (a) libor plus an applicable margin rate or (b) a "base rate" plus an applicable margin rate; provided, however, that all loans denominated in a foreign currency will bear interest at libor plus an applicable margin rate. the "base rate" equals the higher of (i) wells fargo's prime rate, (ii) the federal funds rate plus 0.50%, or (iii) the one-month libor rate plus 1.00%. the applicable margin rate is based upon our public long-term debt ratings and ranges from 0.875% to 1.50% on libor borrowings and from 0.00% to 0.50% on base rate borrowings.
the amended credit facility includes an unutilized revolving credit commitment fee that is equal to the unused maximum revolver amount, multiplied by an applicable commitment fee rate and is payable in arrears on a quarterly basis. the applicable commitment fee rate ranges from 0.08% to 0.20% and is determined based on our long-term debt rating. as of december 31, 2017, the applicable commitment fee rate was 0.125% based on our current long-term debt ratings.
senior notes on august 17, 2017, we issued $1.0 billion in aggregate senior notes, including $500 million principal amount of 2.35% senior unsecured fixed rate notes due september 2022, or the 2022 senior notes, and $500 million principal amount of 3.10% senior unsecured fixed rate notes due september 2027, or the 2027 senior notes. we used the majority of the net proceeds from the 2022 senior notes and 2027 senior notes offering to fund the redemption of the nyse notes.
in november 2015, we issued $2.5 billion in aggregate senior notes, including $1.25 billion principal amount of 2.75% senior unsecured fixed rate notes due november 2020, or the 2020 senior notes, and $1.25 billion principal amount of 3.75% senior unsecured fixed rate notes due november 2025, or the 2025 senior notes. we used the net proceeds from the 2020 senior notes and 2025 senior notes offering, together with $1.6 billion of borrowings under our commercial paper program, to finance the $4.1 billion cash portion of the purchase price of the acquisition of interactive data.
commercial paper program we have entered into our commercial paper program, which is currently backed by the borrowing capacity available under the amended credit facility, equal to the amount of the commercial paper that is issued and outstanding at any given point in time. the effective interest rate of commercial paper issuances does not materially differ from short-term interest rates (such as usd libor). the fluctuation of these rates due to market conditions may impact our interest expense.
we repaid $409 million of net notes outstanding under the commercial paper program during the year ended december 31, 2017 primarily using net cash proceeds received from the sale of our investment in cetip and the sale of trayport. these repayments were partially offset by notes issued under the commercial paper program during the year ended december 31, 2017 for the cash acquisitions and investments and to repurchase our common stock. we used net proceeds from notes issued under the commercial paper program during the year ended december 31, 2016 to finance part of the cash purchase price of the securities evaluations and credit market analysis acquisitions and for general corporate purposes. we used net proceeds from notes issued under the commercial paper program during the year ended december 31, 2015 to finance part of the cash portion of the purchase price of the interactive data acquisition and to pay related fees and expenses, to repurchase our common stock, and for general corporate purposes. we repaid a portion of the amounts outstanding under the commercial paper program during the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 with cash flows from operations.
commercial paper notes of $1.2 billion with original maturities ranging from two to 64 days were outstanding as of december 31, 2017 under our commercial paper program. as of december 31, 2017, the weighted average interest rate on the $1.2 billion outstanding under our commercial paper program was 1.49% per annum, with a weighted average maturity of 18 days.
65
commercial paper notes of $1.6 billion with original maturities ranging from three to 68 days were outstanding as of december 31, 2016 under the commercial paper program. as of december 31, 2016, the weighted average interest rate on the $1.6 billion outstanding under the commercial paper program was 0.74% per annum, with a weighted average maturity of 18 days.
nyse notes the $850 million, 2.00% senior unsecured fixed rate nyse notes were due in october 2017. we redeemed the nyse notes in full in september 2017 using the majority of the proceeds from the 2022 senior notes and 2027 senior notes offering.
refer to note 10 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes, which are included elsewhere in this annual report, for additional information on our debt and debt facilities.
future capital requirements our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including the rate of growth across our trading and clearing and data and listings segments, strategic plans and acquisitions, available sources for financing activities, required technology and clearing initiatives, regulatory requirements, the timing and introduction of new products and enhancements to existing products, the geographic mix of our business, potential stock repurchases, and the continuing market acceptance of our electronic trading and clearing platforms. we currently expect to make aggregate capital expenditures (including operational and real estate capital expenditures) and to incur capitalized software development costs ranging between $300 million and $330 million for the year ended december 31, 2018, which we believe will support the enhancement of our technology, business integration and the continued growth of our businesses.
our board of directors has adopted a quarterly dividend declaration policy providing that the declaration of any dividends will be determined quarterly by the board of directors or the audit committee of the board of directors taking into account such factors as our evolving business model, prevailing business conditions and our financial results and capital requirements, without a predetermined annual net income payout ratio. during the year ended december 31, 2017, we paid cash dividends of $0.80 per share of our common stock in the aggregate, including 2017 quarterly dividends of $0.20 per share, for an aggregate payout of $476 million in 2017, which includes the payment of dividend equivalents on unvested employee restricted stock units. refer to note 11 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes, which are included elsewhere in this annual report, for details on the amounts of our quarterly dividend payouts for the last three years. for the first quarter of 2018, we announced a $0.24 per share dividend, which is a 20% increase over the prior dividend, which is payable on march 29, 2018 to shareholders of record as of march 15, 2018.
as of december 31, 2017, we had $6.1 billion in outstanding debt. we currently have a $3.4 billion amended credit facility. after factoring in the $1.2 billion required to back-stop the commercial paper program as of december 31, 2017 and $100 million that is required to support certain subsidiary clearing house commitments, $2.1 billion of our amended credit facility is currently available for general corporate purposes. the amended credit facility and our commercial paper program are currently the only significant agreements or arrangements that we have with third parties for liquidity and capital resources. in the event of any strategic acquisitions, mergers or investments, or if we are required to raise capital for any reason or desire to return capital to our stockholders, we may incur additional debt, issue additional equity to raise necessary funds, repurchase additional shares of our common stock or pay a dividend. however, we cannot provide assurance that such financing or transactions will be available or successful, or that the terms of such financing or transactions will be favorable to us. see "- debt" above.
non-gaap financial measures we use non-gaap measures internally to evaluate our performance and in making financial and operational decisions. when viewed in conjunction with our gaap results and the accompanying reconciliation, we believe that our presentation of these measures provides investors with greater transparency and a greater understanding of factors affecting our financial condition and results of operations than gaap measures alone. in addition, we believe the presentation of these measures is useful to investors for period-to-period comparison of results because the items described below as adjustments to gaap are not reflective of our core business performance. these financial measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative to, gaap financial measures and may be different from non-gaap measures used by other companies. we use these adjusted results because we believe they more clearly highlight trends in our business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on gaap financial measures, since these measures eliminate from our results specific financial items that have less bearing on our core operating performance. we strongly recommend that investors review the gaap financial measures included in this annual report, including our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto.
adjusted operating expenses, adjusted operating income, adjusted operating margin, adjusted net income attributable to ice common shareholders and adjusted earnings per share for the periods presented below are calculated by adding or subtracting the adjustments described below, which are not reflective of our cash operations and core business performance, and their related income tax effect and other tax adjustments (in millions, except for percentages and per share amounts):

acquisition-related transaction costs are included as part of our core business expenses, except for those that are directly related to the announcement, closing, financing or termination of a transaction. however, the acquisition-related transaction and integration costs relating to interactive data and nyse are included in non-gaap adjustments given the sizes of these acquisitions. as of june 30, 2016, the integration of nyse has been completed and we will no longer include any nyse integration costs as non-gaap
67
adjustments following this date. amortization of acquisition-related intangibles are included in non-gaap adjustments as excluding these non-cash expenses provides greater clarity regarding our financial strength and stability of cash operating results.
during the year ended december 31, 2017, we include as non-gaap adjustments the cetip realized investment gain and the foreign exchange loss and transaction expenses on the sale of our investment in cetip, as the sale of our investment in cetip is not part of our core business operations. during the year ended december 31, 2017, we include as non-gaap adjustments the net gain on the divestiture of trayport, the accruals relating to ongoing investigations and inquiries, and the nyse governance services net loss on its divestiture, as they are non-recurring items. during the year ended december 31, 2016, we include as non-gaap adjustments the creditex u.k. voice brokerage severance costs related to its discontinuance and the creditex customer relationship intangible asset impairment expense, as they are non-recurring items. during the year ended december 31, 2015, we include as non-gaap adjustments various litigation settlements and accruals and the interest expense on the senior notes and commercial paper we issued for the interactive data acquisition (from the issuance date of the new senior notes on november 24, 2015 and on the issuance dates of the commercial paper in early december 2015 to the acquisition date of interactive data on december 14, 2015), as they are not part of our core business operations or represent non-recurring items.
the income tax effects relating to the items above are included in non-gaap adjustments as well as deferred tax adjustments on acquisition-related intangibles and other tax adjustments. the tax items in non-gaap adjustments are either the tax impacts of the pre-tax non-gaap adjustments or are tax items as described below that are not in the normal course of business and are not indicative of our core business performance.
the income tax effects of the pre-tax non-gaap adjustments for the year ended december 31, 2017 include tax benefits associated with the divestiture of nyse governance services. the tax adjustments on u.s. tax reform mainly include the $764 million deferred tax benefit as a result of the enactment of tcja in the last quarter of 2017, which reduces the corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%. deferred tax adjustments on acquisition-related intangibles include the impact of u.s. state tax law and apportionment changes which resulted in deferred tax expense of $10 million, deferred tax expense of $12 million, and deferred tax benefits of $22 million for the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. in addition, deferred tax adjustments on acquisition-related intangibles include $34 million and $60 million deferred tax benefits due to u.k. corporate income tax rate reductions for the years ended december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. other tax adjustments for the year ended december 31, 2016 relate to a $15 million valuation allowance on singapore pre-acquisition net operating losses and other deferred tax assets and an $8 million deferred tax adjustment with respect to our occ equity method investment. other tax adjustments for the year ended december 31, 2015 represents a $7 million uncertain tax position relating to a retrospective foreign tax law change for a pre-acquisition period.

off-balance sheet arrangements except for certain clearing house collateral that is reported off-balance sheet, we do not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. refer to note 13 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes, which are included elsewhere in this annual report, for more information on our clearing houses' collateral.
contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following table presents, for the periods indicated, our contractual obligations (which we intend to fund from our existing cash as well as cash flow from operations) and commercial commitments as of december 31, 2017 (in millions):

purchase obligations include our estimate of the minimum outstanding obligations under agreements to purchase goods or services that we believe are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum
68
quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancellable at any time without penalty.
we have excluded from the contractual obligations and commercial commitments table above $51.2 billion in cash margin deposits, guaranty funds and delivery contracts payable. clearing members of our clearing houses are required to deposit original margin and variation margin and to make deposits to a guaranty fund. the cash deposits made to these margin accounts and to the guaranty fund are recorded in the consolidated balance sheet as current assets with corresponding current liabilities to the clearing members that deposited them. ngx administers the physical delivery of energy trading contracts. it has an equal and offsetting claim to and from their respective participants on opposite sides of the physically settled contract. this balance is reflected as a delivery contract receivable with an offsetting delivery contract payable. see note 13 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes that are included elsewhere in this annual report for additional information on our clearing houses and the margin deposits, guaranty funds and delivery contracts payable.
we have also excluded unrecognized tax benefits, or utbs, from the contractual obligations and commercial commitments table above. as of december 31, 2017, our cumulative utbs were $115 million. interest and penalties related to utbs were $35 million as of december 31, 2017. we are under examination by various tax authorities. we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the periods of cash settlement because it is not possible to reasonably predict the amount of tax, interest and penalties, if any, that might be assessed by a tax authority or the timing of an assessment or payment. it is also not possible to reasonably predict whether or not the applicable statutes of limitations might expire without us being examined by any particular tax authority. see note 12 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes that are included elsewhere in this annual report for additional information on our utbs.
as of december 31, 2017, in connection with our acquisition of nyse, we have obligations related to our pension and other benefit programs. the date of payment under these obligations cannot be determined and have been excluded from the table above. see note 15 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes that are included elsewhere in this annual report for additional information on our pension and other benefit programs.
we have a 40% ownership in occ. under the occ's capital plan, the occ shareholders have committed to contribute up to $200 million in equity capital if certain capital thresholds are breached, including up to $80 million to be contributed by nyse, which has also been excluded from the table above.
new and recently adopted accounting pronouncements refer to note 2 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report for information on the new and recently adopted accounting pronouncements that are applicable to us.
critical accounting policies we have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations. the impact of, and any associated risks related to, these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout "- management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations." for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies, see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report. our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with u.s. gaap. the preparation of financial statements in conformity with these accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, at the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
we evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis, including those related to the accounting matters described below. we base our estimates and judgments on our historical experience and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances when we make these estimates and judgments. based on these factors, we make estimates and judgments about, among other things, the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from market prices or other independent sources and about the recognition and characterization of our revenues and expenses. the values and results based on these estimates and judgments could differ significantly under different assumptions or conditions and could change materially in the future.
we believe that the following critical accounting policies, among others, affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and could materially increase or decrease our reported results, assets and liabilities.
goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets
69
we have significant intangible assets related to goodwill and other acquired intangible assets. in connection with our acquisitions, assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at their estimated fair values. goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of our acquisitions over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired, including other identified intangible assets. we recognize specifically identifiable intangibles when a specific right or contract is acquired. our determination of the fair value of the intangible assets and whether or not these assets are impaired requires us to make significant judgments and requires us to use significant estimates and assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows. if we change our strategy or if market conditions shift, our judgments may change, which may result in adjustments to recorded asset balances. as of december 31, 2017, we had goodwill of $12.2 billion and net other intangible assets of $10.3 billion relating to our acquisitions and our purchase of trademarks and internet domain names from various third parties. we do not amortize goodwill or other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives. intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives.
in performing the purchase price allocation, we consider, among other factors, the intended future use of acquired assets, analysis of historical financial performance and estimates of future performance of the acquired business. at the acquisition date, a preliminary allocation of the purchase price is recorded based upon a preliminary valuation. we continue to review and validate estimates, assumptions and valuation methodologies underlying the preliminary valuation during the measurement period. accordingly, these estimates and assumptions are subject to change, which could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. the measurement period ends as soon as we receive the information about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date or we learn that more information is not obtainable, which usually does not exceed one year from the date of acquisition.
our goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment annually in our fiscal fourth quarter or more frequently if conditions exist that indicate that the value may be impaired. we test our goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level. these impairment evaluations are performed by comparing the carrying value of the goodwill of the reporting unit or other indefinite-lived intangibles to its estimated fair value. we allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the business combination. we have identified four reporting units: our futures reporting unit, our data and listings reporting unit, our cash equities reporting unit, and our cds reporting unit.
goodwill impairment testing consists of a two-step methodology. the initial step requires us to determine the fair value of each reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value, including goodwill and other intangible assets, of such reporting unit. if the fair value exceeds the carrying value, no impairment loss is recognized and the second step, which is a calculation of the impairment, is not performed. however, if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment charge is recorded equal to the extent that the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value. for annual goodwill impairment testing, we have the option to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill and other intangible assets. if we conclude that this is the case, we must perform the two-step methodology described above. otherwise, we can skip the two-step methodology and do not need to perform any further testing. for annual indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment testing, we also have the option to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible assets is less than its carrying amount.
application of the impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units, and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit. we have historically determined the fair value of our reporting units based on various valuation techniques, including discounted cash flow analysis and a multiple of earnings approach. in assessing whether goodwill and other intangible assets are impaired, we must make estimates and assumptions regarding future cash flows, long-term growth rates of our business, operating margins, discount rates, weighted average cost of capital and other factors to determine the fair value of our assets. these estimates and assumptions require management's judgment, and changes to these estimates and assumptions, as a result of changing economic and competitive conditions, could materially affect the determination of fair value and/or impairment. the cash flows employed in the discounted cash flow analysis are based on our most recent budgets and business plans and, when applicable, various growth rates have been assumed for years beyond the current business plan period. future events could cause us to conclude that indicators of impairment exist for goodwill or other intangible assets. impairment may result from, among other things, deterioration in the performance of our business, adverse market conditions, adverse changes in applicable laws and regulations, competition, or the sale or disposition of a reporting unit. any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. our impairment analysis has not resulted in any impairment of goodwill through december 31, 2017.
we are also required to evaluate other finite-lived intangible assets and property and equipment for impairment by first determining whether events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets to be held and used may not be recoverable. if impairment indicators are present, then an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows produced by these long-lived assets is compared to the carrying value of those assets to determine if the asset is recoverable. if an asset is not recoverable, the loss is measured as the difference between fair value and carrying value of the impaired asset. fair value of these assets is based on various valuation techniques, including discounted cash flow analysis.

in august 2016, we sold certain of creditex's u.s. voice brokerage operations to tullett prebon. during the third quarter of 2016, we discontinued creditex's u.k. voice brokerage operations. we continue to operate creditex's electronically traded markets and systems, post-trade connectivity platforms and intellectual property. after the sale and the discontinuance of the voice brokerage operations, it was determined that the carrying value of the cds creditex customer relationship intangible asset was not fully recoverable and an impairment of the asset was recorded in september 2016 for $33 million. the impairment was recorded as amortization expense in the consolidated statements of income for the year ended december 31, 2016.
income taxes we are subject to income taxes in the u.s., u.k. and other foreign jurisdictions where we operate. the determination of our provision for income taxes and related accruals, deferred tax assets and liabilities requires significant judgment, the use of estimates, and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. we recognize a current tax liability or tax asset for the estimated taxes payable or refundable on tax returns for the current year. we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of our assets and liabilities. we establish valuation allowances if we believe that it is more likely than not that some or all of our deferred tax assets will not be realized. deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using current enacted tax rates in effect for the years in which those temporary differences and carryforwards are expected to reverse.
sec staff accounting bulletin no. 118, or sab 118, has provided guidance for companies that have not completed their accounting for the income tax effects of the tcja in the period of enactment, allowing for a measurement period of up to one year after the enactment date to finalize the recording of the related tax impacts. as of december 31, 2017, we have not completed our accounting for the tax effects of the enactment of the tcja, however, we have made a reasonable estimate of the effects on our deferred tax balances and in relation to the transition tax. in other cases, we have not been able to make a reasonable estimate and will continue to analyze the tcja in order to finalize any related impacts within the measurement period. the fasb staff also provided additional guidance to address the accounting for the effects of the provisions related to the taxation of global intangible low-taxed income, or gilti, noting that companies should make an accounting policy election to recognize deferred taxes for temporary basis differences expected to reverse as gilti in future years or to include the tax expense in the year it is incurred. we have not completed our analysis of the effects of the gilti provisions and will further consider the accounting policy election within the measurement period as provided for under sab 118.
we do not recognize a tax benefit unless we conclude that it is more likely than not that the benefit will be sustained on audit by the taxing authority based solely on the technical merits of the associated tax position. if the recognition threshold is met, we recognize a tax benefit measured at the largest amount of the tax benefit that, in our judgment, is greater than 50 percent likely to be realized. we recognize accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain income tax positions as income tax expense in the consolidated statements of income.
we operate within multiple domestic and foreign taxing jurisdictions and are subject to audit in these jurisdictions by domestic and foreign tax authorities. these audits include questions regarding our tax filing positions, including the timing and amount of deductions taken and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. we record accruals for the estimated outcomes of these audits, and the accruals may change in the future due to new developments in each matter. at any point in time, many tax years are subject to or in the process of being audited by various taxing authorities. to the extent our estimates of settlements change or the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts recorded, such differences will impact the income tax provision in the period in which such determinations are made. our income tax expense includes changes in our estimated liability for exposures associated with our various tax filing positions. determining the income tax expense for these potential assessments requires management to make assumptions that are subject to factors such as proposed assessments by tax authorities, changes in facts and circumstances, issuance of new regulations, and resolution of tax audits.
we believe the judgments and estimates discussed above are reasonable. however, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material.
item 7 (a).     quantitative    and qualitative disclosures about market risk as a result of our operating and financing activities, we are exposed to market risks such as interest rate risk, foreign currency exchange rate risk and credit risk. we have implemented policies and procedures designed to measure, manage, monitor and report risk exposures, which are regularly reviewed by the appropriate management and supervisory bodies.
interest rate risk we have exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relating to our cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, short-term and long-term restricted cash and investments, and indebtedness. as of december 31, 2017 and 2016, our cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and short-term and long-term restricted cash and cash equivalents were $1.6 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively, of which $293 million and $272 million, respectively, were denominated in pounds sterling, euros or canadian
71
dollars. the remaining cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and short-term and long-term restricted cash and cash equivalents are denominated in u.s. dollars. we do not use our investment portfolio for trading or other speculative purposes. a hypothetical decrease in long-term interest rates to zero basis points would decrease annual pre-tax earnings by $8 million as of december 31, 2017, assuming no change in the amount or composition of our cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and short-term and long-term restricted cash and cash equivalents.
as of december 31, 2017, we had $6.1 billion in outstanding debt, of which $4.9 billion relates to our senior notes, which bear interest at fixed interest rates. the remaining amount outstanding of $1.2 billion relates to the commercial paper program, which bears interest at fluctuating rates and, therefore, subjects us to interest rate risk. a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in long-term interest rates relating to the amounts outstanding under the commercial paper program as of december 31, 2017 would decrease annual pre-tax earnings by $12 million, assuming no change in the volume or composition of our outstanding indebtedness and no hedging activity. see item 7 "- management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - debt" included elsewhere in this annual report.
the interest rates on our commercial paper program are currently evaluated based upon current maturities and market conditions. the weighted average interest rate on our commercial paper program increased from 0.74% as of december 31, 2016 to 1.49% as of december 31, 2017. the increase in the commercial paper program weighted average interest rate was primarily due to the decisions by the u.s. federal reserve in march 2017, in june 2017 and in december 2017 to increase the federal funds short-term interest rate by an aggregate 75 basis points to 1.50%. the federal reserve also signaled that they intend to continue to increase the federal fund short-term interest rate over the next several years, and if this occurs, this will continue to increase the weighted average interest rate on our commercial paper program.
foreign currency exchange rate risk as an international business, we are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk. we may experience gains or losses from foreign currency transactions in the future given that a significant part of our assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses are recorded in pounds sterling or euros. certain assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of foreign subsidiaries are denominated in the local functional currency of such subsidiaries. our exposure to foreign denominated earnings for the years ended december 31, 2017 and 2016 is presented by primary foreign currency in the following table (dollars in millions, except exchange rates):

(1)   represents the impact of currency fluctuation for the year compared to the same period in the prior year.
we have a significant part of our assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses recorded in pounds sterling or euros. for the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, 15%, 15% and 15%, respectively, of our consolidated revenues, less transaction-based expenses, were denominated in pounds sterling or euros, and 14%, 18%, and 12%, respectively, of our consolidated operating expenses were denominated in pounds sterling or euros. as the pound sterling or euro exchange rate changes, the u.s. equivalent of revenues and expenses denominated in foreign currencies changes accordingly.
we have foreign currency transaction risk related to the settlement of foreign currency denominated assets, liabilities and payables that occur through our operations, which are received in or paid in pounds sterling or euros, due to the increase or decrease in the foreign currency exchange rates between periods. we had foreign currency transaction losses of $4 million, $1 million and $14 million for the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. the foreign currency transactions losses were primarily attributable to the fluctuations of the pound sterling and euro relative to the u.s. dollar. a 10% adverse change in the underlying foreign currency exchange rates as of december 31, 2017 would result in a foreign currency transaction loss of $3 million, assuming no change in the composition of the foreign currency denominated assets, liabilities and payables and assuming no hedging activity.
72
we entered into foreign currency hedging transactions during years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 as economic hedges to help mitigate a portion of our foreign exchange risk exposure and may enter into additional hedging transactions in the future to help mitigate our foreign exchange risk exposure. although we may enter into additional hedging transactions in the future to help mitigate our foreign exchange risk exposure, these hedging arrangements may not be effective, particularly in the event of imprecise forecasts of the levels of our non-u.s. denominated assets and liabilities.
we have foreign currency translation risk equal to our net investment in our foreign subsidiaries. the financial statements of these subsidiaries are translated into u.s. dollars using a current rate of exchange, with gains or losses included in the cumulative translation adjustment account, a component of equity. our exposure to the net investment in foreign currencies is presented by primary foreign currencies in the table below (in millions):

as of december 31, 2017 and 2016, the portion of our equity attributable to accumulated other comprehensive loss from foreign currency translation was $136 million and $345 million, respectively. as of december 31, 2017, we had net exposure of pounds sterling, canadian dollars and euros of £733 million ($990 million), c$628 million ($500 million), and €103 million ($124 million), respectively. based on these december 31, 2017 net currency positions, a hypothetical 10% decrease of pound sterling against u.s. dollar would negatively impact our equity by $99 million, a hypothetical 10% decrease of canadian dollar against u.s. dollar would negatively impact our equity by $50 million, and a hypothetical 10% decrease of euro against u.s. dollar would negatively impact our equity by $12 million. for the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, currency exchange rate differences had a positive/(negative) impact of $209 million, ($300 million) and ($58 million), respectively, on our consolidated equity. the increase for the year ended december 31, 2017 is primarily due to the increase in the pound sterling/u.s. dollar exchange rate to 1.3510 as of december 31, 2017 (from 1.2336 as of december 31, 2016) due to the strengthening pound sterling. the decrease for the year ended december 31, 2016 is primarily due to the decrease in the pound sterling/u.s. dollar exchange rate to 1.2336 as of december 31, 2016 (from 1.4868 as of december 31, 2015) due to the weakening pound sterling. the pound sterling decreased starting in june 2016 following the u.k. referendum that resulted in a vote for the u.k. to leave the eu. the future impact on our business relating to the u.k. leaving the eu and the corresponding regulatory changes are uncertain at this time, including future impacts on currency exchange rates.
credit risk we are exposed to credit risk in our operations in the event of a counterparty default. we limit our exposure to credit risk by rigorously selecting the counterparties with which we make our investments and execute agreements.
clearing house cash deposit risks our clearing houses hold material amounts of clearing member cash deposits which are held or invested primarily to provide security of capital while minimizing credit, market and liquidity risks. refer to note 13 to our consolidated financial statements, which are included elsewhere in this annual report, for more information about clearing house cash deposits and delivery contracts, which were $51.2 billion as of december 31, 2017. while we seek to achieve a reasonable rate of return which may generate interest income for our clearing members, we are primarily concerned with preservation of capital and managing the risks associated with these deposits. as the clearing houses may pass on interest revenues (minus costs) to the members, this could include negative or reduced yield due to market conditions. the following is a summary of the risks associated with these deposits and how these risks are mitigated.
credit risk when a clearing house has the ability to hold cash collateral at a central bank, the clearing house utilizes its access to the central bank system to minimize credit risk exposures. credit risk is monitored by using exposure limits reflecting a number of factors including ratings assigned by rating agencies, cds spreads and internal ratings, as well as the nature and maturity of transactions. we seek to substantially mitigate credit risk associated with investments by ensuring financial assets are placed with governments, well-capitalized financial institutions and other creditworthy counterparties.
73
an ongoing review is performed to evaluate changes in the financial status of counterparties. in addition to the intrinsic creditworthiness of counterparties, our policies require diversification of counterparties (banks, financial institutions, bond issuers and funds) to avoid a concentration of risk.
liquidity risk liquidity risk is the risk a clearing house may not be able to meet its payment obligations in the right currency, in the right place and the right time. to mitigate this risk, the clearing houses monitor liquidity requirements closely and maintain funds and assets in a manner which minimizes the risk of loss or delay in the access by the clearing house to such funds and assets. for example, holding funds with a central bank where possible or making only short term investments such as overnight reverse repurchase agreements serves to reduce liquidity risks.
interest rate risk interest rate risk is the risk that interest rates rise causing the value of purchased securities to decline. if we were required to sell securities prior to maturity, and interest rates had risen, the sale of the securities might be made at a loss relative to the latest market price. our clearing houses seek to manage this risk by making short term investments of cash deposits. for example, where possible and in accordance with regulatory requirements, the clearing houses invest cash pursuant to overnight reverse repurchase agreements or term reverse repurchase agreements with short dated maturities. in addition, the clearing house investment guidelines allow for direct purchases of high quality sovereign debt (for example, u.s. treasury securities) and supranational debt instruments (euro cash deposits only) with short dated maturities.
security issuer risk security issuer risk is the risk that an issuer of a security defaults on its payment when the security matures. this risk is mitigated by limiting allowable investments under the reverse repurchase agreements to high quality sovereign or government agency debt and limiting any direct investments to high quality sovereign debt instruments.
investment counterparty risk investment counterparty risk is the risk that a reverse repurchase agreement counterparty might become insolvent and, thus, fail to meet its obligations to our clearing houses. we mitigate this risk by only engaging in transactions with high credit quality reverse repurchase agreement counterparties and by limiting the acceptable collateral under the repurchase agreement to high quality issuers. when engaging in reverse repurchase agreements, our clearing houses take delivery of the underlying reverse repurchase securities in custody accounts under clearing house control. additionally, the securities purchased subject to reverse repurchase have a market value greater than the reverse repurchase amount. the typical haircut received for high quality sovereign debt is 2% of the reverse repurchase amount. thus, in the event that a reverse repurchase counterparty defaults on its obligation to repurchase the underlying reverse repurchase securities, our clearing house will have possession of a security with a value potentially greater than the reverse repurchase counterparty's obligation to the clearing house.
our clearing houses may use third party investment advisors who make investments subject to the guidelines provided to them by the clearing house. such investment advisors do not hold clearing member cash deposits or the underlying investments. clearing house property is held in custody accounts under clearing house control. clearing house property is held with credit worthy custodians including jpmorgan chase bank n.a., citibank n.a., bny mellon, bmo harris n.a. and euroclear bank brussels (for non-u.s. dollar deposits). each clearing house employs (or may employ) multiple investment advisors and custodians to ensure that in the event a single investment advisor or custodian is unable to fulfill its role, additional investment advisors or custodians are available as alternatives.
cross-currency margin deposit risk each of our clearing houses, pursuant to their rules, may permit posting of cross-currency collateral to satisfy margin requirements (for example, accepting margin deposits denominated in u.s. dollars to secure a euro margin obligation). the clearing houses mitigate the risk of a decline in currency value by applying a "haircut" to the currency posted as margin at a level sufficient to provide financial protection during periods of high currency volatility. cross-currency balances are marked-to-market on a daily basis. should the currency posted to satisfy margin requirements decline in value, the clearing member is required to increase its margin deposit on a same-day basis.
impact of inflation we have not been adversely affected by inflation as technological advances and competition have generally caused prices for the hardware and software that we use for our electronic platforms to remain constant. in the event of inflation, we believe that we will be able to pass on any price increases to our participants, as the prices that we charge are not governed by long-term contracts.

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-a5(f) under the securities exchange act of 1934 ("exchange act"). our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. our internal control over financial reporting is supported by a program of internal audits and appropriate reviews by management, written policies and guidelines, careful selection and training of qualified personnel and a written global code of business conduct adopted by our board of directors, applicable to all of our directors and all officers and all of our employees.
because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements and even when determined to be effective, can only provide reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31, 2017. in making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission ("coso") in internal control - integrated framework (2013 framework). based on our assessment, management believes that we maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31, 2017.
as permitted by sec regulations, our management has excluded natural gas exchange inc. from its assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of december 31, 2017 since natural gas exchange inc. was acquired in a purchase business combination on december 14, 2017. natural gas exchange inc. is a wholly-owned subsidiary and had total and net assets not subject to our assessment of internal controls of $1.1 billion and $301 million, respectively, as of december 31, 2017.

intercontinental exchange, inc. and subsidiaries notes to consolidated financial statements
1.   description of business nature of business and organization we are a leading global operator of regulated exchanges, clearing houses and listings venues, and a provider of data services for commodity, fixed income and equity markets. we operate regulated marketplaces for listing, trading and clearing of a broad array of derivatives and securities contracts across major asset classes, including energy and agricultural commodities, interest rates, equities, equity derivatives, exchange traded funds, credit derivatives, bonds and currencies. we also offer end-to-end data services and solutions to support the trading, investment, risk management and connectivity needs of customers around the world across all major asset classes.
our exchanges include derivative exchanges in the united states, or u.s., united kingdom, or u.k., european union or eu, canada and singapore, and cash equities, equity options and bond exchanges in the u.s. we also operate over-the-counter, or otc, markets for physical energy and credit default swaps, or cds, trade execution. to serve global derivatives markets, we operate central counterparty clearing houses in the u.s., u.k., eu, canada and singapore (note 13). we offer a range of data services for global financial and commodity markets, including pricing and reference data, exchange data, analytics, feeds, desktops and connectivity solutions. through our markets, clearing houses, listings and market data services, we provide end-to-end solutions for our customers through liquid markets, benchmark products, access to capital markets, and related services to support their ability to manage risk and raise capital.
2.   summary of significant accounting policies basis of presentation the accompanying consolidated financial statements are presented in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles, or u.s. gaap. the consolidated financial statements include our wholly-owned and controlled subsidiaries. all intercompany balances and transactions between our wholly-owned and controlled subsidiaries have been eliminated in consolidation. as discussed in note 3, we completed several acquisitions during the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 and have included the financial results of these companies in the consolidated financial statements effective from the respective acquisition dates. also as discussed in note 3, we completed the dispositions of several companies during the year ended december 31, 2017 and have included the financial results of these companies in the consolidated financial statements up to the respective disposition dates.
use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with u.s. gaap requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. estimates also affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. actual amounts could differ from those estimates.
comprehensive income other comprehensive income includes changes in unrealized gains and losses on financial instruments classified as available-for-sale, changes in fair value of net investment hedges, foreign currency translation adjustments, comprehensive income from equity method investments, and amortization of the difference in the projected benefit obligation and the accumulated benefit obligation associated with benefit plan liabilities, net of tax.
non-controlling interest for consolidated subsidiaries in which our ownership is less than 100% and for which we have control over the assets and liabilities and the management of the entity, the outside stockholders' interests are shown as non-controlling interests. for instances where outside stockholders' hold an option to require us to repurchase the outside stockholders' interest, these interests are shown as redeemable non-controlling interests.
segment and geographic information we operate two business segments: our trading and clearing segment and our data and listings segment. this presentation is reflective of how our chief operating decision maker reviews and operates our business. our trading and clearing segment comprises our transaction-based execution and clearing businesses. our data and listings segment comprises our subscription-based data services and securities listings businesses. the majority of our identifiable assets are located in the u.s. and u.k.
85
cash and cash equivalents we consider all short-term, highly liquid investments with original maturities at the purchase date of three months or less to be cash equivalents.
short-term and long-term restricted cash and cash equivalents we classify all cash and cash equivalents and investments that are not available for immediate or general business use by us as restricted in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets (note 5). the restricted cash includes cash set aside due to regulatory requirements, earmarked for specific purposes, or restricted by specific agreements.
short-term and long-term investments we periodically invest a portion of our cash in excess of short-term operating needs in term deposits and investment-grade marketable debt securities, including government or government sponsored agencies and corporate debt securities (note 6). these investments are classified as available-for-sale in accordance with u.s. gaap. we do not have any investments classified as held-to-maturity or trading. additionally, we classify equity and fixed income mutual funds, held for the purpose of providing future payments for the supplemental executive savings plan and a component of the supplemental executive retirement plan, as available-for-sale securities. available-for-sale investments are carried at their fair value using primarily quoted prices in active markets for identical securities, with unrealized gains and losses, net of deferred income taxes, reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. realized gains and losses, and declines in value deemed to be other-than-temporary on available-for-sale investments, are recognized in earnings. the cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method. investments that we intend to hold for more than one year are classified as long-term investments in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
cost and equity method investments we use the cost method to account for a non-marketable equity investment in an entity that we do not control and for which we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence over the entity's operating and financial policies. when we do not have a controlling financial interest in an entity but exercise significant influence over the entity's operating and financial policies, such investment is accounted for using the equity method. we account for our investments in merscorp holdings, inc., owner of mortgage electronic registrations systems, inc., or collectively mers, and options clearing corporation, or occ, as equity method investments. we recognized $36 million, $25 million and $6 million in equity income related to these investments during the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, as other income. we recognize dividend income when declared as a reduction in the carrying value of our equity method investments. cost and equity method investments were $563 million and $208 million as of december 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and are classified as other non-current assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. the increase in the cost and equity method investments during the year ended december 31, 2017 is primarily due to our investment in euroclear plc, or euroclear, and during the year ended december 31, 2016 is primarily due to our investment in mers (note 3). see "recently adopted and new accounting pronouncements" below for the new financial instruments accounting standard and its impact on the accounting for our investments.
margin deposits, guaranty funds and delivery contracts receivable and payable original margin, variation margin and, with the exception of natural gas exchange inc., or ngx, guaranty funds held by our clearing houses for clearing members may be in the form of cash, government obligations, certain agency and corporate debt, letters of credit or gold (note 13). government, agency and corporate securities held for margin purposes are recorded at an amount that approximates fair value. cash original margin, variation margin and guaranty fund deposits are reflected in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as current assets and current liabilities. the amount of margin deposits on hand will fluctuate over time as a result of, among other things, the extent of open positions held at any point in time by market participants in contracts and the margin rates then in effect for such contracts. changes in our margin accounts are not reflected in our consolidated statements of cash flows. non-cash original margin and guaranty fund deposits are not reflected in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as the risks and rewards of these assets remain with the clearing members unless the clearing houses have sold or re-pledged the assets or in the event of a clearing member default, where the clearing member is no longer entitled to redeem the assets. any income, gain or loss accrues to the clearing members.
ngx, which we acquired in december 2017, owns a clearing house which administers the physical delivery of energy trading contracts. ngx serves as an intermediary counter-party to both the buyer and seller. when physical delivery has occurred and/or settlement amounts have been determined, an asset is recorded as a delivery contract receivable for the fair value of the contract due from the buying participant, and an equal and offsetting delivery contract payable is recorded for the amount owed to
86
the selling participant. amounts recorded at period end represent receivables and payables for deliveries that have occurred but for which payment has not been received or made. there is no impact on our consolidated statements of income as an equal amount is recognized as both an asset and a liability. ngx also records unsettled variation margin equal to the fair value of open energy trading contracts as of the balance sheet date.
property and equipment property and equipment is recorded at cost, reduced by accumulated depreciation (note 7). depreciation and amortization expense related to property and equipment is computed using the straight-line method based on estimated useful lives of the assets, or in the case of leasehold improvements, the shorter of the initial lease term or the estimated useful life of the improvement. we review the remaining estimated useful lives of our property and equipment at each balance sheet date and will make adjustments to the estimated remaining useful lives whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the remaining useful lives have changed. gains on disposals of property and equipment are included in other income and losses on disposals of property and equipment are included in depreciation expense. maintenance and repair costs are expensed as incurred.
allowance for doubtful accounts the allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained at a level that we believe to be sufficient to absorb probable losses in our accounts receivable portfolio. the allowance is based on several factors, including a continuous assessment of the collectability of each account. in circumstances where a specific customer's inability to meet its financial obligations is known, we record a specific provision for bad debts against amounts due to reduce the receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be collected. accounts receivable are written off against the allowance for doubtful accounts when collection efforts cease. a reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of allowance for doubtful accounts is as follows for the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 (in millions):
year ended december 31,
2017                                                                               2016                2015

charge-offs                                                 (5    )              -                  (1    )
ending balance of allowance for doubtful accounts           $6                  $7                  $2
bad debt expense in the table above is based on our historical collection experiences and our assessment of the collectability of specific accounts. charge-offs in the table above represent the write-off of uncollectible receivables, net of recoveries. these amounts also include the impact of foreign currency translation adjustments.
software development costs we capitalize costs, both internal and external direct and incremental costs, related to software developed or obtained for internal use in accordance with u.s. gaap. software development costs incurred during the preliminary or maintenance project stages are expensed as incurred, while costs incurred during the application development stage are capitalized and are amortized using the straight-line method over the useful life of the software, not to exceed three years (except for interactive data's and nyse's new platforms, which have eight year useful lives). amortization of these capitalized costs begins only when the software becomes ready for its intended use. general and administrative costs related to developing or obtaining such software are expensed as incurred.
accrued employee benefits we have a defined benefit pension plan and other postretirement benefit plans, or collectively the "benefit plans," covering certain of our u.s. operations. the benefit accrual for the pension plan is frozen. we recognize the funded status of the benefit plans in the consolidated balance sheets, measure the fair value of plan assets and benefit obligations as of the date of our fiscal year-end, and provide additional disclosures in the footnotes to the consolidated financial statements (note 15).
benefit plan costs and liabilities are dependent on assumptions used in calculating such amounts. these assumptions include discount rates, health care cost trend rates, benefits earned, interest cost, expected return on assets, mortality rates and other factors. actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and, therefore, generally affect recognized expense and the recorded obligation in future periods. we immediately recognize in the consolidated statements of income certain of these unrecognized amounts when triggering events occur, such as when a settlement of pension obligations in
87
excess of total interest and service costs occurs. while we believe that the assumptions used are appropriate, differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect our pension and other post-retirement obligations and future expense recognized.
goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of our acquisitions over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired, including other identified intangible assets (note 8). we recognize specifically identifiable intangibles when a specific right or contract is acquired. goodwill has been allocated to reporting units for purposes of impairment testing based on the portion of synergy, cost savings and other expected future cash flows expected to benefit the reporting units at the time of the acquisition. we test our goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level. the reporting units identified for our goodwill testing are the futures, data and listings, cash equities and credit default swap reporting units. goodwill impairment testing is performed annually in the fiscal fourth quarter or more frequently if conditions exist that indicate that the asset may be impaired.
we also evaluate indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually in our fiscal fourth quarter or more frequently if conditions exist that indicate that the asset may be impaired. such evaluation includes either applying the optional qualitative screen to determine if it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the asset continues to exceed its carrying value or determining the fair value of the asset and comparing the fair value of the asset to its carrying value. if the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying value, an impairment loss is recognized in earnings in an amount equal to the difference.
for both goodwill and indefinite lived impairment testing, we have the option to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or indefinite lived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount. if we conclude that this is the case, we must perform additional testing of the asset or reporting unit. otherwise, no further testing is necessary.
other than for the divestiture of nyse governance services as discussed in note 3, we did not record an impairment charge related to goodwill or indefinite lived intangible assets during the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 or 2015.
impairment of long-lived assets and finite-lived intangible assets we review our property and equipment and finite-lived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be fully recoverable. to analyze recoverability, we project undiscounted net future cash flows over the remaining life of such assets. if these projected cash flows are less than the carrying amount, an impairment indicator would exist. the impairment loss is measured based upon the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the assets. finite-lived intangible assets are generally amortized on a straight-line basis or using an accelerated method over the lesser of their contractual or estimated useful lives.
during the third quarter of 2016, we discontinued creditex's u.k. voice brokerage operations and an impairment of the asset was recorded as amortization expense in september 2016 for $33 million (note 8).
derivatives and hedging activity we may use derivative instruments to limit exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. all derivatives are required to be recorded at fair value in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. changes in the fair value of such derivative financial instruments are recognized in net income as they are not designated as hedges under u.s. gaap.
from time to time, we may hedge the foreign currency translation of certain net investments by designating all or a portion of certain financial liabilities denominated in the same currency in accordance with u.s. gaap. we entered into foreign currency hedging transactions during years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 as economic hedges to help mitigate a portion of our foreign exchange risk exposure.
intellectual property all costs related to internally developed patents and trademarks are expensed as incurred. all costs related to purchased patents, trademarks and internet domain names are recorded as other intangible assets and are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. all costs related to licensed patents are capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis over the term of the license.
88
income taxes we recognize income taxes under the liability method. we recognize a current tax liability or tax asset for the estimated taxes payable or refundable on tax returns for the current year. we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities. we establish valuation allowances if we believe that it is more likely than not that some or all of our deferred tax assets will not be realized. deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using current enacted tax rates in effect.
sec staff accounting bulletin no. 118, or sab 118, has provided guidance for companies that have not completed their accounting for the income tax effects of the tax cuts and jobs act, or tcja, in the period of enactment, allowing for a measurement period of up to one year after the enactment date to finalize the recording of the related tax impacts. as of december 31, 2017, we have not completed our accounting for the tax effects of the enactment of the tcja, however, we have made a reasonable estimate of the effects on our deferred tax balances and in relation to the transition tax. in other cases, we have not been able to make a reasonable estimate and will continue to analyze the tcja in order to finalize any related impacts within the measurement period. the financial accounting standards board, or fasb, staff also provided additional guidance to address the accounting for the effects of the provisions related to the taxation of global intangible low-taxed income, or gilti, noting that companies should make an accounting policy election to recognize deferred taxes for temporary basis differences expected to reverse as gilti in future years or to include the tax expense in the year it is incurred. we have not completed our analysis of the effects of the gilti provisions and will further consider the accounting policy election within the measurement period as provided for under sab 118.
we do not recognize a tax benefit unless we conclude that it is more likely than not that the benefit will be sustained on audit by the taxing authority based solely on the technical merits of the associated tax position. if the recognition threshold is met, we recognize a tax benefit measured at the largest amount of the tax benefit that, in our judgment, is greater than 50 percent likely to be realized. we recognize accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as a component of income tax expense.
we are subject to tax in numerous domestic and foreign jurisdictions primarily based on our operations in these jurisdictions. significant judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. fluctuations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sale price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. our revenues primarily consist of transaction and clearing fee revenues for transactions executed and/or cleared through our global electronic derivatives trading and clearing platforms and cash equities trading and revenues related to our data services fees and listing fees. we also evaluate all contracts in order to determine appropriate gross versus net revenue reporting.
derivatives trading and clearing revenues are recognized over the period in which the services are provided, which is typically the date the transactions are executed or are cleared, except for a portion of clearing revenues related to cleared contracts which have an ongoing clearing obligation that extends beyond the execution date. the transaction and clearing fee revenues are determined on the basis of the transaction and clearing fee charged for each contract traded on the exchanges. derivatives transaction and clearing fees are recorded net of rebates of $749 million, $674 million and $563 million for the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. we offer rebates in certain of our markets primarily to support market liquidity and trading volume by providing qualified participants in those markets a discount to the applicable commission rate. such rebates are calculated based on volumes traded. the increase in the rebates is due primarily to an increase in the number of participants in the rebate programs offered on various contracts, an increase in our traded volume and an increase in the number of rebate programs.
cash trading fee revenues are paid by organizations based on their trading activity. fees are assessed on a per share basis for trading in equity securities. the fees are applicable to all transactions that take place on any of our equity trading venues, and the fees vary based on the size and type of trade that is consummated and trading venue. the equity trading venues earn transaction fees for customer orders of equity securities matched internally, as well as for customer orders routed to other exchanges. cash trading fees are recognized as earned, which is generally upon execution of the trade. cash trading fees are recorded gross of liquidity rebates and routing charges. liquidity payments made to cash and options trading customers and routing charges made to other exchanges are included in transaction-based expenses in the consolidated statements of income.
listings revenues consist of original listing fees paid by issuers to list the initial securities on the various cash markets, other listing fees related to other corporate actions (including stock splits, sales of additional securities and merger and acquisitions), annual listing fees paid by companies whose financial instruments are listed on the cash markets, and other services provided to our listed companies and other companies. original listing fees are assessed primarily based on the number of shares that the issuer
89
initially lists. original listing fees are recognized as revenue on a straight-line basis over the estimated service periods of 5 years for nyse arca and nyse american and 9 years for nyse. other corporate action listing fees are recognized as revenue on a straight-line basis over the estimated service periods of 3 years for nyse arca and nyse american and 6 years for nyse. the service periods are determined separately for each of our listing venues (note 9). annual listing fees are billed at the beginning of the year and are recognized on a pro rata basis over the calendar year.
data services revenues include market data access fees charged to customers that trade on the electronic platform. the market data access amount for each company is based on the number of users at each company trading on the electronic platform. for our bilateral otc data services, monthly trading commissions are recognized as transaction and clearing fee revenues. any customer's market data access fees in excess of that customer's commissions on trading activity are recognized as market data access revenues. data services revenues in our derivatives markets also include terminal and license fees received from data vendors in exchange for the provision of real-time futures price information and market data access fees. market data fees are charged to data vendors on a monthly basis based on the number and type of terminals they have providing futures data. some of our data vendors also pay an annual license fee, which is deferred and recognized as revenue ratably over the period of the annual license.
we collect market data revenues from our cash equity and options consortium-based data products and, to a lesser extent, for new york stock exchange proprietary data products. consortium-based data fees are determined by securities industry plans. consortium-based data revenues that coordinated market data distribution generates (net of administration costs) are distributed to participating markets on the basis of the regulation nms formula. we collect fees from vendors for the right to distribute market data to third parties and a service fee from vendors for direct connection to market data. these fees are recognized as revenue as services are rendered.
we also charge customers for accessing our data services through secure financial transaction infrastructure, or sfti, and colocation services. sfti is a physical network infrastructure that connects our markets and other major market centers with market participants and allows those participants to receive data feeds. we also offer data analytics services which include a number of products such as forward curves, index and valuation services.
revenue for subscription based contracts is recognized ratably over the life of the contract and revenue for usage based contracts is recognized in the month that the products/services are provided. certain of our businesses collect fees for installation/set-up services which, if deemed a separate deliverable with standalone value, are recognized upon delivery as long as the remaining criteria for recognition of revenue have been achieved. revenue for installation/set-up services, that do not meet the criteria for separation, is recognized ratably either over the contractual term or the expected client relationship life. revenue for professional services is recognized as the services are provided. revenue for hardware is recognized when installation is completed and the related services go-live.
other revenues primarily consist of various fees for services provided to our customers, including interest income on certain clearing margin deposits, regulatory penalties and fines, fees for use of our facilities, regulatory fees charged to member organizations of our u.s. securities exchanges, designated market maker service fees, exchange membership fees and agricultural grading and certification fees. these fees are recognized as revenue as services are rendered.
on january 1, 2018, we were required to adopt asc 606, revenue from contracts with customers, and asc 340-40, other assets and deferred costs- contracts with customers. the new guidance requires enhanced disclosures, including revenue recognition policies to identify performance obligations to customers and significant judgments in measurement and recognition. see "recently adopted and new accounting pronouncements," and note 4 where discussed further.
activity assessment fees and section 31 fees we pay the securities and exchange commission, or sec, fees pursuant to section 31 of the securities exchange act of 1934 for transactions executed on our u.s. equities and options exchanges. these section 31 fees are designed to recover the costs to the government for supervising and regulating the securities markets and securities professionals. we (or the occ on our behalf), in turn, collect activity assessment fees, which are included in transaction and clearing fees in the accompanying consolidated statements of income, from member organizations clearing or settling trades on the u.s. equities and options exchanges and recognize these amounts as revenue when invoiced. fees received are included in cash at the time of receipt and, as required by law, the amount due to the sec is remitted semi-annually and recorded as an accrued liability until paid. the activity assessment fees are designed so that they are equal to the section 31 fees paid by us to the sec. as a result, section 31 fees do not have an impact on our net income.

stock-based compensation we currently sponsor employee and director stock option and restricted stock plans (note 11). u.s. gaap requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expenses for all share-based payment awards made to employees and directors, including employee stock options and restricted stock, based on estimated fair values. u.s. gaap requires companies to estimate the fair value of stock option awards on the date of grant using an option-pricing model. the value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as stock-based compensation expense over the requisite service period in our consolidated financial statements.
we use the black-scholes option pricing model for purposes of valuing stock option awards. our determination of fair value of stock option awards on the date of grant using the black-scholes option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of subjective variables. these variables include interest rates, our expected dividend yield, our expected share price volatility over the term of the awards and actual and projected employee stock option exercise behavior.
treasury stock we record treasury stock activities under the cost method whereby the cost of the acquired stock is recorded as treasury stock (note 11). we retired all of our outstanding treasury shares effective october 27, 2016, the record date of our 5-for-1 stock split (which has already been reflected in our results retroactively). our accounting policy upon the formal retirement of treasury stock is to deduct the par value from common stock and to reflect any excess of cost over par value as a deduction from additional paid-in capital (to the extent created by previous issuances of the shares) and retained earnings.
credit risk and significant customers our clearing houses have credit risk for maintaining certain of the clearing member cash deposits at various financial institutions (note 13). cash deposit accounts are established at larger money center banks and structured to restrict the rights of offset or liens by the banks. our clearing houses monitor the cash deposits and mitigate credit risk by keeping such deposits in several financial institutions, ensuring that its overall credit risk exposure to any individual financial institution remains within acceptable concentration limits, and by ensuring that the financial institutions have high investment grade ratings. we also limit our risk of loss by holding the majority of the cash deposits in cash accounts at the federal reserve bank of chicago, high quality short-term sovereign debt reverse repurchase agreements with several different counterparty banks or direct investments in short-term high quality sovereign and supranational debt issues. while we seek to achieve a reasonable rate of return which may generate interest income for our clearing members, we are primarily concerned with preservation of capital and managing the risks associated with these deposits. as the clearing houses may pass on interest revenues, minus costs, to the members, this could include negative or reduced yield due to market conditions.
when engaging in reverse repurchase agreements, our clearing houses take delivery of the underlying securities in custody accounts under clearing house control. additionally, the securities purchased subject to reverse repurchase have a market value greater than the reverse repurchase amount. the typical haircut received for high quality sovereign debt is 2% of the reverse repurchase amount. thus, in the event that a reverse repurchase counterparty defaults on its obligation to repurchase the underlying reverse repurchase securities, our clearing house will have possession of securities with a value potentially greater than the reverse repurchase counterparty's obligation to the clearing house.
ice clear credit, a systemically important financial market utility as designated by the financial stability oversight council, held $18.5 billion of its u.s. dollar cash margin in cash accounts at the federal reserve bank of chicago as of december 31, 2017. ice clear europe has established a euro-denominated account at the de nederlandsche bank, or dnb, the central bank of the netherlands. this account provides the flexibility for ice clear europe to place euro-denominated cash margin securely at a national bank, in particular during periods when liquidity in the euro repo markets may temporarily become contracted, such as over a quarter or year end. as of december 31, 2017, ice clear europe held €3.3 billion ($4.0 billion based on the euro/u.s. dollar exchange rate of 1.2003 as of december 31, 2017) at dnb. such accounts are intended to decrease ice clear credit and ice clear europe's custodial, liquidity and operational risk as compared to alternative custodial and investment arrangements.
our futures businesses have minimal credit risk as the majority of their transaction revenues are currently cleared through our clearing houses. our accounts receivable related to market data revenues, cash trading, listing revenues, technology revenues, cds transaction revenues and bilateral over-the-counter energy transaction revenues subjects us to credit risk, as we do not require these customers to post collateral. we limit our risk of loss by terminating access to trade to entities with delinquent accounts. the concentration of risk on accounts receivable is also mitigated by the large number of entities comprising our customer base.
our accounts receivable are stated at cost. excluding clearing members, there were no individual accounts receivable balances greater than 10% of total consolidated accounts receivable as of december 31, 2017 or december 31, 2016. no single
91
customer accounted for more than 10% of total consolidated revenues during any of the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 or 2015.
leases we expense rent from non-cancellable operating leases, net of sublease income, on a straight-line basis based on future minimum lease payments. the net costs are included in rent and occupancy expenses and technology and communication expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of income (note 14).
acquisition-related transaction and integration costs we incurred incremental direct acquisition-related transaction costs relating to various completed and potential acquisitions and other strategic opportunities to strengthen our competitive position and support growth. the acquisition-related transaction costs include fees for investment banking advisors, lawyers, accountants, tax advisors and public relations firms, deal-related bonuses to certain of our employees, as well as costs associated with credit facilities and other external costs directly related to the proposed or closed transactions. we also incurred integration costs during the years ended december 31, 2017 and 2016 relating to our integration of interactive data and during the years ended december 31, 2016 and 2015 relating to our integration of nyse. integration costs primarily related to employee termination costs, deal related bonuses, lease termination costs and professional services costs incurred relating to the integrations. as of june 30, 2016, the integration of nyse has been completed.
the acquisition-related transaction and integration costs incurred during the year ended december 31, 2017 primarily relate to costs incurred for our interactive data integration, legal and professional fees related to the trayport cma review, and various other costs incurred for our other acquisitions that closed during 2017. the acquisition-related transaction and integration costs incurred during the year ended december 31, 2016 primarily relate to costs incurred for our interactive data and nyse integrations, legal and professional fees related to the trayport cma review, our investment in mers, our acquisition of securities evaluations and credit market analysis, and various other potential and discontinued acquisitions. the acquisition-related transaction and integration costs incurred during the year ended december 31, 2015 primarily relate to the integration costs incurred for our nyse integration and the acquisition-related transaction costs related to our interactive data and trayport acquisitions. see note 3 for additional information on our acquisitions.
fair value of financial instruments we apply fair value accounting for all financial assets and liabilities and non-financial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis (note 16). fair value is the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. our financial instruments consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, short-term and long-term restricted cash and investments, short-term and long-term investments, customer accounts receivable, margin deposits and guaranty funds, short-term and long-term debt and other short-term assets and liabilities.
foreign currency translation adjustments and foreign currency transaction gains and losses our functional and reporting currency is the u.s. dollar. we have foreign currency translation risk equal to our net investment in certain u.k., continental european, asian and canadian subsidiaries. the revenues, expenses and financial results of these subsidiaries are recorded in the functional currency of the countries that these subsidiaries are located in, which are primarily pounds sterling and euros. the financial statements of these subsidiaries are translated into u.s. dollars using a current rate of exchange, with gains or losses, net of tax as applicable, included in the cumulative translation adjustment account, a component of equity. as of december 31, 2017 and 2016, the portion of our equity attributable to accumulated other comprehensive loss from foreign currency translation adjustments was $136 million and $345 million, respectively.
we have foreign currency transaction gains and losses related to the settlement of foreign currency denominated assets, liabilities and payables that occur through our operations. the transaction gain and losses are due to the increase or decrease in the foreign currency exchange rates between periods. forward contracts on foreign currencies are entered into to manage the foreign currency exchange rate risk. gains and losses from foreign currency transactions are included in other income (expense) in the accompanying consolidated statements of income and resulted in net losses of $4 million, $1 million and $14 million for the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
92
earnings per common share basic earnings per common share is calculated using the weighted average common shares outstanding during the year. common equivalent shares from stock options and restricted stock awards, using the treasury stock method, are included in the diluted per share calculations unless the effect of inclusion would be antidilutive (note 18).
recently adopted and new accounting pronouncements asc 606 provides guidance outlining a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers that supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance. this guidance requires us to recognize revenue when we transfer promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. the new guidance requires enhanced disclosures, including revenue recognition policies to identify performance obligations to customers and significant judgments in measurement and recognition. the new guidance may be applied retrospectively to each prior period presented or retrospectively with the cumulative effect recognized as of the date of adoption. we will apply the guidance retrospectively to each prior period presented, and provide the relevant disclosures beginning in the first interim period (march 31, 2018 quarterly results) and annual period (december 31, 2018 annual results) in which we adopt the guidance.
the adoption accelerated the timing of recognition of a portion of original listing fees related to our new york stock exchange, or nyse, businesses, which prior to adoption have been deferred over an estimated customer life of up to nine years. revenue recognition related to our trading, clearing and data businesses remains substantially unchanged.
adoption of the standard related to asc 606 will impact our reported results as follows, driven primarily by the accelerated recognition of listings fee revenue in our nyse business (in millions, except earnings per share):

the fasb has issued accounting standards update no. 2016-01, financial instruments - overall (subtopic 825-10): recognition and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities, or asu 2016-01. asu 2016-01 provides updated guidance for the recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of certain financial assets and liabilities, including the requirement that equity investments (except those accounted for under the equity method of accounting or those that result in consolidation of the investee) are to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income. we were required to adopt asu 2016-01 on january 1, 2018. our cost method investments, including our investment in euroclear (note 3) and our 1.8% stake in coinbase global, inc., among others, will be impacted by our adoption of asu 2016-01 beginning in the first quarter of 2018. these companies do not currently have readily determinable fair market values as they are not publicly listed companies. therefore, in accordance with asu 2016-01, we will only adjust the fair value of these investments if and when there is an observable price change in an orderly transaction, and any change in the fair value will be recognized in net income.
the fasb has issued accounting standards update no. 2016-02, leases, or asu 2016-02. asu 2016-02 requires an entity to recognize both assets and liabilities arising from financing and operating leases, along with additional qualitative and quantitative disclosures. a lessee should recognize in its balance sheet a liability to make lease payments (the lease liability) and a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term. in transition, lessees and lessors are required to recognize and measure leases at the beginning of the earliest period presented using a modified retrospective approach. asu 2016-02 is required to be adopted at the beginning of our first quarter of fiscal 2019, with early adoption permitted. we will not adopt asu 2016-02 early, but we are currently evaluating this guidance to determine the potential impact on our consolidated financial statements.
the fasb has issued accounting standards update no. 2016-18, statement of cash flows: restricted cash, or asu 2016-18, that requires entities to show the changes in the total of cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents in the statement of cash flows. as a result, entities will no longer present transfers between cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents in the statement of cash flows. when cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents are presented in more than one line item on the balance sheet, the new guidance requires a reconciliation of the totals in the statement of cash flows to the related captions in the balance sheet. this reconciliation can be presented either on the face of the statement of cash flows or in the notes to the financial statements. entities also have to disclose the nature of their restricted cash and restricted cash equivalent balances. asu 2016-18 is required to be adopted at the beginning of our first quarter of fiscal 2018, with early adoption permitted. the standard is required to be applied retrospectively when adopted, and to provide the relevant disclosures in the first interim and annual periods in which we adopt the guidance. in the fourth quarter of 2017, we early adopted asu 2016-18 and reclassified changes in restricted cash from cash flow provided by (used in) investing activities to the total change in beginning-of-year and end-of-year total amounts shown on the consolidated
94
statements of cash flows for the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015. the impact of adopting this new standard only resulted in a change in cash flow statement presentation and related disclosures. see note 5 for additional details on our restricted cash balances. the following table provides a reconciliation of cash and cash equivalents, short-term restricted cash and cash equivalents, and long-term restricted cash and cash equivalents reported within our consolidated balance sheets that sum to the total of the same such amounts shown in our consolidated statements of cash flows (in millions).

the fasb has issued accounting standards update no. 2017-07, compensation-retirement benefits (topic 715): improving the presentation of net periodic pension cost and net periodic postretirement benefit cost, or asu 2017-07. the amendments in this update require that an employer disaggregate the service cost component from the other components of net benefit cost. the amendments also provide explicit guidance on how to present the service cost component in the same line item as other related compensation costs, and the other components of net benefit cost in the income statement outside of operating income. the guidance only allows the service cost component of net benefit cost to be eligible for capitalization. we were required to adopt asu 2017-07 on january 1, 2018. we will apply the guidance retrospectively to each prior period presented when adopted, and provide the relevant disclosures in the first interim period (march 31, 2018 quarterly results) and annual period (december 31, 2018 annual results) in which we adopt the guidance. we have a pension plan, a u.s. nonqualified supplemental executive retirement plan, and post-retirement defined benefit plans that are all impacted by the guidance. each of the plans are frozen and do not have a service cost component, which means the expense or benefit recognized under each plan represents other components of net benefit cost as defined in the guidance. the combined net periodic benefit of these plans are $9 million and $8 million for the years ended december 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and are reported as a reduction to compensation and benefits expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of income. these amounts will be reported as other income, net in the consolidated statements of income when applying the guidance retroactively. see note 15 for further discussion of our pension and other benefit programs.
3.   acquisitions, investments and divestitures divestiture of trayport and the acquisitions of natural gas exchange inc. and shorcan energy brokers inc.
on december 11, 2015, we acquired 100% of trayport in a stock transaction. the total purchase price was $620 million, comprised of 12.6 million shares of our common stock. trayport is a software company that licenses its technology to serve exchanges, otc brokers and traders to facilitate electronic and hybrid trade execution primarily in the energy markets.
the u.k. competition and markets authority, or the cma, undertook a review of our acquisition of trayport under the merger control laws of the u.k. in october 2016, the cma issued its findings and ordered a divestment of trayport to remedy what the cma determined to be a substantial lessening of competition. in november 2016, we filed an appeal with the competition appeal tribunal, or the cat, to challenge the cma's decision. in march 2017, the cat upheld the cma decision that we should divest trayport. following the cat's judgment, we asked for leave to appeal the cat's decision at the u.k. court of appeals. in may 2017, the u.k. court of appeals denied our request for leave to appeal and we were obligated to sell trayport by january 2018.
on december 14, 2017, we sold trayport to tmx group for £550 million ($733 million based on the pound sterling/u.s. dollar exchange rate of 1.3331 as of december 14, 2017). we recognized a net gain of $110 million on the divestiture of trayport, which was recorded as other income within our data and listings segment in the accompanying consolidated statements of income for the year ended december 31, 2017. the net gain is equal to the $733 million in gross proceeds received less the adjusted carrying value of trayport's net assets of $607 million (which is equal to the $531 million carrying value of trayport plus $76 million in accumulated other comprehensive loss from foreign currency translation) and less $16 million in costs to sell trayport. see note 8 for information on the trayport goodwill and other intangibles assets.
the gross proceeds included a combination of £350 million ($466 million) in cash and £200 million ($267 million) in value relating to our acquisitions of natural gas exchange, inc., or ngx, and shorcan energy brokers inc., or shorcan energy, both wholly-owned subsidiaries of tmx group. trayport was included in our data and listings segment and ngx and shorcan energy are included in our trading and clearing segment. ngx, headquartered in calgary, provides electronic execution, central counterparty
95
clearing and data services to the north american natural gas, electricity and oil markets. shorcan energy offers brokerage services for the north american crude oil markets.
the ngx and shorcan energy purchase price was allocated to the preliminary net tangible and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities based on their estimated fair values as of december 14, 2017. the preliminary identifiable intangible assets acquired were $202 million, including exchange registrations and licenses for $143 million, which have been assigned an indefinite useful life, and customer relationship intangible assets for $53 million, which have been assigned useful lives of 20 years. the excess of the purchase price over the preliminary net tangible and identifiable intangible assets was $121 million and was recorded as goodwill. see note 13 for discussion of ngx margin and delivery contracts receivables and payables. we have not yet obtained all of the information related to the fair value of the acquired assets and liabilities related to the acquisition to finalize the purchase price allocation. the primary areas of the preliminary purchase price allocation that are not yet finalized relate to the valuation of the identifiable intangible assets, income taxes and certain other tangible assets and liabilities.
the functional currency of trayport was the pound sterling, as this was the currency in which trayport operated. the $620 million in trayport net assets were recorded on our december 11, 2015 opening balance sheet at a pound sterling/u.s. dollar exchange rate of 1.5218 (£407 million). because our consolidated financial statements are presented in u.s. dollars, we translated the trayport net assets into u.s. dollars at the exchange rates in effect at the end of each reporting period. therefore, increases or decreases in the value of the u.s. dollar against the pound sterling affected the value of the trayport balance sheet, with gains or losses included in the cumulative translation adjustment account, a component of equity. as a result of the decrease in the pound sterling/u.s. dollar exchange rate to 1.3331 as of december 14, 2017, the portion of our equity attributable to the trayport net assets in accumulated other comprehensive loss from foreign currency translation was $76 million. in connection with the divestiture on december 14, 2017, the $76 million in the trayport foreign currency translation loss was reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive loss and recognized as part of the net gain on the divestiture as discussed above.
as of june 30, 2017, we classified trayport as held for sale and ceased depreciation and amortization of the property and equipment and other intangible assets. subsequent to its divestiture on december 14, 2017, there are no longer any trayport assets and liabilities classified as held for sale.
acquisition of interactive data on december 14, 2015, we acquired 100% of interactive data in a stock and cash transaction. the total purchase price was $5.6 billion comprised of cash consideration of $4.1 billion and 32.3 million shares of our common stock. the cash consideration is gross of $301 million of cash held by interactive data on the date of the acquisition. the fair value of the shares issued was $1.6 billion based on the average share price of our common stock of $48.90 per share on december 14, 2015. the cash consideration was funded from $2.5 billion of net proceeds received on november 24, 2015 in connection with the offering of new senior notes and $1.6 billion of borrowing under our commercial paper program. the interactive data acquisition was included in our data and listings segment.
the financial information in the table below summarizes the combined results of operations of ice and interactive data, on a pro forma basis, as though the companies had been combined as of the beginning of the period presented. the pro forma financial information combines the historical results for us and interactive data for the year ended december 31, 2015 in the following table (in millions, except per share amounts).

other acquisitions on january 2, 2018, we acquired 100% of bondpoint from virtu financial, inc. for $400 million in cash. bondpoint is a leading provider of electronic fixed income trading solutions for the buy-side and sell-side offering access to centralized liquidity and automated trade execution services through its alternative trading system, or ats, and provides trading services to more than 500 financial services firms. the bondpoint acquisition will be included in our trading and clearing segment starting in the first quarter of 2018.
96
on october 20, 2017, we acquired bank of america merrill lynch, or bofaml's, global research division's index business. bofaml indices are the second largest group of fixed income indices as measured by assets under management, or aum, globally. the aum benchmarked against our combined fixed income indices is nearly $1 trillion, and the indices have been re-branded as the ice bofaml indices. the bofaml acquisition was included in our data and listings segment.
on may 1, 2017, we acquired 100% of tmx atrium, a global extranet and wireless services business, from tmx group. tmx atrium provides low-latency access to markets and market data across 12 countries, more than 30 major trading venues, and ultra-low latency wireless connectivity to access markets and market data in the toronto, new jersey and chicago metro areas. the wireless assets consist of microwave and millimeter networks that transport market data and provide private bandwidth. the tmx atrium acquisition was included in our data and listings segment.
on january 31, 2017, we acquired 100% of national stock exchange, inc., now named nyse national. the acquisition gives the nyse group a fourth u.s. exchange license. nyse national is distinct from nyse group's three listings exchanges because nyse national will only be a trading venue and will not be a listings market. nyse group's three listings exchanges, nyse, nyse american and nyse arca, have unique market models designed for corporate and exchange traded fund, or etf, issuers. after closing the transaction, nyse national ceased operations on february 1, 2017. subject to regulatory approvals, nyse group anticipates re-launching operations on nyse national, inc. in the second quarter of 2018. the nyse national acquisition was included in our trading and clearing segment.
on october 3, 2016, we acquired from s&p global 100% of standard & poor's securities evaluations, inc., or spse, and 100% of credit market analysis for $431 million in cash. the cash consideration was funded from borrowings under our commercial paper program. spse, which has been renamed securities evaluations, is a provider of fixed income evaluated pricing and credit market analysis is a provider of independent data for the otc markets, including credit derivatives and bonds. the spse and credit market analysis purchase price was allocated to the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities based on their estimated fair values as of october 3, 2016. the identifiable intangible assets acquired were $171 million, including customer relationship intangible assets for $135 million, which have been assigned useful lives of 15 to 20 years, and data/databases intangible assets for $29 million, which have been assigned useful lives of 5 to 10 years. the excess of the purchase price over the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets was $312 million and was recorded as goodwill and was recorded in our data and listings segment.
investments and divestitures on october 24, 2017, we acquired a 4.7% stake in euroclear for €275 million in cash ($327 million based on the euro/u.s. dollar exchange rate of 1.1903 as of october 24, 2017). during december 2017, we reached an agreement to buy an additional 5.1% stake in euroclear for €243 million in cash ($292 million based on the euro/u.s. dollar exchange rate of 1.2003 as of december 31, 2017) and expect to receive necessary regulatory approval during the first quarter of 2018. upon closing, we will own a 9.8% stake in euroclear for a total investment of €518 million ($619 million based on the exchange rates above). euroclear is a leading provider of post-trade services, including settlement, central securities depositories and related services for cross-border transactions across asset classes. we account for our investment in euroclear as a cost method investment and we classify it as an other non-current asset in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of december 31, 2017. as discussed in note 2, subsequent to the adoption of asu 2016-01 on january 1, 2018, we would only adjust the fair value of our investment in euroclear if there is an observable price change in an orderly euroclear transaction and any change in the fair value will be recognized in net income.
for consolidated subsidiaries in which our ownership is less than 100% and for which we have control over the assets, liabilities and management of the entity, the outside stockholders' interests are shown as non-controlling interest in our consolidated financial statements. as of december 31, 2016, non-controlling interest included those related to the operating results of our cds clearing subsidiaries in which non-ice limited partners held a 42.5% net profit sharing interest; ice endex in which gasunie held a 21% ownership interest; and ice clear netherlands in which abn amro clearing bank n.v. held a 25% ownership interest. for both ice endex and ice clear netherlands, in addition to the non-controlling interest reported in the consolidated statements of income, we reported redeemable non-controlling interest in the consolidated balance sheets which represents the minority interest redemption fair value for each company.
during june 2017, we purchased both gasunie's 21% minority ownership interest in ice endex and abn amro clearing bank n.v.'s 25% minority ownership interest in ice clear netherlands. subsequent to these acquisitions, we own 100% of ice endex and ice clear netherlands and will no longer include any non-controlling interest amounts for ice endex and ice clear netherlands in our consolidated financial statements. during the year ended december 31, 2017, we purchased 12.6% of the net profit sharing interest in our cds clearing subsidiaries from several non-ice limited partners and the remaining non-ice limited partners hold a 29.9% net profit sharing interest in our cds clearing subsidiaries as of december 31, 2017.
on june 1, 2017, we sold nyse governance services to marlin heritage, l.p. nyse governance services provides governance and compliance analytics and education solutions for organizations and their boards of directors through dynamic learning solutions.
97
we recognized a net loss of $6 million on the divestiture of nyse governance services, which was recorded as amortization expense within our data and listings segment in the accompanying consolidated statements of income for the year ended december 31, 2017.
on march 31, 2017, we sold interactive data managed solutions, or idms, a unit of interactive data, to factset. idms is a managed solutions and portal provider for the global wealth management industry. there was no gain or loss recognized on the sale of idms.
on june 30, 2016, we acquired a majority equity position in mers. mers is a privately held, member-based organization that owns and manages the mers® system and is made up of thousands of lenders, servicers, sub-servicers, investors and government institutions. in addition, we have entered into a software development agreement to rebuild the mers® system to benefit the u.s. residential mortgage finance market. the mers® system is a national electronic registry that tracks the changes in servicing rights and beneficial ownership interests in u.s.-based mortgage loans. the terms of the mers acquisition include a right for us to purchase all of the remaining equity interests of mers after we satisfy our deliverables under the software development agreement. in addition, the mers equity holders may exercise a put option to require us to purchase all of the remaining equity interests of mers. each of these terms is subject to certain price provisions. because we do not have the ability to control mers' operations, we have recorded the purchase as an equity method investment and our ratable share of net income (loss) in mers in future periods will be recorded in our consolidated statements of income as equity earnings of our unconsolidated subsidiaries, below operating income in other income (loss).
4.   revenue recognition (disclosures related to the adoption of asc 606 on january 1, 2018)
in note 2, we disclose the accounting policies associated with our material revenue streams that are applied in our consolidated financial statements. on january 1, 2018, we were required to adopt asc 606 on a full retrospective basis and beginning in the first quarter of 2018 will restate each prior reporting period presented as if asc 606 had always been applied. the adoption of asc 606 does not have a material impact on the measurement or recognition of revenue in any prior or current reporting periods; however, additional disclosures required by asc 606 are provided below for comparability purposes. our adoption of asc 606 was subject to the same internal controls over financial reporting that we apply to our consolidated financial statements. terms as used below relate to how they are defined in asc 606.
substantially all of our revenues are considered to be revenues from contracts with customers. the related accounts receivable balances are recorded in our balance sheets as customer accounts receivable. we do not have obligations for warranties, returns or refunds to customers, other than the rebates discussed further below, which are settled each period and therefore do not result in variable consideration. we do not have significant revenue recognized from performance obligations that were satisfied in prior periods, and we do not have any transaction price allocated to unsatisfied performance obligations other than in our deferred revenue. deferred revenue represents our contract liabilities related to our annual, original and other listings revenues as well as certain data services, clearing services and other revenues. deferred revenue is the only significant contract asset or liability impacted by our adoption of asc 606. see note 9 for our discussion on deferred revenue balances, activity, and expected timing of recognition. we have elected not to provide disclosures about transaction price allocated to unsatisfied performance obligations if contract durations are less than one-year, or if we are not required to estimate the transaction price. for all of our contracts with customers, except for listings and certain data and clearing services, our performance obligations are short term in nature and there is no significant variable consideration. see below for further descriptions of our revenue contracts. in addition, we have elected the practical expedient of excluding sales taxes from transaction prices. we have assessed the costs incurred to obtain or fulfill a contract with a customer and determined them to be immaterial.
certain judgments and estimates were used in the identification and timing of satisfaction of performance obligations and the related allocation of transaction price. we believe that these represent a faithful depiction of the transfer of services to our customers.
our primary revenue contract classifications are described below. though we discuss additional revenue details in our "management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations," the categories below best represent those that depict similar economic characteristics of the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of our revenues and cash flows.
•   transaction and clearing, net - transaction and clearing revenues represent fees charged for the performance obligations of derivatives trading and clearing, and from our cash trading and equity options exchanges. the derivatives trading and clearing fees contain two performance obligations: 1) trade execution/clearing novation and 2) risk management of open interest. we allocate the transaction price between these two performance obligations; however both of these generally occur almost simultaneously, therefore, no significant deferral results as we have no further obligation to the customer at that time. cash trading and equity options fees contain one performance obligation related to trade execution. trade execution occurs instantaneously, therefore, there is no need to allocate the transaction price and no deferral results as we have no further obligation to the customer at that time. our transaction and clearing revenues are reported net of rebates, except for the nyse transaction-based expenses. transaction and clearing fees can be variable based on trade volume discounts used in the determination of rebates, however virtually all volume discounts are calculated and recorded on a monthly basis. transaction
98
and clearing fees, as well as any volume discounts rebated to our customers, are calculated and billed monthly in accordance with our published fee schedules. we make liquidity payments to certain customers in our nyse business and recognize those payments as a cost of revenue. in addition, we pay nyse regulatory oversight fees to the sec and collect equal amounts from our customers. these are also considered a cost of revenue, and both of these nyse-related fees are included in transaction-based expenses. transaction and clearing revenues and the related transaction-based expenses are all recognized in our trading and clearing segment.
•   data services - data service revenues represent the following:
◦   pricing and analytics services consisting of an extensive set of independent evaluated pricing services focused primarily on fixed income and international equity securities, valuation services, reference data, market data, end of day pricing, fixed income equity portfolio analytics and risk management analytics.
◦   desktop and connectivity services which comprise technology-based information platforms, feeds and connectivity. these include trading applications, desktop solutions and data feeds to support trading, voice brokers and investment functions.
◦   exchange data services which represent subscription fees for the provision of our market data that is created from activity in our trading and clearing segment.
the nature and timing of each contract type for the data services above are similar in nature. data services revenues are primarily subscription-based, billed monthly, quarterly or annually in advance and recognized ratably over time as our performance obligations of data delivery are met consistently throughout the period. considering these contracts primarily consist of single performance obligations with fixed prices, there is no variable consideration and no need to allocate the transaction price. in certain of our data contracts, where third parties are involved, we arrange for the third party to transfer the services to our customers; in these arrangements we are acting as an agent and revenue is recorded net. all data services fees are included in our data and listings segment.
•   listings - listing revenues include original, annual, and other corporate action fees. under asc 606, each distinct listing fee is allocated to multiple performance obligations including original and incremental listing and investor relations services, as well as a customer's material right to renew the option to list on our exchanges. in performing this allocation, the standalone selling price of the listing services is based on the original and annual listing fees and the standalone selling price of the investor relation services is based on its market value. all listings fees are billed upfront and the identified performance obligations are satisfied over time. upon our adoption of the asc 606 framework, the amount of revenue related to the investor relations performance obligation is recognized ratably over a two-year period, with the remaining revenue recognized ratably over time as customers continue to list on our exchanges, which is generally estimated to be over a period of up to 9 years for nyse and 5 years for nyse arca and nyse american. listings fees related to other corporate actions are considered contract modifications of our listing contracts and are recognized ratably over time as customers continue to list on our exchanges, which is generally estimated to be a period of 6 years for nyse and 3 years for nyse arca and nyse american. all listings fees are recognized in our data &amp; listings segment.
•   other revenues - other revenue primarily includes interest income on certain clearing margin deposits, regulatory penalties and fines, fees for use of our facilities, regulatory fees charged to member organizations of our u.s. securities exchanges, designated market maker service fees, exchange membership fees and agricultural grading and certification fees. other revenues are recognized either in our trading and clearing segment or data and listings segment based on the nature of the revenue. generally, fees for other revenues contain one performance obligation. services for other revenues are primarily satisfied at a point in time, therefore, there is no need to allocate the fee and no deferral results as we have no further obligation to the customer at that time.
the following table depicts the disaggregation of our revenue according to business line and segment (in millions) prior to our adoption of asc 606; as such, the segment totals here are consistent with the segment totals in note 17:

5.   short-term and long-term restricted cash and cash equivalents we own ice futures europe, which operates as a u.k. recognized investment exchange. as a u.k. recognized investment exchange, ice futures europe is required by the financial conduct authority in the u.k. to restrict the use of the equivalent of six months of operating expenditures, subject to certain deductions, in cash or cash equivalents or investments at all times. as of both

december 31, 2017 and 2016, this amount for ice futures europe was $77 million. such amounts are reflected as short-term restricted cash and cash equivalents in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
as a u.k. recognized clearing house, ice clear europe is required by the bank of england and the european market infrastructure regulation, or emir, to restrict as cash, cash equivalents or investments an amount to reflect an estimate of the capital required to wind down or restructure the activities of the clearing house, cover operational, legal and business risks and to reserve capital to meet credit, counterparty and market risks not covered by the members margin and guaranty funds. as such, it is calculated taking into account the operating expenditures, revenues and credit exposures associated with the assets and investments. as of december 31, 2017 and 2016, the regulatory capital restricted cash for ice clear europe was $423 million and $352 million, respectively, and was reflected as short-term restricted cash and cash equivalents in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. the increase in the regulatory capital restricted cash at ice clear europe as of december 31, 2017 was primarily due to additional costs incurred due to the growth of our clearing businesses and the consequential additional regulatory capital buffers required by the bank of england. ice clear europe, in addition to being regulated by the bank of england, is also regulated by the commodity futures trading commission, or cftc, as a u.s. derivatives clearing organizations, or dco. the regulatory capital available to ice clear europe, as described above, exceeds the cftc requirements.
our cftc regulated u.s. designated contract market, or dcm, ice futures u.s., our cftc regulated u.s. dcos, ice clear u.s. and ice clear credit, our cftc regulated u.s. swap data repository, or sdr, ice trade vault, and our u.s. swap execution facility, or sef, ice swap trade, are required to maintain financial resources with a value at least equal to the amount that would cover certain operating costs for a one-year period, including maintaining cash or a committed line of credit, subject to certain deductions, to satisfy at least six months of such operating costs at all times. as of december 31, 2017 and 2016, the financial resources reserved necessary to satisfy cftc financial resource requirements for the dcm, u.s. dcos, sdr and sef were $193 million and $192 million, respectively, and was reflected as short-term restricted cash and cash equivalents in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. for our u.s. dcos, ice clear u.s. and ice clear credit, these amounts include voluntarily-held additional reserves consistent with the emir requirements to cover operational, legal and business risks and to reserve capital to meet credit, counterparty and market risks not covered by the member margin and guaranty funds.
our clearing houses, other than ngx, require that each clearing member make deposits to a fund known as the guaranty fund. the amounts in the guaranty fund will serve to secure the obligations of a clearing member to our clearing houses and may be used to cover losses in excess of the margin and clearing firm accounts sustained by our clearing houses in the event of a default of a clearing member. as of december 31, 2017 and 2016; ice clear europe has contributed $100 million of its own cash as part of its futures and options guaranty fund; ice clear europe has contributed $50 million as part of its cds guaranty fund; ice clear credit has contributed $50 million as part of its cds guaranty fund; ice clear u.s. has contributed $50 million as part of its futures and options guaranty fund; and ice clear canada, ice clear netherlands and ice clear singapore have each also contributed a combined $4 million in cash to their respective guaranty funds. these cash contributions to the guaranty funds are reflected as long-term restricted cash and cash equivalents in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of december 31, 2017 and 2016. see note 13 for additional information on the guaranty funds and our contributions of cash to our clearing houses guaranty funds.
as of december 31, 2017 and 2016, there is $64 million and $44 million, respectively, of additional combined cash reflected as short-term restricted cash and cash equivalents in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets related to other regulated entities and exchanges, including ice benchmark administration, ice clear netherlands, ice clear canada, ice trade vault u.k., ice endex, ice clear singapore and ngx. the increase in the regulatory capital restricted cash as of december 31, 2017 was primarily due to additional costs incurred due to the growth of these businesses and the acquisition of ngx in december 2017 (note 3).
as of december 31, 2017 and 2016, there is $22 million and $24 million, respectively, of additional restricted cash, primarily related to escrow for recent acquisitions and was reflected as short-term or long-term restricted cash and cash equivalents in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

until march 29, 2017, we held a 12% ownership interest in cetip, s.a., or cetip, which we classified as an available-for-sale long-term investment. cetip was recorded at its fair value using its quoted market price. changes in the fair value of available-for-sale securities are reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income, and include the effects of both stock price and foreign currency translation fluctuations. the unrealized holding gains and losses are excluded from earnings and reported in other comprehensive income until realized. realized gains and losses, and declines in value deemed to be other-than-temporary, are recognized in earnings.
we acquired the common stock of cetip for an aggregate consideration of $514 million in cash in july 2011. during the year ended december 31, 2013, we recognized an impairment loss on our cetip investment of $190 million, primarily due to unfavorable foreign exchange rate changes, which was equal to the difference between the $324 million fair value as of december 31, 2013 and the original investment cost of $514 million. the $324 million fair value of the cetip investment as of december 31, 2013 became our new cost basis. the long-term investment in equity securities as of december 31, 2016 represents our investment in cetip, which was valued at $432 million, including a $108 million accumulated unrealized gain.
on march 29, 2017, cetip and bm&fbovespa s.a. finalized a merger agreement. bm&fbovespa s.a., which changed its name to b3 s.a. - brasil, bolsa, balcao, or b3, following the merger with cetip, is a stock exchange and operator of registration, clearing, custodial and settlement services for equities, financial securities, indices, rates, commodities and currencies and is located in são paulo, brazil. the merger valued our cetip investment at $500 million. we received the proceeds in cash and in b3 common stock.
the cash component was valued at $319 million, which was subject to brazilian capital gains tax of $28 million that was remitted to the brazilian tax authorities in march 2017. we received net cash proceeds in april 2017 of $286 million, which is net of a foreign exchange loss of $6 million that was incurred in april 2017. we received 29,623,756 b3 common shares valued at their quoted market price of $181 million. in april 2017, we sold the b3 common shares for net proceeds of $152 million, which is net of a capital gain tax of $26 million that was remitted to the brazilian tax authorities and further transaction expenses of $3 million that were incurred in april 2017. we used the $438 million in net cash and stock proceeds received from the merger and sale of b3 shares to pay down amounts outstanding under our commercial paper program and for share repurchases.
the $500 million fair value of our investment in cetip included an accumulated unrealized gain of $176 million, based on the $324 million cost basis. in connection with the sale of our equity investment in cetip, the $176 million, accumulated unrealized gain was reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income and was recognized in other income as a realized investment gain in the accompanying consolidated statement of income for the year ended december 31, 2017.
equity and fixed income mutual funds are held for the purpose of providing future payments for the supplemental executive savings plan and the supplemental executive retirement plan (note 15) and are classified as available-for-sale securities.

we completed the acquisitions of ngx, shorcan energy, the bofaml indices, tmx atrium and nyse national and sold trayport, nyse governance services and idms during the year ended december 31, 2017 and completed the acquisitions of securities evaluations and credit market analysis during the year ended december 31, 2016 (note 3). the changes in other activity, net in the tables above primarily relate to adjustments to the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities relating to the acquisitions, with a corresponding adjustment to goodwill.
the foreign currency translation adjustments in the tables above resulted from a portion of our goodwill and other intangible assets being held at our u.k., eu and canadian subsidiaries, some of whose functional currencies are not the u.s. dollar. the foreign currency translation decrease for the year ended december 31, 2016 is primarily due to certain of our goodwill and intangible assets being recorded in pound sterling, which decreased in value due to the weakening pound sterling exchange rate following the u.k. referendum vote in june 2016 to leave the eu.
in 2016, we sold certain of creditex's u.s. voice brokerage operations to tullett prebon and we discontinued creditex's u.k. voice brokerage operations. we continue to operate creditex's electronically traded markets and systems, post-trade connectivity platforms and intellectual property. based on an analysis of these factors, it was determined that the carrying value of the creditex customer relationship intangible asset was not fully recoverable and an impairment of the asset was recorded in september 2016 for $33 million based on a discounted cash flow calculation. the impairment was recorded as amortization expense within our trading and clearing segment in the accompanying consolidated statement of income for the year ended december 31, 2016.

amended credit facility we had previously entered into a $3.4 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility, or the credit facility, with a maturity date of november 13, 2020, pursuant to a credit agreement with wells fargo bank, n.a., or wells fargo, as administrative agent,
105
issuing lender and swing-line lender, bank of america, n.a., as syndication agent, backup administrative agent and swing-line lender, and the lenders party thereto. on august 18, 2017, we agreed with the lenders to, amongst other items, extend the maturity date to august 18, 2022, herein referred to as the amended credit facility. the amended credit facility includes an option for us to propose an increase in the aggregate amount available for borrowing by up to $975 million, subject to the consent of the lenders funding the increase and certain other conditions.
other amendments within the amended credit facility include, but are not limited to, (i) eliminating the step-up in the commitment fee ratings-based grid that was scheduled to take effect in april 2019, (ii) removing ice europe parent limited as a party to the credit agreement, (iii) removing the guaranty by ice in respect of ice europe parent limited, (iv) increasing the maximum leverage ratio to 3.50:1.00, and (v) up to two times, increasing the maximum leverage ratio from 3.50:1.00 to 4.00:1.00 for a period of one year following a material acquisition.
no amounts were outstanding under the amended credit facility as of december 31, 2017. we incurred debt issuance costs of $5 million relating to the amended credit facility and they are presented in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as other non-current assets and will be amortized over the life of the amended credit facility.
amounts borrowed under the amended credit facility may be prepaid at any time without premium or penalty. the amended credit facility provides for a $3.4 billion multi-currency revolving facility, with sub-limits for non-dollar borrowings and letters of credit and with a swing-line facility available on a same-day basis. of the $3.4 billion that is currently available for borrowing under the amended credit facility, $1.2 billion is required to back-stop the amount outstanding under our commercial paper program as of december 31, 2017 and $100 million is required to support certain subsidiary clearing house commitments (note 13). the amount required to back-stop the amounts outstanding under the commercial paper program will fluctuate as we increase or decrease our commercial paper borrowings. the remaining $2.1 billion available under the amended credit facility as of december 31, 2017 is available to us to use for working capital and general corporate purposes including, but not limited to, acting as a back-stop to future increases in the amounts outstanding under the commercial paper program.
borrowings under the amended credit facility will bear interest on the principal amount outstanding at either (a) libor plus an applicable margin rate or (b) a "base rate" plus an applicable margin rate; provided, however, that all loans denominated in a foreign currency will bear interest at libor plus an applicable margin rate. the "base rate" equals the higher of (i) wells fargo's prime rate, (ii) the federal funds rate plus 0.50%, or (iii) the one-month libor rate plus 1.00%. the applicable margin rate is based upon our public long-term debt ratings and ranges from 0.875% to 1.50% on libor borrowings and from 0.00% to 0.50% on base rate borrowings.
the amended credit facility includes an unutilized revolving credit commitment fee that is equal to the unused maximum revolver amount, multiplied by an applicable commitment fee rate and is payable in arrears on a quarterly basis. the applicable commitment fee rate ranges from 0.08% to 0.20% and is determined based on our long-term debt rating. as of december 31, 2017, the applicable commitment fee rate was 0.125% based on our current long-term debt ratings.
the amended credit facility contains customary representations and warranties, covenants and events of default, including a leverage ratio, as well as limitations on liens on our assets, indebtedness of non-obligor subsidiaries, the sale of all or substantially all of our assets, and other matters.
senior notes on august 17, 2017, we issued $1.0 billion in aggregate senior notes, including $500 million principal amount of 2.35% senior unsecured fixed rate notes due september 2022, or the 2022 senior notes, and $500 million principal amount of 3.10% senior unsecured fixed rate notes due september 2027, or the 2027 senior notes. we used the majority of the net proceeds from the 2022 senior notes and 2027 senior notes offering to fund the redemption of the nyse notes.
we incurred debt issuance costs of $8 million relating to the issuance of the 2022 senior notes and the 2027 senior notes and they are presented in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as a deduction from the carrying amount of the related debt liability and will be amortized over the life of the 2022 senior notes and the 2027 senior notes. the 2022 senior notes and 2027 senior notes contain affirmative and negative covenants, including, but not limited to, certain redemption rights, limitations on liens and indebtedness and limitations on certain mergers, sales, dispositions and lease-back transactions.
in november 2015, we issued $2.5 billion in aggregate senior notes, including $1.25 billion principal amount of 2.75% senior unsecured fixed rate notes due november 2020, or the 2020 senior notes, and $1.25 billion principal amount of 3.75% senior unsecured fixed rate notes due november 2025, or the 2025 senior notes. we used the net proceeds from the 2020 senior notes and 2025 senior notes offering, together with $1.6 billion of borrowings under our commercial paper program, to finance the $4.1 billion cash portion of the purchase price of the acquisition of interactive data. the 2020 senior notes and 2025 senior notes contain affirmative and negative covenants, including, but not limited to, certain redemption rights, limitations on liens and indebtedness, limitations on certain mergers, sales, dispositions and lease-back transactions.
106
commercial paper program we have entered into a u.s. dollar commercial paper program, or the commercial paper program. our commercial paper program is currently backed by the borrowing capacity available under the amended credit facility, equal to the amount of the commercial paper that is issued and outstanding at any given point in time. the effective interest rate of commercial paper issuances does not materially differ from short-term interest rates (such as usd libor). the fluctuation of these rates due to market conditions may impact our interest expense.
we repaid $409 million of net notes outstanding under the commercial paper program during the year ended december 31, 2017 primarily using net cash proceeds received from the sale of our investment in cetip and the sale of trayport. these repayments were partially offset by notes issued under the commercial paper program during the year ended december 31, 2017 for the cash acquisitions and investments and to repurchase our common stock. see note 3 for a discussion of our 2017 acquisitions, investments and divestitures. we used net proceeds from notes issued under the commercial paper program during the year ended december 31, 2016 to finance part of the cash purchase price of the securities evaluations and credit market analysis acquisitions and for general corporate purposes. we used net proceeds from notes issued under the commercial paper program during the year ended december 31, 2015 to finance part of the cash portion of the purchase price of the interactive data acquisition and to pay related fees and expenses, to repurchase our common stock, and for general corporate purposes. we repaid a portion of the amounts outstanding under the commercial paper program during the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 with cash flows from operations.
commercial paper notes of $1.2 billion with original maturities ranging from two to 64 days were outstanding as of december 31, 2017 under our commercial paper program. as of december 31, 2017, the weighted average interest rate on the $1.2 billion outstanding under our commercial paper program was 1.49% per annum, with a weighted average maturity of 18 days. commercial paper notes of $1.6 billion with original maturities ranging from three to 68 days were outstanding as of december 31, 2016 under the commercial paper program. as of december 31, 2016, the weighted average interest rate on the $1.6 billion outstanding under the commercial paper program was 0.74% per annum, with a weighted average maturity of 18 days.
nyse notes the $850 million, 2.00% senior unsecured fixed rate nyse notes were due in october 2017. we redeemed the nyse notes in full in september 2017 using the majority of the proceeds from the 2022 senior notes and 2027 senior notes offering.
we previously provided condensed consolidating financial statements for intercontinental exchange, inc., or ice (parent), nyse holdings llc and the subsidiary non-guarantors in a footnote to our consolidated financial statements. however, in connection with the nyse notes being redeemed in full in september 2017, all guarantees between ice and nyse holdings llc were terminated and we are no longer required to include a condensed consolidating financial statements footnote in our quarterly and annual filings.

in march 2016, we early adopted accounting standards update no. 2016-09, stock compensation (topic 718) - improvements to employee share-based payment accounting, or asu 2016-09, on a prospective basis. under the requirements of asu 2016-09, we recognized $15 million in excess tax benefits for tax deductions in excess of cumulative compensation expenses for financial reporting purposes for the year ended december 31, 2016 through our consolidated statement of income. for the year ended december 31, 2015, we recognized excess tax benefits of $19 million as an increase to the additional paid-in capital balance.
as of december 31, 2017, we had 39.7 million shares in total under various equity plans that are available for future issuance as stock option and restricted stock awards.
stock option plans stock options are granted at the discretion of the compensation committee of the board of directors. all stock options are granted at an exercise price equal to the fair value of the common stock on the date of grant. the grant date fair value is based on the closing stock price on the date of grant as well as certain other assumptions. the fair value of the stock options on the date of grant is recognized as expense ratably over the vesting period, net of estimated forfeitures. we may grant, under provisions of the plans, both incentive stock options and nonqualified stock options. the options generally vest over three years, but can vest at different intervals based on the compensation committee's determination and the terms of the equity plans. generally, options may be exercised up to ten years after the date of grant, but expire either 14 or 60 days after termination of employment unless an employee's employment agreement specifies otherwise. the shares of common stock issued under our stock option plans are made available from authorized and unissued common stock or treasury shares. the following is a summary of stock options for the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015:

the total intrinsic value of stock options exercised during the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 was $22 million, $18 million and $22 million, respectively. as of december 31, 2017, there was $8 million in total unrecognized compensation costs related to stock options. these costs are expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.7 years as the stock options vest.
of the options outstanding at december 31, 2017, 2,989,950 were exercisable at a weighted-average exercise price of $36.36. of the options outstanding at december 31, 2016, 2,787,525 were exercisable at a weighted-average exercise price of $31.61. of the options outstanding at december 31, 2015, 2,699,865 were exercisable at a weighted-average exercise price of $27.87.
we use the black-scholes option pricing model for purposes of valuing stock option awards. during the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, we used the assumptions in the table below to compute the value of all options for shares of common stock granted to employees:

the risk-free interest rate is based on the zero-coupon u.s. treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. the expected life computation is derived from historical exercise patterns and anticipated future patterns. expected volatilities are based on historical volatility of our stock.
restricted stock plans restricted stock units are granted at the discretion of the compensation committee of the board of directors. we granted 3,274,358, 3,251,017 and 3,457,590 time-based and performance-based restricted stock units during the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, including 2,364,288, 2,325,985 and 1,871,785 time-based restricted stock units during the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. the grant date fair value of each award is based on the closing stock price at the date of grant. the fair value of the time-based restricted stock units on the date of grant is recognized as expense ratably over the vesting period, which is typically three years, net of forfeitures. granted but unvested shares are generally forfeited upon termination of employment. when restricted stock is forfeited, compensation costs previously recognized for unvested shares are reversed. until the shares vest and are issued, the participants have no voting or dividend rights and the shares may not be sold, assigned, transferred, pledged or otherwise encumbered. unvested restricted stock earns dividend equivalents which are paid in cash on the vesting date.
we recognize compensation costs, net of forfeitures, using an accelerated attribution method over the vesting period for awards with performance conditions. compensation costs for such awards are recognized only if it is probable that the condition will be satisfied. if we initially determine that it is not probable that the performance condition will be satisfied and later determine that it is probable that the performance condition will be satisfied, or vice versa, the effect of the change in estimate is accounted for in the period of change by recording a cumulative catch-up adjustment to retroactively apply the new estimate. we recognize the remaining compensation costs over the remaining vesting period. our compensation committee, pursuant to the terms of the equity plans and the authority delegated to it by our board of directors, can make equitable adjustments to the performance condition in recognition of unusual or non-recurring events.
in january 2017, we reserved a maximum of 1,534,218 restricted shares for potential issuance as performance-based restricted shares for certain of our employees. these restricted shares were subject to a market condition that could have reduced the number of shares that were awarded if our 2017 total shareholder return fell below that of the 2017 return of the s&p 500 index and if we achieved above target financial performance level. our total shareholder return for the year ended december 31, 2017 was higher than the 2017 return of the s&p 500 index. therefore, no share reduction was required. based on our actual 2017 financial performance as compared to the 2017 financial performance level thresholds, 767,109 restricted shares were awarded, which resulted in $43 million in compensation expenses that will be expensed over the three-year accelerated vesting period, including $26 million that was expensed during the year ended december 31, 2017.
the grant date fair values of the awards with a market condition were estimated based on our stock price on the grant date, the valuation of historical awards with market conditions, the relatively low likelihood that the market condition will affect the number of shares granted (as the market condition only affects shares granted in excess of certain financial performance targets), and our expectation of achieving the financial performance targets. the grant date fair value of the awards, when considering the impact of the market condition on fair value, was determined to not be materially different from our stock price on the respective grant dates.
restricted shares are used as an incentive to attract and retain qualified employees and to increase shareholder returns with actual performance linked to both short and long-term shareholder return. our equity plans include a change in control provision that may accelerate vesting on both the time-based and performance-based restricted shares if the awards are not assumed by an acquirer in the case of a change in control. the following is a summary of the nonvested restricted shares under all plans discussed above for the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015:

restricted stock shares granted in the table above include both time-based and performance-based grants. performance-based shares have been presented to reflect the actual shares to be issued based on the achievement of past performance targets, also considering the impact of any market conditions. non-vested performance-based restricted shares granted are presented in the table above at the maximum number of restricted shares that would vest if the maximum performance targets are met. as of december 31, 2017, there were $142 million in total unrecognized compensation costs related to the time-based restricted stock and the performance-based restricted stock. these costs are expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.3 years as the restricted stock vests. during the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, the total fair value of restricted stock vested under all restricted stock plans was $206 million, $130 million and $96 million, respectively.
treasury stock during the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, we received 1,503,453 shares, 1,074,162 shares and 979,295 shares, respectively, of common stock from certain of our employees related to tax withholdings made by us on our employee's behalf for restricted stock and stock option exercises. we recorded the receipt of the shares as treasury stock. treasury stock activity is presented in the accompanying consolidated statements of changes in equity, accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and redeemable non-controlling interest.
in connection with the record date for a 5-for-1 stock split on october 27, 2016, all shares of common stock held by us as treasury shares were canceled and extinguished. therefore, as of the close of market on october 27, 2016, all 35,273,515 outstanding treasury stock shares were retired. in connection with the retirement, of the $1.5 billion value assigned to the treasury stock shares, $1.1 billion was allocated to additional paid-in capital and $370 million was allocated to retained earnings. the amount allocated to additional paid-in capital was determined based on the paid-in capital per share generated from the historical issuances of these treasury shares.
stock repurchase program during the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, we repurchased 14,966,616 shares, 902,920 shares and 14,343,845 shares, respectively, of our outstanding common stock at a cost of $949 million, $50 million and $660 million, respectively. the shares repurchased are held in treasury stock. these repurchases were completed on the open market and under our 10b5-1 trading plan. in connection with our acquisition of interactive data during the fourth quarter of 2015, we suspended our stock repurchase plan for a period of time. the timing and extent of future repurchases that are not made pursuant to a rule 10b5-1 trading plan will be at our discretion and will depend upon many conditions. our management periodically reviews whether or not to be active in repurchasing our stock. in making a determination regarding any stock repurchases, we consider multiple factors. the factors may include: overall stock market conditions, our common stock price movements, the remaining amount authorized for repurchases by our board of directors, the potential impact of a stock repurchase program on our corporate debt ratings, our expected free cash flow and working capital needs, our current and future planned strategic growth initiatives, and other potential uses of our cash and capital resources.
in august 2016, our board of directors approved an aggregate of $1.0 billion for future repurchases of our common stock with no fixed expiration date. in september 2017, our board of directors approved an aggregate of $1.2 billion for future repurchases of our common stock with no fixed expiration date that became effective on january 1, 2018. we expect funding for any share repurchases to come from our operating cash flow or borrowings under our debt facilities or commercial paper program.

repurchases may be made from time to time on the open market, through established trading plans, in privately-negotiated transactions or otherwise, in accordance with all applicable securities laws, rules and regulations. we have entered into a rule 10b5-1 trading plan, as authorized by our board of directors, to govern some or all of the repurchases of our shares of common stock. we may discontinue the stock repurchases at any time and may amend or terminate the rule 10b5-1 trading plan at any time. the approval of our board of directors for the share repurchases does not obligate us to acquire any particular amount of our common stock. in addition, our board of directors may increase or decrease the amount of capacity we have for repurchases from time to time. we repurchased shares of our common stock in the open market during the periods presented as follows:

the effective tax rates for the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 are lower than the federal statutory rate primarily due to favorable u.s. and u.k. tax law changes and favorable foreign income tax rate differentials, partially offset by state income taxes. favorable foreign income tax rate differentials result primarily from lower income tax rates in the u.k. and various other lower tax jurisdictions as compared to the historical income tax rates in the u.s.
on december 22, 2017, the tcja was signed into law (note 2). the tcja reduced the u.s. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective january 1, 2018. we are required to revalue our u.s. deferred tax assets and liabilities at the new federal corporate income tax rate as of the date of enactment of the tcja and to include the rate change effect in the tax provision for the period ended december 31, 2017. as a result, we recognized a $764 million deferred tax benefit based on a reasonable estimate of the deferred tax assets and liabilities as of december 22, 2017. this significantly reduced the effective tax rate for the period ended december 31, 2017 in comparison to the effective tax rates for the last two comparable periods.
during the fourth quarter of 2015, the u.k. reduced the corporate income tax rate from 20% to 19% effective april 1, 2017 and to 18% effective april 1, 2020. during the third quarter of 2016, the u.k. further reduced their corporate income tax rate from 18% to 17% effective april 1, 2020. the reduction in the future u.s. and u.k. corporate income tax rates resulted in deferred tax benefits. the impact of the deferred tax benefits for the u.s. and u.k. corporate income tax rate reductions for the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 collectively lowered the effective tax rates by 30%, 2% and 4%, respectively, and resulted in deferred tax benefits of $764 million, $34 million and $60 million, respectively.
the decrease in the effective tax rate for the year ended december 31, 2017, from the comparable period in 2016, is primarily due to the deferred tax benefit associated with the tcja and tax benefits associated with a divestiture in the second quarter of 2017, partially offset by the deferred tax benefit from the u.k. corporate income tax reduction in the third quarter of 2016, additional tax expense from an illinois corporate income tax rate increase enacted in the third quarter of 2017, and an income tax expense increase due to a relatively higher u.s. mix of income in 2017. the increase in the effective tax rate for the year ended december 31, 2016, from the comparable period in 2015, is primarily due to the tax impact of foreign versus u.s. based pre-tax income, lower deferred tax benefits associated with the future u.k. income tax rate reductions, and greater favorable settlements with various taxing authorities in 2015, partially offset by a tax benefit from the early adoption of asu 2016-09 in 2016.
deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. as a result of the enactment of tcja on december 22, 2017, we revalued the u.s. deferred tax assets and liabilities at the new federal corporate income tax rate of 21%, for the period ended december 31, 2017. therefore, the ending balance of the net deferred tax liability for that period is significantly lower compared to the prior periods' balances. the following table summarizes the significant components of our deferred tax liabilities and assets as of december 31, 2017 and 2016 (in millions):

ending balance of deferred income tax valuation allowance         $126                $122                 $72
we recognize valuation allowances on deferred tax assets if, based on the weight of the evidence, we believe that it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. we recorded a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets of $126 million and $122 million as of december 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. increases charged to income tax expense primarily relate to deferred tax assets on foreign net operating and capital losses that we do not expect to be realizable in future periods. increases charged against goodwill primarily relate to deferred tax assets arising on the 2017 acquisition of national stock exchange and the 2016 acquisition of a foreign branch that we do not expect to be realizable in future periods. decreases for the year ended december 31, 2017 relate to the u.s. corporate income tax rate reduction from 35% to 21% and the net impact from divestitures of trayport and idms. decreases for the year ended december 31, 2015 relate to net operating loss carryforwards that we determined would be available to offset income in future periods.
as part of u.s. tax reform, the tcja imposes a transition tax on certain accumulated foreign earnings aggregated across all non-u.s. subsidiaries, net of foreign deficits, as computed under u.s. tax principles. as we are in an aggregate net foreign deficit position for u.s. tax purposes, we are not liable for the transition tax.
our non-u.s. subsidiaries had $4.5 billion in cumulative undistributed earnings as of december 31, 2017. this amount represents the post-income tax earnings under u.s. gaap principles. the earnings from our non-u.s. subsidiaries are considered to be indefinitely reinvested. accordingly, no provision for u.s. federal and state income taxes has been made in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. further, a determination of the unrecognized deferred tax liability is not practicable.
any future distribution by way of dividend of these non-u.s. earnings may subject us to both u.s. federal and state income taxes, as adjusted for non-u.s. tax credits, and withholding taxes payable to various non-u.s. countries. such dividends may not be
114
subject to u.s. federal tax under the tcja and we will continue to monitor both federal and state interpretations, guidance and regulations concerning u.s. tax reform. we will continue to evaluate our indefinite reinvestment assertion in light of any further developments.
sab 118 has provided guidance for companies that have not completed their accounting for the income tax effects of the tcja in the period of enactment, allowing for a measurement period of up to one year after the enactment date to finalize the recording of the related tax impacts. as of december 31, 2017, we have not completed our accounting for the tax effects of the enactment of the tcja, however, we have made a reasonable estimate of the effects on our deferred tax balances and in relation to the transition tax. in other cases, we have not been able to make a reasonable estimate and will continue to analyze the tcja in order to finalize any related impacts within the measurement period. the fasb staff also provided additional guidance to address the accounting for the effects of the provisions related to the taxation of gilti, noting that companies should make an accounting policy election to recognize deferred taxes for temporary basis differences expected to reverse as gilti in future years or to include the tax expense in the year it is incurred. we have not completed our analysis of the effects of the gilti provisions and will further consider the accounting policy election within the measurement period as provided for under sab 118 (note 2).
as of december 31, 2017 and 2016, we have gross u.s. federal net operating loss carryforwards of $89 million and $59 million, respectively, and gross state and local net operating loss carryforwards of $353 million and $293 million, respectively. the increases for u.s federal and state and local net operating loss carryforwards is primarily due to acquisitions during 2017. the majority of the new additions are not expected to be realizable in future periods and have related valuation allowance. the remaining carryforwards are available to offset future taxable income until they begin to expire in 2019. in addition, as of december 31, 2017 and 2016, we have gross foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $253 million and $116 million, respectively. the majority of gross foreign net operating losses are not expected to be realizable in future periods and have related valuation allowances.

as of december 31, 2017 and 2016, the balance of unrecognized tax benefits which would, if recognized, affect our effective tax rate was $77 million and $76 million, respectively. it is reasonably possible, as a result of settlements of ongoing audits or statute of limitations expirations, unrecognized tax benefits could increase as much as $10 million and decrease as much as $39 million within the next twelve months. of the $115 million in unrecognized tax benefits as of december 31, 2017, $69 million is recorded as other non-current liabilities and $47 million is recorded as other current liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet.
we recognize interest accrued on income tax uncertainties and accrued penalties as a component of income tax expense. for the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, we recognized $1 million, $1 million and $12 million, respectively, of income tax benefit for interest and penalties. accrued interest and penalties were $35 million as of both december 31, 2017 and 2016. of the $35 million in accrued interest and penalties as of december 31, 2017, $25 million is recorded as other non-current liabilities and $10 million is recorded as other current liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet.
we or one of our subsidiaries files income tax returns in the u.s. federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdictions. the following table summarizes open tax years by major jurisdiction:
jurisdiction   open tax years u.s. federal      2014 - 2017

u.k.              2015 - 2017
netherlands       2012 - 2017
although the outcome of tax audits is always uncertain, we believe that adequate amounts of tax, including interest and penalties, have been provided for any adjustments expected to result from open tax years.

13.   clearing organizations we operate regulated central counterparty clearing houses for the settlement and clearance of derivative contracts. the clearing houses include ice clear europe, ice clear credit, ice clear u.s., ice clear canada, ice clear netherlands, ice clear singapore and ngx (referred to herein collectively as the "ice clearing houses").
•   ice clear europe performs the clearing and settlement for all futures and options contracts traded through ice futures europe and ice endex, for energy futures and options contracts trading through ice futures u.s., and for cds contracts submitted for clearing in europe.
•   ice clear credit performs the clearing and settlement for cds contracts submitted for clearing in north america.
•   ice clear u.s. performs the clearing and settlement of agricultural, metals, currencies and financial futures and options contracts traded through ice futures u.s.
•   ice clear canada performs the clearing and settlement for all futures and options contracts traded through ice futures canada.
•   ice clear netherlands offers clearing for dutch equity options.
•   ice clear singapore performs the clearing and settlement for all futures and options contracts traded through ice futures singapore.
•   ngx performs clearing and settlement for north american natural gas, electricity and oil markets and was acquired in december 2017 (note 3).
each of the ice clearing houses requires all clearing members or participants to maintain cash on deposit or pledge certain assets, which may include government obligations, non-government obligations, letters of credit or gold to guarantee performance of the clearing members' or participants' open positions. such amounts in total are known as "original margin." the ice clearing houses may make intraday original margin calls in circumstances where market conditions require additional protection. the daily profits and losses from and to the ice clearing houses due to the marking-to-market of open contracts is known as "variation margin." with the exception of ngx's physical natural gas and physical power products, the ice clearing houses mark all outstanding contracts to market, and therefore pay and collect variation margin, at least once daily, and in some cases multiple times throughout the day. for ngx's physical natural gas and power products, ngx marks all outstanding contracts to market daily, but only collects variation margin when a participant's open position falls outside a specified percentage of its pledged collateral. marking-to-market allows the ice clearing houses to identify any clearing members or participants that may be unable to satisfy the financial obligations resulting from changes in the prices of their open contracts before those financial obligations become exceptionally large and jeopardize the ability of the ice clearing houses to ensure financial performance of clearing members' or participants' open positions.
with the exception of ngx, each of the ice clearing houses requires that each clearing member make deposits into a fund known as a "guaranty fund," which is maintained by the relevant ice clearing house. these amounts serve to secure the obligations of a clearing member to the ice clearing house to which it has made the guaranty fund deposit and may be used to cover losses sustained by the respective ice clearing house in the event of a default of a clearing member. ngx maintains a guaranty fund utilizing a $100 million letter of credit that has been entered into with a major canadian chartered bank and backed by a default insurance policy underwritten by export development corporation, or edc, a canadian government agency. in event of a participant default, where a participant's collateral becomes depleted, any remaining shortfall would be covered by a draw down on the letter of credit following which ngx would pay the first $15 million in losses per its deductible and recover additional losses under the insurance policy up to $100 million. we have provided a parent guaranty of $100 million in favor of the major canadian chartered bank and we voluntarily reserved $100 million of our amended credit facility to backstop that parent guaranty (note 11).
we have contributed cash of $150 million, $50 million and $50 million to the guaranty funds of ice clear europe, ice clear credit and ice clear us, respectively, as of december 31, 2017, and such amounts are at risk and could be used in the event of a clearing member default where the amount of the defaulting clearing member's original margin and guaranty fund deposits are insufficient. we have also contributed $4 million in cash in total to the guaranty funds of ice clear canada, ice clear netherlands and ice clear singapore. the $254 million combined contributions to the guaranty funds as of december 31, 2017 and 2016 are included in long-term restricted cash and cash equivalents in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets (note 5).
for ice clear europe, if a futures and options clearing member's deposits are depleted and a default occurs, then a $100 million contribution made by us to the ice clear europe guaranty fund would be utilized after the available funds of the defaulting clearing member but before all other amounts within the guaranty fund. the $100 million is solely available in the event of an ice clear europe futures and options clearing member default. we have contributed $50 million to the ice clear europe cds guaranty fund and it would be utilized after the available funds of the defaulting cds clearing member but before all other amounts within the cds guaranty fund. the $50 million contribution to the ice clear u.s. guaranty fund and the $50 million contribution to the ice clear credit guaranty fund would be utilized after the available funds of the defaulting clearing member but before all other amounts within the guaranty fund.

each of the ice clearing houses has equal and offsetting claims to and from their respective clearing members or participants on opposite sides of each cleared contract. this arrangement allows the ice clearing houses to serve as the central financial counterparty on every cleared contract. each ice clearing house bears financial counterparty credit risk in the event that market movements create conditions that lead to its clearing members or participants failing to meet their financial obligations to that ice clearing house. accordingly, the ice clearing houses account for this central counterparty guarantee as a performance guarantee. given that each contract is margined and marked-to-market or settled at least once daily for each clearing member, or in the case of ngx, collateralized for each participant, the ice clearing houses' maximum estimated exposure for this guarantee, excluding the effects of original and variation margin requirements and mandatory deposits to the applicable guaranty fund by clearing members and collateral from its participants, is $78.3 billion as of december 31, 2017, which represents the maximum estimated value by the ice clearing houses of a hypothetical one day movement in pricing of the underlying unsettled contracts. this amount is based on calculations determined using proprietary risk management software that simulates gains and losses based on historical market prices, volatility and other factors present at that point in time for those particular unsettled contracts. future actual market price volatility could result in the exposure being significantly different than the amount estimated by the ice clearing houses. the net notional value of unsettled contracts was $2.6 trillion as of december 31, 2017. we performed calculations to determine the fair value of our counterparty performance guarantee taking into consideration factors such as daily settlement of contracts, margining and collateral requirements, other elements of our risk management program, historical evidence of default payments, and estimated probability of potential default payouts by the ice clearing houses. based on these analyses, the estimated counterparty performance guaranty liability was determined to be nominal and no liability was recorded as of december 31, 2017 and 2016.
the ice clearing houses seek to reduce their exposure through a risk management program that includes initial and ongoing financial standards for clearing member and participant admission and continued membership, original and variation margin and collateral requirements, and mandatory deposits to the guaranty fund. the amounts that the clearing members and participants are required to maintain in the original margin, guaranty fund and collateral accounts are determined by standardized parameters established by the risk management departments and reviewed by the risk committees and the boards of directors of each of the ice clearing houses and may fluctuate over time. as of december 31, 2017 and 2016, the ice clearing houses have received or have been pledged $92.6 billion and $95.7 billion, respectively, in cash and non-cash collateral in original margin and guaranty fund deposits to cover price movements of underlying contracts for both periods. with the exception of ngx, the ice clearing houses also have powers of assessment that provide the ability to collect additional funds from their clearing members to cover a defaulting member's remaining obligations up to the limits established under the respective rules of each ice clearing house.
should a particular clearing member or participant fail to deposit original margin, provide collateral, or fail to make a variation margin payment, when and as required, the relevant ice clearing house may liquidate or hedge the clearing member's or participant's open positions and use their original margin and guaranty fund deposits to make up any amount owed. in the event that those deposits are not sufficient to pay the amount owed in full, the ice clearing houses may utilize the respective guaranty fund deposits of their respective clearing members on a pro-rata basis for that purpose.
ngx administers the physical delivery of energy trading contracts. it has an equal and offsetting claim to and from their respective participants on opposite sides of the physically settled contract. the balance related to delivered but unpaid contracts is reflected as a delivery contract net receivable with an offsetting delivery contract net payable in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of december 31, 2017. ngx also records unsettled variation margin equal to the fair value of open energy trading contracts as of the balance sheet date. fair value is determined based on the difference between the trade price when the contract was entered into and the settlement price and is considered a level 2 fair value measurement. there is no impact to the consolidated statements of income for either delivery contracts receivable/payable and unsettled variation margin, as an equivalent amount is recognized in both the assets and liabilities.
in connection with the ngx physical delivery of the energy trading contracts, we maintain a daylight liquidity facility with a major canadian chartered bank in the amount of c$300 million. this facility may be used on settlement day to effect payments through the settlement accounts and it is intended to cover any intra-day shortfalls due to timing of payments and receipts. in the event that amounts drawn on settlement day do not clear to zero by the end of the day, we must repay the deficiency on the following business day. in addition, a c$20 million overdraft facility is in place with the same major canadian chartered bank and is available to repay the daylight liquidity facility on the business day following a settlement day.
as of december 31, 2017, our cash margin deposits, unsettled variation margin, guaranty fund and delivery contracts receivable/payable are as follows for the ice clearing houses (in millions):

we have recorded these cash deposits and amounts due in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as current assets with corresponding current liabilities to the clearing members of the relevant ice clearing house. all cash, securities and amounts due are available only to meet the financial obligations of that clearing member to the relevant ice clearing house. ice clear europe, ice clear credit, ice clear us, ice clear canada, ice clear netherlands, ice clear singapore and ngx are separate legal entities and are not subject to the liabilities of the other ice clearing houses or the obligations of the members of the other ice clearing houses. the amount of these cash deposits and amounts due may fluctuate due to the types of margin collateral choices available to clearing members and the change in the amount of deposits required. as a result, these assets and corresponding liabilities may vary significantly over time.
of the cash held by the ice clearing houses, as of december 31, 2017, $24.7 billion is secured in reverse repurchase agreements with primarily overnight maturities or direct investment in government securities. ice clear credit, as a systemically important financial market utility as designated by the financial stability oversight council, held $18.5 billion of its u.s. dollar cash in the guaranty fund and in original margin in cash accounts at the federal reserve bank of chicago as of december 31, 2017. during the quarter ended september 30, 2017, ice clear europe established a euro-denominated account at the de nederlandsche bank, or dnb, the central bank of the netherlands. this account provides the flexibility for ice clear europe to place euro-denominated cash margin securely at a national bank, in particular during periods when liquidity in the euro repo markets may temporarily become contracted, such as over a quarter or year end. as of december 31, 2017, ice clear europe held €3.3 billion ($4.0 billion based on the euro/u.s. dollar exchange rate of 1.2003 as of december 31, 2017) at dnb. the remaining cash deposits at the ice clearing houses are held in demand deposit accounts at large, highly rated financial institutions and direct investments primarily in u.s. treasury securities with original maturities of less than three months, plus certain u.s. treasury securities that extend beyond 12-months which we consider to be level 1 securities. the carrying value of these securities approximates their fair value due to the short-term nature of the instruments and repurchase agreements.
of the $22.8 billion of ice clear europe cash deposits as of december 31, 2017, which are primarily held in u.s. dollars, euros and pounds sterling, $18.5 billion relates to futures and options products and $4.3 billion relates to cleared otc european cds instruments. ice clear europe offers a separate clearing platform, risk model and risk pool for futures and options products that is distinct from those associated with cleared otc european cds instruments.
in addition to the cash deposits for original margin and the guaranty fund, the ice clearing houses have also received other assets from clearing members, which include government obligations, and may include other non-cash collateral such as certain agency and corporate debt, letters of credit or gold to mitigate credit risk. these assets are not reflected in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as the risks and rewards of these assets remain with the clearing members unless the ice clearing houses have sold or re-pledged the assets or in the event of a clearing member default, where the clearing member is no longer entitled to redeem the assets. any income, gain or loss accrues to the clearing member. for certain non-cash deposits, the ice clearing houses may impose discount or "haircut" rates to ensure adequate collateral levels to account for fluctuations in the market value of these deposits.
ngx requires participants to maintain cash or letters of credit to serve as collateral in the event of a participant default. the cash is maintained in a segregated bank account which is subject to a collateral agreement between the bank, the participant and ngx. per the agreement, ngx serves in the capacity of a trustee. the cash is held by ngx in trust for and on behalf of the participant; however, the cash remains the property of the participant and may only be accessed by ngx if there is evidence of default. the rules governing when the cash can be accessed by ngx are listed in the contracting party agreement, a standardized agreement signed by each

participant that also allows for netting of positive and negative exposure. since the cash is held in trust and remains the property of the participant, it is not included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet.

legal proceedings we are subject to legal proceedings, claims and investigations that arise in the ordinary course of our business. we establish accruals for those matters in circumstances when a loss contingency is considered probable and the related amount is reasonably estimable. any such accruals may be adjusted as circumstances change. assessments of losses are inherently subjective and involve unpredictable factors. we do not believe that the resolution of these legal matters, including the matters described below, will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity. it is possible, however, that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially and adversely affected by any developments relating to the legal proceedings, claims and investigations. the matters described below all relate to our operation of nyse. a range of possible losses related to the cases below cannot be reasonably estimated at this time, except as otherwise disclosed below.
in april 2014, new york stock exchange llc and nyse arca, inc., two of our subsidiaries, were among more than 40 financial institutions and exchanges named as defendants in four purported class action lawsuits filed in the u.s. district court for the southern district of new york, or the southern district, by the city of providence, rhode island, and other plaintiffs. in subsequent consolidated amended complaints, the plaintiffs asserted claims against the exchange defendants and barclays plc, or barclays, a subsidiary of which operates an alternative trading system known as barclays lx, on behalf of a class of "all public investors" who bought or sold stock from april 18, 2009 to the present on the u.s.-based equity exchanges operated by the exchange defendants or on barclays lx.
in august 2015, the court issued an opinion and order granting the defendants' motions to dismiss and dismissing the second amended complaint in its entirety with prejudice. the court held that the plaintiffs had failed to sufficiently state a claim against the defendants under sections 10(b) and 6(b) of the exchange act, and additionally that some of the claims against the exchanges were barred by the doctrine of self-regulatory organization immunity. in september 2015, the plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal of the dismissal of the lawsuit to the u.s. court of appeals for the second circuit, or the second circuit. the appeal was briefed and argued during 2016.
on december 19, 2017, the second circuit issued a decision vacating the dismissal and remanding the case to the district court for further proceedings. the second circuit held that the claims against the exchanges were not barred by the doctrine of self-regulatory organization immunity because (according to the second circuit) the exchanges were not carrying out regulatory functions while operating their markets and engaging in the challenged conduct at issue, and that the plaintiffs had adequately pleaded claims against the defendants under section 10(b) of the exchange act. the second circuit directed that, on remand, the district court should address and rule upon various other defenses raised by the exchanges in their motion to dismiss (which the district court did not address in its prior opinion and order). the exchanges disagree with various aspects of the second circuit's decision, and on january 31, 2018, filed a petition for rehearing and/or rehearing en banc.
in may 2014, three purported class action lawsuits were filed (and later amended) in the southern district by harold lanier against the securities exchanges that are participants in each of the three national market system data distribution plans - the consolidated tape association/consolidated quotation plan, the nasdaq utp plan, and the options price reporting authority, or the plans, - which are established under the exchange act and regulated by the sec. new york stock exchange llc, nyse arca, inc. and nyse american (nyse american was formerly known as nyse mkt), which are our subsidiaries, were among the defendants named in one or more of the suits, in which lanier claimed to sue on behalf of himself and all other similarly situated subscribers to the market data disseminated by the plans. lanier's allegations included that the exchange participants in the plans breached agreements with subscribers by disseminating market data in a discriminatory manner in that other "preferred" customers allegedly received their data faster than the proposed class. in september 2014, the defendants moved to dismiss the amended complaints, and in april 2015, the court issued an opinion and order granting the motion and dismissing the three lawsuits with prejudice. in september 2016, the second circuit entered an order affirming the dismissal of the lawsuits. in november 2016, the second circuit denied a petition filed by lanier, relating only to the lawsuit involving the options price reporting authority plan, seeking a rehearing by the panel of judges that decided the appeal or, in the alternative, for review by the full second circuit. lanier has not sought review of these matters by the u.s. supreme court and we consider this matter closed.
in december 2015, our subsidiaries new york stock exchange llc and nyse american received an inquiry from the enforcement staff of the new york regional office, or the staff, of the sec regarding a july 8, 2015 outage on the nyse markets, during which trading was suspended for approximately 3.5 hours in all symbols. the staff's investigation proceeded throughout 2016. on december 29, 2016, nyse received a wells notice stating that the staff have made a preliminary determination to recommend that the sec file an enforcement action in connection with how nyse responded on july 8, 2015 to the circumstances leading into the suspension of trading that day. nyse disputes the appropriateness of the proposed charges, believes there are substantial defenses, and has made a written submission to the staff in response to the wells notice setting forth such points. if the staff determines to maintain its recommendation contained in the wells notice, the commissioners of the sec will need to determine whether to authorize the filing of an enforcement action. for this matter and other sec investigative matters, we have recorded an aggregate of $14 million in expense accruals during the year ended december 31, 2017.

tax audits we are engaged in ongoing discussions and audits with taxing authorities on various tax matters, the resolutions of which are uncertain. currently, there are matters that may lead to assessments involving us or one of our subsidiaries, some of which may not be resolved for several years. based on currently available information, we believe we have adequately provided for any assessments that could result from those proceedings where it is more likely than not that we will be assessed. we continuously review our positions as these matters progress.
15.   pension and other benefit programs defined benefit pension plan we have a pension plan covering certain of our u.s. operations. the benefit accrual for the pension plan is frozen. retirement benefits are derived from a formula, which is based on length of service and compensation. based on this calculation, we may contribute to our pension plan to the extent such contributions may be deducted for income tax purposes.
during the year ended december 31, 2017, in connection with our de-risking strategy, we contributed $136 million to our pension plan. at the same time, we changed the plan's target allocation from 65% equity securities and 35% fixed income securities, to 5% equity securities and 95% fixed income securities. the fixed income allocation includes corporate bonds of companies from diversified industries and u.s. government bonds. as a result of this contribution and change in investment policy, we anticipate that there will be less need for pension contributions in future years, and the pension plan will not be required to pay the pension benefit guaranty corporation variable rate premiums. income is expected to be lower than it was in prior periods because the expected return on plan assets is lower.
during the years ended december 31, 2016 and 2015, we contributed $10 million each year to our pension plan. during the year ended december 31, 2018, we do not expect to make contributions to the pension plan. we will continue to monitor the plan's funded status, and we will consider modifying the plan's investment policy based on the actuarial and funding characteristics of the retirement plan, the demographic profile of plan participants, and our business objectives. our long-term objective is to keep the plan at or near full funding, while minimizing the risk inherent in pension plans.

we use a market-related value of plan assets when determining the estimated return on plan assets. gains/losses on plan assets are amortized over a four year period and accumulate in other comprehensive income. we recognize deferred gains and losses in future net income based on a "corridor" approach, where the corridor is equal to 10% of the greater of the benefit obligation or the market-related value of plan assets at the beginning of the year.

supplemental executive retirement plan we have a u.s. nonqualified supplemental executive retirement plan, or serp, which provides supplemental retirement benefits for certain employees. the future benefit accrual of the serp plan is frozen. to provide for the future payments of these benefits, we have purchased insurance on the lives of certain of the participants through company-owned policies. as of december 31, 2017 and 2016, the cash surrender value of such policies was $55 million and $53 million, respectively, and is included in other non-current assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. we also acquired a serp through the ngx acquisition. the following table provides a summary of the changes in the serp benefit obligations (in millions):

pension and serp plans assumptions the weighted-average assumptions used to develop the actuarial present value of the projected benefit obligation and net periodic pension/serp costs for years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 are set forth below:
year ended december 31,
2017                                                                                                  2016               2015
weighted-average discount rate for determining benefit obligations (pension/serp plans)   3.4%/3.1%          3.9%/3.4%          4.0%/3.4%
weighted-average discount rate for determining interest costs (pension/serp plans)        3.2%/2.6%          3.3%/2.5%          3.8%/3.2%
expected long-term rate of return on plan assets (pension/serp plans)                      6.5%/n/a           6.5%/n/a           6.5%/n/a rate of compensation increase                                                                   n/a                n/a                n/a the assumed discount rate reflects the market rates for high-quality corporate bonds currently available. the discount rate was determined by considering the average of pension yield curves constructed on a large population of high quality corporate bonds. the resulting discount rates reflect the matching of plan liability cash flows to yield curves. to develop the expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption, we considered the historical returns and the future expectations for returns for each asset class as well as the target asset allocation of the pension portfolio.
the determination of the interest cost component utilizes a full yield curve approach by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to each year's discounted cash flow.
post-retirement benefit plans our defined benefit plans provide certain health care and life insurance benefits for certain eligible retired nyse u.s. employees. these post-retirement benefit plans, which may be modified in accordance with their terms, are fully frozen. the net periodic post-retirement benefit costs were $5 million, $7 million and $8 million for the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. the defined benefit plans are unfunded and we currently do not expect to fund the post-retirement benefit plans. the weighted-average discount rate for determining the benefit obligation as of december 31, 2017 and 2016 is 3.4% and 3.9%, respectively. the weighted-average discount rate for determining the interest cost as of december 31, 2017 and 2016 is 3.2% and 3.3%, respectively. the following table shows the actuarial determined benefit obligation, interest costs, employee contributions, actuarial (gain) loss, benefits paid during the periods and the accrued employee benefits (in millions):

other benefit plans and defined contribution plans our u.s. employees are eligible to participate in 401(k) and profit sharing plans and our non-u.s. employees are eligible to participate in defined contribution pension plans. total contributions under the 401(k), profit sharing and defined contribution pension plans were $38 million, $31 million and $21 million for the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. no discretionary or profit sharing contributions were made during the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 or 2015.
16.   fair value measurements
124
our financial instruments consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, short-term and long-term restricted cash and cash equivalents, short-term and long-term investments, customer accounts receivable, margin deposits and guaranty funds, cost and equity method investments, short-term and long-term debt and certain other short-term assets and liabilities. the fair value of our financial instruments are measured based on a three-level hierarchy:
•   level 1 inputs - quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.
•   level 2 inputs - observable inputs other than level 1 inputs such as quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or inputs other than quoted prices that are directly observable.
•   level 3 inputs - unobservable inputs supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.
we use level 1 inputs to determine fair value. the level 1 assets consist of u.s. treasury and other foreign government securities, equity and other securities listed in active markets, and investments in publicly traded mutual funds held for the purpose of providing future payments of the serp and sesp plans.
financial assets and liabilities recorded in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of december 31, 2017 and 2016 are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the asset or liability's fair value measurement. financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of december 31, 2017 are as follows (in millions):
level 1   level 2        level 3                 total assets at fair value:
u.s. treasury and other foreign government securities      $734        $-             $-                   $734

financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of december 31, 2016 are as follows (in millions):
level 1   level 2        level 3                  total assets at fair value:

as of december 31, 2017, we held $734 million in u.s. treasury and other foreign government securities which are considered cash equivalents. of these securities, $534 million were recorded as short-term restricted cash and cash equivalents and $200 million were recorded as long-term restricted cash and cash equivalents in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of december 31, 2017. as of december 31, 2016, we held $500 million in u.s. treasury and other foreign government securities. of these securities, $350 million were recorded as short-term restricted cash and cash equivalents and $150 million were recorded as long-term restricted cash and cash equivalents in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of december 31, 2016. we account for the u.s. treasury securities held using the available-for-sale method.
the long-term investment in equity securities as of december 31, 2016 represents our investment in cetip, recorded at its fair value using its quoted market price. cetip was sold in march 2017 (note 6). mutual funds represent equity and fixed income mutual funds held for the purpose of providing future payments for the serp and sesp and are classified as available-for-sale securities (note 15).
we did not use level 3 inputs to determine the fair value of assets or liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of december 31, 2017 and 2016. we measure certain assets, such as intangible assets and cost and equity method investments, at fair value on a non-recurring basis. these assets are recognized at fair value if they are deemed to be impaired. as of december 31, 2017 and 2016, none of these assets were required to be recorded at fair value since no impairments were recorded. see note 13 for the fair value considerations related to our margin deposits, guaranty funds and delivery contracts receivable.
as of december 31, 2017, the fair value of our $495 million 2027 senior notes was $500 million, the fair value of our $1.24 billion 2025 senior notes was $1.32 billion, the fair value of our $791 million 2023 senior notes was $842 million, the fair value of our $495 million 2022 senior notes was $495 million, the fair value of our $1.24 billion 2020 senior notes was $1.26 billion, and the fair value of our $600 million 2018 senior notes was $601 million. the fair values of these fixed rate notes were estimated using quoted market prices for these instruments. the fair value of our commercial paper approximates the carrying value since the rates of
125
interest on this short-term debt approximate market rates as of december 31, 2017. excluding our cost and equity method investments, all other financial instruments are determined to approximate carrying value due to the short period of time to their maturities.
17.   segment reporting we operate two business segments: our trading and clearing segment and our data and listings segment. this presentation is reflective of how our chief operating decision maker reviews and operates our business. our trading and clearing segment comprises our transaction-based execution and clearing businesses. our data and listings segment comprises our subscription-based data services and securities listings businesses. our chief operating decision maker does not review total assets or statements of income below operating income by segments; therefore, such information is not presented below. our two segments do not engage in intersegment transactions.
certain prior year's segment expenses for the year ended december 31, 2016 have been reclassified to conform to our current year's segment financial statement presentation. this reclassification increased the operating expenses for the data and listings segment by $55 million, while decreasing the operating expenses for the trading and clearing segment by the same amount.
financial data for our business segments is as follows for the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 (in millions):

revenue from two clearing members of the trading and clearing segment comprised a combined $477 million or 22% of our trading and clearing revenues for the year ended december 31, 2017 and revenue from one clearing member of the trading and clearing segment comprised $221 million or 11% of our trading and clearing revenues for the year ended december 31, 2016. clearing members are primarily intermediaries and represent a broad range of principal trading firms. if a clearing member ceased its operations, we believe that the trading firms would continue to conduct transactions and would clear those transactions through another clearing member firm. no additional customers or clearing members accounted for more than 10% of our segment revenues or consolidated revenues for the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015.

basic earnings per common share is calculated using the weighted average common shares outstanding during the periods. the weighted average common shares outstanding decreased for the year ended december 31, 2017, from the prior year period, primarily due to stock repurchases during 2017 (note 11). the weighted average common shares outstanding increased for the year ended december 31, 2016, over the prior year period, primarily due to stock issued for the interactive data and trayport acquisitions, partially offset by stock repurchases. we issued 32.3 million shares of our common stock to interactive data stockholders and 12.6 million shares of our common stock to trayport stockholders, which are weighted to show these additional shares outstanding for periods after the respective acquisition dates (note 3).
common equivalent shares from stock options and restricted stock awards, using the treasury stock method, are included in the diluted per share calculations unless the effect of their inclusion would be antidilutive. during the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, 694,343, 724,918 and 836,405 outstanding stock options, respectively, were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per common share, because to do so would have had an antidilutive effect. as of december 31, 2017 and 2016, there were 88,930 and 110,265 restricted stock units, respectively, that were vested but have not been issued that are included in the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share. certain figures in the table above may not recalculate due to rounding.

item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements for many reasons. see the factors set forth under the heading "forward looking statements" at the beginning of part 1 of this annual report and in item 1(a) under the heading "risk factors." the following discussion is qualified in its entirety by, and should be read in conjunction with, the more detailed information contained in item 6 "selected financial data" and our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report.
overview we are a leading global operator of regulated exchanges, clearing houses and listings venues, and a provider of data services for commodity, fixed income and equity markets. we operate regulated marketplaces for listing, trading and clearing of a broad array of derivatives and securities contracts across major asset classes, including energy and agricultural commodities, interest rates, equities, equity derivatives, etfs, credit derivatives, bonds and currencies. we also offer end-to-end data services and solutions to support the trading, investment, risk management and connectivity needs of customers around the world across all major asset classes.
our exchanges include derivative exchanges in the u.s., u.k., eu, canada and singapore, and cash equities, equity options and bond exchanges in the u.s. we also operate otc markets for physical energy and cds trade execution. to serve global derivatives markets, we operate central counterparty clearing houses in the u.s., u.k., eu, canada and singapore. we offer a range of data services for global financial and commodity markets, including pricing and reference data, exchange data, analytics, feeds, desktops and connectivity solutions. through our markets, clearing houses, listings and market data services, we provide end-to-end solutions for our customers through liquid markets, benchmark products, access to capital markets, and related services to support their ability to manage risk and raise capital. our business is currently conducted as two reportable business segments, our trading and clearing segment and our data and listings segment, and the majority of our identifiable assets are located in the u.s. and u.k.
recent developments u.s. tax cuts and jobs act on december 22, 2017, the tax cuts and jobs act, or tcja, was signed into law. the tcja reduced the u.s. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective january 1, 2018. we are required to revalue our u.s. deferred tax assets and liabilities at the new federal corporate income tax rate as of the date of enactment of the tcja and to include the rate change effect in the tax provision for the period ended december 31, 2017. as a result, we recognized a $764 million deferred tax benefit based on a reasonable estimate of the deferred tax assets and liabilities as of december 22, 2017. this significantly reduced the effective tax rate for the period ended december 31, 2017 in comparison to the effective tax rates for the last two comparable periods. as part of u.s. international tax reform, the tcja imposes a transition tax on certain accumulated foreign earnings aggregated across all non-u.s. subsidiaries, net of foreign deficits. as we are in an aggregate net foreign deficit position for u.s. tax purposes, we are not liable for the transition tax. see "- consolidated income tax provision" below.
divestiture of trayport and the acquisitions of ngx and shorcan energy on december 11, 2015, we acquired 100% of trayport in a stock transaction. the total purchase price was $620 million, comprised of 12.6 million shares of our common stock. trayport is a software company that licenses its technology to serve exchanges, otc brokers and traders to facilitate electronic and hybrid trade execution primarily in the energy markets.
the cma undertook a review of our acquisition of trayport under the merger control laws of the u.k. in october 2016, the cma issued its findings and ordered a divestment of trayport to remedy what the cma determined to be a substantial lessening of competition. in november 2016, we filed an appeal with the u.k. competition appeal tribunal, or the cat, to challenge the cma's decision. in march 2017, the cat upheld the cma decision that we should divest trayport. following the cat's judgment, we asked for leave to appeal the cat's decision at the u.k. court of appeals. in may 2017, the u.k. court of appeals denied our request for leave to appeal and we were obligated to sell trayport by january 2018.

on december 14, 2017, we sold trayport to tmx group for £550 million ($733 million based on the pound sterling/u.s. dollar exchange rate of 1.3331 as of december 14, 2017). we recognized a net gain of $110 million on the divestiture of trayport, which was recorded as other income within our data and listings segment in the consolidated statements of income for the year ended december 31, 2017. the net gain is equal to the $733 million in gross proceeds received less the adjusted carrying value of trayport's net assets of $607 million (which is equal to the $531 million carrying value of trayport plus $76 million in accumulated other comprehensive loss from foreign currency translation) and less $16 million in costs to sell trayport.
the gross proceeds included a combination of £350 million ($466 million) in cash and £200 million ($267 million) in value relating to our acquisitions of ngx and shorcan energy, both wholly-owned subsidiaries of tmx group. trayport was included in our data and listings segment and ngx and shorcan energy are included in our trading and clearing segment. ngx, headquartered in calgary, provides electronic execution, central counterparty clearing and data services to the north american natural gas, electricity and oil markets. shorcan energy offers brokerage services for the north american crude oil markets.
the functional currency of trayport was the pound sterling, as this was the currency in which trayport operated. the $620 million in trayport net assets were recorded on our december 11, 2015 opening balance sheet at a pound sterling/u.s. dollar exchange rate of 1.5218 (£407 million). because our consolidated financial statements are presented in u.s. dollars, we translated the trayport net assets into u.s. dollars at the exchange rates in effect at the end of each reporting period. therefore, increases or decreases in the value of the u.s. dollar against the pound sterling affected the value of the trayport balance sheet, with gains or losses included in the cumulative translation adjustment account, a component of equity. as a result of the decrease in the pound sterling/u.s. dollar exchange rate to 1.3331 as of december 14, 2017, the portion of our equity attributable to the trayport net assets in accumulated other comprehensive loss from foreign currency translation was $76 million. in connection with the divestiture on december 14, 2017, the $76 million in the trayport foreign currency translation loss was reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive loss and recognized as part of the net gain on the divestiture as discussed above.
as of june 30, 2017, we classified trayport as held for sale and ceased depreciation and amortization of the property and equipment and other intangible assets. subsequent to its divestiture on december 14, 2017, there are no longer any trayport assets and liabilities classified as held for sale.
acquisition of bondpoint on january 2, 2018, we acquired 100% of bondpoint from virtu financial, inc. for $400 million in cash. bondpoint is a leading provider of electronic fixed income trading solutions for the buy-side and sell-side offering access to centralized liquidity and automated trade execution services through its ats and provides trading services to more than 500 financial services firms.
investment in euroclear on october 24, 2017, we acquired a 4.7% stake in euroclear for €275 million in cash ($327 million based on the euro/u.s. dollar exchange rate of 1.1903 as of october 24, 2017). during december 2017, we reached an agreement to buy an additional 5.1% stake in euroclear for €243 million in cash ($292 million based on the euro/u.s. dollar exchange rate of 1.2003 as of december 31, 2017) and expect to receive necessary regulatory approval during the first quarter of 2018. upon closing, we will own a 9.8% stake in euroclear for a total investment of €518 million ($619 million based on the exchange rates above). euroclear is a leading provider of post-trade services, including settlement, central securities depositories and related services for cross-border transactions across asset classes.
acquisition of global research division's index business from bofaml on october 20, 2017, we acquired bofaml's global research division's index business. bofaml indices are the second largest group of fixed income indices as measured by aum globally. the aum benchmarked against our combined fixed income indices is nearly $1 trillion, and the indices have been re-branded as the ice bofaml indices.
purchase of minority interests during june 2017, we purchased both n.v. nederlandse gasunie's, or gasunie, 21% minority ownership interest in ice endex and abn amro clearing bank n.v.'s, or abn amro clearing, 25% minority ownership interest in ice clear netherlands. subsequent to these acquisitions, we own 100% of ice endex and ice clear netherlands and will no longer include any non-controlling interest amounts for ice endex and ice clear netherlands in our consolidated financial statements. during the year ended december 31, 2017, we purchased 12.6% of the net profit sharing interest in our cds clearing subsidiaries from several non-ice limited partners and the remaining non-ice limited partners hold a 29.9% net profit sharing interest in our cds clearing subsidiaries as of december 31, 2017. see "- consolidated non-operating income (expense)" below.

divestiture of nyse governance services on june 1, 2017, we sold nyse governance services to marlin heritage, l.p. nyse governance services provides governance and compliance analytics and education solutions for organizations and their boards of directors through dynamic learning solutions. we recognized a net loss of $6 million on the divestiture of nyse governance services, which was recorded as amortization expense within our data and listings segment in the accompanying consolidated statements of income for the year ended december 31, 2017.
acquisition of tmx atrium on may 1, 2017, we acquired 100% of tmx atrium, a global extranet and wireless services business, from tmx group. tmx atrium provides low-latency access to markets and market data across 12 countries, more than 30 major trading venues, and ultra-low latency wireless connectivity to access markets and market data in the toronto, new jersey and chicago metro areas. the wireless assets consist of microwave and millimeter networks that transport market data and provide private bandwidth. tmx atrium is now part of ice data services and is being integrated with our connectivity services.
divestiture of interactive data managed solutions on march 31, 2017, we sold interactive data managed solutions, or idms, a unit of interactive data, to factset. idms is a managed solutions and portal provider for the global wealth management industry. there was no gain or loss recognized on the sale of idms.
cetip investment gain until march 29, 2017, we held a 12% ownership interest in cetip, which we classified as an available-for-sale long-term investment. on march 29, 2017, cetip and bm&fbovespa s.a. finalized a merger agreement. bm&fbovespa s.a., which changed its name to b3 s.a. - brasil, bolsa, balcao, or b3, following the merger with cetip, is a stock exchange and operator of registration, clearing, custodial and settlement services for equities, financial securities, indices, rates, commodities and currencies and is located in são paulo, brazil. the merger valued our cetip investment at $500 million. we received the proceeds in cash and in b3 common stock.
the cash component was valued at $319 million, which was subject to brazilian capital gains tax of $28 million that was remitted to the brazilian tax authorities in march 2017. we received net cash proceeds in april 2017 of $286 million, which is net of a foreign exchange loss of $6 million that was incurred in april 2017. we received 29,623,756 b3 common shares valued at their quoted market price of $181 million. in april 2017, we sold the b3 common shares for net proceeds of $152 million, which is net of a capital gain tax of $26 million that was remitted to the brazilian tax authorities and further transaction expenses of $3 million that were incurred in april 2017. we used the $438 million in net cash and stock proceeds received from the merger and sale of b3 shares to pay down amounts outstanding under our u.s. dollar commercial paper program, or the commercial paper program, and for share repurchases.
the $500 million fair value of our investment in cetip included an accumulated unrealized gain of $176 million, based on the $324 million cost basis. in connection with the sale of our equity investment in cetip, the $176 million accumulated unrealized gain was reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income and was recognized in other income as a realized investment gain in the consolidated statement of income for the year ended december 31, 2017. refer to note 6 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes, which are included elsewhere in this annual report, for more information on the cetip investment gain.
acquisition of national stock exchange on january 31, 2017, we acquired 100% of national stock exchange, inc., now named nyse national. the acquisition gives the nyse group a fourth u.s. exchange license. nyse national is distinct from nyse group's three listings exchanges because nyse national will only be a trading venue and will not be a listings market. nyse group's three listings exchanges, nyse, nyse american and nyse arca, have unique market models designed for corporate and etf issuers. after closing the transaction, nyse national ceased operations on february 1, 2017. subject to regulatory approvals, nyse group anticipates re-launching operations on nyse national, inc. in the second quarter of 2018.

•   revenues, less transaction-based expenses, increased $130 million for the year ended december 31, 2017, from the comparable period in 2016. see "- trading and clearing segment" and "data and listings segment" below for a discussion of the significant changes in our revenues. the increase in revenues includes $22 million in unfavorable foreign exchange effects
43
arising from the strengthening u.s. dollar for the year ended december 31, 2017, from the comparable period in 2016. see item 7(a) "- quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk - foreign currency exchange rate risk" below for additional information on the impact of currency fluctuations.
•   revenues, less transaction-based expenses, increased $1.2 billion for the year ended december 31, 2016, from the comparable period in 2015, primarily due to our acquisitions of interactive data, trayport, securities evaluations and credit market analysis, and to a lesser extent, revenue increases in our exchange-related data services and brent crude and agricultural transaction and clearing. we recognized $1.1 billion in interactive data, trayport, securities evaluations and credit market analysis data services revenues for the year ended december 31, 2016, compared to $50 million in interactive data and trayport data services revenues for the year ended december 31, 2015, subsequent to their acquisitions in december 2015. the increase in revenues includes $59 million in unfavorable foreign exchange effects arising from the strengthening u.s. dollar for the year ended december 31, 2016, from the comparable period in 2015.
•   operating expenses decreased $82 million for the year ended december 31, 2017, from the comparable period in 2016. during the year ended december 31, 2016, we recorded a $33 million creditex customer relationship intangible asset impairment. see "- consolidated operating expenses" below for a discussion of the other significant changes in our operating expenses. the decrease in operating expenses includes $14 million in favorable foreign exchange effects arising from the strengthening u.s. dollar for the year ended december 31, 2017, from the comparable period in 2016.
•   operating expenses increased $744 million for the year ended december 31, 2016, from the comparable period in 2015, primarily due to increased operating expenses relating to interactive data, trayport, securities evaluations and credit market analysis and $33 million relating to the creditex customer relationship intangible asset impairment recorded in september 2016. excluding acquisition-related transaction and integration costs, we recognized $812 million in interactive data, trayport, securities evaluations and credit market analysis operating expenses for the year ended december 31, 2016, compared to $39 million in interactive data and trayport operating expenses for the year ended december 31, 2015, subsequent to their acquisitions in december 2015. these increases were partially offset by decreases in professional services expenses and selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended december 31, 2016, from the comparable period in 2015. also partially offsetting the operating expense increases were favorable foreign exchange effects of $40 million arising from the strengthening u.s. dollar for the year ended december 31, 2016, from the comparable period in 2015.
•   in connection with cetip's merger with bm&amp;fbovespa s.a., now b3, we recognized a $167 million net realized investment gain in other income, net for the year ended december 31, 2017. we also recognized a net gain of $110 million in connection with our divestiture of trayport in other income (expense), net for the year ended december 31, 2017. see "- recent developments" above.
•   the lower effective tax rates and income tax expense (benefit) for the years ended december 31, 2017 and 2015 are primarily due to the deferred tax benefit associated with future u.s. income tax rate reductions of $764 million for the year ended december 31, 2017 and the deferred tax benefit associated with future u.k. income tax rate reductions along with certain favorable settlements with various taxing authorities of $75 million for the year ended december 31, 2015. see "- consolidated income tax provision" below.
business environment and market trends our business environment has been characterized by industry consolidation and increasing competition among global markets for trading, clearing and listings; the globalization of exchanges, customers and competitors; market participants' rising demand for speed, data capacity and connectivity, which requires ongoing investment in technology; evolving and disparate regulation across multiple jurisdictions; and increasing focus on capital and cost efficiencies.
price volatility increases the need to hedge risk and creates demand among market participants for the exchange of risk through trading and clearing. market liquidity is one of the primary market attributes for attracting and maintaining customers and is an important indicator of a market's strength. in addition, the ability to evolve existing products to serve emerging needs, develop new products and respond to competitive dynamics in pricing, exclusivity and consolidation is important to our business. changes in these and other factors could cause our revenues to fluctuate from period to period and these fluctuations may affect the reliability of period to period comparisons of our revenues and operating results. for additional information regarding the factors that affect our results of operations, see item 1(a) "- risk factors" included elsewhere in this annual report.
the implementation of new laws or regulations or the uncertainty around potential changes may impact participation in our markets, or the demand for our clearing and data services either favorably or unfavorably. many of the recent changes with regard to global financial reform have emphasized the importance of transparent markets, centralized clearing and access to data, all of which are important aspects of our product offering. however, some of the proposed rules have yet to be implemented and some rules that have already been partially implemented on january 3, 2018 are being reconsidered. in addition, some of the global regulations have
44
not been fully harmonized and several of the mifid ii regulations are inconsistent with u.s. rules. as this is established, legislative and regulatory actions may change the way we conduct our business and may create uncertainty for market participants, which could affect trading volumes or demand for market data. as a result, it is difficult to predict all of the effects that the legislation and its implementing regulations will have on us. as discussed more fully in item 1 "- business - regulation" included elsewhere in this annual report, the implementation of mifid ii and other regulations may result in operational, regulatory and/or business risk.
in recent years, low interest rates and uncertainty in the financial markets continued to reflect the impact of a relatively slow or yet to occur global economic recovery. lower growth in asia and the eu may also continue to affect global financial markets. in addition, economic and regulatory uncertainty, coupled with periods of high market volatility around geopolitical events, low interest rates and low natural gas prices, has affected our clients' activities in recent years. the duration of these trends will determine the continued impact on our business across trading and listings. we have diversified our business so that we are not dependent on volatility or trading activity in any one asset class. in addition, we have increased our portion of non-transaction and clearing revenues from 21% in 2013 to 58% in 2017. this non-transaction revenue includes data services, listings and other revenues. we continue to focus on our strategy to grow each of our revenue streams, as well as on our company-wide expense reduction initiatives and our synergies in connection with our acquisitions in order to mitigate these uncertainties and to build on our growth opportunities by leveraging our proprietary data, clearing and markets.
many of the data products and services we sell are required for our clients' business operations regardless of market volatility or shifts in business profitability levels. we anticipate that there will continue to be growth in the financial information services sector driven by a number of global trends, including the following: increasing global regulatory demands; greater use of fair value accounting standards and reliance on independent valuations; greater emphasis on risk management; market fragmentation driven by regulatory changes; the move to passive investing and indexation; ongoing growth in the size and diversity of financial markets; increased electronification of fixed income and other less automated markets; the development of new data products; the demand for greater data capacity and connectivity; new entrants; and increasing demand for outsourced services by financial institutions. we contract with clients through data fixed-fee subscriptions, variable fees based on usage or a combination of fixed-fee subscription and usage-based fees. in addition, some of our data services generate one-time or non-recurring revenue, such as one-time purchases of historical data, set-up services or implementation fees.
segment reporting we operate two business segments: our trading and clearing segment and our data and listings segment. this presentation is reflective of how our chief operating decision maker reviews and operates our business. our trading and clearing segment comprises our transaction-based execution and clearing businesses. our data and listings segment comprises our subscription-based data services and securities listings businesses. our chief operating decision maker does not review total assets, intersegment revenues/expenses or statements of income below operating income by segments; therefore, such information is not presented below.
while revenues are allocated directly to segments, a significant portion of our operating expenses are not solely related to a specific segment because the expenses serve functions that are necessary for the operation of both segments. because these expenses do not relate to a single segment, we have employed a reasonable allocation method to allocate expenses between the segments for presentation purposes. we have elected to use a pro-rata revenue approach as the allocation method for the expenses that do not relate solely to one segment. further, precise allocation of expenses to specific revenue streams within these segments is not reasonably possible. accordingly, we did not allocate expenses to specific revenue streams within the segments.
certain prior year's segment expenses for 2016 have been reclassified to conform to our current year's segment financial statement presentation. this reclassification increased the operating expenses for the data and listings segment by $55 million, while decreasing the operating expenses for the trading and clearing segment by the same amount.

transaction and clearing revenues overview our transaction and clearing revenues are reported on a net basis, except for the nyse transaction-based expenses discussed below, and consist of fees collected from our derivatives, cash equities and equity options trading and derivatives clearing. in our derivatives markets, we earn transaction and clearing revenues from both counterparties to each contract that is traded and/or cleared, and in our equity and equity options markets, we receive trade execution fees as well as routing fees related to orders in our markets which are routed to other markets for execution.
rates per-contract are driven by the number of contracts or securities traded and the fees charged per contract, net of certain rebates. our per-contract transaction and clearing revenues will depend upon many factors, including, but not limited to, market conditions, transaction and clearing volume, product mix, pricing, applicable revenue sharing and market making agreements, and new product introductions. because transaction and clearing revenues are generally assessed on a per-contract basis, revenues and profitability fluctuate with changes in contract volume and due to product mix.
for the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, 20%, 19% and 20%, respectively, of our trading and clearing segment revenues, less transaction-based expenses, were billed in pounds sterling or euros. as the pound sterling or euro exchange rate changes, the u.s. equivalent of revenues denominated in foreign currencies changes accordingly. due to the weakening of the pound sterling and euro the last two years compared to the u.s. dollar, our trading and clearing segment revenues, less transaction-based expenses, were lower by $14 million for the year ended december 31, 2017 from the comparable period in 2016, and were lower by $35 million for the year ended december 31, 2016 from the comparable period in 2015. see item 7(a) "- quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk - foreign currency exchange rate risk" below for additional information on the impact of currency fluctuations.
our transaction and clearing fees are presented net of rebates. we recorded rebates of $749 million, $674 million and $563 million for the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. we offer rebates in certain of our markets primarily to support market liquidity and trading volume by providing qualified participants in those markets a discount to the applicable commission rate. such rebates are calculated based on volumes traded. the increase in the rebates is due primarily to an increase in the number of participants in the rebate programs offered on various contracts, an increase in our traded volume and an increase in the number of rebate programs.
commodities markets we operate global crude oil and refined oil futures markets, including the ice brent, ice wti and ice gasoil futures and options contracts, as well as over 500 refined oil futures products that relate to our benchmark futures contracts and other key price benchmarks. the ice brent crude contract is relied upon by a broad range of global market participants, including oil producing nations and multinational companies, to price and hedge their crude oil production and consumption. ice gasoil is a key refined
47
oil benchmark in europe and asia. total oil volume and revenues increased 14% and 12%, respectively, for the year ended december 31, 2017, from the comparable period in 2016, and increased 12% and 10%, respectively, for the year ended december 31, 2016, from the comparable period in 2015. crude oil revenues grew at a slightly lower rate due to customer and product mix.
in 2017, ice brent crude futures and options contracts were traded at record levels for the twenty-first consecutive year. ice brent crude futures and options volume increased 15% for the year ended december 31, 2017, from the comparable period in 2016, and increased 15% for the year ended december 31, 2016, from the comparable period in 2015. ice wti crude futures and options volume increased 14% for the year ended december 31, 2017, from the comparable period in 2016, and increased 16% for the year ended december 31, 2016, from the comparable period in 2015. ice brent crude and ice wti crude futures and options volume increased primarily due to increased oil price volatility related to shifting supply and demand dynamics globally; broader market volatility in oil products, equities and foreign exchange rates; acts of central governments; outcomes of elections; and uncertainty around the organization of petroleum exporting countries, or opec, policy.
our global natural gas futures and options volume declined 1% and revenues decreased 1% for the year ended december 31, 2017, from the comparable period in 2016, respectively, and volume declined 2% and revenues increased 4% for the year ended december 31, 2016, from the comparable period in 2015, respectively. global natural gas revenues decreased in 2017 primarily due to the impact of foreign currency translation in our european natural gas products. global natural gas volume declined in 2016 primarily due to lower price volatility related to high natural gas supplies but revenues increased due to geographic product mix.
total volume and revenues in our agricultural and metals futures and options markets decreased 7% and 5%, respectively, for the year ended december 31, 2017, from the comparable period in 2016, and increased 11% and 8%, respectively, for the year ended december 31, 2016, from the comparable period in 2015. the decreases in agricultural volume in 2017 were primarily driven by the reduced price volatility in 2017 compared to the higher price volatility in 2016. the increases in agricultural volume in 2016 were primarily driven by increased price volatility due to changing supply and demand expectations largely related to weather and production levels.
financial markets interest rates and other financial futures and options volume and revenues increased 15% and 2%, respectively, for the year ended december 31, 2017, from the comparable period in 2016, and volume increased 10% and revenues decreased 6%, respectively, for the year ended december 31, 2016, from the comparable period in 2015. interest rate futures and options volume increased in 2017 primarily due to expectations for heightened central bank activity during 2017, and volume increased in 2016 primarily due to uncertainty around central bank actions, economic data during 2016, and the u.k.'s decision to exit the eu. interest rate futures and options revenues increased less than traded volumes in 2017 and in 2016 primarily due to the impact of foreign currency translation and increased market making rebates that apply at higher volume levels.
cash equities handled volume decreased 17% for the year ended december 31, 2017, from the comparable period in 2016, primarily due to a reduction in u.s. equities market volatility during 2017 compared to the prior year. cash equities handled volume increased 6% for the year ended december 31, 2016, from the comparable period in 2015, primarily due to increased market volatility throughout 2016. cash equities revenues, net of transaction-based expenses, were $196 million, $223 million and $220 million for the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
equity options volume decreased 13% for the year ended december 31, 2017, compared to the same period in 2016, and decreased 5% for the year ended december 31, 2016, from the comparable period in 2015. equity options revenues, net of transaction-based expenses, were $90 million, $98 million and $112 million for the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. equity options volume and revenues decreased the last several years primarily due to lower u.s. equity market volatility in 2017 and the restructuring of the nyse american options business. while revenues declined the last several years, the overall financial contribution of equity options was consistent with the prior years due to the retention of a higher percentage of profits from nyse american options driven by our repurchase of the equity in the exchange from the minority shareholders.
cds clearing revenues were $113 million, $107 million and $100 million for the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. the notional value of cds cleared during the same periods were $11.5 trillion, $11.5 trillion and $11.9 trillion, respectively. buy-side participation at our u.s. cds clearing house, ice clear credit, reached record levels in terms of number of participants and notional cleared due to increased participation from both u.s. and european buy-side customers due to greater regulatory certainty, the breadth of products offered, and cost efficient margining in the u.s. relative to europe.
cds trade execution revenues were $27 million, $36 million and $49 million for the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. cds trading remains muted due to financial reform and lower volatility in corporate credit markets. the
48
decrease in the cds trade execution revenues for the year ended december 31, 2017 is also impacted by the sale and discontinuance of our u.s. and u.k. cds voice brokerage operations in the third quarter of 2016.
other revenues other revenues primarily include interest income on certain clearing margin deposits, regulatory penalties and fines, fees for use of our facilities, regulatory fees charged to member organizations of our u.s. securities exchanges, designated market maker service fees, exchange membership fees and agricultural grading and certification fees. the increase in other revenues for the year ended december 31, 2017, from the comparable period in 2016, is primarily due to a $6 million breakup fee received in the third quarter of 2017 related to the termination of the derivatives clearing agreement with euronext, under which ice clear netherlands was to provide clearing of euronext's financial and commodity derivatives.

open interest is the aggregate number of contracts (long or short) that clearing members hold either for their own account or on behalf of their clients. open interest refers to the total number of contracts that are currently open - in other words, contracts that have been traded but not yet liquidated by either an offsetting trade, exercise, expiration or assignment. open interest is also a measure of the future activity remaining to be closed out in terms of the number of contracts that members and their clients continue to hold in the particular contract and by the number of contracts held for each contract month listed by the exchange. the following charts and table presents our year-end open interest for our futures and options contracts (in thousands, except for

for nyse cash equities, market share declined during 2017 due to historically low volatility driving more trading to off-exchange trading venues, particularly dark pools. for nyse equity options, market share decreased due to a strategic focus on maximizing revenues in an extremely competitive environment.
transaction-based expenses our equities and equity options markets pay fees to the sec pursuant to section 31 of the exchange act. section 31 fees are recorded on a gross basis as a component of transaction and clearing fee revenue. these section 31 fees are designed to recover the government's costs of supervising and regulating the securities markets and securities professionals. we, in turn, collect activity assessment fees, which are included in transaction and clearing revenues in our consolidated statements of income, from member organizations clearing or settling trades on the equities and options exchanges and recognize these amounts when invoiced. the activity assessment fees are designed so that they are equal to the section 31 fees that are included in transaction-based expenses in our consolidated statements of income. as a result, activity assessment fees and the corresponding section 31 fees do not have an impact on our net income. activity assessment fees received are included in cash at the time of receipt and, as required by law, the amount due to the sec is remitted semi-annually and recorded as an accrued liability until paid. as of december 31, 2017, the accrued liability related to the un-remitted sec section 31 fees was $128 million.
we also incur liquidity payments made to cash and options trading customers and routing charges made to other exchanges that are included in transaction-based expenses. we incur routing charges when we do not have the best bid or offer in the market

for a security that a customer is trying to buy or sell on one of our securities exchanges. in that case, we route the customer's order to the external market center that displays the best bid or offer. the external market center charges us a fee per share (denominated in tenths of a cent per share) for routing to its system. we record routing charges on a gross basis as a component of transaction and clearing fee revenue.
operating expenses, operating income and operating margin our trading and clearing segment operating expenses decreased $46 million for the year ended december 31, 2017, from the comparable period in 2016, and decreased $90 million for the year ended december 31, 2016, from the comparable period in 2015 (with the 2016 decrease being partially offset by the $33 million creditex customer relationship intangible asset impairment expense recorded in september 2016). see "- consolidated operating expenses" below for a discussion of the significant changes in our operating expenses.
our trading and clearing segment operating income increased $72 million for the year ended december 31, 2017, from the comparable period in 2016, and increased $130 million for the year ended december 31, 2016, from the comparable period in 2015. trading and clearing segment operating margins were 63%, 61% and 56% for the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. the operating income and operating margin increases the last two years were driven by the revenue increases discussed above and operating expense decreases discussed below.

the data and listings segment represents subscription-based, or recurring, revenues from data services and listings services offered across our trading and clearing businesses and ice data services. through ice data services, we generate revenues from a range of market data services, including the dissemination of our exchange and evaluated pricing data and analytics, desktops, connectivity and market data. through nyse, nyse american and nyse arca, we generate listings revenue related to the provision of listings services for public companies and etfs, and related corporate actions for listed companies.
for the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, 10%, 12% and 4%, respectively, of our data and listings segment revenues were billed in pounds sterling or euros (all relating to our data services revenues). as the pound sterling or euro exchange rate changes, the u.s. equivalent of revenues denominated in foreign currencies changes accordingly. due to the weakening of the pound sterling and euro the last two years compared to the u.s. dollar, our data services revenues were lower by $8 million for the year ended december 31, 2017 from the comparable period in 2016, and were lower by $24 million for the year ended december 31, 2016 from the comparable period in 2015.
data services revenues our pricing and analytics services consist of an extensive set of independent evaluated pricing services focused primarily on fixed income and international equity securities, valuation services, reference data, market data, end of day pricing, fixed income, equity portfolio analytics and risk management analytics. we also serve as an administrator of regulated benchmarks. our index services offer a range of products across fixed income, energy, equities, etfs and other asset classes to provide the methodology, pricing and licensing of indices and benchmarks.
our exchange data revenues primarily represent subscription fees for the provision of our market data that is created from activity on our exchanges, which is driven by the products and technology we develop to deliver real-time views of markets and related information. in our derivatives markets, exchange data revenues relate to subscription fees charged for customer and license access from third party data vendors, or quote vendors such as thomson reuters corporation and bloomberg, and from end users, as well as view-only data access, direct access services, terminal access, daily indices, forward curves, and end of day reports.
we also earn exchange data revenues relating to our cash equity and options markets, and related data services. we collect cash trading market data fees principally for consortium-based data products and, to a lesser extent, for nyse proprietary data
53
products. consortium-based data fees are determined by the securities industry plans and are charged to vendors based on their redistribution of data. consortium-based data revenues (net of administrative costs) are distributed to participating securities markets on the basis of a formula set by the sec under regulation nms. last trade prices and quotes in nyse-listed, nyse american-listed, and nyse arca-listed securities are disseminated through "tape a" and "tape b," which constitute the majority of our revenues from consortium-based market data revenues.
our desktop and connectivity services comprise technology-based information platforms, feeds and connectivity solutions. these include trading applications, desktop solutions, data feeds and infrastructure to support trading, voice brokers and investment functions. our desktop and web-based applications deliver real-time market information, analytical and decision support tools to support trading and investment decisions. through our consolidated feeds, clients receive market data from global exchanges, trading venues, news and data sources for exchange-traded and otc markets. our services offer clients a secure, resilient, private multi-participant network that provides access to global exchanges and content service providers. our infrastructure managed services solution also offers colocation space, direct exchange access, proximity hosting and support services that enable access to real-time exchange data, and facilitates low latency, secure electronic market access.
our data services revenues increased the last two years primarily due to the strong retention rate of existing customers, the addition of new customers, increased purchases by existing customers, the development of new and enhanced products serving the need for an expanded range of data, regulatory compliance and analytics solutions, and our acquisitions of interactive data and trayport in december 2015 and of securities evaluations and credit market analysis in october 2016. these increases were partially offset by the impact of foreign currency translation and the divestitures of idms and trayport in our desktop and connectivity business. we recognized $1.1 billion in data services revenues for interactive data, trayport, securities evaluations and credit market analysis during the year ended december 31, 2016, compared to $50 million in data services revenues for interactive data and trayport from the comparable period in 2015, subsequent to their acquisitions dates.
organic annual subscription value organic annual subscription value, or asv, represents, at a point in time, the data services revenues subscribed for the succeeding twelve months. asv does not include new sales, contract terminations or price changes that may occur during that twelve-month period. asv also does not include certain data services revenue streams that are not subscription-based. asv is adjusted for material acquisitions, divestitures or discontinued businesses to provide an organic view of comparable performance on a year over year basis at a beginning of the quarter. thus, while it is an indicative forward-looking metric, it does not provide a growth forecast of the next twelve months of data services revenues.
as of december 31, 2017, asv was $1.8 billion, a 6% increase compared to asv of $1.7 billion as of december 31, 2016. underpinning this growth is strength in both our pricing and analytics business and our connectivity services.
listings revenues we recognize listings revenues in our securities markets from fees applicable to companies listed on our cash equities exchanges - original listing fees and annual listing fees. original listing fees consist of two components: initial listing fees and fees related to corporate actions. initial listing fees, subject to a minimum and maximum amount, are based on the number of shares that a company initially lists. initial listing fees are recognized as revenue on a straight-line basis over estimated service periods of nine years for nyse and five years for nyse arca and nyse american. u.s. companies pay annual fees based on the number of outstanding shares the company has and non-u.s. companies pay annual fees based on the number of outstanding shares the company has issued or held in the u.s. annual fees are recognized as revenue on a pro rata basis over the calendar year, and generally received as cash in the first quarter of the year.
in addition, we earn corporate actions-related listing fees in connection with actions involving the issuance of new shares, such as stock splits, rights issues and sales of additional securities, as well as mergers and acquisitions. corporate actions-related listing fees are recognized as revenue on a straight-line basis over estimated service periods of six years for nyse and three years for nyse arca and nyse american. unamortized balances are recorded as deferred revenue in our consolidated balance sheet.
operating expenses, operating income and operating margin our data and listings segment operating expenses decreased $36 million for the year ended december 31, 2017, from the comparable period in 2016, and increased $834 million for the year ended december 31, 2016, from the comparable period in 2015. the increase in 2016 primarily relates to $812 million in operating expenses recognized relating to interactive data, trayport, securities evaluations and credit market analysis for the year ended december 31, 2016, compared to $39 million in operating expenses recognized relating to interactive data, trayport, securities evaluations and credit market analysis for the comparable period in 2015 (both excluding acquisition-related transaction and integration costs). see "- consolidated operating
54
expenses" below for further details on the interactive data, trayport, securities evaluations and credit market analysis operating expenses and for a discussion of the other significant changes in our operating expenses.
our data and listings segment operating income increased $140 million for the year ended december 31, 2017, from the comparable period in 2016, and increased $287 million for the year ended december 31, 2016, from the comparable period in 2015. data and listings segment operating margins were 41%, 37% and 47% for the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. the operating income and operating margin increases in 2017 were driven by the revenue increases discussed above and operating expense decreases discussed below.
our data and listings segment adjusted operating expenses were $1.2 billion, $1.2 billion and $556 million for the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. our data and listings segment adjusted operating income was $1.3 billion, $1.2 billion and $720 million for the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. our data and listings segment adjusted operating margins were 51%, 49% and 56% for the years for the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. see "- non-gaap financial measures" below.
consolidated operating expenses the majority of our operating expenses do not vary directly with changes in our volume and revenues, except for certain technology and communication expenses and a portion of our compensation expense that is tied directly to our data sales or overall financial performance, as discussed below. the following chart and table present our consolidated operating expenses (dollars in millions):

we expect our operating expenses to increase in absolute terms in future periods in connection with our acquisitions and growth of our business, and to vary from year to year based on the type and level of our acquisitions, our integrations and other investments.
for the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, 14%, 18% and 12%, respectively, of our consolidated operating expenses were incurred in pounds sterling or euros. as the pound sterling or euro exchange rate changes, the u.s. equivalent of operating expenses denominated in foreign currencies changes accordingly. due to the weakening of the pound sterling and euro the last two years compared to the u.s. dollar, our consolidated operating expenses were lower by $14 million for the year ended december 31, 2017 from the comparable period in 2016, and were lower by $40 million for the year ended december 31, 2016 from the comparable period in 2015. see item 7(a) "- quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk - foreign currency exchange rate risk" below for additional information on the impact of currency fluctuations.
compensation and benefits expenses compensation and benefits expense is our most significant operating expense and includes non-capitalized employee wages, bonuses, non-cash or stock compensation, certain severance costs, benefits and employer taxes. the bonus component of our compensation and benefits expense is based on both our financial performance and the individual employee performance and the performance-based restricted stock compensation expense is also based on our financial performance. therefore, our compensation and benefits expense will vary year to year based on our financial performance and fluctuations in the number of employees.
as of december 31, 2017 we had 4,952 employees, compared to 5,631 employees as of december 31, 2016 and 5,549 employees as of december 31, 2015. our employee headcount decreased as of december 31, 2017 primarily due to the divestitures in 2017 of idms, trayport and nyse governance services, and employee terminations in connection with our integration of interactive data, partially offset by the acquisitions of ngx and tmx atrium in 2017. our employee headcount increased as of december 31, 2016 and 2015 primarily due to acquisitions of securities evaluations, credit market analysis, interactive data and trayport during 2016 and 2015, converting contractor roles to employees at nyse, and hiring for clearing, technology, regulation and compliance. see "- recent developments" above.
compensation and benefits expenses increased for the year ended december 31, 2016, from the comparable period in 2015, primarily due to the increases in our employee headcount. we recognized $342 million in compensation and benefits expenses relating to the interactive data, trayport, securities evaluations and credit market analysis acquisitions during the year ended december 31, 2016, compared to $17 million in compensation and benefits expenses relating to the interactive data and trayport acquisitions during the year ended december 31, 2015, subsequent to their acquisitions.
we recorded $17 million, $33 million and $20 million in nyse and interactive data employee severance costs during the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, with such costs included in the acquisition-related transaction and integration costs discussed below and primarily related to executive departures. in addition, we incurred non-acquisition-related employee severance costs of $21 million, $10 million and $3 million for the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
non-cash compensation expenses recognized in our consolidated financial statements for employee stock options and restricted stock were $135 million, $123 million and $111 million for the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. the increase in non-cash compensation expenses in 2017 primarily relates to the integration of the interactive data employees into the ice non-cash incentive plans, and the increase in 2016 primarily relates to a greater number of employees receiving non-cash awards due to the headcount increases discussed above.
professional services expenses this expense includes fees for consulting services received on strategic and technology initiatives, temporary labor, as well as regulatory, legal and accounting fees. this expense may fluctuate as a result of changes in consulting and technology services, temporary labor, and regulatory, accounting and legal proceedings.
professional services expenses decreased the last two years primarily due to the continued reduction in professional services and contractors at nyse. we eliminated or replaced certain contractor positions with full-time employees at nyse in 2016 and 2015. in addition, during the year ended december 31, 2016, we recorded a credit from a third party service provider related to fees charged during 2015, and we incurred lower legal fees during the year ended december 31, 2016, from the comparable period in 2015. legal fees, which are included in professional services expenses, primarily related to class action lawsuits in which nyse is a defendant. these decreases were partially offset by professional services expenses incurred by interactive data, trayport, securities evaluations and credit market analysis following their acquisitions in 2016 and 2015.
acquisition-related transaction and integration costs we incurred $36 million in acquisition-related transaction and integration costs during the year ended december 31, 2017, primarily relating to our integrations of interactive data, securities evaluations and credit market analysis and our acquisitions of
56
bondpoint, tmx atrium, bofaml indices and nyse national. of this amount, $11 million was primarily related to the acquisitions. we incurred $25 million for interactive data, securities evaluations and credit market analysis integration costs during the year ended december 31, 2017, primarily relating to employee and lease termination costs and professional services costs.
we incurred $80 million in acquisition-related transaction and integration costs during the year ended december 31, 2016, primarily relating to our integrations of interactive data and nyse, legal and professional fees related to the trayport cma review, our investment in merscorp holdings, inc., owner of mortgage electronic registrations systems, inc., or collectively mers, our acquisitions of securities evaluations and credit market analysis, and various other potential and discontinued acquisitions. of this amount, $41 million was primarily related to the acquisitions and other transaction costs. we incurred $39 million for interactive data and nyse integration costs during the year ended december 31, 2016, primarily relating to employee and lease termination costs and professional services costs. as of december 31, 2016, the integration of nyse has been completed and we will no longer include any nyse integration costs in the future.
we incurred $88 million in acquisition-related transaction and integration costs during the year ended december 31, 2015, primarily relating to our acquisitions of interactive data and trayport and the integration of nyse. of this amount, $46 million was primarily related to the acquisition costs. we incurred $42 million for nyse integration costs during the year ended december 31, 2015, primarily relating to employee and lease termination costs and professional services costs.
we expect to continue to explore and pursue various potential acquisitions and other strategic opportunities to strengthen our competitive position and support our growth. as a result, we may incur acquisition-related transaction costs in future periods. see "- non-gaap financial measures" below.
technology and communication expenses technology support services consist of costs for running our wholly-owned data centers, hosting costs paid to third-party data centers, and maintenance of our computer hardware and software required to support our technology. these costs are driven by system capacity, functionality and redundancy requirements. communication expenses consist of costs for network connection for our electronic platforms, telecommunications costs, and fees paid for access to external market data. this expense also includes licensing and other fee agreement expenses which may be impacted by growth in electronic contract volume, our capacity requirements, changes in the number of telecommunications hubs and connections with customers to access our electronic platforms directly.
technology and communications expenses increased the last two years primarily due to technology expenses incurred by interactive data, trayport, securities evaluations and credit market analysis following their acquisitions in 2016 and 2015. in addition, during the last two years, we incurred increased hardware and software support costs related to our trading and clearing platforms and our data services.
rent and occupancy expenses this expense consists of costs related to leased and owned property including rent, maintenance, real estate taxes, utilities and other related costs. we have significant operations located in and around atlanta, new york and london with smaller offices located throughout the world. see item 2 "- properties" above for additional information regarding our leased and owned property.
the increase in rent and occupancy expenses for the year ended december 31, 2016, from the comparable period in 2015, is primarily due to rent and occupancy expenses relating to interactive data, trayport, securities evaluations and credit market analysis subsequent to their acquisitions. excluding the impact of the acquisitions, rent and occupancy expenses decreased the last two years primarily due to reduced rent and occupancy costs realized due to the continued consolidation of our atlanta, new york and london office locations.
selling, general and administrative expenses this expense relates to expenses from marketing, advertising, public relations, insurance, bank service charges, dues and subscriptions, travel and entertainment, non-income taxes and other general and administrative costs.
selling, general and administrative expenses increased for the year ended december 31, 2017, from the comparable period in 2016, primarily due to the acquisitions of securities evaluations and credit market analysis and $14 million in accruals relating to ongoing investigations and inquiries during the year ended december 31, 2017. refer to note 14 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes, which are included elsewhere in this annual report, for more information on the ongoing investigations and inquiries. selling, general and administrative expenses increased for the year ended december 31, 2016, from the comparable period in 2015, primarily due to selling, general and administrative expenses incurred by interactive data, trayport, securities evaluations and credit market analysis following their acquisitions in 2016 and 2015. excluding the impact of the acquisitions, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased the last two years primarily due to the release of non-income tax-related reserves and lower marketing expenses.
57
depreciation and amortization expenses depreciation and amortization expense results from depreciation of long-lived assets such as buildings, leasehold improvements, planes, furniture, fixtures and equipment over their estimated useful lives. this expense includes amortization of intangible assets obtained in our acquisitions of businesses, as well as on various licensing agreements, over their estimated useful lives. intangible assets subject to amortization consist primarily of customer relationships, trading products with finite lives and technology. this expense also includes amortization of internally developed and purchased software over their estimated useful lives.
we recorded amortization expenses on the intangible assets acquired as part of our acquisitions, as well as on the other intangible assets, of $272 million, $323 million and $160 million for the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. the decrease in the amortization expenses recorded on the intangible assets for the year ended december 31, 2017, from the comparable period in 2016, is primarily due to a reduction in amortization expenses recorded on intangible assets which became fully amortized (primarily related to certain of the nyse intangible assets) and the divestitures of trayport and nyse governance services, partially offset by amortization expenses recorded on the securities evaluations, credit market analysis, ngx and tmx atrium intangible assets. the increase in the amortization expenses recorded on the intangible assets for the year ended december 31, 2016, from the comparable period in 2015, is primarily due to amortization expenses recorded on the interactive data, trayport, securities evaluations and credit market analysis intangible assets, following their acquisitions.
in addition, we recognized a net loss of $6 million on the sale of nyse governance services, which was recorded in depreciation and amortization expenses for the year ended december 31, 2017 (see "- recent developments" above), and we recorded an impairment of the creditex customer relationship intangible asset of $33 million, which was recorded in depreciation and amortization expenses for the year ended december 31, 2016. in august 2016, we sold certain of creditex's u.s. voice brokerage operations to tullett prebon. during the third quarter of 2016, we discontinued creditex's u.k. voice brokerage operations. we continue to operate creditex's electronically traded markets and systems, post-trade connectivity platforms and intellectual property. in connection with the divestiture of the voice brokerage business, it was determined that the carrying value of the cds creditex customer relationship intangible asset was not fully recoverable and an impairment of the asset was recorded in september 2016 for $33 million.
we recorded depreciation expenses on our fixed assets of $257 million, $254 million and $213 million for the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, with the increase in 2016 primarily relating to our acquisitions of interactive data, trayport, securities evaluations and credit market analysis.

interest expense increased for the year ended december 31, 2017, from the comparable period in 2016, primarily due to interest expense that we recognized relating to the $1.0 billion in senior notes issued in august 2017, partially offset by the repayment of $850 million of the 2.00% senior unsecured fixed rate notes due in october 2017, or the nyse notes, in september 2017. interest expense increased for the year ended december 31, 2016, from the comparable period in 2015, primarily due to the interest expense we recognized on the additional debt incurred to finance the interactive data acquisition in december 2015. see "- debt" below.
on december 14, 2017, we sold trayport to tmx group for £550 million ($733 million based on the pound sterling/u.s. dollar exchange rate of 1.3331 as of december 14, 2017). we recognized a net gain of $110 million on the divestiture of trayport, which was recorded as other income for the year ended december 31, 2017. see "- recent developments - divestiture of trayport and the acquisitions of ngx and shorcan energy" above.
in connection with cetip's merger with bm&fbovespa s.a., now b3, and its subsequent sale, we recognized a $176 million realized investment gain in other income for the year ended december 31, 2017 and we recognized $9 million in foreign exchange losses and transaction expenses in other expense for the year ended december 31, 2017. see "- recent developments - cetip

investment gain" above. we recognized dividend income received relating to our investment in cetip in other income, which was $5 million, $17 million and $16 million for the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. we no longer receive any dividends from cetip subsequent to its sale in the first quarter of 2017.
we account for our investments in mers and the options clearing corporation, or occ, as equity method investments. we recognized $36 million, $25 million and $6 million in equity income related to these investments during the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, as other income.
we incurred foreign currency transaction losses of $4 million, $1 million and $14 million for the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. this was primarily attributable to the fluctuations of the pound sterling and euro relative to the u.s. dollar. foreign currency gains and losses are recorded in other income (expense) and relate to the settlement of foreign currency assets, liabilities and payables that occur through our foreign operations that are received in non-functional currencies due to the increase or decrease in the period-end foreign currency exchange rates between periods. see item 7a "- quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk - foreign currency exchange rate risk" included elsewhere in this annual report for more information on these items.
we recognized interest income on our investments of $8 million, $3 million and $6 million during the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, which were recorded as other income. during the year ended december 31, 2015, we incurred $15 million in settlements and accruals for various outstanding legal matters (net of insurance proceeds), which was recorded in other expense.
for consolidated subsidiaries in which our ownership is less than 100%, and for which we have control over the assets, liabilities and management of the entity, the outside stockholders' interests are shown as non-controlling interest in our consolidated financial statements. as of december 31, 2016, non-controlling interest included those related to the operating results of our cds clearing subsidiaries in which non-ice limited partners held a 42.5% net profit sharing interest; ice endex in which gasunie held a 21% ownership interest; and ice clear netherlands in which abn amro clearing held a 25% ownership interest. for both ice endex and ice clear netherlands, in addition to the non-controlling interest reported in the consolidated statements of income, we reported redeemable non-controlling interest in the consolidated balance sheets which represents the minority interest redemption fair value for each company.
during june 2017, we purchased both gasunie's 21% minority ownership interest in ice endex and abn amro clearing's 25% minority ownership interest in ice clear netherlands. subsequent to these acquisitions, we own 100% of ice endex and ice clear netherlands and will no longer include any non-controlling interest amounts for ice endex and ice clear netherlands in our consolidated financial statements. during the year ended december 31, 2017, we purchased 12.6% of the net profit sharing interest in our cds clearing subsidiaries from several non-ice limited partners and the remaining non-ice limited partners hold a 29.9% net profit sharing interest in our cds clearing subsidiaries as of december 31, 2017.
consolidated income tax provision consolidated income tax expense (benefit) was $(25) million, $580 million and $358 million for the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. the change in consolidated income tax expense (benefit) between years is primarily due to the tax impact of changes in our pre-tax income and the changes in our effective tax rate each year. our effective tax rate was (1)%, 29% and 22% for the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. the effective tax rates for the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 are lower than the federal statutory rate primarily due to favorable u.s. and u.k. tax law changes and favorable foreign income tax rate differentials, partially offset by state income taxes. favorable foreign income tax rate differentials result primarily from lower income tax rates in the u.k. and various other lower tax jurisdictions as compared to the historical income tax rates in the u.s.
during the fourth quarter of 2015, the u.k. reduced their corporate income tax rate from 20% to 19% effective april 1, 2017 and to 18% effective april 1, 2020. during the third quarter of 2016, the u.k. further reduced their corporate income tax rate from 18% to 17% effective april 1, 2020. during december 2017, the tcja reduced the u.s. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective january 1, 2018. see "- recent developments" above. the reduction in u.s. and u.k. corporate income tax rates resulted in deferred tax benefits in the respective periods of enactment. the impact of the deferred tax benefits for the u.s. and u.k. corporate income tax rate reductions for the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 lowered the effective tax rates by 30%, 2% and 4%, respectively, and resulted in deferred tax benefits of $764 million, $34 million and $60 million, respectively.
the decrease in the effective tax rate for the year ended december 31, 2017, from the comparable period in 2016, is primarily due to the deferred tax benefit associated with the future u.s. income tax rate reduction and tax benefits associated with a divestiture in the second quarter of 2017, partially offset by the deferred tax benefit from the u.k. corporate income tax reduction in the third quarter of 2016, additional tax expense from an illinois corporate income tax rate increase enacted in the third quarter of 2017, and an income tax expense increase due to a relatively higher u.s. mix of income in 2017. the increase in the effective tax rate for the year ended december 31, 2016, from the comparable period in 2015, is primarily due to the tax impact of foreign versus u.s. based pre-tax income, lower deferred tax benefits associated with the future u.k. income tax rate reductions, and greater favorable settlements with

various taxing authorities in 2015, partially offset by a tax benefit from the early adoption of asu 2016-09 in 2016. see note 12 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes, which are included elsewhere is this annual report, for additional information on these tax items.
quarterly results of operations the following quarterly unaudited consolidated statements of income data has been prepared on substantially the same basis as our audited consolidated financial statements and includes all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for the fair presentation of our consolidated results of operations for the quarters presented. the historical results for any quarter do not necessarily indicate the results expected for any future period. this unaudited condensed consolidated quarterly data should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report. the following table sets forth quarterly consolidated statements of income data (in millions):

(1) the increase in the depreciation and amortization expenses for the three months ended september 30, 2016 is primarily due to the $33 million creditex customer relationship intangible asset impairment. see "- consolidated operating expenses" above.
(2) other income (expense), net for the three months ended december 31, 2017 includes a $110 million gain on our sale of trayport, and for the three months ended march 31, 2017, includes a $176 million realized investment gain in connection with the sale of our investment in cetip. see "- recent developments" above.
(3) the decrease in the income tax expenses for the three months ended december 31, 2017 is primarily due to a $764 million deferred tax benefit associated with future u.s. income tax reductions, the decrease for the three months ended june 30, 2017 is primarily due to the tax benefit associated with a divestiture, and the decrease for the three months ended september 30, 2016 is primarily due to a deferred tax benefit associated with future u.k. income tax rate reductions. see "- consolidated income tax provision" above.

liquidity and capital resources below are charts that reflect our capital allocation. the acquisition and integration costs in the chart below includes both the net cash paid for the acquisitions and the acquisition-related transaction and integration costs in each year.
we have financed our operations, growth and cash needs primarily through income from operations and borrowings under our various debt facilities. our principal capital requirements have been to fund capital expenditures, working capital, strategic acquisitions and investments, stock repurchases, dividends to our shareholders and the continued development of our technology platforms that support our businesses. we believe that our cash on hand and cash flows from operations will be sufficient to repay our outstanding debt as it matures. in the future, we may need to incur additional debt or issue additional equity securities, which we may be unable to do or to do on favorable terms. see "- future capital requirements" below.
our commercial paper program enables us to borrow efficiently at reasonable short-term interest rates and provides us with the flexibility to de-lever using our strong annual cash flows from operating activities whenever our leverage becomes elevated as a result of investment or acquisition activities. we reduced our outstanding commercial paper during the year ended december 31, 2017 by $409 million, primarily using net cash proceeds received from the sale of our investment in cetip, the sale of trayport and cash flows from operations, partially offset by acquisitions and investments we made in 2017. see "- debt" below.
see "- recent developments" above for a discussion of the acquisitions and investments that we made during the year ended december 31, 2017. these cash acquisitions and investments were funded from borrowing under our commercial paper program, cash flows from operations and a portion of the proceeds received from our divestitures during the year ended december 31, 2017.
upon maturity of old issuances of commercial paper and to the extent old issuances are not repaid by cash on hand, we are exposed to the rollover risk of not being able to issue new commercial paper. to mitigate the rollover risk, we maintain an undrawn back-stop bank revolving credit facility for an aggregate amount equaling at any time the amount issued under our commercial paper program. if we were not able to issue new commercial paper, we have the option of drawing on the back-stop revolving facility, however electing to do so would result in higher interest expense. see "- debt" below.
consolidated cash and cash equivalents were $535 million and $407 million as of december 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. we had $1.0 billion and $943 million in short-term and long-term restricted cash and cash equivalents as of december 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively and $432 million in long-term investments as of december 31, 2016 (relating to our investment in cetip, which was sold in 2017). we consider all short-term, highly-liquid investments with original maturity dates of three months or less to be cash equivalents. we classify all investments with original maturity dates in excess of three months but less than one year as short-term investments and all investments that we intend to hold for more than one year as long-term investments. cash and investments that are
61
not available for general use, either due to regulatory requirements or through restrictions in specific agreements, are classified as restricted cash and investments.
as of december 31, 2017, the amount of unrestricted cash held by our non-u.s. subsidiaries was $325 million. while we consider our non-u.s. earnings to be indefinitely reinvested overseas, if these cash balances are needed for our operations in the u.s., any repatriation by way of dividend may be subject to both u.s. federal and state income taxes, as adjusted for any non-u.s. tax credits. such dividends may not be subject to u.s. federal tax under the tcja and we will continue to monitor both federal and state interpretations, guidance and regulations concerning u.s. tax reform. however, we do not have any current needs or foreseeable future needs or other plans to repatriate cash by way of dividends from our non-u.s. subsidiaries. we will continue to evaluate our indefinite reinvestment assertion in light of any further u.s. tax reform developments.
our cash and cash equivalents and financial investments are managed as a global treasury portfolio of non-speculative financial instruments that are readily convertible into cash, such as overnight deposits, term deposits, money market funds, mutual funds for treasury investments, short duration fixed income investments and other money market instruments, thus ensuring high liquidity of financial assets. we may invest a portion of our cash in excess of short-term operating needs in investment-grade marketable debt securities, including government or government-sponsored agencies and corporate debt securities.
certain of these investments, with an original maturity of greater than three months, will be classified as available-for-sale in accordance with relevant accounting standards. available-for-sale investments are carried at their fair values with unrealized gains and losses, reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. realized gains and losses, and declines in value deemed to be other-than-temporary on available-for-sale investments, are recognized currently in earnings. we do not have any investments classified as held-to-maturity or trading.
during the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, we repurchased 14,966,616 shares, 902,920 shares and 14,343,845 shares, respectively, of our outstanding common stock at a cost of $949 million, $50 million and $660 million, respectively. the shares repurchased are held in treasury stock. these repurchases were completed on the open market and under our rule 10b5-1 trading plan. in connection with our acquisition of interactive data during the fourth quarter of 2015, we suspended our stock repurchase plan for a period of time. the timing and extent of future repurchases that are not made pursuant to a rule 10b5-1 trading plan will be at our discretion and will depend upon many conditions. our management periodically reviews whether or not to be active in repurchasing our stock. in making a determination regarding any stock repurchases, we consider multiple factors. the factors may include: overall stock market conditions, our common stock price movements, the remaining amount authorized for repurchases by our board of directors, the potential impact of a stock repurchase program on our corporate debt ratings, our expected free cash flow and working capital needs, our current and future planned strategic growth initiatives, and other potential uses of our cash and capital resources.
in august 2016, our board of directors approved an aggregate of $1.0 billion for future repurchases of our common stock with no fixed expiration date. in september 2017, our board of directors approved an aggregate of $1.2 billion for future repurchases of our common stock with no fixed expiration date that becomes effective as of january 1, 2018. we expect funding for any share repurchases to come from our operating cash flow or borrowings under our debt facilities or our commercial paper program.
repurchases may be made from time to time on the open market, through established trading plans, in privately-negotiated transactions or otherwise, in accordance with all applicable securities laws, rules and regulations. we have entered into a rule 10b5-1 trading plan, as authorized by our board of directors, to govern some or all of the repurchases of our shares of common stock. we may discontinue the stock repurchases at any time and may amend or terminate the rule 10b5-1 trading plan at any time. the approval of our board of directors for the share repurchases does not obligate us to acquire any particular amount of our common stock. in addition, our board of directors may increase or decrease the amount of capacity we have for repurchases from time to time.

the fasb has issued asu 2016-18, statement of cash flows: restricted cash, that requires entities to show the changes in the total of cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and cash equivalents in the statement of cash flows. as a result, entities will no longer present transfers between cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash and cash equivalents in the statement of cash flows. in the fourth quarter of 2017, we adopted asu 2016-18 and reclassified changes in restricted cash from cash flow provided by (used in) investing activities to the total change in beginning-of-year and end-of-year total amounts shown on the consolidated statements of cash flows for the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015. this new standard is a change in cash flow statement presentation only. refer to note 2 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes, which are included elsewhere in this annual report, for more information on the impact of the adoption of asu 2016-18.
operating activities net cash provided by operating activities primarily consists of net income adjusted for certain non-cash items, including depreciation and amortization and the effects of changes in working capital. fluctuations in net cash provided by operating activities are primarily attributable to increases and decreases in our net income between periods and due to fluctuations in working capital.
the $64 million decrease in net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december 31, 2017, from the comparable period in 2016, is primarily due to a $136 million contribution that was made to our pension plan in september 2017, compared to a $10 million contribution that was made to our pension plan in september 2016. the pension contribution in september 2017 allowed us to reach 99% funding of our pension obligation and allowed us to immunize the liability against future market fluctuations. for additional information on our pension plan, refer to note 15 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes, which are included elsewhere in this annual report.
the $838 million increase in net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december 31, 2016, from the comparable period in 2015, is primarily due to $393 million in cash provided by operating activities for interactive data, trayport, securities evaluations and credit market analysis for the year ended december 31, 2016, increase in the net income of our historical income statement excluding the acquisitions, and other fluctuations in working capital (including the impact of the increase in cash paid for income taxes in 2015).
investing activities consolidated net cash provided by (used in) investing activities for the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 primarily relates to cash paid for acquisitions, cash received from divestitures, net cash received from the sale of our investment in cetip, purchases of cost and equity method investments, proceeds from term deposits, and changes in the capital expenditures and capitalized software development costs.
we paid cash for acquisitions, net of cash acquired, of $423 million, $425 million and $3.8 billion, respectively, for the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, primarily relating to the ngx, shorcan energy, bofaml indices and tmx atrium acquisitions during the year ended december 31, 2017, the securities evaluations and credit market analysis acquisitions during the year ended december 31, 2016, and the interactive data acquisition during the year ended december 31, 2015. we received cash from our divestitures of $761 million during the year ended december 31, 2017, relating to the sales of trayport, idms and nyse governance services. we received net cash proceeds from the sale of our investment in cetip of $438 million. we made purchases of cost and equity method investments of $327 million, $70 million and $60 million during the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, relating to our investments in euroclear, mers and occ. see "- recent developments" above for more details on these acquisitions, divestitures and investments. we received proceeds from term deposits of $1.1 billion during the year ended december 31, 2015 relating to the repayments of outstanding debt.
capital expenditures were $220 million, $250 million and $190 million for the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and we had capitalized software development expenditures of $137 million, $115 million and $87 million for the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. the capital expenditures primarily relate to hardware purchases to continue the development and expansion of our electronic platforms, data services and clearing houses and leasehold improvements associated
63
with the new and renovated office spaces in atlanta, new york and london. the software development expenditures primarily relate to the continued development and expansion of our electronic trading platforms, data services and clearing houses.

amended credit facility we had previously entered into a $3.4 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility, or the credit facility, with a maturity date of november 13, 2020, pursuant to a credit agreement with wells fargo bank, n.a., or wells fargo, as administrative agent, issuing lender and swing-line lender, bank of america, n.a., as syndication agent, backup administrative agent and swing-line lender, and the lenders party thereto. on august 18, 2017, we agreed with the lenders to, amongst other items, extend the maturity date to august 18, 2022, herein referred to as the amended credit facility. the amended credit facility includes an option for us to propose an increase in the aggregate amount available for borrowing by up to $975 million, subject to the consent of the lenders funding the increase and certain other conditions.
64
other amendments within the amended credit facility include, but are not limited to, (i) eliminating the step-up in the commitment fee ratings-based grid that was scheduled to take effect in april 2019, (ii) removing ice europe parent limited as a party to the credit agreement, (iii) removing the guaranty by ice in respect of ice europe parent limited, (iv) increasing the maximum leverage ratio to 3.50:1.00, and (v) up to two times, increasing the maximum leverage ratio from 3.50:1.00 to 4.00:1.00 for a period of one year following a material acquisition.
no amounts were outstanding under the amended credit facility as of december 31, 2017. amounts borrowed under the amended credit facility may be prepaid at any time without premium or penalty. the amended credit facility provides for a $3.4 billion multi-currency revolving facility, with sub-limits for non-dollar borrowings and letters of credit and with a swing-line facility available on a same-day basis. of the $3.4 billion that is currently available for borrowing under the amended credit facility, $1.2 billion is required to back-stop the amount outstanding under our commercial paper program as of december 31, 2017 and $100 million is required to support certain subsidiary clearing house commitments. the amount required to back-stop the amounts outstanding under the commercial paper program will fluctuate as we increase or decrease our commercial paper borrowings. the remaining $2.1 billion available under the amended credit facility as of december 31, 2017 is available to us to use for working capital and general corporate purposes including, but not limited to, acting as a back-stop to future increases in the amounts outstanding under the commercial paper program.
borrowings under the amended credit facility will bear interest on the principal amount outstanding at either (a) libor plus an applicable margin rate or (b) a "base rate" plus an applicable margin rate; provided, however, that all loans denominated in a foreign currency will bear interest at libor plus an applicable margin rate. the "base rate" equals the higher of (i) wells fargo's prime rate, (ii) the federal funds rate plus 0.50%, or (iii) the one-month libor rate plus 1.00%. the applicable margin rate is based upon our public long-term debt ratings and ranges from 0.875% to 1.50% on libor borrowings and from 0.00% to 0.50% on base rate borrowings.
the amended credit facility includes an unutilized revolving credit commitment fee that is equal to the unused maximum revolver amount, multiplied by an applicable commitment fee rate and is payable in arrears on a quarterly basis. the applicable commitment fee rate ranges from 0.08% to 0.20% and is determined based on our long-term debt rating. as of december 31, 2017, the applicable commitment fee rate was 0.125% based on our current long-term debt ratings.
senior notes on august 17, 2017, we issued $1.0 billion in aggregate senior notes, including $500 million principal amount of 2.35% senior unsecured fixed rate notes due september 2022, or the 2022 senior notes, and $500 million principal amount of 3.10% senior unsecured fixed rate notes due september 2027, or the 2027 senior notes. we used the majority of the net proceeds from the 2022 senior notes and 2027 senior notes offering to fund the redemption of the nyse notes.
in november 2015, we issued $2.5 billion in aggregate senior notes, including $1.25 billion principal amount of 2.75% senior unsecured fixed rate notes due november 2020, or the 2020 senior notes, and $1.25 billion principal amount of 3.75% senior unsecured fixed rate notes due november 2025, or the 2025 senior notes. we used the net proceeds from the 2020 senior notes and 2025 senior notes offering, together with $1.6 billion of borrowings under our commercial paper program, to finance the $4.1 billion cash portion of the purchase price of the acquisition of interactive data.
commercial paper program we have entered into our commercial paper program, which is currently backed by the borrowing capacity available under the amended credit facility, equal to the amount of the commercial paper that is issued and outstanding at any given point in time. the effective interest rate of commercial paper issuances does not materially differ from short-term interest rates (such as usd libor). the fluctuation of these rates due to market conditions may impact our interest expense.
we repaid $409 million of net notes outstanding under the commercial paper program during the year ended december 31, 2017 primarily using net cash proceeds received from the sale of our investment in cetip and the sale of trayport. these repayments were partially offset by notes issued under the commercial paper program during the year ended december 31, 2017 for the cash acquisitions and investments and to repurchase our common stock. we used net proceeds from notes issued under the commercial paper program during the year ended december 31, 2016 to finance part of the cash purchase price of the securities evaluations and credit market analysis acquisitions and for general corporate purposes. we used net proceeds from notes issued under the commercial paper program during the year ended december 31, 2015 to finance part of the cash portion of the purchase price of the interactive data acquisition and to pay related fees and expenses, to repurchase our common stock, and for general corporate purposes. we repaid a portion of the amounts outstanding under the commercial paper program during the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 with cash flows from operations.
commercial paper notes of $1.2 billion with original maturities ranging from two to 64 days were outstanding as of december 31, 2017 under our commercial paper program. as of december 31, 2017, the weighted average interest rate on the $1.2 billion outstanding under our commercial paper program was 1.49% per annum, with a weighted average maturity of 18 days.
65
commercial paper notes of $1.6 billion with original maturities ranging from three to 68 days were outstanding as of december 31, 2016 under the commercial paper program. as of december 31, 2016, the weighted average interest rate on the $1.6 billion outstanding under the commercial paper program was 0.74% per annum, with a weighted average maturity of 18 days.
nyse notes the $850 million, 2.00% senior unsecured fixed rate nyse notes were due in october 2017. we redeemed the nyse notes in full in september 2017 using the majority of the proceeds from the 2022 senior notes and 2027 senior notes offering.

future capital requirements our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including the rate of growth across our trading and clearing and data and listings segments, strategic plans and acquisitions, available sources for financing activities, required technology and clearing initiatives, regulatory requirements, the timing and introduction of new products and enhancements to existing products, the geographic mix of our business, potential stock repurchases, and the continuing market acceptance of our electronic trading and clearing platforms. we currently expect to make aggregate capital expenditures (including operational and real estate capital expenditures) and to incur capitalized software development costs ranging between $300 million and $330 million for the year ended december 31, 2018, which we believe will support the enhancement of our technology, business integration and the continued growth of our businesses.
our board of directors has adopted a quarterly dividend declaration policy providing that the declaration of any dividends will be determined quarterly by the board of directors or the audit committee of the board of directors taking into account such factors as our evolving business model, prevailing business conditions and our financial results and capital requirements, without a predetermined annual net income payout ratio. during the year ended december 31, 2017, we paid cash dividends of $0.80 per share of our common stock in the aggregate, including 2017 quarterly dividends of $0.20 per share, for an aggregate payout of $476 million in 2017, which includes the payment of dividend equivalents on unvested employee restricted stock units. refer to note 11 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes, which are included elsewhere in this annual report, for details on the amounts of our quarterly dividend payouts for the last three years. for the first quarter of 2018, we announced a $0.24 per share dividend, which is a 20% increase over the prior dividend, which is payable on march 29, 2018 to shareholders of record as of march 15, 2018.
as of december 31, 2017, we had $6.1 billion in outstanding debt. we currently have a $3.4 billion amended credit facility. after factoring in the $1.2 billion required to back-stop the commercial paper program as of december 31, 2017 and $100 million that is required to support certain subsidiary clearing house commitments, $2.1 billion of our amended credit facility is currently available for general corporate purposes. the amended credit facility and our commercial paper program are currently the only significant agreements or arrangements that we have with third parties for liquidity and capital resources. in the event of any strategic acquisitions, mergers or investments, or if we are required to raise capital for any reason or desire to return capital to our stockholders, we may incur additional debt, issue additional equity to raise necessary funds, repurchase additional shares of our common stock or pay a dividend. however, we cannot provide assurance that such financing or transactions will be available or successful, or that the terms of such financing or transactions will be favorable to us. see "- debt" above.
non-gaap financial measures we use non-gaap measures internally to evaluate our performance and in making financial and operational decisions. when viewed in conjunction with our gaap results and the accompanying reconciliation, we believe that our presentation of these measures provides investors with greater transparency and a greater understanding of factors affecting our financial condition and results of operations than gaap measures alone. in addition, we believe the presentation of these measures is useful to investors for period-to-period comparison of results because the items described below as adjustments to gaap are not reflective of our core business performance. these financial measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative to, gaap financial measures and may be different from non-gaap measures used by other companies. we use these adjusted results because we believe they more clearly highlight trends in our business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on gaap financial measures, since these measures eliminate from our results specific financial items that have less bearing on our core operating performance. we strongly recommend that investors review the gaap financial measures included in this annual report, including our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto.
adjusted operating expenses, adjusted operating income, adjusted operating margin, adjusted net income attributable to ice common shareholders and adjusted earnings per share for the periods presented below are calculated by adding or subtracting the adjustments described below, which are not reflective of our cash operations and core business performance, and their related income tax effect and other tax adjustments (in millions, except for percentages and per share amounts):

acquisition-related transaction costs are included as part of our core business expenses, except for those that are directly related to the announcement, closing, financing or termination of a transaction. however, the acquisition-related transaction and integration costs relating to interactive data and nyse are included in non-gaap adjustments given the sizes of these acquisitions. as of june 30, 2016, the integration of nyse has been completed and we will no longer include any nyse integration costs as non-gaap
67
adjustments following this date. amortization of acquisition-related intangibles are included in non-gaap adjustments as excluding these non-cash expenses provides greater clarity regarding our financial strength and stability of cash operating results.
during the year ended december 31, 2017, we include as non-gaap adjustments the cetip realized investment gain and the foreign exchange loss and transaction expenses on the sale of our investment in cetip, as the sale of our investment in cetip is not part of our core business operations. during the year ended december 31, 2017, we include as non-gaap adjustments the net gain on the divestiture of trayport, the accruals relating to ongoing investigations and inquiries, and the nyse governance services net loss on its divestiture, as they are non-recurring items. during the year ended december 31, 2016, we include as non-gaap adjustments the creditex u.k. voice brokerage severance costs related to its discontinuance and the creditex customer relationship intangible asset impairment expense, as they are non-recurring items. during the year ended december 31, 2015, we include as non-gaap adjustments various litigation settlements and accruals and the interest expense on the senior notes and commercial paper we issued for the interactive data acquisition (from the issuance date of the new senior notes on november 24, 2015 and on the issuance dates of the commercial paper in early december 2015 to the acquisition date of interactive data on december 14, 2015), as they are not part of our core business operations or represent non-recurring items.
the income tax effects relating to the items above are included in non-gaap adjustments as well as deferred tax adjustments on acquisition-related intangibles and other tax adjustments. the tax items in non-gaap adjustments are either the tax impacts of the pre-tax non-gaap adjustments or are tax items as described below that are not in the normal course of business and are not indicative of our core business performance.
the income tax effects of the pre-tax non-gaap adjustments for the year ended december 31, 2017 include tax benefits associated with the divestiture of nyse governance services. the tax adjustments on u.s. tax reform mainly include the $764 million deferred tax benefit as a result of the enactment of tcja in the last quarter of 2017, which reduces the corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%. deferred tax adjustments on acquisition-related intangibles include the impact of u.s. state tax law and apportionment changes which resulted in deferred tax expense of $10 million, deferred tax expense of $12 million, and deferred tax benefits of $22 million for the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. in addition, deferred tax adjustments on acquisition-related intangibles include $34 million and $60 million deferred tax benefits due to u.k. corporate income tax rate reductions for the years ended december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. other tax adjustments for the year ended december 31, 2016 relate to a $15 million valuation allowance on singapore pre-acquisition net operating losses and other deferred tax assets and an $8 million deferred tax adjustment with respect to our occ equity method investment. other tax adjustments for the year ended december 31, 2015 represents a $7 million uncertain tax position relating to a retrospective foreign tax law change for a pre-acquisition period.

purchase obligations include our estimate of the minimum outstanding obligations under agreements to purchase goods or services that we believe are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum
68
quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancellable at any time without penalty.
we have excluded from the contractual obligations and commercial commitments table above $51.2 billion in cash margin deposits, guaranty funds and delivery contracts payable. clearing members of our clearing houses are required to deposit original margin and variation margin and to make deposits to a guaranty fund. the cash deposits made to these margin accounts and to the guaranty fund are recorded in the consolidated balance sheet as current assets with corresponding current liabilities to the clearing members that deposited them. ngx administers the physical delivery of energy trading contracts. it has an equal and offsetting claim to and from their respective participants on opposite sides of the physically settled contract. this balance is reflected as a delivery contract receivable with an offsetting delivery contract payable. see note 13 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes that are included elsewhere in this annual report for additional information on our clearing houses and the margin deposits, guaranty funds and delivery contracts payable.
we have also excluded unrecognized tax benefits, or utbs, from the contractual obligations and commercial commitments table above. as of december 31, 2017, our cumulative utbs were $115 million. interest and penalties related to utbs were $35 million as of december 31, 2017. we are under examination by various tax authorities. we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the periods of cash settlement because it is not possible to reasonably predict the amount of tax, interest and penalties, if any, that might be assessed by a tax authority or the timing of an assessment or payment. it is also not possible to reasonably predict whether or not the applicable statutes of limitations might expire without us being examined by any particular tax authority. see note 12 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes that are included elsewhere in this annual report for additional information on our utbs.
as of december 31, 2017, in connection with our acquisition of nyse, we have obligations related to our pension and other benefit programs. the date of payment under these obligations cannot be determined and have been excluded from the table above. see note 15 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes that are included elsewhere in this annual report for additional information on our pension and other benefit programs.
we have a 40% ownership in occ. under the occ's capital plan, the occ shareholders have committed to contribute up to $200 million in equity capital if certain capital thresholds are breached, including up to $80 million to be contributed by nyse, which has also been excluded from the table above.
new and recently adopted accounting pronouncements refer to note 2 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report for information on the new and recently adopted accounting pronouncements that are applicable to us.
critical accounting policies we have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations. the impact of, and any associated risks related to, these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout "- management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations." for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies, see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report. our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with u.s. gaap. the preparation of financial statements in conformity with these accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, at the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
we evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis, including those related to the accounting matters described below. we base our estimates and judgments on our historical experience and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances when we make these estimates and judgments. based on these factors, we make estimates and judgments about, among other things, the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from market prices or other independent sources and about the recognition and characterization of our revenues and expenses. the values and results based on these estimates and judgments could differ significantly under different assumptions or conditions and could change materially in the future.
we believe that the following critical accounting policies, among others, affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and could materially increase or decrease our reported results, assets and liabilities.
goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets
69
we have significant intangible assets related to goodwill and other acquired intangible assets. in connection with our acquisitions, assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at their estimated fair values. goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of our acquisitions over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired, including other identified intangible assets. we recognize specifically identifiable intangibles when a specific right or contract is acquired. our determination of the fair value of the intangible assets and whether or not these assets are impaired requires us to make significant judgments and requires us to use significant estimates and assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows. if we change our strategy or if market conditions shift, our judgments may change, which may result in adjustments to recorded asset balances. as of december 31, 2017, we had goodwill of $12.2 billion and net other intangible assets of $10.3 billion relating to our acquisitions and our purchase of trademarks and internet domain names from various third parties. we do not amortize goodwill or other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives. intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives.
in performing the purchase price allocation, we consider, among other factors, the intended future use of acquired assets, analysis of historical financial performance and estimates of future performance of the acquired business. at the acquisition date, a preliminary allocation of the purchase price is recorded based upon a preliminary valuation. we continue to review and validate estimates, assumptions and valuation methodologies underlying the preliminary valuation during the measurement period. accordingly, these estimates and assumptions are subject to change, which could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. the measurement period ends as soon as we receive the information about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date or we learn that more information is not obtainable, which usually does not exceed one year from the date of acquisition.
our goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment annually in our fiscal fourth quarter or more frequently if conditions exist that indicate that the value may be impaired. we test our goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level. these impairment evaluations are performed by comparing the carrying value of the goodwill of the reporting unit or other indefinite-lived intangibles to its estimated fair value. we allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the business combination. we have identified four reporting units: our futures reporting unit, our data and listings reporting unit, our cash equities reporting unit, and our cds reporting unit.
goodwill impairment testing consists of a two-step methodology. the initial step requires us to determine the fair value of each reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value, including goodwill and other intangible assets, of such reporting unit. if the fair value exceeds the carrying value, no impairment loss is recognized and the second step, which is a calculation of the impairment, is not performed. however, if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment charge is recorded equal to the extent that the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value. for annual goodwill impairment testing, we have the option to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill and other intangible assets. if we conclude that this is the case, we must perform the two-step methodology described above. otherwise, we can skip the two-step methodology and do not need to perform any further testing. for annual indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment testing, we also have the option to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible assets is less than its carrying amount.
application of the impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units, and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit. we have historically determined the fair value of our reporting units based on various valuation techniques, including discounted cash flow analysis and a multiple of earnings approach. in assessing whether goodwill and other intangible assets are impaired, we must make estimates and assumptions regarding future cash flows, long-term growth rates of our business, operating margins, discount rates, weighted average cost of capital and other factors to determine the fair value of our assets. these estimates and assumptions require management's judgment, and changes to these estimates and assumptions, as a result of changing economic and competitive conditions, could materially affect the determination of fair value and/or impairment. the cash flows employed in the discounted cash flow analysis are based on our most recent budgets and business plans and, when applicable, various growth rates have been assumed for years beyond the current business plan period. future events could cause us to conclude that indicators of impairment exist for goodwill or other intangible assets. impairment may result from, among other things, deterioration in the performance of our business, adverse market conditions, adverse changes in applicable laws and regulations, competition, or the sale or disposition of a reporting unit. any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. our impairment analysis has not resulted in any impairment of goodwill through december 31, 2017.
we are also required to evaluate other finite-lived intangible assets and property and equipment for impairment by first determining whether events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets to be held and used may not be recoverable. if impairment indicators are present, then an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows produced by these long-lived assets is compared to the carrying value of those assets to determine if the asset is recoverable. if an asset is not recoverable, the loss is measured as the difference between fair value and carrying value of the impaired asset. fair value of these assets is based on various valuation techniques, including discounted cash flow analysis.

in august 2016, we sold certain of creditex's u.s. voice brokerage operations to tullett prebon. during the third quarter of 2016, we discontinued creditex's u.k. voice brokerage operations. we continue to operate creditex's electronically traded markets and systems, post-trade connectivity platforms and intellectual property. after the sale and the discontinuance of the voice brokerage operations, it was determined that the carrying value of the cds creditex customer relationship intangible asset was not fully recoverable and an impairment of the asset was recorded in september 2016 for $33 million. the impairment was recorded as amortization expense in the consolidated statements of income for the year ended december 31, 2016.
income taxes we are subject to income taxes in the u.s., u.k. and other foreign jurisdictions where we operate. the determination of our provision for income taxes and related accruals, deferred tax assets and liabilities requires significant judgment, the use of estimates, and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. we recognize a current tax liability or tax asset for the estimated taxes payable or refundable on tax returns for the current year. we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of our assets and liabilities. we establish valuation allowances if we believe that it is more likely than not that some or all of our deferred tax assets will not be realized. deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using current enacted tax rates in effect for the years in which those temporary differences and carryforwards are expected to reverse.
sec staff accounting bulletin no. 118, or sab 118, has provided guidance for companies that have not completed their accounting for the income tax effects of the tcja in the period of enactment, allowing for a measurement period of up to one year after the enactment date to finalize the recording of the related tax impacts. as of december 31, 2017, we have not completed our accounting for the tax effects of the enactment of the tcja, however, we have made a reasonable estimate of the effects on our deferred tax balances and in relation to the transition tax. in other cases, we have not been able to make a reasonable estimate and will continue to analyze the tcja in order to finalize any related impacts within the measurement period. the fasb staff also provided additional guidance to address the accounting for the effects of the provisions related to the taxation of global intangible low-taxed income, or gilti, noting that companies should make an accounting policy election to recognize deferred taxes for temporary basis differences expected to reverse as gilti in future years or to include the tax expense in the year it is incurred. we have not completed our analysis of the effects of the gilti provisions and will further consider the accounting policy election within the measurement period as provided for under sab 118.
we do not recognize a tax benefit unless we conclude that it is more likely than not that the benefit will be sustained on audit by the taxing authority based solely on the technical merits of the associated tax position. if the recognition threshold is met, we recognize a tax benefit measured at the largest amount of the tax benefit that, in our judgment, is greater than 50 percent likely to be realized. we recognize accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain income tax positions as income tax expense in the consolidated statements of income.
we operate within multiple domestic and foreign taxing jurisdictions and are subject to audit in these jurisdictions by domestic and foreign tax authorities. these audits include questions regarding our tax filing positions, including the timing and amount of deductions taken and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. we record accruals for the estimated outcomes of these audits, and the accruals may change in the future due to new developments in each matter. at any point in time, many tax years are subject to or in the process of being audited by various taxing authorities. to the extent our estimates of settlements change or the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts recorded, such differences will impact the income tax provision in the period in which such determinations are made. our income tax expense includes changes in our estimated liability for exposures associated with our various tax filing positions. determining the income tax expense for these potential assessments requires management to make assumptions that are subject to factors such as proposed assessments by tax authorities, changes in facts and circumstances, issuance of new regulations, and resolution of tax audits.
we believe the judgments and estimates discussed above are reasonable. however, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material.
item 7 (a).     quantitative    and qualitative disclosures about market risk as a result of our operating and financing activities, we are exposed to market risks such as interest rate risk, foreign currency exchange rate risk and credit risk. we have implemented policies and procedures designed to measure, manage, monitor and report risk exposures, which are regularly reviewed by the appropriate management and supervisory bodies.
interest rate risk we have exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relating to our cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, short-term and long-term restricted cash and investments, and indebtedness. as of december 31, 2017 and 2016, our cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and short-term and long-term restricted cash and cash equivalents were $1.6 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively, of which $293 million and $272 million, respectively, were denominated in pounds sterling, euros or canadian
71
dollars. the remaining cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and short-term and long-term restricted cash and cash equivalents are denominated in u.s. dollars. we do not use our investment portfolio for trading or other speculative purposes. a hypothetical decrease in long-term interest rates to zero basis points would decrease annual pre-tax earnings by $8 million as of december 31, 2017, assuming no change in the amount or composition of our cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and short-term and long-term restricted cash and cash equivalents.
as of december 31, 2017, we had $6.1 billion in outstanding debt, of which $4.9 billion relates to our senior notes, which bear interest at fixed interest rates. the remaining amount outstanding of $1.2 billion relates to the commercial paper program, which bears interest at fluctuating rates and, therefore, subjects us to interest rate risk. a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in long-term interest rates relating to the amounts outstanding under the commercial paper program as of december 31, 2017 would decrease annual pre-tax earnings by $12 million, assuming no change in the volume or composition of our outstanding indebtedness and no hedging activity. see item 7 "- management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - debt" included elsewhere in this annual report.
the interest rates on our commercial paper program are currently evaluated based upon current maturities and market conditions. the weighted average interest rate on our commercial paper program increased from 0.74% as of december 31, 2016 to 1.49% as of december 31, 2017. the increase in the commercial paper program weighted average interest rate was primarily due to the decisions by the u.s. federal reserve in march 2017, in june 2017 and in december 2017 to increase the federal funds short-term interest rate by an aggregate 75 basis points to 1.50%. the federal reserve also signaled that they intend to continue to increase the federal fund short-term interest rate over the next several years, and if this occurs, this will continue to increase the weighted average interest rate on our commercial paper program.
foreign currency exchange rate risk as an international business, we are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk. we may experience gains or losses from foreign currency transactions in the future given that a significant part of our assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses are recorded in pounds sterling or euros. certain assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of foreign subsidiaries are denominated in the local functional currency of such subsidiaries. our exposure to foreign denominated earnings for the years ended december 31, 2017 and 2016 is presented by primary foreign currency in the following table (dollars in millions, except exchange rates):

we have a significant part of our assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses recorded in pounds sterling or euros. for the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, 15%, 15% and 15%, respectively, of our consolidated revenues, less transaction-based expenses, were denominated in pounds sterling or euros, and 14%, 18%, and 12%, respectively, of our consolidated operating expenses were denominated in pounds sterling or euros. as the pound sterling or euro exchange rate changes, the u.s. equivalent of revenues and expenses denominated in foreign currencies changes accordingly.
we have foreign currency transaction risk related to the settlement of foreign currency denominated assets, liabilities and payables that occur through our operations, which are received in or paid in pounds sterling or euros, due to the increase or decrease in the foreign currency exchange rates between periods. we had foreign currency transaction losses of $4 million, $1 million and $14 million for the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. the foreign currency transactions losses were primarily attributable to the fluctuations of the pound sterling and euro relative to the u.s. dollar. a 10% adverse change in the underlying foreign currency exchange rates as of december 31, 2017 would result in a foreign currency transaction loss of $3 million, assuming no change in the composition of the foreign currency denominated assets, liabilities and payables and assuming no hedging activity.
72
we entered into foreign currency hedging transactions during years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 as economic hedges to help mitigate a portion of our foreign exchange risk exposure and may enter into additional hedging transactions in the future to help mitigate our foreign exchange risk exposure. although we may enter into additional hedging transactions in the future to help mitigate our foreign exchange risk exposure, these hedging arrangements may not be effective, particularly in the event of imprecise forecasts of the levels of our non-u.s. denominated assets and liabilities.
we have foreign currency translation risk equal to our net investment in our foreign subsidiaries. the financial statements of these subsidiaries are translated into u.s. dollars using a current rate of exchange, with gains or losses included in the cumulative translation adjustment account, a component of equity. our exposure to the net investment in foreign currencies is presented by primary foreign currencies in the table below (in millions):

as of december 31, 2017 and 2016, the portion of our equity attributable to accumulated other comprehensive loss from foreign currency translation was $136 million and $345 million, respectively. as of december 31, 2017, we had net exposure of pounds sterling, canadian dollars and euros of £733 million ($990 million), c$628 million ($500 million), and €103 million ($124 million), respectively. based on these december 31, 2017 net currency positions, a hypothetical 10% decrease of pound sterling against u.s. dollar would negatively impact our equity by $99 million, a hypothetical 10% decrease of canadian dollar against u.s. dollar would negatively impact our equity by $50 million, and a hypothetical 10% decrease of euro against u.s. dollar would negatively impact our equity by $12 million. for the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, currency exchange rate differences had a positive/(negative) impact of $209 million, ($300 million) and ($58 million), respectively, on our consolidated equity. the increase for the year ended december 31, 2017 is primarily due to the increase in the pound sterling/u.s. dollar exchange rate to 1.3510 as of december 31, 2017 (from 1.2336 as of december 31, 2016) due to the strengthening pound sterling. the decrease for the year ended december 31, 2016 is primarily due to the decrease in the pound sterling/u.s. dollar exchange rate to 1.2336 as of december 31, 2016 (from 1.4868 as of december 31, 2015) due to the weakening pound sterling. the pound sterling decreased starting in june 2016 following the u.k. referendum that resulted in a vote for the u.k. to leave the eu. the future impact on our business relating to the u.k. leaving the eu and the corresponding regulatory changes are uncertain at this time, including future impacts on currency exchange rates.
credit risk we are exposed to credit risk in our operations in the event of a counterparty default. we limit our exposure to credit risk by rigorously selecting the counterparties with which we make our investments and execute agreements.
clearing house cash deposit risks our clearing houses hold material amounts of clearing member cash deposits which are held or invested primarily to provide security of capital while minimizing credit, market and liquidity risks. refer to note 13 to our consolidated financial statements, which are included elsewhere in this annual report, for more information about clearing house cash deposits and delivery contracts, which were $51.2 billion as of december 31, 2017. while we seek to achieve a reasonable rate of return which may generate interest income for our clearing members, we are primarily concerned with preservation of capital and managing the risks associated with these deposits. as the clearing houses may pass on interest revenues (minus costs) to the members, this could include negative or reduced yield due to market conditions. the following is a summary of the risks associated with these deposits and how these risks are mitigated.
credit risk when a clearing house has the ability to hold cash collateral at a central bank, the clearing house utilizes its access to the central bank system to minimize credit risk exposures. credit risk is monitored by using exposure limits reflecting a number of factors including ratings assigned by rating agencies, cds spreads and internal ratings, as well as the nature and maturity of transactions. we seek to substantially mitigate credit risk associated with investments by ensuring financial assets are placed with governments, well-capitalized financial institutions and other creditworthy counterparties.
73
an ongoing review is performed to evaluate changes in the financial status of counterparties. in addition to the intrinsic creditworthiness of counterparties, our policies require diversification of counterparties (banks, financial institutions, bond issuers and funds) to avoid a concentration of risk.
liquidity risk liquidity risk is the risk a clearing house may not be able to meet its payment obligations in the right currency, in the right place and the right time. to mitigate this risk, the clearing houses monitor liquidity requirements closely and maintain funds and assets in a manner which minimizes the risk of loss or delay in the access by the clearing house to such funds and assets. for example, holding funds with a central bank where possible or making only short term investments such as overnight reverse repurchase agreements serves to reduce liquidity risks.
interest rate risk interest rate risk is the risk that interest rates rise causing the value of purchased securities to decline. if we were required to sell securities prior to maturity, and interest rates had risen, the sale of the securities might be made at a loss relative to the latest market price. our clearing houses seek to manage this risk by making short term investments of cash deposits. for example, where possible and in accordance with regulatory requirements, the clearing houses invest cash pursuant to overnight reverse repurchase agreements or term reverse repurchase agreements with short dated maturities. in addition, the clearing house investment guidelines allow for direct purchases of high quality sovereign debt (for example, u.s. treasury securities) and supranational debt instruments (euro cash deposits only) with short dated maturities.
security issuer risk security issuer risk is the risk that an issuer of a security defaults on its payment when the security matures. this risk is mitigated by limiting allowable investments under the reverse repurchase agreements to high quality sovereign or government agency debt and limiting any direct investments to high quality sovereign debt instruments.
investment counterparty risk investment counterparty risk is the risk that a reverse repurchase agreement counterparty might become insolvent and, thus, fail to meet its obligations to our clearing houses. we mitigate this risk by only engaging in transactions with high credit quality reverse repurchase agreement counterparties and by limiting the acceptable collateral under the repurchase agreement to high quality issuers. when engaging in reverse repurchase agreements, our clearing houses take delivery of the underlying reverse repurchase securities in custody accounts under clearing house control. additionally, the securities purchased subject to reverse repurchase have a market value greater than the reverse repurchase amount. the typical haircut received for high quality sovereign debt is 2% of the reverse repurchase amount. thus, in the event that a reverse repurchase counterparty defaults on its obligation to repurchase the underlying reverse repurchase securities, our clearing house will have possession of a security with a value potentially greater than the reverse repurchase counterparty's obligation to the clearing house.
our clearing houses may use third party investment advisors who make investments subject to the guidelines provided to them by the clearing house. such investment advisors do not hold clearing member cash deposits or the underlying investments. clearing house property is held in custody accounts under clearing house control. clearing house property is held with credit worthy custodians including jpmorgan chase bank n.a., citibank n.a., bny mellon, bmo harris n.a. and euroclear bank brussels (for non-u.s. dollar deposits). each clearing house employs (or may employ) multiple investment advisors and custodians to ensure that in the event a single investment advisor or custodian is unable to fulfill its role, additional investment advisors or custodians are available as alternatives.
cross-currency margin deposit risk each of our clearing houses, pursuant to their rules, may permit posting of cross-currency collateral to satisfy margin requirements (for example, accepting margin deposits denominated in u.s. dollars to secure a euro margin obligation). the clearing houses mitigate the risk of a decline in currency value by applying a "haircut" to the currency posted as margin at a level sufficient to provide financial protection during periods of high currency volatility. cross-currency balances are marked-to-market on a daily basis. should the currency posted to satisfy margin requirements decline in value, the clearing member is required to increase its margin deposit on a same-day basis.
impact of inflation we have not been adversely affected by inflation as technological advances and competition have generally caused prices for the hardware and software that we use for our electronic platforms to remain constant. in the event of inflation, we believe that we will be able to pass on any price increases to our participants, as the prices that we charge are not governed by long-term contracts.

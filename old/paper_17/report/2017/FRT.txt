item 1a.    risk factors this annual report on form 10-k contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of section 27a of the securities act of 1933, section 21e of the exchange act and the private securities litigation reform act of 1995. also, documents that we "incorporate by reference" into this annual report on form 10-k, including documents that we subsequently file with the sec will contain forward-looking statements. when we refer to forward-looking statements or information, sometimes we use words such as "may," "will," "could," "should," "plans," "intends," "expects," "believes," "estimates," "anticipates" and "continues." in particular, the below risk factors describe forward-looking information. the risk factors describe risks that may affect these statements but are not all-inclusive, particularly with respect to possible future events. many things can happen that can cause actual results to be different from those we describe. these factors include, but are not limited to the following:
revenue from our properties may be reduced or limited if the retail operations of our tenants are not successful.
revenue from our properties depends primarily on the ability of our tenants to pay the full amount of rent and other charges due under their leases on a timely basis. some of our leases provide for the payment, in addition to base rent, of additional rent above the base amount according to a specified percentage of the gross sales generated by the tenants and generally provide for reimbursement of real estate taxes and expenses of operating the property. economic and/or competitive conditions may impact the success of our tenants' retail operations and therefore the amount of rent and expense reimbursements we receive from our tenants. while demand for our retail spaces has been sufficient to increase occupancy, there can be no assurance that this will continue. any reduction in our tenants' abilities to pay base rent, percentage rent, or other charges on a timely basis, including the filing by any of our tenants for bankruptcy protection, will adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. in the event of default by a tenant, we may experience delays and unexpected costs in enforcing our rights as landlord under lease terms, which may also adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
our net income depends on the success and continued presence of our "anchor" tenants.
our net income could be adversely affected in the event of a downturn in the business, or the bankruptcy or insolvency, of any anchor store or anchor tenant. anchor tenants generally occupy large amounts of square footage, pay a significant portion of the total rents at a property and contribute to the success of other tenants by drawing significant numbers of customers to a property. the closing of one or more anchor stores at a property could adversely affect that property and result in lease terminations by, or reductions in rent from, other tenants whose leases may permit termination or rent reduction in those circumstances or whose own operations may suffer as a result. we have been experiencing higher levels of anchor vacancy and expect this will persist over the next few years while we are actively releasing vacant space, and in some cases, redeveloping the shopping center. as of december 31, 2017, our anchor tenant space is 98.1% leased and 96.5% occupied. we also have seen an overall decrease in the number of tenants available to fill anchor spaces. therefore, tenant demand for certain of our anchor spaces may decrease and as a result, we may see an increase in vacancy and/or a decrease in rents for those spaces that could have a negative impact to our net income.
we may be unable to collect balances due from tenants that file for bankruptcy protection.
if a tenant or lease guarantor files for bankruptcy, we may not be able to collect all pre-petition amounts owed by that party. in addition, a tenant that files for bankruptcy protection may terminate our lease in which event we would have a general unsecured claim that would likely be for less than the full amount owed to us for the remainder of the lease term, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
we may experience difficulty or delay in renewing leases or re-leasing space.
we derive most of our revenue directly or indirectly from rent received from our tenants. we are subject to the risks that, upon expiration or termination of leases, whether by their terms, as a result of a tenant bankruptcy, general economic conditions or otherwise, leases for space in our properties may not be renewed, space may not be re-leased, or the terms of renewal or re-lease, including the cost of required renovations or concessions to tenants, may be less favorable than current lease terms and may include decreases in rental rates. as a result, our net income could be reduced.
the amount of debt we have and the restrictions imposed by that debt could adversely affect our business and financial condition.
as of december 31, 2017, we had approximately $3.3 billion of debt outstanding. of that outstanding debt, approximately $491.6 million was secured by all or a portion of 13 of our real estate projects and approximately $71.6 million represented capital lease obligations on four of our properties. as of december 31, 2017, 98.8% of our debt is fixed rate, which includes all of our property secured debt, our unsecured senior notes, our capital lease obligations, and our $275.0 million term loan, as the rate is effectively fixed by two interest rate swap agreements. our organizational documents do not limit the level or amount of
7
debt that we may incur. the amount of our debt outstanding from time to time could have important consequences to our shareholders. for example, it could:
•   require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our debt, thereby reducing funds available for operations, property acquisitions, redevelopments and other appropriate business opportunities that may arise in the future;
•   limit our ability to make distributions on our outstanding common shares and preferred shares;
•   make it difficult to satisfy our debt service requirements;
•   require us to dedicate increased amounts of our cash flow from operations to payments on debt upon refinancing or on our variable rate, unhedged debt, if interest rates rise;
•   limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the factors that affect the profitability of our business;
•   limit our ability to obtain any additional debt or equity financing we may need in the future for working capital, debt refinancing, capital expenditures, acquisitions, redevelopments or other general corporate purposes or to obtain such financing on favorable terms; and/or
•   limit our flexibility in conducting our business, which may place us at a disadvantage compared to competitors with less debt or debt with less restrictive terms.
our ability to make scheduled principal payments of, to pay interest on, or to refinance our indebtedness will depend primarily on our future performance, which to a certain extent is subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. there can be no assurance that our business will continue to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to service our debt or meet our other cash needs. if we are unable to generate this cash flow from our business, we may be required to refinance all or a portion of our existing debt, sell assets or obtain additional financing to meet our debt obligations and other cash needs, including the payment of dividends required to maintain our status as a real estate investment trust. we cannot assure you that any such refinancing, sale of assets or additional financing would be possible on terms that we would find acceptable.
we are obligated to comply with financial and other covenants pursuant to our debt obligations that could restrict our operating activities, and the failure to comply with such covenants could result in defaults that accelerate payment under our debt agreements.
our revolving credit facility, term loan and certain series of notes include financial covenants that may limit our operating activities in the future. we are also required to comply with additional covenants that include, among other things, provisions:
•   relating to the maintenance of property securing a mortgage;
•   restricting our ability to pledge assets or create liens;
•   restricting our ability to incur additional debt;
•   restricting our ability to amend or modify existing leases at properties securing a mortgage;
•   restricting our ability to enter into transactions with affiliates; and
•   restricting our ability to consolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of our assets.
as of december 31, 2017, we were in compliance with all of our default related financial covenants. if we were to breach any of our default related debt covenants, including the covenants listed above, and did not cure the breach within any applicable cure period, our lenders could require us to repay the debt immediately, and, if the debt is secured, could immediately begin proceedings to take possession of the property securing the loan. many of our debt arrangements, including our public notes, term loan and our revolving credit facility, are cross-defaulted, which means that the lenders under those debt arrangements can put us in default and require immediate repayment of their debt if we breach and fail to cure a default under certain of our other debt obligations. as a result, any default under our debt covenants could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, our results of operations, our ability to meet our obligations and the market value of our shares.
adverse changes in our credit rating could affect our borrowing capacity and borrowing terms our credit worthiness is rated by nationally recognized credit rating agencies. the credit ratings assigned are based on our operating performance, liquidity and leverage ratios, financial condition and prospects, and other factors viewed by the credit rating agencies as relevant to our industry and the economic outlook in general. our credit rating can affect the amount of capital we access, as well as the terms of certain existing and future financing we obtain. since we depend on debt financing to fund the growth of our business, an adverse change in our credit rating, including actual changes in outlook, or even the initiation of review of our credit rating that could result in an adverse change, could have a material adverse effect on us.
8
our development activities have inherent risks.
the ground-up development of improvements on real property, as opposed to the renovation and redevelopment of existing improvements, presents substantial risks. we generally do not look to acquire raw land for future development; however, we do intend to complete the development and construction of future phases of projects we already own, such as assembly row in somerville, massachusetts and pike & rose in north bethesda, maryland. we may undertake development of these and other projects on our own or bring in third parties if it is justifiable on a risk-adjusted return basis. we may also choose to delay completion of a project if market conditions do not allow an appropriate return. if conditions arise and we are not able or decide not to complete a project or if the expected cash flows of our project do not exceed the book value, an impairment of the project may be required. if additional phases of any of our existing projects or if any new projects are not successful, it may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
during 2017, construction continued on the development of phase ii at both assembly row and pike & rose, with portions of both projects opening during 2017. at santana row, we continue our on-going redevelopment efforts, including construction of an eight story 284,000 square foot office building, which will include an additional 29,000 square feet of retail space and 1,300 parking spaces. a further discussion of these projects, expected costs, and current status can be found in item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in the "outlook" subsection.
in addition to the risks associated with real estate investment in general, as described elsewhere and the specific risks above, the risks associated with our remaining development activities include:
•   contractor changes may delay the completion of development projects and increase overall costs;
•   significant time lag between commencement and stabilization subjects us to greater risks due to fluctuations in the general economy;
•   delivery of residential product (both rental units and for sale condominium units) into uncertain residential environments may result in lower rents or sale prices than underwritten or longer time periods to reach economic stabilization;
•   substantial amount of our investment is related to infrastructure, the value of which may be negatively impacted if we do not complete subsequent phases;
•   failure or inability to obtain construction or permanent financing on favorable terms;
•   failure or inability to obtain public funding from governmental agencies to fund infrastructure projects, including public funding in connection with our development at assembly row;
•   expenditure of money and time on projects that may never be completed;
•   failure or inability of partners to perform on hotel joint ventures;
•   the third-party developer of office or other buildings may not deliver or may encounter delays in delivering space as planned;
•   difficulty securing key anchor or other tenants may impact occupancy rates and projected revenue;
•   inability to achieve projected rental rates or anticipated pace of lease-up;
•   higher than estimated construction or operating costs, including labor and material costs; and
•   possible delay in completion of a project because of a number of factors, including weather, labor disruptions, construction delays or delays in receipt of zoning or other regulatory approvals, acts of terror or other acts of violence, or acts of god (such as fires, earthquakes or floods).
redevelopments and acquisitions may fail to perform as expected.
our investment strategy includes the redevelopment and acquisition of high quality, retail focused properties in densely populated areas with high average household incomes and significant barriers to adding competitive retail supply. the redevelopment and acquisition of properties entail risks that include the following, any of which could adversely affect our results of operations and our ability to meet our obligations:
•   our estimate of the costs to improve, reposition or redevelop a property may prove to be too low, or the time we estimate to complete the improvement, repositioning or redevelopment may be too short. as a result, the property may fail to achieve the returns we have projected, either temporarily or for a longer time;
•   we may not be able to identify suitable properties to acquire or may be unable to complete the acquisition of the properties we identify;
•   we may not be able to integrate an acquisition into our existing operations successfully;
•   properties we redevelop or acquire may fail to achieve the occupancy or rental rates we project, within the time frames we project, at the time we make the decision to invest, which may result in the properties' failure to achieve the returns we projected;
•   our pre-acquisition evaluation of the physical condition of each new investment may not detect certain defects or identify necessary repairs until after the property is acquired, which could significantly increase our total acquisition costs or decrease cash flow from the property; and
9
•   our investigation of a property or building prior to our acquisition, and any representations we may receive from the seller of such building or property, may fail to reveal various liabilities, which could reduce the cash flow from the property or increase our acquisition cost.
our ability to grow will be limited if we cannot obtain additional capital.
our growth strategy is focused on the redevelopment of properties we already own and the acquisition of additional properties. we believe that it will be difficult to fund our expected growth with cash from operating activities because, in addition to other requirements, we are generally required to distribute to our shareholders at least 90% of our taxable income each year to continue to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes. as a result, we must rely primarily upon the availability of debt or equity capital, which may or may not be available on favorable terms or at all. debt could include the sale of debt securities and mortgage loans from third parties. if economic conditions and conditions in the capital markets are not favorable at the time we need to raise capital, we may need to obtain capital on less favorable terms. additionally, we cannot guarantee that additional financing, refinancing or other capital will be available in the amounts we desire or on favorable terms. our access to debt or equity capital depends on a number of factors, including the market's perception of our growth potential and risk profile, our ability to pay dividends, and our current and potential future earnings. depending on the outcome of these factors as well as the impact of the economic environment, we could experience delay or difficulty in implementing our growth strategy on satisfactory terms, or be unable to implement this strategy.
rising interest rates could adversely affect our cash flow and the market price of our outstanding debt and preferred shares.
of our approximately $3.3 billion of debt outstanding as of december 31, 2017, approximately $316.0 million bears interest at variable rates, of which $275.0 million is effectively fixed at 2.62% through two interest rate swap agreements. we have an $800.0 million revolving credit facility, on which $41.0 million is outstanding at december 31, 2017, that bears interest at libor plus 82.5 basis points. we may borrow additional funds at variable interest rates in the future. increases in interest rates would increase the interest expense on our variable rate debt and reduce our cash flow, which could adversely affect our ability to service our debt and meet our other obligations and also could reduce the amount we are able to distribute to our shareholders. we may enter into hedging arrangements or other transactions for all or a portion of our variable rate debt to limit our exposure to rising interest rates. however, the amounts we are required to pay under the term loan and any other variable rate debt to which hedging or similar arrangements relate may increase in the event of non-performance by the counterparties to any of our hedging arrangements. in addition, an increase in market interest rates may lead purchasers of our debt securities and preferred shares to demand a higher annual yield, which could adversely affect the market price of our outstanding debt securities and preferred shares and the cost and/or timing of refinancing or issuing additional debt securities or preferred shares.
the market value of our debt and equity securities is subject to various factors that may cause significant fluctuations or volatility.
as with other publicly traded securities, the market price of our debt and equity securities depends on various factors, which may change from time to time and/or may be unrelated to our financial condition, operating performance or prospects that may cause significant fluctuations or volatility in such prices. these factors include, among others:
•   general economic and financial market conditions;
•   level and trend of interest rates;
•   our ability to access the capital markets to raise additional capital;
•   the issuance of additional equity or debt securities;
•   changes in our funds from operations ("ffo") or earnings estimates;
•   changes in our debt or analyst ratings;
•   our financial condition and performance;
•   market perception of our business compared to other reits; and
•   market perception of reits, in general, compared to other investment alternatives.
loss of our key management could adversely affect performance and the value of our common shares.
we are dependent on the efforts of our key management. although we believe qualified replacements could be found for any departures of key executives, the loss of their services could adversely affect our performance and the value of our common shares.
10
our performance and value are subject to general risks associated with the real estate industry.
our economic performance and the value of our real estate assets, and, consequently, the value of our investments, are subject to the risk that if our properties do not generate revenues sufficient to meet our operating expenses, including debt service and capital expenditures, our cash flow and ability to pay distributions to our shareholders will be adversely affected. as a real estate company, we are susceptible to the following real estate industry risks:
•   economic downturns in general, or in the areas where our properties are located;
•   adverse changes in local real estate market conditions, such as an oversupply or reduction in demand;
•   changes in tenant preferences that reduce the attractiveness of our properties to tenants;
•   zoning or regulatory restrictions;
•   decreases in market rental rates;
•   weather conditions that may increase or decrease energy costs and other weather-related expenses;
•   costs associated with the need to periodically repair, renovate and re-lease space; and
•   increases in the cost of adequate maintenance, insurance and other operating costs, including real estate taxes, associated with one or more properties, which may occur even when circumstances such as market factors and competition cause a reduction in revenues from one or more properties, although real estate taxes typically do not increase upon a reduction in such revenues.
each of these risks could result in decreases in market rental rates and increases in vacancy rates, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operation.
many real estate costs are fixed, even if income from our properties decreases.
our financial results depend primarily on leasing space in our properties to tenants on terms favorable to us. costs associated with real estate investment, such as real estate taxes, insurance and maintenance costs, generally are not reduced even when a property is not fully occupied, rental rates decrease, or other circumstances cause a reduction in income from the property. as a result, cash flow from the operations of our properties may be reduced if a tenant does not pay its rent or we are unable to rent our properties on favorable terms. under those circumstances, we might not be able to enforce our rights as landlord without delays and may incur substantial legal costs. additionally, new properties that we may acquire or redevelop may not produce any significant revenue immediately, and the cash flow from existing operations may be insufficient to pay the operating expenses and debt service associated with such new properties until they are fully occupied.
competition may limit our ability to purchase new properties and generate sufficient income from tenants.
numerous commercial developers and real estate companies compete with us in seeking tenants for our existing properties and properties for acquisition. this competition may:
•   reduce properties available for acquisition;
•   increase the cost of properties available for acquisition;
•   reduce rents payable to us;
•   interfere with our ability to attract and retain tenants;
•   lead to increased vacancy rates at our properties; and
•   adversely affect our ability to minimize expenses of operation.
retailers at our properties also face increasing competition from online retailers, outlet stores, discount shopping clubs and other forms of sales and marketing of goods, such as direct mail. this competition could contribute to lease defaults and insolvency of tenants. if we are unable to continue to attract appropriate retail tenants to our properties, or to purchase new properties in our geographic markets, it could materially affect our ability to generate net income, service our debt and make distributions to our shareholders.
we may be unable to sell properties when appropriate because real estate investments are illiquid.
real estate investments generally cannot be sold quickly. in addition, there are some limitations under federal income tax laws applicable to real estate and to reits in particular that may limit our ability to sell our assets. we may not be able to alter our portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions including being unable to sell a property at a return we believe is appropriate due to the economic environment. our inability to respond quickly to adverse changes in the performance of our investments could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our obligations and make distributions to our shareholders.
11
our insurance coverage on our properties may be inadequate.
we currently carry comprehensive insurance on all of our properties, including insurance for liability, fire, flood, earthquake, environmental matters, rental loss and acts of terrorism. all of these policies contain coverage limitations. we believe these coverages are of the types and amounts customarily obtained for or by an owner of similar types of real property assets located in the areas where our properties are located. we intend to obtain similar insurance coverage on subsequently acquired properties.
the availability of insurance coverage may decrease and the prices for insurance may increase as a consequence of significant losses incurred by the insurance industry and other factors outside our control. as a result, we may be unable to renew or duplicate our current insurance coverage in adequate amounts or at reasonable prices. in addition, insurance companies may no longer offer coverage against certain types of losses, such as losses due to terrorist acts and toxic mold, or, if offered, the expense of obtaining these types of insurance may not be justified. we therefore may cease to have insurance coverage against certain types of losses and/or there may be decreases in the limits of insurance available. if an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of our insured limits occurs, we could lose all or a portion of the capital we have invested in a property, as well as the anticipated future revenue from the property, but still remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial obligations related to the property. we cannot guarantee that material losses in excess of insurance proceeds will not occur in the future. if any of our properties were to experience a catastrophic loss, it could seriously disrupt our operations, delay revenue and result in large expenses to repair or rebuild the property. also, due to inflation, changes in codes and ordinances, environmental considerations and other factors, it may not be feasible to use insurance proceeds to replace a building after it has been damaged or destroyed. further, we may be unable to collect insurance proceeds if our insurers are unable to pay or contest a claim. events such as these could adversely affect our results of operations and our ability to meet our obligations, including distributions to our shareholders.
we may have limited flexibility in dealing with our jointly owned investments.
our organizational documents do not limit the amount of funds that we may invest in properties and assets owned jointly with other persons or entities. as of december 31, 2017, we held 16 predominantly retail real estate projects jointly with other persons in addition to properties owned in a "downreit" structure. additionally, we have entered into joint venture agreements related to the hotel component of phase ii of our pike & rose and assembly row development projects. we may make additional joint investments in the future. our existing and future joint investments may subject us to special risks, including the possibility that our partners or co-investors might become bankrupt, that those partners or co-investors might have economic or other business interests or goals which are unlike or incompatible with our business interests or goals, that those partners or co-investors might be in a position to take action contrary to our suggestions or instructions, or in opposition to our policies or objectives, and that disputes may develop with our joint venture partners over decisions affecting the property or the joint venture, which may result in litigation or arbitration or some other form of dispute resolution. although as of december 31, 2017, we held the controlling interests in all of our existing co-investments (except the hotel investments discussed above and the investment in the la alameda shopping center acquired in 2017), we generally must obtain the consent of the co-investor or meet defined criteria to sell or to finance these properties. joint ownership gives a third party the opportunity to influence the return we can achieve on some of our investments and may adversely affect our ability to make distributions to our shareholders. we may also be liable for the actions of our co-investors.
environmental laws and regulations could reduce the value or profitability of our properties.
all real property and the operations conducted on real property are subject to federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations relating to hazardous materials, environmental protection and human health and safety. under various federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations, we and our tenants may be required to investigate and clean up certain hazardous or toxic substances released on or in properties we own or operate, and also may be required to pay other costs relating to hazardous or toxic substances. this liability may be imposed without regard to whether we or our tenants knew about the release of these types of substances or were responsible for their release. the presence of contamination or the failure to properly remediate contamination at any of our properties may adversely affect our ability to sell or lease those properties or to borrow funds by using those properties as collateral. the costs or liabilities could exceed the value of the affected real estate. we are not aware of any environmental condition with respect to any of our properties that management believes would have a material adverse effect on our business, assets or results of operations taken as a whole. the uses of any of our properties prior to our acquisition of the property and the building materials used at the property are among the property-specific factors that will affect how the environmental laws are applied to our properties. if we are subject to any material environmental liabilities, the liabilities could adversely affect our results of operations and our ability to meet our obligations.
we cannot predict what other environmental legislation or regulations will be enacted in the future, how existing or future laws or regulations will be administered or interpreted or what environmental conditions may be found to exist on the properties in the future. compliance with existing and new laws and regulations may require us or our tenants to spend funds to remedy
12
environmental problems. our tenants, like many of their competitors, have incurred, and will continue to incur, capital and operating expenditures and other costs associated with complying with these laws and regulations, which will adversely affect their potential profitability.
generally, our tenants must comply with environmental laws and meet remediation requirements. our leases typically impose obligations on our tenants to indemnify us from any compliance costs we may incur as a result of the environmental conditions on the property caused by the tenant. if a lease does not require compliance or if a tenant fails to or cannot comply, we could be forced to pay these costs. if not addressed, environmental conditions could impair our ability to sell or re-lease the affected properties in the future or result in lower sales prices or rent payments.
the americans with disabilities act of 1990 could require us to take remedial steps with respect to existing or newly acquired properties.
our existing properties, as well as properties we may acquire, as commercial facilities, are required to comply with title iii of the americans with disabilities act of 1990. investigation of a property may reveal non-compliance with this act. the requirements of this act, or of other federal, state or local laws or regulations, also may change in the future and restrict further renovations of our properties with respect to access for disabled persons. future compliance with this act may require expensive changes to the properties.
the revenues generated by our tenants could be negatively affected by various federal, state and local laws to which they are subject.
we and our tenants are subject to a wide range of federal, state and local laws and regulations, such as local licensing requirements, consumer protection laws and state and local fire, life-safety and similar requirements that affect the use of the properties. the leases typically require that each tenant comply with all laws and regulations. failure to comply could result in fines by governmental authorities, awards of damages to private litigants, or restrictions on the ability to conduct business on such properties. non-compliance of this sort could reduce our revenues from a tenant, could require us to pay penalties or fines relating to any non-compliance, and could adversely affect our ability to sell or lease a property.
failure to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes would cause us to be taxed as a corporation, which would substantially reduce funds available for payment of distributions.
we believe that we are organized and qualified as a reit for federal income tax purposes and currently intend to operate in a manner that will allow us to continue to qualify as a reit under the code. however, we cannot assure you that we will remain qualified as such in the future.
qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex code provisions and applicable income tax regulations that have been issued under the code. certain facts and circumstances not entirely within our control may affect our ability to qualify as a reit. for example, in order to qualify as a reit, at least 95% of our gross income in any year must be derived from qualifying rents and certain other income. satisfying this requirement could be difficult, for example, if defaults by tenants were to reduce the amount of income from qualifying rents. as a reit, we must generally make annual distributions to shareholders of at least 90% of our taxable income. in addition, new legislation, new regulations, new administrative interpretations or new court decisions may significantly change the tax laws with respect to qualification as a reit or the federal income tax consequences of such qualification. any modification in the tax treatment of reits could have a significant adverse impact to our net income.
if we fail to qualify as a reit:
•   we would not be allowed a deduction for distributions to shareholders in computing taxable income;
•   we would be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates;
•   we could be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax;
•   unless we are entitled to relief under specific statutory provisions, we could not elect to be taxed as a reit for four taxable years following the year during which we were disqualified;
•   we could be required to pay significant income taxes, which would substantially reduce the funds available for investment or for distribution to our shareholders for each year in which we failed or were not permitted to qualify; and
•   we would no longer be required by law to make any distributions to our shareholders.
13
we may be required to incur additional debt to qualify as a reit.
as a reit, we must generally make annual distributions to shareholders of at least 90% of our taxable income. we are subject to income tax on amounts of undistributed taxable income and net capital gain. in addition, we would be subject to a 4% excise tax if we fail to distribute sufficient income to meet a minimum distribution test based on our ordinary income, capital gain and aggregate undistributed income from prior years. we intend to make distributions to shareholders to comply with the code's distribution provisions and to avoid federal income and excise tax. we may need to borrow funds to meet our distribution requirements because:
•   our income may not be matched by our related expenses at the time the income is considered received for purposes of determining taxable income; and
•   non-deductible capital expenditures, creation of reserves, or debt service requirements may reduce available cash but not taxable income.
in these circumstances, we might have to borrow funds on terms we might otherwise find unfavorable and we may have to borrow funds even if our management believes the market conditions make borrowing financially unattractive. current tax law also allows us to pay a portion of our distributions in shares instead of cash.
to maintain our status as a reit, we limit the amount of shares any one shareholder can own.
the code imposes certain limitations on the ownership of the stock of a reit. for example, not more than 50% in value of our outstanding shares of capital stock may be owned, directly or indirectly, by five or fewer individuals (as defined in the code) during the last half of any taxable year. to protect our reit status, our declaration of trust prohibits any one shareholder from owning (actually or constructively) more than 9.8% in value of the outstanding common shares or of any class or series of outstanding preferred shares. the constructive ownership rules are complex. shares of our capital stock owned, actually or constructively, by a group of related individuals and/or entities may be treated as constructively owned by one of those individuals or entities. as a result, the acquisition of less than 9.8% in value of the outstanding common shares and/or a class or series of preferred shares (or the acquisition of an interest in an entity that owns common shares or preferred shares) by an individual or entity could cause that individual or entity (or another) to own constructively more than 9.8% in value of the outstanding capital stock. if that happened, either the transfer of ownership would be void or the shares would be transferred to a charitable trust and then sold to someone who can own those shares without violating the 9.8% ownership limit.
the board of trustees may waive these restrictions on a case-by-case basis. in addition, the board of trustees and two-thirds of our shareholders eligible to vote at a shareholder meeting may remove these restrictions if they determine it is no longer in our best interests to attempt to qualify, or to continue to qualify, as a reit. the 9.8% ownership restrictions may delay, defer or prevent a transaction or a change of our control that might involve a premium price for the common shares or otherwise be in the shareholders' best interest.
u.s. federal tax reform legislation now and in the future could affect reits, both positively and negatively, in ways that are difficult to anticipate.
the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 (the "2017 tax act"), signed into law on december 22, 2017, represents sweeping tax reform legislation that makes significant changes to corporate and individual tax rates and the calculation of taxes.  while we currently do not expect the 2017 tax act will have a significant direct impact on us, it may impact us indirectly as our tenants and the jurisdictions in which we do business as well as the overall investment thesis for reits may be impacted both positively and negatively in ways that are difficult to predict. additionally, the overall impact of the 2017 tax act depends on future interpretations and regulations that may be issued by federal tax authorities, as well as changes in state and local taxation in response to the 2017 tax act, and it is possible that such future interpretations, regulations and other changes could adversely impact us.
we cannot assure you we will continue to pay dividends at historical rates.
our ability to continue to pay dividends on our common shares at historical rates or to increase our common share dividend rate, and our ability to pay preferred share dividends and service our debt securities, will depend on a number of factors, including, among others, the following:
•   our financial condition and results of future operations;
•   the performance of lease terms by tenants;
•   the terms of our loan covenants; and
•   our ability to acquire, finance, develop or redevelop and lease additional properties at attractive rates.
if we do not maintain or increase the dividend on our common shares, it could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common shares and other securities. any preferred shares we may offer in the future may have a fixed dividend rate that would
14
not increase with any increases in the dividend rate of our common shares. conversely, payment of dividends on our common shares may be subject to payment in full of the dividends on any preferred shares and payment of interest on any debt securities we may offer.
certain tax and anti-takeover provisions of our declaration of trust and bylaws may inhibit a change of our control.
certain provisions contained in our declaration of trust and bylaws and the maryland general corporation law, as applicable to maryland reits, may discourage a third party from making a tender offer or acquisition proposal to us. if this were to happen, it could delay, deter or prevent a change in control or the removal of existing management. these provisions also may delay or prevent the shareholders from receiving a premium for their common shares over then-prevailing market prices. these provisions include:
•   the reit ownership limit described above;
•   authorization of the issuance of our preferred shares with powers, preferences or rights to be determined by the board of trustees;
•   special meetings of our shareholders may be called only by the chairman of the board, the chief executive officer, the president, by one-third of the trustees or by shareholders possessing no less than 25% of all the votes entitled to be cast at the meeting;
•   the board of trustees, without a shareholder vote, can classify or reclassify unissued shares of beneficial interest, including the reclassification of common shares into preferred shares and vice-versa;
•   a two-thirds shareholder vote is required to approve some amendments to the declaration of trust; and
•   advance-notice requirements for proposals to be presented at shareholder meetings.
in addition, if we elect to be governed by it in the future, the maryland control share acquisition law could delay or prevent a change in control. under maryland law, unless a reit elects not to be subject to this law, "control shares" acquired in a "control share acquisition" have no voting rights except to the extent approved by shareholders by a vote of two-thirds of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter, excluding shares owned by the acquirer and by officers or trustees who are employees of the reit. "control shares" are voting shares that would entitle the acquirer to exercise voting power in electing trustees within specified ranges of voting power. a "control share acquisition" means the acquisition of control shares, with some exceptions.
our bylaws state that the maryland control share acquisition law will not apply to any acquisition by any person of our common shares. this bylaw provision may be repealed, in whole or in part, at any time, whether before or after an acquisition of control shares, by a vote of a majority of the shareholders entitled to vote, and, upon such repeal, may, to the extent provided by any successor bylaw, apply to any prior or subsequent control share acquisition.
we may amend or revise our business policies without your approval.
our board of trustees may amend or revise our operating policies without shareholder approval. our investment, financing and borrowing policies and policies with respect to all other activities, such as growth, debt, capitalization and operations, are determined by the board of trustees. the board of trustees may amend or revise these policies at any time and from time to time at its discretion. a change in these policies could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations, and the market price of our securities.
the current business plan adopted by our board of trustees focuses on our investment in high quality retail based properties that are typically neighborhood and community shopping centers or mixed-use properties, principally through redevelopments and acquisitions. if this business plan is not successful, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
given these uncertainties, readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements that we make, including those in this annual report on form 10-k. except as may be required by law, we make no promise to update any of the forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. you should carefully review the above risks and the risk factors.
natural disasters and severe weather conditions could have an adverse impact on our cash flow and operating results.
changing weather patterns and climatic conditions, such as global warming, may have added to the unpredictability and frequency of natural disasters and severe weather conditions and created additional uncertainty as to future trends and exposures.  our operations are located in areas that are subject to natural disasters and severe weather conditions such as hurricanes, earthquakes, droughts, snow storms, floods and fires.  the occurrence of natural disasters or severe weather conditions can delay new development projects, increase investment costs to repair or replace damaged properties, increase operation costs, increase future property insurance costs, and negatively impact the tenant demand for lease space.  if insurance
15
is unavailable to us or is unavailable on acceptable terms, or if our insurance is not adequate to cover business interruption or losses from these events, our earnings, liquidity or capital resources could be adversely affected.
we face risks relating to cybersecurity attacks that could cause loss of confidential information and other business disruptions.
we rely extensively on computer systems to process transactions and manage our business, and our business is at risk from and may be impacted by cybersecurity attacks. these could include attempts to gain unauthorized access to our data and computer systems. attacks can be both individual and/or highly organized attempts organized by very sophisticated hacking organizations. we employ a number of measures to prevent, detect and mitigate these threats, which include password encryption, frequent password change events, firewall detection systems, anti-virus software in-place, frequent backups, a redundant data system for core applications and annual penetration testing; however, there is no guarantee such efforts will be successful in preventing a cyber attack. a cybersecurity attack could compromise the confidential information of our employees, tenants and vendors. a successful attack could disrupt and otherwise adversely affect our business operations.
item 7.    management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations forward-looking statements certain statements in this section or elsewhere in this report may be deemed "forward-looking statements". see "item 1a. risk factors" in this report for important information regarding these forward-looking statements and certain risk and uncertainties that may affect us. the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing in "item 8. financial statements and supplementary data" of this report.
overview we are an equity real estate investment trust ("reit") specializing in the ownership, management, and redevelopment of high quality retail and mixed-use properties located primarily in densely populated and affluent communities in strategically selected metropolitan markets in the northeast and mid-atlantic regions of the united states, california, and south florida. as of december 31, 2017, we owned or had a majority interest in community and neighborhood shopping centers and mixed-use properties which are operated as 104 predominantly retail real estate projects comprising approximately 24.2 million square feet. in total, the real estate projects were 95.3% leased and 93.9% occupied at december 31, 2017. we have paid quarterly dividends to our shareholders continuously since our founding in 1962 and have increased our dividends per common share for 50 consecutive years.
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america, referred to as "gaap", requires management to make estimates and assumptions that in certain circumstances affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and revenues and expenses. these estimates are prepared using management's best judgment, after considering past and current events and economic conditions. in addition, information relied upon by management in preparing such estimates includes internally generated financial and operating information, external market information, when available, and when necessary, information obtained from consultations with third party experts. actual results could differ from these estimates. a discussion of possible risks which may affect these estimates is included in "item 1a. risk factors" of this report. management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if changes in the estimate could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition.
our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements; however, the most critical accounting policies, which involve the use of estimates and assumptions as to future uncertainties and, therefore, may result in actual amounts that differ from estimates, are as follows:
30
revenue recognition and accounts receivable our leases with tenants are classified as operating leases. substantially all such leases contain fixed escalations which occur at specified times during the term of the lease. base rents are recognized on a straight-line basis from when the tenant controls the space through the term of the related lease, net of valuation adjustments, based on management's assessment of credit, collection and other business risk. percentage rents, which represent additional rents based upon the level of sales achieved by certain tenants, are recognized at the end of the lease year or earlier if we have determined the required sales level is achieved and the percentage rents are collectible. real estate tax and other cost reimbursements are recognized on an accrual basis over the periods in which the related expenditures are incurred. for a tenant to terminate its lease agreement prior to the end of the agreed term, we may require that they pay a fee to cancel the lease agreement. lease termination fees for which the tenant has relinquished control of the space are generally recognized on the termination date. when a lease is terminated early but the tenant continues to control the space under a modified lease agreement, the lease termination fee is generally recognized evenly over the remaining term of the modified lease agreement.
current accounts receivable from tenants primarily relate to contractual minimum rent and percentage rent as well as real estate tax and other cost reimbursements. accounts receivable from straight-line rent is typically longer term in nature and relates to the cumulative amount by which straight-line rental income recorded to date exceeds cash rents billed to date under the contractual lease agreement.
we make estimates of the collectability of our current accounts receivable and straight-line rents receivable which requires significant judgment by management. the collectability of receivables is affected by numerous factors including current economic conditions, bankruptcies, and the ability of the tenant to perform under the terms of their lease agreement. while we make estimates of potentially uncollectible amounts and provide an allowance for them through bad debt expense, actual collectability could differ from those estimates which could affect our net income. with respect to the allowance for current uncollectible tenant receivables, we assess the collectability of outstanding receivables by evaluating such factors as nature and age of the receivable, past history and current financial condition of the specific tenant including our assessment of the tenant's ability to meet its contractual lease obligations, and the status of any pending disputes or lease negotiations with the tenant. at december 31, 2017 and 2016, our allowance for doubtful accounts was $11.8 million and $11.9 million, respectively. historically, we have recognized bad debt expense between 0.3% and 1.3% of rental income and it was 0.3% in 2017. a change in the estimate of collectability of a receivable would result in a change to our allowance for doubtful accounts and correspondingly bad debt expense and net income. for example, in the event our estimates were not accurate and we were required to increase our allowance by 1% of rental income, our bad debt expense would have increased and our net income would have decreased by $8.4 million.
due to the nature of the accounts receivable from straight-line rents, the collection period of these amounts typically extends beyond one year. our experience relative to unbilled straight-line rents is that a portion of the amounts otherwise recognizable as revenue is never billed to or collected from tenants due to early lease terminations, lease modifications, bankruptcies and other factors. accordingly, the extended collection period for straight-line rents along with our evaluation of tenant credit risk may result in the nonrecognition of a portion of straight-line rental income until the collection of such income is reasonably assured. if our evaluation of tenant credit risk changes indicating more straight-line revenue is reasonably collectible than previously estimated and realized, the additional straight-line rental income is recognized as revenue. if our evaluation of tenant credit risk changes indicating a portion of realized straight-line rental income is no longer collectible, a reserve and bad debt expense is recorded. at december 31, 2017 and 2016, accounts receivable includes approximately $93.1 million and $80.6 million, respectively, related to straight-line rents. correspondingly, these estimates of collectability have a direct impact on our net income.
we are currently under construction on 221 condominium units at our assembly row and pike & rose properties. gains or losses on the sale of these condominium units are recognized in accordance with the provisions of asc topic 360-20, "property, plant and equipment - real estate sales." we account for contracted condominium sales under the percentage-of completion method, based on an evaluation of the criteria specified in asc topic 360-20 including: the legal commitment of the purchaser in the real estate contract, whether the construction of the project is beyond a preliminary phase, whether sufficient units have been contracted to ensure the project will not revert to a rental project, the ability to reasonably estimate the aggregate project sale proceeds and aggregate project costs, and the determination that the buyer has made an adequate initial and continuing cash investment under the contract. when the percentage-of-completion criteria have not been met, no profit is recognized. the application of these criteria can be complex and requires us to make assumptions. the timing of revenue recognition related to these condominium sales will be impacted by the january 1, 2018 adoption of asu 2014-09 "revenue from contracts with customers." see "recent accounting pronouncements," in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion regarding the changes.
31
real estate the nature of our business as an owner, redeveloper and operator of retail shopping centers and mixed-use properties means that we invest significant amounts of capital. depreciation and maintenance costs relating to our properties constitute substantial costs for us as well as the industry as a whole. we capitalize real estate investments and depreciate them on a straight-line basis in accordance with gaap and consistent with industry standards based on our best estimates of the assets' physical and economic useful lives. we periodically review the estimated lives of our assets and implement changes, as necessary, to these estimates and, therefore, to our depreciation rates. these reviews may take into account such factors as the historical retirement and replacement of our assets, expected redevelopments, and general economic and real estate factors. certain events, such as unforeseen competition or changes in customer shopping habits, could substantially alter our assumptions regarding our ability to realize the expected return on investment in the property and therefore reduce the economic life of the asset and affect the amount of depreciation expense to be charged against both the current and future revenues. these assessments have a direct impact on our net income. the longer the economic useful life, the lower the depreciation expense will be for that asset in a fiscal period, which in turn will increase our net income. similarly, having a shorter economic useful life would increase the depreciation for a fiscal period and decrease our net income.
land, buildings and real estate under development are recorded at cost. we calculate depreciation using the straight-line method with useful lives ranging generally from 35 years to a maximum of 50 years on buildings and major improvements. maintenance and repair costs are charged to operations as incurred. tenant work and other major improvements, which improve or extend the life of the asset, are capitalized and depreciated over the life of the lease or the estimated useful life of the improvements, whichever is shorter. minor improvements, furniture and equipment are capitalized and depreciated over useful lives ranging from 2 to 20 years.
capitalized costs associated with leases are depreciated or amortized over the base term of the lease. unamortized leasing costs are charged to expense if the applicable tenant vacates before the expiration of its lease. undepreciated tenant work is written-off if the applicable tenant vacates and the tenant work is replaced or has no future value. additionally, we make estimates as to the probability of certain development and redevelopment projects being completed. if we determine the redevelopment is no longer probable of completion, we immediately expense all capitalized costs which are not recoverable.
interest costs on developments and major redevelopments are capitalized as part of developments and redevelopments not yet placed in service. capitalization of interest commences when development activities and expenditures begin and end upon completion, which is when the asset is ready for its intended use. generally, rental property is considered substantially complete and ready for its intended use upon completion of tenant improvements, but no later than one year from completion of major construction activity. we make judgments as to the time period over which to capitalize such costs and these assumptions have a direct impact on net income because capitalized costs are not subtracted in calculating net income. if the time period for capitalizing interest is extended, more interest is capitalized, thereby decreasing interest expense and increasing net income during that period.
certain external and internal costs directly related to the development, redevelopment and leasing of real estate, including pre-construction costs, real estate taxes, insurance, construction costs and salaries and related costs of personnel directly involved, are capitalized. we capitalized external and internal costs related to both development and redevelopment activities of $410 million and $8 million, respectively, for 2017 and $420 million and $9 million, respectively, for 2016. we capitalized external and internal costs related to other property improvements of $74 million and $3 million, respectively, for 2017 and $61 million and $3 million, respectively, for 2016. we capitalized external and internal costs related to leasing activities of $11 million and $6 million, respectively, for 2017 and $13 million and $6 million, respectively, for 2016. the amount of capitalized internal costs for salaries and related benefits for development and redevelopment activities, other property improvements, and leasing activities were $7 million, $3 million, and $6 million, for 2017 and $8 million, $2 million, and $6 million for 2016. total capitalized costs were $512 million and $511 million for 2017 and 2016, respectively.
when applicable, as lessee, we classify our leases of land and building as operating or capital leases. we are required to use judgment and make estimates in determining the lease term, the estimated economic life of the property and the interest rate to be used in determining whether or not the lease meets the qualification of a capital lease and is recorded as an asset.
real estate acquisitions upon acquisition of operating real estate properties, we estimate the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired including land, building, improvements, leasing costs, intangibles such as in-place leases, assumed debt, and current assets and liabilities, if any.  based on these estimates, we allocate the purchase price to the applicable assets and liabilities. we utilize methods similar to those used by independent appraisers in estimating the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities. the value allocated to in-place leases is amortized over the related lease term and reflected as rental income in the statement of operations. we consider qualitative and quantitative factors in evaluating the likelihood of a tenant exercising a below market renewal option and
32
include such renewal options in the calculation of in-place lease value when we consider these to be bargain renewal options. if the value of below market lease intangibles includes renewal option periods, we include such renewal periods in the amortization period utilized. if a tenant vacates its space prior to contractual termination of its lease, the unamortized balance of any in-place lease value is written off to rental income.
long-lived assets and impairment there are estimates and assumptions made by management in preparing the consolidated financial statements for which the actual results will be determined over long periods of time. this includes the recoverability of long-lived assets, including our properties that have been acquired or redeveloped and our investment in certain joint ventures. management's evaluation of impairment includes review for possible indicators of impairment as well as, in certain circumstances, undiscounted and discounted cash flow analysis. since most of our investments in real estate are wholly-owned or controlled assets which are held for use, a property with impairment indicators is first tested for impairment by comparing the undiscounted cash flows, including residual value, to the current net book value of the property. if the undiscounted cash flows are less than the net book value, the property is written down to expected fair value.
the calculation of both discounted and undiscounted cash flows requires management to make estimates of future cash flows including revenues, operating expenses, required maintenance and development expenditures, market conditions, demand for space by tenants and rental rates over long periods. because our properties typically have a long life, the assumptions used to estimate the future recoverability of book value requires significant management judgment. actual results could be significantly different from the estimates. these estimates have a direct impact on net income, because recording an impairment charge results in a negative adjustment to net income.
contingencies we are sometimes involved in lawsuits, warranty claims, and environmental matters arising in the ordinary course of business. management makes assumptions and estimates concerning the likelihood and amount of any potential loss relating to these matters. we accrue a liability for litigation if an unfavorable outcome is probable and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. if an unfavorable outcome is probable and a reasonable estimate of the loss is a range, we accrue the best estimate within the range; however, if no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount, the minimum within the range is accrued. any difference between our estimate of a potential loss and the actual outcome would result in an increase or decrease to net income.
self-insurance we are self-insured for general liability costs up to predetermined retained amounts per claim, and we believe that we maintain adequate accruals to cover our retained liability. we currently do not maintain third party stop-loss insurance policies to cover liability costs in excess of predetermined retained amounts. our accrual for self-insurance liability is determined by management and is based on claims filed and an estimate of claims projected to be incurred but not yet reported. management considers a number of factors, including third-party actuarial analysis, previous experience in our portfolio, and future increases in costs of claims, when making these determinations. if our liability costs differ from these accruals, it will increase or decrease our net income.
recently adopted and recently issued accounting pronouncements see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements.
2017 property acquisitions and dispositions on february 1, 2017, we acquired a leasehold interest in hastings ranch plaza, a 274,000 square foot shopping center in pasadena, california for $29.5 million. the land is subject to a long-term ground lease that expires on april 30, 2054. approximately $21.5 million of assets acquired were allocated to lease intangibles and included within other assets. approximately $15.2 million of net assets acquired were allocated to lease liabilities and included in other liabilities.

on september 29, 2017, we issued 6,000,000 depository shares, each representing 1/1000th of a 5.0% series c cumulative redeemable preferred share, par value $0.01 per share ("series c preferred shares"), at the liquidation preference of $25.00 per depository share (or $25,000 per series c preferred share) in an underwritten public offering. the series c preferred shares accrue dividends at a rate of 5.0% of the $25,000 liquidation preference per year and are redeemable at our option on or after september 29, 2022. additionally, they are not convertible and holders of these shares generally have no voting rights, unless we fail to pay dividends for six or more quarters. the net proceeds after underwriting fees and other costs were approximately $145.0 million.
on december 21, 2017, we issued $175.0 million aggregate principal amount of 3.25% senior unsecured notes due july 15, 2027. the notes have the same terms and are of the same series as the $300.0 million senior notes issued on june 23, 2017. the notes were offered at 99.404% of the principal amount, with a yield to maturity of 3.323%. our net proceeds from the december note offering after net issuance premium, underwriting fees and other costs were approximately $172.5 million. the proceeds were used on december 31, 2017 to repay our $150.0 million 5.90% notes prior to the original maturity date of april 1, 2020. the redemption price of $164.1 million included a make-whole premium of $11.9 million and accrued but unpaid interest of $2.2 million. the make-whole premium is included in "early extinguishment of debt" in 2017.
on november 4, 2016, we replaced our existing at-the-market ("atm") equity program with a new atm equity program in which we may from time to time offer and sell common shares having an aggregate offering price of up to $400.0 million. we intend to use the net proceeds to fund potential acquisition opportunities, fund our development and redevelopment pipeline, repay amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility and/or for general corporate purposes. for the three months ended december 31, 2017, we issued 501,120 common shares at a weighted average price per share of $132.22 for net cash proceeds of $65.6 million and paid $0.7 million in commissions and less than $0.1 million in additional offering expenses related to the sales of these common shares. for the year ended december 31, 2017, we issued 826,517 common shares at a weighted average price per share of $132.56 for net cash proceeds of $108.3 million and paid $1.1 million in commissions and $0.2 million in additional offering expenses related to the sales of these common shares. as of december 31, 2017, we had the capacity to issue up to $261.3 million in common shares under our atm equity program.
outlook we seek growth in earnings, funds from operations, and cash flows primarily through a combination of the following:
•   growth in our same-center portfolio,
•   growth in our portfolio from property development and redevelopments, and
•   expansion of our portfolio through property acquisitions.
our same-center growth is primarily driven by increases in rental rates on new leases and lease renewals, changes in portfolio occupancy, and the redevelopment of those assets. over the long-term, the infill nature and strong demographics of our properties provide a strategic advantage allowing us to maintain relatively high occupancy and generally increase rental rates. we continue to see strong levels of interest from prospective tenants for our retail spaces; however, the time it takes to complete new lease deals is longer, as tenants have become more selective and more deliberate in their decision-making process. we have also experienced extended periods of time for some government agencies to process permits and inspections further delaying rent commencement on newly leased spaces. additionally, we have seen an overall decrease in the number of tenants available to fill anchor spaces, and have seen an uptick in the number of retail tenants closing early and/or filing for bankruptcy. we believe the locations and nature of our centers and diverse tenant base partially mitigates any potential negative changes in the economic environment. however, any significant reduction in our tenants' abilities to pay base rent, percentage rent or other charges, will adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. we seek to maintain a mix of strong national, regional, and local retailers. at december 31, 2017, no single tenant accounted for more than 2.9% of annualized base rent.
our properties are located primarily in densely populated and/or affluent areas with high barriers to entry which allow us to take advantage of redevelopment opportunities that enhance our operating performance through renovation, expansion,
35
reconfiguration, and/or retenanting. we evaluate our properties on an ongoing basis to identify these types of opportunities. we currently have redevelopment projects underway with a projected cost of approximately $155 million that we expect to stabilize in the next several years.
we continue our ongoing redevelopment efforts at santana row and are under construction on an eight story 284,000 square foot office building which will include an additional 29,000 square feet of retail space and 1,300 parking spaces. the building is expected to cost between $205 and $215 million and to be delivered in 2019. after current phases, we have approximately 4 acres remaining for further redevelopment and entitlements in place for an additional 395 residential units and 321,000 square feet of commercial space. additionally, we control 12 acres of land adjacent to santana row.
we continue to invest in our long-term multi-phased mixed-use development projects at assembly row in somerville, massachusetts and pike & rose in north bethesda, maryland which we expect to be involved in over the coming years.
construction of phase ii of assembly row which will include 161,000 square feet of retail space, 447 residential units, and a 158 room boutique hotel (which will be owned and operated by a joint venture in which we are a partner) is underway. total expected costs range from $280 million to $295 million and remaining delivery is expected in 2018. approximately 49,000 square feet of retail space in phase ii has opened in 2017, and in september, the first tenants moved into the new residential building. phase ii will also include 122 for-sale condominium units with an expected total cost of $74 million to $79 million. additionally, as part of the second phase, we entered into a ground lease agreement with partners healthcare to bring 741,500 square feet of office space to assembly row. the ground lease agreement included a purchase option, which was exercised and the related sale closed on april 4, 2017.
construction of phase ii of pike & rose is also underway. phase ii will include approximately 216,000 square feet of retail space, 272 residential units, and a 177 room boutique hotel. approximately 151,000 square feet of retail space in phase ii has opened in 2017, and in august, the first tenants moved into the new residential building. total expected costs range from $200 million to $207 million and remaining delivery is expected in 2018. the hotel will be owned and operated by a joint venture in which we are a partner. phase ii will also include 99 for-sale condominium units with an expected cost of $53 million to $58 million.
we invested $273 million in assembly row and pike & rose in 2017 and expect to invest between $75 million and $100 million in assembly row and pike & rose in 2018.
the development of future phases of assembly row, pike & rose and santana row will be pursued opportunistically based on, among other things, market conditions, tenant demand, and our evaluation of whether those phases will generate an appropriate financial return.
we continue to review acquisition opportunities in our primary markets that complement our portfolio and provide long-term growth opportunities. initially, some of our acquisitions do not contribute significantly to earnings growth; however, we believe they provide long-term re-leasing growth, redevelopment opportunities, and other strategic opportunities. any growth from acquisitions is contingent on our ability to find properties that meet our qualitative standards at prices that meet our financial hurdles. changes in interest rates may affect our success in achieving earnings growth through acquisitions by affecting both the price that must be paid to acquire a property, as well as our ability to economically finance the property acquisition. generally, our acquisitions are initially financed by available cash and/or borrowings under our revolving credit facility which may be repaid later with funds raised through the issuance of new equity or new long-term debt. we may also finance our acquisitions through the issuance of common shares, preferred shares, or downreit units as well as through assumed mortgages.
at december 31, 2017, the leasable square feet in our properties was 95.3% leased and 93.9% occupied. the leased rate is higher than the occupied rate due to leased spaces that are being redeveloped or improved or that are awaiting permits and, therefore, are not yet ready to be occupied. our occupancy and leased rates are subject to variability over time due to factors including acquisitions, the timing of the start and stabilization of our redevelopment projects, lease expirations and tenant closings and bankruptcies.

same-center throughout this section, we have provided certain information on a "same-center" basis. information provided on a same-center basis includes the results of properties that we owned and operated for the entirety of both periods being compared except for properties for which significant redevelopment or expansion occurred during either of the periods being compared. for the year ended december 31, 2017 and the comparison of 2017 and 2016, all or a portion of 78 properties were considered same-center and 15 properties were considered redevelopment or expansion. for the year ended december 31, 2017, one property was moved from acquisition to same-center, two properties were removed from same-center as they were sold during 2017, and four properties or portions of properties were moved from redevelopment to same-center, compared to the designations as of december 31, 2016. for the year ended december 31, 2016 and the comparison of 2016 and 2015, all or a portion of 76 properties were considered same-center and 17 properties were considered redevelopment or expansion. for the year ended december 31, 2016, three properties or portions of properties were moved from same-center to redevelopment and one property was moved from redevelopment to same-center, compared to the designations as of december 31, 2015. while there is judgment surrounding changes in designations, we typically move redevelopment properties to same-center once they have stabilized, which is typically considered 95% occupancy or when the growth expected from the redevelopment has been included in the comparable periods. we typically remove properties from same center when the redevelopment has or is expected to have a significant impact to property operating income within the calendar year.  acquisitions are moved to same-center once we have owned the property for the entirety of comparable periods and the property is not under significant redevelopment or expansion.

property revenues total property revenue increased $55.8 million, or 7.0%, to $857.3 million in 2017 compared to $801.6 million in 2016. the percentage occupied at our shopping centers was 93.9% at december 31, 2017 compared to 93.3% at december 31, 2016. changes in the components of property revenue are discussed below.
rental income rental income consists primarily of minimum rent, cost reimbursements from tenants and percentage rent. rental income increased $54.9 million, or 7.0%, to $841.5 million in 2017 compared to $786.6 million in 2016 due primarily to the following:
•   an increase of $22.0 million from acquisitions, primarily related to the six shopping centers acquired in los angeles county, california, riverpoint center, and hastings ranch plaza,
•   an increase of $16.6 million at redevelopment properties due to the opening of our new office building at santana row in late 2016, the lease-up of three of our retail redevelopments, and the lease-up of the new residential building at congressional plaza, partially offset by lower occupancy at two of our retail properties in florida in the beginning stages of redevelopment,
•   an increase of $8.0 million at same-center properties due primarily to higher rental rates of approximately $6.0 million, higher recoveries of $3.4 million primarily the result of higher real estate tax assessments, partially offset by lower average occupancy of approximately $1.2 million,
•   an increase of $6.1 million from assembly row and pike &amp; rose due primarily to the lease-up of residential units and the opening of the second phase of retail during the second half of 2017, and
•   an increase of $3.2 million from the acquisition of six previously unconsolidated clarion joint venture properties in january 2016,
38
partially offset by
•   a decrease of $0.9 million from the sale of our 150 post street and north lake commons properties in august and september 2017, respectively.
other property income other property income increased $1.8 million, or 16.4%, to $12.8 million in 2017 compared to $11.0 million in 2016. included in other property income are items, which, although recurring, inherently tend to fluctuate more than rental income from period to period, such as lease termination fees. this increase is primarily related to higher lease termination fees.
mortgage interest income mortgage interest income decreased $0.9 million, or 23.3%, to $3.1 million in 2017 compared to $4.0 million in 2016. this decrease is primarily related to a mortgage note receivable that was repaid in 2016.
property expenses total property expenses increased $19.1 million, or 7.5%, to $272.7 million in 2017 compared to $253.6 million in 2016. changes in the components of property expenses are discussed below.
rental expenses rental expenses increased $6.6 million, or 4.1%, to $164.9 million in 2017 compared to $158.3 million in 2016. this increase is primarily due to the following:
•   an increase of $4.7 million from acquisitions, primarily related to six shopping centers in los angeles county, california, hastings ranch plaza, and riverpoint center, and
•   an increase of $2.1 million from assembly row and pike &amp; rose due primarily to the opening of phase ii residential units during the second half of 2017.
as a result of the changes in rental income and rental expenses as discussed above, rental expenses as a percentage of rental income plus other property income decreased to 19.3% for the year ended december 31, 2017 from 19.9% for the year ended december 31, 2016.
real estate taxes real estate tax expense increased $12.6 million, or 13.2% to $107.8 million in 2017 compared to $95.3 million in 2016 due primarily to the following:
•   an increase of $4.4 million at same-center properties primarily due to higher assessments,
•   an increase of $4.2 million from acquisitions, primarily related to six shopping centers in los angeles county, california, riverpoint center, and hastings ranch plaza,
•   an increase of $3.0 million from redevelopment properties, primarily related to our new office building at santana row and other reassessments on our redevelopments, and
•   an increase of $0.9 million related to assembly row and pike &amp; rose.
property operating income property operating income increased $36.6 million, or 6.7%, to $584.6 million in 2017 compared to $548.0 million in 2016. this increase is primarily due to growth in earnings at redevelopment and same-center properties, 2017 acquisitions, assembly row and pike & rose (primarily the lease-up of residential units at pike & rose, the opening of the second phase of retail at pike & rose, and higher lease termination fees), and the acquisition of the six previously unconsolidated clarion joint venture properties in january 2016.
other operating expenses general and administrative expense general and administrative expense increased $2.9 million, or 8.6%, to $36.3 million in 2017 from $33.4 million in 2016. this increase is primarily due to higher personnel related costs.
39
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense increased $22.5 million, or 11.6%, to $216.1 million in 2017 from $193.6 million in 2016. this increase is primarily due to 2017 acquisitions, redevelopment properties (largely the new office building at santana row), assembly row and pike & rose, and same-center properties.
operating income operating income increased $11.3 million, or 3.5%, to $332.3 million in 2017 compared to $321.0 million in 2016. this increase is primarily due to growth in earnings at redevelopment and same-center properties, our 2017 acquisitions, assembly row and pike & rose, and the acquisition of the six previously unconsolidated clarion joint venture properties in january 2016, partially offset by higher personnel related costs.
other interest expense interest expense increased $5.1 million, or 5.4%, to $100.1 million in 2017 compared to $95.0 million in 2016. this increase is due primarily to the following:
•   an increase of $16.1 million due to higher borrowings primarily attributable to the $300 million 3.25% senior notes and the $100 million reopening of the 4.5% senior notes both issued in june 2017, the 3.625% senior notes issued in july 2016, and higher weighted average borrowings on our revolving credit facility, partially offset by
•   an increase of $7.5 million in capitalized interest, and
•   a decrease of $3.5 million due to a lower overall weighted average borrowing rate.
gross interest costs were $125.7 million and $113.0 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively. capitalized interest was $25.6 million and $18.0 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively.
early extinguishment of debt the $12.3 million early extinguishment of debt charge in 2017 relates to the make-whole premium paid as part of the early redemption of our 5.90% senior notes on december 31, 2017 and the related write-off of the unamortized discount and debt fees.
gain on sale of real estate and change in control of interests, net the $77.9 million gain on sale of real estate and change in control of interests, net for the year ended december 31, 2017 is primarily due to the following:
•   $45.2 million gain related to the sale of our 150 post street property in august 2017,
•   $15.4 million gain related to the sale of three ground lease parcels at our assembly row property in somerville, massachusetts,
•   $6.5 million gain related to the sale of a parcel of land at our bethesda row property in december 2017,
•   $5.4 million net percentage-of-completion gain, related to residential condominium units under binding contract at our assembly row property, and
•   $4.9 million gain related to the sale of our north lake commons property in september 2017.
the $32.5 million gain on sale of real estate and change in control of interests for the year ended december 31, 2016 is primarily due to the following:
•   $25.7 million gain related to our obtaining control of six properties when we acquired clarion's 70% interest in the partnership that owned those properties. the properties were previously accounted for under the equity method of accounting. we consolidated these assets effective january 13, 2016, and consequently recognized a gain on obtaining the controlling interest,
•   $4.9 million gain related to the reversal of the unused portion of the warranty reserve for condominium units at santana row, as the statutorily mandated latent construction defect period ended in third quarter 2016, and
•   $1.8 million gain related to the sale of a building in coconut grove, florida. our share of the gain, net of noncontrolling interests, was $0.5 million.

property revenues total property revenue increased $57.6 million, or 7.7%, to $801.6 million in 2016 compared to $744.0 million in 2015. the percentage occupied at our shopping centers was 93.3% at december 31, 2016 compared to 93.5% at december 31, 2015. changes in the components of property revenue are discussed below.
rental income rental income consists primarily of minimum rent, cost reimbursements from tenants and percentage rent. rental income increased $58.8 million, or 8.1%, to $786.6 million in 2016 compared to $727.8 million in 2015 due primarily to the following:
•   an increase of $16.9 million attributable to properties acquired in 2015 and 2016,
•   an increase of $15.3 million from the acquisition of the six previously unconsolidated clarion joint venture properties in january 2016,
•   an increase of $11.7 million from assembly row and pike &amp; rose as portions of both projects opened in 2015 and early 2016,
•   an increase of $10.6 million at redevelopment properties due primarily to the lease-up of the point at plaza el segundo, as well as six of our other retail redevelopments, and the opening of the new office building at santana row, partially offset by lower occupancy as we start redeveloping centers, and
•   an increase of $9.5 million at same-center properties due primarily to higher rental rates of approximately $12.8 million, higher recoveries of $1.8 million primarily the net result of higher real estate tax expense offset by lower snow removal expense, partially offset by lower average occupancy of approximately $4.7 million, partially offset by,
41
•   a decrease of $4.8 million due to the sale of our houston street and courtyard shops properties in april 2015 and november 2015, respectively.
other property income other property income decreased $0.8 million, or 6.7%, to $11.0 million in 2016 compared to $11.8 million in 2015. the decrease is primarily due to a decrease in fee income as we no longer earn fees on the former clarion joint venture properties.
property expenses total property expenses increased $20.2 million, or 8.7%, to $253.6 million in 2016 compared to $233.4 million in 2015. changes in the components of property expenses are discussed below.
rental expenses rental expenses increased $10.7 million, or 7.3%, to $158.3 million in 2016 compared to $147.6 million in 2015. this increase is primarily due to the following:
•   an increase of $6.1 million related to properties acquired in 2015 and 2016,
•   an increase of $3.2 million from the acquisition of the six previously unconsolidated clarion joint venture properties in january 2016,
•   an increase of $2.0 million related to assembly row and pike &amp; rose, as portions of both projects opened in 2015 and early 2016,
•   an increase of $2.0 million at redevelopment properties, partially offset by
•   a decrease of $1.9 million in repairs and maintenance expenses at same-center properties primarily due to lower snow removal costs, and
•   a decrease of $1.1 million due to the sale of our houston street and courtyard shops properties in april 2015 and november 2015, respectively.
as a result of the changes in rental income and rental expenses as discussed above, rental expenses as a percentage of rental income plus other property income increased to 19.9% for the year ended december 31, 2016 from 20.0% for the year ended december 31, 2015.
real estate taxes real estate tax expense increased $9.5 million, or 11.0% to $95.3 million in 2016 compared to $85.8 million in 2015 due primarily to the following:
•   an increase of $4.2 million at same-center properties due to higher assessments,
•   an increase of $2.2 million from properties acquired in 2015 and 2016,
•   an increase of $1.9 million due to the acquisition of the six previously unconsolidated clarion joint venture properties in january 2016,
•   an increase of $1.1 million from redevelopment properties, and
•   an increase of $0.8 million related to assembly row and pike &amp; rose, partially offset by
•   a decrease of $0.8 million due to the sale of our houston street and courtyard shops properties in april 2015 and november 2015, respectively.
property operating income property operating income increased $37.4 million, or 7.3%, to $548.0 million in 2016 compared to $510.6 million in 2015. this increase is primarily due to growth in earnings at same-center and redevelopment properties, the acquisition of the six previously unconsolidated clarion joint venture properties in january 2016, portions of assembly row and pike & rose opening in 2015 and early 2016, and properties acquired in 2015, partially offset by the sale of our houston street and courtyard shops properties in april 2015 and november 2015, respectively.
42
other operating expense general and administrative expense general and administrative expense decreased $2.2 million, or 6.3%, to $33.4 million in 2016 from $35.6 million in 2015. this increase is primarily due to lower transaction costs, partially offset by higher personnel related costs.
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense increased $18.8 million, or 10.7%, to $193.6 million in 2016 from $174.8 million in 2015. this increase is due primarily to the acquisition of the six previously unconsolidated clarion joint venture properties in january 2016, assembly row and pike & rose, depreciation on redevelopment related assets, and properties acquired in 2015.
operating income operating income increased $20.8 million, or 6.9%, to $321.0 million in 2016 compared to $300.2 million in 2015. this increase is primarily due to properties acquired in 2015, portions of assembly row and pike & rose opening in 2015 and early 2016, growth in earnings at redevelopment and same-center properties, and the acquisition of the six previously unconsolidated clarion joint venture properties in january 2016, partially offset by the sale of our houston street and courtyard shops properties in april 2015 and november 2015, respectively.
other interest expense interest expense increased $2.4 million, or 2.6%, to $95.0 million in 2016 compared to $92.6 million in 2015. this increase is due primarily to an increase of $8.6 million due to higher borrowings, partially offset by a decrease of $6.2 million due to a lower overall weighted average borrowing rate.
gross interest costs were $113.0 million and $110.7 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively. capitalized interest was $18.0 million and $18.1 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively.
early extinguishment of debt the $19.1 million early extinguishment of debt in 2015 relates to the make-whole premium paid as part of the early redemption of our 6.20% senior notes in the second quarter of 2015, partially offset by the related net write-off of unamortized premium and debt fees.
gain on sale of real estate the $32.5 million gain on sale of real estate and change in control of interests is primarily the result of our obtaining control of six properties when we acquired clarion's 70% interest in the partnership that owned those properties (see discussion in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements). the properties were previously accounted for under the equity method of accounting. we consolidated these assets effective january 13, 2016, and consequently recognized a gain of $25.7 million upon obtaining the controlling interest. 2016 also included a $1.8 million gain related to the may 2016 sale of a building in coconut grove, florida by an unconsolidated joint venture (our share of the gain, net of noncontrolling interests, was $0.5 million) and a $4.9 million gain due to the reversal of the warranty reserve for condominium units at santana row, as the statutorily mandated latent construction defect period ended in third quarter 2016 and no further claims were filed.
the $28.3 million gain on sale of real estate for 2015 is due to the sale of our houston street property in april 2015 and the sale of our courtyard shops property in november 2015.
liquidity and capital resources due to the nature of our business and strategy, we typically generate significant amounts of cash from operations. the cash generated from operations is primarily paid to our common and preferred shareholders in the form of dividends. as a reit, we must generally make annual distributions to shareholders of at least 90% of our taxable income.
our short-term liquidity requirements consist primarily of normal recurring operating expenses, obligations under our capital and operating leases, regular debt service requirements (including debt service relating to additional or replacement debt, as well as scheduled debt maturities), recurring expenditures, non-recurring expenditures (such as tenant improvements and redevelopments) and dividends to common and preferred shareholders. our long-term capital requirements consist primarily of maturities under our long-term debt agreements, development and redevelopment costs and potential acquisitions.
43
we intend to operate with and maintain a conservative capital structure that will allow us to maintain strong debt service coverage and fixed-charge coverage ratios as part of our commitment to investment-grade debt ratings. in the short and long term, we may seek to obtain funds through the issuance of additional equity, unsecured and/or secured debt financings, joint venture relationships relating to existing properties or new acquisitions, and property dispositions that are consistent with this conservative structure.
at december 31, 2017, we had cash and cash equivalents of $15.2 million and $41.0 million outstanding on our $800.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility which matures on april 20, 2020, subject to two six-month extensions at our option. in addition, we have an option (subject to bank approval) to increase the credit facility through an accordion feature to $1.5 billion. our $275.0 million unsecured term loan that matures on november 21, 2018, subject to a one-year extension at our option, also has an option (subject to bank approval) to increase the term loan through an accordion feature to $350.0 million. as of december 31, 2017, we had the capacity to issue up to $261.3 million in common shares under our atm equity program.
for 2017, the maximum amount of borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility was $344.0 million, the weighted average amount of borrowings outstanding was $147.5 million and the weighted average interest rate, before amortization of debt fees, was 1.9%. during 2017, we raised $716.9 million of net proceeds through three separate public offerings for a total of $575.0 million of senior unsecured notes with a weighted average coupon of 3.47% and term of 13 years and $150.0 million of 5.0% preferred shares in addition to $108.3 million raised under our atm equity program. during 2018, we have only $10.5 million of debt maturing, in addition to our unsecured term loan mentioned above. we currently believe that cash flows from operations, cash on hand, our atm equity program, our revolving credit facility and our general ability to access the capital markets will be sufficient to finance our operations and fund our debt service requirements and capital expenditures.
our overall capital requirements during 2018 will depend upon acquisition opportunities, the level of improvements and redevelopments on existing properties and the timing and cost of development of assembly row, pike & rose and future phases of santana row. while the amount of future expenditures will depend on numerous factors, we expect to see a reduced level of capital investments in our properties under development and redevelopment compared to 2017, which is the result of completing construction on phase ii at both assembly row and pike & rose in 2018. with respect to other capital investments related to our existing properties, we expect to incur levels consistent with prior years. our capital investments will be funded on a short-term basis with cash flow from operations, cash on hand and/or our revolving credit facility, and on a long-term basis, with long-term debt or equity including shares issued under our atm equity program. if necessary, we may access the debt or equity capital markets to finance significant acquisitions. given our past ability to access the capital markets, we expect debt or equity to be available to us. although there is no intent at this time, if market conditions deteriorate, we may also delay the timing of certain development and redevelopment projects as well as limit future acquisitions, reduce our operating expenditures, or re-evaluate our dividend policy.
in addition to conditions in the capital markets which could affect our ability to access those markets, the following factors could affect our ability to meet our liquidity requirements:
•   restrictions in our debt instruments or preferred shares may limit us from incurring debt or issuing equity at all, or on acceptable terms under then-prevailing market conditions; and
•   we may be unable to service additional or replacement debt due to increases in interest rates or a decline in our operating performance.

44
net cash used in investing activities increased $246.6 million to $836.8 million during 2017 from $590.2 million during 2016. the increase was primarily attributable to:
•   a $293.7 million increase in acquisitions of real estate, primarily due to the august 2017 acquisition of six shopping centers in los angeles county, california,
•   a $80.0 million net increase in capital expenditures and leasing costs as we continue to invest in pike &amp; rose, assembly row, santana row, and other current redevelopments, and
•   a $13.3 million decrease in cash flows from mortgage notes receivable primarily due to the payoff of an $11.7 million note receivable in september 2016, partially offset by

•   $145.0 million in net proceeds from the september 29, 2017 issuance of 6,000 series c preferred shares,
•   $41.0 million of borrowings on our revolving credit facility in 2017 as compared to $56.9 million of repayments in 2016,
•   a $12.8 million increase in contributions from noncontrolling interests primarily due to contributions to fund the $50.0 million partial repayment of the plaza el segundo mortgage loan, and
•   an $8.9 million decrease in distributions to and redemptions of noncontrolling interests primarily due to the 2016 acquisition of the 10% noncontrolling interest of a partnership which owns a project in southern california, partially offset by
•   a $210.5 million decrease in net proceeds from the issuance of common shares primarily due to our march 2016 issuance of 1.0 million common shares at $149.43 per share in an underwritten public offering, and 1.2 million common shares under our atm equity program at a weighted average price of $152.92 during 2016, compared to 0.8 million common shares under our atm equity program at a weighted average price of $132.56 during 2017,
•   the december 2017 redemption of $150.0 million of senior notes with a make-whole premium of $11.9 million, and
•   a $15.3 million increase in dividends paid to shareholders due to an increase in the dividend rate and a higher number of shares outstanding.

(1)   fixed rate debt includes our $275.0 million term loan as the rate is effectively fixed by two interest rate swap agreements.
(2)   variable rate debt includes our revolving credit facility, which currently has $41.0 million outstanding and bears interest at libor plus 0.825%.
in addition to the amounts set forth in the table above and other liquidity requirements previously discussed, the following potential commitments exist:
(a) under the terms of the congressional plaza partnership agreement, a minority partner has the right to require us and the other minority partner to purchase its 26.63% interest in congressional plaza at the interest's then-current fair market value. if the other minority partner defaults in their obligation, we must purchase the full interest. based on management's current estimate of fair market value as of december 31, 2017, our estimated liability upon exercise of the put option would range from approximately $81 million to $85 million.
(b) under the terms of various other partnership agreements, the partners have the right to exchange their operating partnership units for cash or the same number of our common shares, at our option. as of december 31, 2017, a total of 787,962 operating partnership units are outstanding.
(c) the other member in montrose crossing has the right to require us to purchase all of its 10.1% interest in montrose crossing at the interest's then-current fair market value. if the other member fails to exercise its put option, we have the right to purchase its interest on or after december 27, 2021 at fair market value. based on management's current estimate of fair market value as of december 31, 2017, our estimated maximum liability upon exercise of the put option would range from approximately $12 million to $13 million.
(d) two of the members in plaza el segundo have the right to require us to purchase their 10.0% and 11.8% ownership interests at the interests' then-current fair market value. if the members fail to exercise their put options, we have the right to purchase each of their interests on or after december 30, 2026 at fair market value. based on management's current estimate of fair market value as of december 31, 2017, our estimated maximum liability upon exercise of the put option would range from approximately $26 million to $29 million.
(e) effective january 1, 2017, the other member in the grove at shrewsbury and brook 35 has the right to require us to purchase all of its approximately 4.8% interest in the grove at shrewsbury and approximately 8.8% interest in brook 35 at the interests' then-current fair market value. based on management's current estimate of fair market value as of december 31, 2017, our estimated maximum liability upon exercise of the put option would range from $9 million to $10 million.

our revolving credit facility, term loan and other debt agreements include financial and other covenants that may limit our operating activities in the future. as of december 31, 2017, we were in compliance with all of the financial and other covenants related to our revolving credit facility, term loan, and senior notes. additionally, as of december 31, 2017, we were in compliance with all of the financial and other covenants that could trigger loan default on our mortgage loans. if we were to breach any of these financial and other covenants and did not cure the breach within an applicable cure period, our lenders could require us to repay the debt immediately and, if the debt is secured, could immediately begin proceedings to take possession of the property securing the loan. many of our debt arrangements, including our public notes, term loan and our revolving credit facility, are cross-defaulted, which means that the lenders under those debt arrangements can put us in default and require immediate repayment of their debt if we breach and fail to cure a default under certain of our other debt obligations. as a result, any default under our debt covenants could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, our results of operations, our ability to meet our obligations and the market value of our shares. our organizational documents do not limit the level or amount of debt that we may incur.
the following is a summary of our scheduled principal repayments as of december 31, 2017:

1)   our $275.0 million unsecured term loan matures on november 21, 2018, subject to a one-year extension at our option.
2)   our $800.0 million revolving credit facility matures on april 20, 2020, subject to two six-month extensions at our option. as of december 31, 2017, there was $41.0 million outstanding under this credit facility.
3)   the total debt maturities differs from the total reported on the consolidated balance sheet due to the unamortized net premium/(discount) and debt issuance costs on mortgage loans, notes payable, and senior notes as of december 31, 2017.
interest rate hedging we may use derivative instruments to manage exposure to variable interest rate risk. we generally enter into interest rate swaps to manage our exposure to variable interest rate risk and treasury locks to manage the risk of interest rates rising prior to the issuance of debt. we enter into derivative instruments that qualify as cash flow hedges and do not enter into derivative instruments for speculative purposes.
the interest rate swaps associated with our cash flow hedges are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. we assess effectiveness of our cash flow hedges both at inception and on an ongoing basis. the effective portion of changes in fair value of the interest rate swaps associated with our cash flow hedges is recorded in other comprehensive income (loss) which is included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) on our consolidated balance sheet and our consolidated statement of shareholders' equity. our cash flow hedges become ineffective if critical terms of the hedging instrument and the debt instrument do not perfectly match such as notional amounts, settlement dates, reset dates, calculation period and libor rate. in addition, we evaluate the default risk of the counterparty by monitoring the credit worthiness of the counterparty which includes reviewing debt ratings and financial performance. however, management does not anticipate non-performance by the counterparty. if a cash flow hedge is deemed ineffective, the ineffective portion of changes in fair value of the interest rate swaps associated with our cash flow hedges is recognized in earnings in the period affected.
as of december 31, 2017, we are party to two interest rate swap agreements that effectively fixed the rate on the term loan at 2.62%. both swaps were designated and qualified as cash flow hedges and were recorded at fair value. hedge ineffectiveness has not impacted earnings in 2017, 2016 and 2015, and we do not anticipate it will have a significant effect in the future.

reit qualification we intend to maintain our qualification as a reit under section 856(c) of the code. as a reit, we generally will not be subject to corporate federal income taxes on income we distribute to our shareholders as long as we satisfy certain technical requirements of the code, including the requirement to distribute at least 90% of our taxable income to our shareholders.
funds from operations funds from operations ("ffo") is a supplemental non-gaap financial measure of real estate companies' operating performance. the national association of real estate investment trusts ("nareit") defines ffo as follows: net income, computed in accordance with u.s. gaap, plus real estate related depreciation and amortization and excluding extraordinary items and gains and losses on the sale of real estate, and impairment write-downs of depreciable real estate. we compute ffo in accordance with the nareit definition, and we have historically reported our ffo available for common shareholders in addition to our net income and net cash provided by operating activities. it should be noted that ffo:
•   does not represent cash flows from operating activities in accordance with gaap (which, unlike ffo, generally reflects all cash effects of transactions and other events in the determination of net income);
•   should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indication of our performance; and
•   is not necessarily indicative of cash flow as a measure of liquidity or ability to fund cash needs, including the payment of dividends.
we consider ffo available for common shareholders a meaningful, additional measure of operating performance primarily because it excludes the assumption that the value of the real estate assets diminishes predictably over time, as implied by the historical cost convention of gaap and the recording of depreciation. we use ffo primarily as one of several means of assessing our operating performance in comparison with other reits. comparison of our presentation of ffo to similarly titled measures for other reits may not necessarily be meaningful due to possible differences in the application of the nareit definition used by such reits.
an increase or decrease in ffo available for common shareholders does not necessarily result in an increase or decrease in aggregate distributions because our board of trustees is not required to increase distributions on a quarterly basis unless necessary for us to maintain reit status. however, we must distribute at least 90% of our taxable income to remain qualified as a reit. therefore, a significant increase in ffo will generally require an increase in distributions to shareholders although not necessarily on a proportionate basis.
the reconciliation of net income to ffo available for common shareholders is as follows:

_____________________
(1)   for the year ended december 31, 2017, dividends on our series 1 preferred stock are not deducted in the calculation of ffo available to common shareholders, as the related shares are dilutive and included in "weighted average common shares, diluted." the weighted average common shares used to compute ffo per diluted common share also includes
50
operating partnership units that were excluded from the computation of diluted eps. conversion of these operating partnership units is dilutive in the computation of ffo per diluted common share but is anti-dilutive for the computation of diluted eps for the periods presented.
(2)   if the $12.3 million and the $19.1 million early extinguishment of debt charge incurred in 2017 and 2015, respectively, was excluded, our ffo available for common shareholders for 2017 and 2015 would have been $432.2 million and $371.9 million, respectively, and ffo available for common shareholders, per diluted share would have been $5.91 and $5.32, respectively.

item 1a. risk factors statements in this annual report on form 10-k and elsewhere that are forward-looking involve risks and uncertainties which may affect the company's actual results of operations. certain of these risks and uncertainties which have affected and, in the future, could affect the company's actual results are discussed below. the company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements made due to new information or future events. investors are cautioned not to place undue emphasis on these statements.
the following risk factors should be read carefully in connection with evaluation of the company's business and any forward-looking statements made in this annual report on form 10-k and elsewhere. see the section entitled "forward-looking statements" set forth above. any of the following risks or others discussed in this annual report on form 10-k or the company's other sec filings could materially adversely affect the company's business, operating results and financial condition.
it may be difficult for us to implement our strategies for maintaining organic growth.
some of the markets in which we compete are experiencing slower growth and we face significant competition across many of our product lines. competitors include companies ranging from start-up companies, which may be able to more quickly respond to customers' needs, to large multinational companies, which may have greater financial, marketing, operational, and research and development resources than the company. in addition, consolidation trends in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology and diagnostics industries have served to create fewer customer accounts and to concentrate purchasing decisions for some customers, resulting in increased pricing pressure on the company. moreover, customers may believe that consolidated businesses are better able to compete as sole source vendors, and therefore prefer to purchase from such businesses. the entry into the market by manufacturers in china, india and other low-cost manufacturing locations is also creating increased pricing and competitive pressures, particularly in developing markets. failure to anticipate and respond to competitors' actions may impact the company's future sales and earnings.
to address this issue, we are pursuing a number of strategies to improve our internal growth, including:
•   strengthening our presence in selected geographic markets;

•   allocating research and development funding to products with higher growth prospects;

•   developing new applications for our technologies;

•   continuing key opinion leader initiatives;

•   finding new markets for our products; and

•   continuing the development of commercial tools and infrastructure to increase and support cross-selling opportunities of products and services to take advantage of our depth in product offerings.

we may not be able to successfully implement these strategies, and these strategies may not result in the expected growth of our business.
our acquisition growth strategy pose financial, management and other risks and challenges.
we routinely explore acquiring other businesses and assets, and have completed nine acquisitions and several investments in the last three years. however, we may be unable to identify or complete promising acquisitions for many reasons, including competition among buyers, the high valuations of businesses in our industry, the need for regulatory and other approvals, and availability of capital. when we do identify and consummate acquisitions, we may face financial, managerial and operational challenges, including diversion of management attention, difficulty with integrating acquired businesses, integration of different corporate cultures, increased expenses, assumption of unknown liabilities, indemnities, potential disputes with the sellers, and the need to evaluate the financial systems of and establish internal controls for acquired entities. there can be no assurance that we will engage in any additional acquisitions or that we will be able to do so on terms that will result in any expected benefits. in addition, acquisitions financed with borrowings could make us more vulnerable to business downturns and could negatively affect our earnings due to higher leverage and interest expense.
10
we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings if our goodwill and other amortizable intangible assets, or other investments become impaired.
we are required under generally accepted accounting principles to test goodwill for impairment at least annually and to review our goodwill, amortizable intangible assets, and other assets acquired through merger and acquisition activity, for impairment when events or changes in circumstance indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. factors that could lead to impairment of goodwill, amortizable intangible assets, and other assets acquired via acquisitions include significant adverse changes in the business climate and actual or projected operating results (affecting our company as a whole or affecting any particular segment) and declines in the financial condition of our business. we may be required in the future to record additional charges to earnings if our goodwill, amortizable intangible assets or other investments become impaired. any such charge would adversely impact our financial results.
in addition, the company's expansion strategies include collaborations and investments in joint ventures and companies developing new products related to the company's business. these strategies carry risks that objectives will not be achieved and future earnings will be adversely affected. for example, the company has an approximate 13% equity investment in publicly traded chemocentryx, inc. (nasdaq: ccxi) that is valued at $59.6 million as of june 30, 2017. the ownership of ccxi shares is very concentrated, the share price is highly volatile and there is limited trading of the shares. in fiscal 2017, we also invested and hold a minority interest in privately-held astute medical, inc., a diagnostics company developing new diagnostics tests relating to kidney injury. while their initial product is on the market, its adoption and success is highly uncertain, and our initial investment may be significantly impaired if it does not have market success. any diminution in the value of these investments could result in future dilution of our investments or materially impact our financial statements.
significant developments stemming from the recent u.s. elections and the u.k.'s referendum on membership in the eu could have an adverse effect on us.
the current congress is considering significant changes to, or replacement or elimination of the patient protection and affordable care act, and government negotiation/regulation of drug prices paid by government programs. the new u.s. administration has called for substantial changes to trade agreements and has raised the possibility of imposing significant increases on tariffs on goods imported into the united states, particularly from china and mexico. these and other potential shifts in law, regulation and policy could adversely affect operating results and our business.
in a referendum vote held on june 23, 2016, the united kingdom (uk) voted to leave the european union (eu). subsequently, on march 29, 2017, the uk invoked article 50 of the lisbon treaty to formally begin the withdrawal process. the impact of this action has caused and may continue to cause global economic uncertainty and currency exchange rate fluctuations. although it is unknown what the terms of the uk's future relationship with the eu will be, it is possible that there will be disruption to the uk and eu economies, as well as greater restrictions on imports and exports between the uk and the eu and increased regulatory and tax complexities. any of these factors could adversely affect customer demand, our relationships with customers and suppliers, and our business and financial results, particularly since our european headquarters and shipping facilities are currently located in the uk. additionally, attracting and retaining qualified employees who are citizens of eu countries to our uk facilities may be more difficult given the uncertainties resulting from the uk withdrawal.
we are subject to financial, operating, legal and compliance risk associated with global operations.
we engage in business globally, with approximately 31% of our sales revenue in fiscal 2017 coming from outside the u.s. in addition, one of our strategies is to expand geographically, particularly in china and in developing countries, both through distribution and through direct operations. this subjects us to a number of risks, including international economic, political, and labor conditions; currency fluctuations; tax laws (including u.s. taxes on foreign subsidiaries); increased financial accounting and reporting burdens and complexities; unexpected changes in, or impositions of, legislative or regulatory requirements; failure of laws to protect intellectual property rights adequately; inadequate local infrastructure and difficulties in managing and staffing international operations; delays resulting from difficulty in obtaining export licenses for certain technology; tariffs, quotas and other trade barriers and restrictions; transportation delays; operating in locations with a higher incidence of corruption and fraudulent business practices; and other factors beyond our control, including terrorism, war, natural disasters, climate change and diseases.
11
the application of laws and regulations implicating global transactions is often unclear and may at times conflict. compliance with these laws and regulations may involve significant costs or require changes in our business practices that result in reduced revenue and profitability. non-compliance could also result in fines, damages, criminal sanctions, prohibited business conduct, and damage to our reputation. we incur additional legal compliance costs associated with our global operations and could become subject to legal penalties in foreign countries if it does not comply with local laws and regulations, which may be substantially different from those in the u.s.
we continue to expand our operations in countries with developing economies, where it may be common to engage in business practices that are prohibited by u.s. regulations applicable to the company, such as the foreign corrupt practices act. although we implement policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws, there can be no assurance that all of our employees, contractors, and agents, as well as those companies to which we outsource certain aspects of our business operations, including those based in foreign countries where practices which violate such u.s. laws may be customary, will comply with our internal policies. any such non-compliance, even if prohibited by our internal policies, could have an adverse effect on our business and result in significant fines or penalties.
changes in economic conditions for our customers could negatively impact our revenues and earnings.
our biotechnology and protein platforms products are sold primarily to research scientists at pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and at university and government research institutions. research and development spending by our customers and the availability of government research funding can fluctuate due to changes in available resources, mergers of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, spending priorities, general economic conditions and institutional and governmental budgetary policies. our diagnostics segment products are intended primarily for the medical diagnostics market, which relies largely on government healthcare-related policies and funding. changes in government reimbursement for certain diagnostic tests or reductions in overall healthcare spending could negatively impact our customers and, correspondingly, our sales to them. the u.s. and global economies recently experienced a period of economic downturn and have been slow to recover in some parts of the world. in japan, government investment in biotechnology research remains weak. such downturns, and other reductions or delays in governmental funding, could cause customers to delay or forego purchases of our products. we carry essentially no backlog of orders and changes in the level of orders received and filled daily can cause fluctuations in quarterly revenues and earnings.
we have identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting which could, if not remediated, harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations.
our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over our financial reporting, as defined in rule 13a-15(f) under the securities exchange act. as disclosed in item 9a, at the beginning of fiscal 2017 management identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting involving the effectiveness of the information and communication, and monitoring processes resulting in a lack of effective controls over general information technology controls (gitc) for certain applications. a material weakness is defined as a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. as a result of these material weaknesses, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective based on criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organization of the treadway commission in internal control-an integrated framework (2013 framework). we have developed and implemented a remediation plan designed to address these material weaknesses, but have not yet had sufficient time to fully and effective implement and test the additional controls established in that plan. any failure to complete the implementation of effective internal controls could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. inadequate internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our common stock, and may require us to incur additional costs to improve our internal control system.
12
our success will be dependent on recruiting and retaining highly qualified personnel and creating a new culture that includes the employees joining through acquisition.
recruiting and retaining qualified scientific, production, sales and marketing, and management personnel are critical to our success. our anticipated growth and its expected expansion into areas and activities requiring additional expertise will require the addition of new personnel and the development of additional expertise by existing personnel. we also operate in several geographic locations where competition for talent is strong, making employee retention particularly challenging in those locations. our growth by acquisition also creates challenges in retaining employees. as we integrate past and future acquisitions and evolve our corporate culture to incorporate the new workforces, some employees may not find such integration or cultural changes appealing. the failure to attract and retain such personnel could adversely affect our business.
cyber security risks and the failure to maintain the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of our computer hardware, software, and internet applications and related tools and functions could result in damage to our reputation and/or subject us to costs, fines, or lawsuits.
the integrity and protection of our own data, and that of our customers and employees, is critical to our business. the regulatory environment governing information, security and privacy laws is increasingly demanding and continues to evolve. maintaining compliance with applicable security and privacy regulations may increase our operating costs and/or adversely impact our ability to market our products and services to customers. although our computer and communications hardware is protected through physical and software safeguards, it is still vulnerable to fire, storm, flood, power loss, earthquakes, telecommunications failures, physical or software break-ins, software viruses, and similar events. these events could lead to the unauthorized access, disclosure and use of non-public information. the techniques used by criminal elements to attack computer systems are sophisticated, change frequently and may originate from less regulated and remote areas of the world. as a result, we may not be able to address these techniques proactively or implement adequate preventative measures. if our computer systems are compromised, we could be subject to fines, damages, litigation, and enforcement actions, customers could curtail or cease using its applications, and we could lose trade secrets, the occurrence of which could harm our business.
we are dependent on maintaining our intellectual property rights.
our success depends in part on our ability to protect and maintain our intellectual property, including trade secrets. if we fail to protect our intellectual property, third parties may be able to compete more effectively against us, we may lose our technological or competitive advantage, or we may incur substantial litigation costs in our attempts to recover or restrict use of our intellectual property. we attempt to protect trade secrets in part through confidentiality agreements, but those agreements can be breached, and if they are, there may not be an adequate remedy. if trade secrets become publicly known, we could lose our competitive position.
we also attempt to protect and maintain intellectual property through the patent process. as of june 30, 2017, we owned or exclusively licensed 115 granted u.s. patents and approximately 100 pending patent applications. we cannot be confident that any of our currently pending or future patent applications will result in granted patents, and we cannot predict how long it will take for such patents to be granted. it is possible that, if patents are granted to us, others will design around our patented technologies. further, other parties may challenge any patents granted to us and courts or regulatory agencies may hold our patents to be invalid or unenforceable. we may not be successful in defending challenges made against our patents and patent applications. any successful third-party challenge to our patents could result in the unenforceability or invalidity of such patents. our ability to establish or maintain a technological or competitive advantage over our competitors may be diminished because of these uncertainties. to the extent our intellectual property offers inadequate protection, or is found to be invalid or unenforceable, we would be exposed to a greater risk of direct competition. if our intellectual property does not provide adequate coverage of our competitors' products, our competitive position could be adversely affected, as could our business. both the patent application process and the process of managing patent disputes can be time consuming and expensive.
13
we may be involved in disputes to determine the scope, coverage and validity of others' proprietary rights, or to defend against third-party claims of intellectual property infringement, any of which could be time-intensive and costly and may adversely impact our business.
our success depends in part on its ability to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others, and to obtain licenses where necessary or appropriate. we have obtained and continue to negotiate licenses to produce a number of products claimed to be owned by others. since we have not conducted a patent infringement study for each of our products, it is possible that some of our products may unintentionally infringe patents of third parties.
we have been and may in the future be sued by third parties alleging that we are infringing their intellectual property rights. these lawsuits are expensive, take significant time, and divert management's focus from other business concerns. if we are found to be infringing the intellectual property of others, we could be required to cease certain activities, alter our products or processes or pay licensing fees. this would cause unexpected costs and delays which may have a material adverse effect on us. if we are unable to obtain a required license on acceptable terms, or unable to design around any third party patent, we may be unable to sell some of our products and services, which could result in reduced revenue. in addition, if we do not prevail, a court may find damages or award other remedies in favor of the opposing party in any of these suits, which may adversely affect our earnings.
the company relies heavily on internal manufacturing and related operations to produce, package and distribute its products which, if disrupted, could materially impair our business operations.
the company's internal quality control, packaging and distribution operations support the majority of the company's sales. since certain company products must comply with food and drug administration quality system regulations and because in all instances, the company creates value for its customers through the development of high-quality products, any significant decline in quality or disruption of operations for any reason, particularly at the minneapolis facility, could adversely affect sales and customer relationships, and therefore adversely affect the business. while the company has taken certain steps to manage these operational risks, and while insurance coverage may reimburse, in whole or in part, for losses related to such disruptions, the company's future sales growth and earnings may be adversely affected by perceived disruption risks or actual disruptions.
we have entered into and drawn on a revolving credit facility. the burden of this additional debt could adversely affect us, make us more vulnerable to adverse economic or industry conditions, and prevent us from funding our expansion strategy.
in connection with the acquisition of advanced cell diagnostics on august 1, 2016, we modified our revolving credit facility, governed by a credit agreement on july 28, 2016. the credit agreement provides for a revolving credit facility of $400 million. borrowings under the credit agreement bear interest at a variable rate. as of august 30, 2017, the company had drawn $368.5 million under the credit agreement.
the terms of the credit agreement and the burden of the indebtedness incurred thereunder could have negative consequences for us, such as:
•   limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund our working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, expansion strategy, or other needs;

•   increasing our vulnerability to, and reducing our flexibility in planning for, adverse changes in economic, industry and competitive conditions; and

•   increasing our vulnerability to increases in interest rates.

the credit agreement also contains negative covenants that limit our ability to engage in specified types of transactions. these covenants limit our ability to, among other things, sell, lease or transfer any properties or assets, with certain exceptions; and enter into certain merger, consolidation or other reorganization transactions, with certain exceptions.
14
a breach of any of these covenants could result in an event of default under our credit facility. upon the occurrence of an event of default, the lender could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under such facility to be immediately due and payable and terminate all commitments to extend further credit. in addition, the company would be subject to additional restrictions if an event of default exists under the credit agreement, such as a prohibition on the payment of cash dividends.
our share price will fluctuate.
over the last several years, stock markets in general and our common stock in particular have experienced significant price and volume volatility. both the market price and the daily trading volume of our common stock may continue to be subject to significant fluctuations due not only to general stock market conditions but also to a change in sentiment in the market regarding our operations and business prospects. in addition to the risk factors discussed above, the price and volume volatility of our common stock may be affected by:
•   operating results that vary from our financial guidance or the expectations of securities analysts and investors;

•   the financial performance of the major end markets that we target;

•   the operating and securities price performance of companies that investors consider to be comparable to us;

•   announcements of strategic developments, acquisitions and other material events by us or our competitors; and

•   changes in global financial markets and global economies and general market conditions, such as interest or foreign exchange rates, commodity and equity prices and the value of financial assets.

dividends on our common stock could be reduced or eliminated in the future.
for the past 9 years, our board has consistently declared quarterly dividends of $0.25 to $0.32 cents per share. in the future, our board may determine to reduce or eliminate our common stock dividend in order to fund investments for growth, repurchase shares or conserve capital resources.

overall results for fiscal 2017, consolidated net sales increased 13% as compared to fiscal 2016. after adjusting for the impacts of the space and acd acquisitions in fiscal 2016, as well as foreign currency fluctuations, organic sales for the year increased 6% with currency translation having a negative impact of 1% and acquisitions contributing 8%. the organic growth was broad-based, with the company achieving growth in all three of its reporting segments. a strong biopharma end-market in the us and europe and additional market demand for protein platforms instruments were the biggest contributing factors to organic growth.
consolidated gaap net earnings decreased 27% for fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016. after adjusting for acquisition related costs, stock based compensation, and certain income tax items in both years, adjusted net earnings increased 4% in fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016. adjusted earnings growth was driven by increased revenue partially offset by negative mix and a negative impact from foreign currency.
for fiscal 2016, consolidated net sales increased 10% as compared to fiscal 2015. after adjusting for the impact of the cliniqa acquisition in fiscal 2016, as well as foreign currency fluctuations, organic sales for the year increased 6% with currency translation having a negative impact of 2% and acquisitions contributing 6%. the organic growth was broad-based, with the company achieving growth in all three of its segments reporting segments. a strong bio-pharma end-market in the us and significant government funding of life science research in china and additional market demand for protein platform instruments were the biggest contributing factors impacting organic growth.
consolidated gaap net earnings decreased 3% for fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015. after adjusting for acquisition related costs, stock based compensation, and certain income tax items in both years, adjusted net earnings increased 3% in fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015. adjusted earnings growth was driven by increased revenue partially offset by negative mix and a negative impact from foreign currency.

results of operations net sales consolidated organic net sales exclude the impact of net sales contributed by companies acquired during the fiscal year and the effect of the change from the prior year in exchange rates used to convert sales in foreign currencies (primarily the euro, british pound sterling, and chinese yuan) into u.s. dollars.
consolidated net sales growth was as follows:

in fiscal 2017, biotechnology segment net sales increased 15% compared to fiscal 2016. organic growth for the segment was 4% for the fiscal year, with acquisitions contributing 13% and foreign currency translation having an unfavorable impact of 2%. antibody and assay product categories drove growth. the growth in antibodies was led by double-digit growth in the novus brand. the growth in assays was by luminex-based products the company makes and sells and royalties received from luminex assay suppliers who use the company's content in the production of their assays.
in fiscal 2017, the protein platforms segment net sales increased 18% compared to fiscal 2016. organic growth for the segment was 19% with acquisitions contributing 1% and foreign currency translation having an unfavorable impact of 2%. growth was broad-based and led by additional market demand for simple western (wes) instruments and consumables, and the simple plex (ella) and biologics (maurice) product lines.
in fiscal 2017, diagnostics segment net sales increased 3% compared to fiscal 2016. all results for fiscal 2017 are organic. timing of oem orders had a negative impact on fiscal 2017 results. mid-single digit sales growth in blood and glucose-based controls was partially offset by the timing of oem shipments from the diagnostic assay and reagent product lines.
in fiscal 2016, biotechnology segment net sales increased 3% compared to fiscal 2015. organic growth for the segment was 6% for the fiscal year, with foreign currency translation having an unfavorable impact of 3%. we grew in all major geographies, most notably in china and from biopharma customers in the u.s. and europe. japan was the only notable exception, where demand was weak due to delayed funding from japanese government agencies.
21
in fiscal 2016, the protein platforms segment net sales increased 17% compared to fiscal 2015. organic growth for the segment was 14% with acquisitions contributing 5% and foreign currency translation having an unfavorable impact of 2%. additional market demand for simple western instruments and consumables, a new instrument product launch in the biologics (maurice) product line, and simple plex (ella) instrument and consumable sales, the elisa-multiplexing solution that was the key technology acquired as part of the cyvek acquisition in fiscal 2015, all drove growth in this segment. there was no revenue from the zephyrus acquisition in fiscal 2016.
in fiscal 2016, diagnostics segment net sales increased 34% compared to fiscal 2015. included in fiscal 2016 diagnostics segment net sales was $26.6 million generated by the acquisition of cliniqa in july 2015, contributing essentially all of the growth. solid organic growth in the hematology controls product line was offset by customer delayed projects in the glucose controls product line due to reimbursement pricing pressures in that particular market segment.
gross margins consolidated gross margins were 67%, 67% and 68% in fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. consolidated gross margins were negatively impacted as a result of purchase accounting related to inventory and intangible assets acquired during fiscal 2017, 2016, 2015 and prior years. under purchase accounting, inventory is valued at fair value less expected selling and marketing costs, resulting in reduced margins in future periods as the inventory is sold. excluding the impact of acquired inventory sold and amortization of intangibles, adjusted gross margins were 71%, 71% and 72% in fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
a reconciliation of the reported consolidated gross margin percentages, adjusted for acquired inventory sold and intangible amortization included in cost of sales, is as follows:
year ended june 30,

2017              2016              2015
consolidated gross margin percentage                      66.5   %          67.5   %          67.9   %
identified adjustments:
costs recognized upon sale of acquired inventory           0.6   %           1.1   %           1.5   %
amortization of intangibles                                4.1   %           2.2   %           2.2   %
adjusted gross margin percentage                          71.2   %          70.8   %          71.6   %
fluctuations in adjusted gross margins, as a percentage of net sales, have primarily resulted from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and changes in product mix. in fiscal 2017, the biggest impact to gross margin as compared to fiscal 2016, was the change in product mix associated with the acquisition of acd. in fiscal 2016, the biggest impact to gross margin, as compared to fiscal 2015, was the change in product mix associated with the acquisition of cliniqa. in fiscal 2015, the biggest impact to gross margin, as compared to fiscal 2014, was the change in product mix associated with the acquisitions of novus, proteinsimple, and cyvek. we expect that, in the future, gross margins will continue to be impacted by the mix of our portfolio growing at different rates as well as future acquisitions.
management uses adjusted operating results to monitor and evaluate performance of the company's three business segments. since these results are used for this purpose, they are also considered to be prepared in accordance with gaap. segment gross margins, as a percentage of net sales, were as follows:
year ended june 30,

2017              2016              2015
biotechnology                                          80.5   %          80.0   %          79.8   %

critical accounting policies management's discussion and analysis of the company's financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company's consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america (u.s. gaap). the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. on an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates. management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
the company has identified the policies outlined below as critical to its business operations and an understanding of results of operations. the listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all accounting policies; investors should also refer to note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k.
business combinations we allocate the purchase price of acquired businesses to the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the date of the acquisition. the calculations used to determine the fair value of the long-lived assets acquired, primarily intangible assets, can be complex and require significant judgment. we weigh many factors when completing these estimates including, but not limited to, the nature of the acquired company's business; its competitive position, strengths, and challenges; its historical financial position and performance; estimated customer retention rates; discount rates; and future plans for the combined entity. we may also engage independent valuation specialists, when necessary, to assist in the fair value calculations for significant acquired long-lived assets.
the fair value of acquired technology is estimated, at times, using the relief from royalty method, which calculates the cost savings associated with owning rather than licensing the technology. assumed royalty rates are applied to the projected revenues for the remaining useful life of the technology to estimate the royalty savings. the fair value of acquired technology may also be estimated using the cost of reproduction method under which the primary components of the technology are identified and the estimated cost to reproduce the technology is calculated based on historical data provided by the acquirees. the fair value of trade names is estimated using the relief from royalty method, which calculates the cost savings associated with owning rather than licensing the trade name. assumed royalty rates are applied to the projected revenues for the remaining useful life of the trade name to estimate the royalty savings. we generally estimate the fair value of acquired customer relationships using the multi-period excess earnings method. this valuation model estimates revenues and cash flows derived from the asset and then deducts portions of the cash flow that can be attributed to supporting assets, such as a brand name or fixed assets, that contributed to the generation of the cash flows. the resulting cash flow, which is attributable solely to the customer list asset, is then discounted at a rate of return commensurate with the risk of the asset to calculate a present value. the fair value of acquired customer relationships may also be estimated by discounting the estimated cash flows expected to be generated by the assets. assumptions used in these calculations include same-customer revenue growth rates and estimated customer retention rates based on the acquirees' historical information.
we estimate the fair value of liabilities for contingent consideration by discounting to present value the probability weighted contingent payments expected to be made. assumptions used in these calculations include discount rates, projected financial results of the acquired businesses based on our most recent internal forecasts, and factors indicating the probability of achieving the forecasted results. the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. goodwill is not amortized, but is subject to impairment testing on at least an annual basis.
we are also required to estimate the useful lives of the acquired intangible assets, which determines the amount of acquisition-related amortization expense we will record in future periods. each reporting period, we evaluate the remaining useful lives of our amortizable intangibles to determine whether events or circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period of amortization.
while we use our best estimates and assumptions, our fair value estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. as a result, during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. any adjustments required after the measurement period are recorded in the consolidated statements of earnings.

the judgments required in determining the estimated fair values and expected useful lives assigned to each class of assets and liabilities acquired can significantly affect net income. for example, different classes of assets will have useful lives that differ. consequently, to the extent a longer-lived asset is ascribed greater value than a shorter-lived asset, net income in a given period may be higher. additionally, assigning a lower value to amortizable intangibles would result in a higher amount assigned to goodwill. as goodwill is not amortized, this would benefit net income in a given period, although goodwill is subject to annual impairment analysis impairment of goodwill and intangible assets goodwill goodwill was $579.0 million as of june 30, 2017, which represented 37% of total assets. goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis in the fourth quarter of each year, or more frequently if events occur or circumstances change that could indicate a possible impairment.
to analyze goodwill for impairment, we must assign our goodwill to individual reporting units. identification of reporting units includes an analysis of the components that comprise each of our operating segments, which considers, among other things, the manner in which we operate our business and the availability of discrete financial information. components of an operating segment are aggregated to form one reporting unit if the components have similar economic characteristics. we periodically review our reporting units to ensure that they continue to reflect the manner in which we operate our business.
2017 goodwill impairment analysis in completing our 2017 annual goodwill impairment analysis, we elected to perform a quantitative assessment for all of our reporting units. a quantitative assessment involves comparing the carrying value of the reporting unit, including goodwill, to its estimated fair value. carrying value is based on the assets and liabilities associated with the operations of the reporting unit, which often requires the allocation of shared or corporate items among reporting units. in accordance with asu 2017-04, a goodwill impairment charge is recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit. in determining the fair values of our reporting units, we utilized the income approach. the income approach is a valuation technique under which we estimated future cash flows using the reporting unit's financial forecast from the perspective of an unrelated market participant. using historical trending and internal forecasting techniques, we projected revenue and applied our fixed and variable cost experience rates to the projected revenue to arrive at the future cash flows. a terminal value was then applied to the projected cash flow stream. future estimated cash flows were discounted to their present value to calculate the estimated fair value. the discount rate used was the value-weighted average of our estimated cost of capital derived using both known and estimated customary market metrics. in determining the estimated fair value of a reporting unit, we were required to estimate a number of factors, including projected operating results, terminal growth rates, economic conditions, anticipated future cash flows, the discount rate and the allocation of shared or corporate items. because our 2017 quantitative analysis included all of our reporting units, the summation of our reporting units' fair values was compared to our consolidated fair value, as indicated by our market capitalization, to evaluate the reasonableness of our calculations.
the quantitative assessment completed as of june 30, 2017 indicated that all of the reporting units had a substantial amount of headroom. this impairment assessment is sensitive to changes in forecasted cash flows, as well as our selected discount rate. changes in the reporting unit's results, forecast assumptions and estimates could materially affect the estimation of the fair value of the reporting units.
29
2016 and 2015 goodwill impairment analysis the company used a qualitative test for all reporting units during the fourth quarter for fiscal year 2016 and fiscal year 2015 with one exception. the company elected to utilize a quantitative test for the protein platforms reporting unit for fiscal year 2016 using the previously described income approach given that this was a newer reporting unit created primarily through acquisitions. the qualitative analyses for our other reporting units completed during 2016 and 2015 evaluated factors including, but not limited to, economic, market and industry conditions, cost factors and the overall financial performance of the reporting units. in completing these assessments, we noted no changes in events or circumstances which indicated that it was more likely than not that the fair value of any reporting unit was less than its carrying amount. based on the testing performed for the protein platforms reporting unit, fair value exceeded carrying value by a substantial amount and no adjustment to the carrying value of goodwill was necessary.
there has been no impairment of goodwill since the adoption of financial accounting standards board ("fasb") asc 350 guidance for goodwill and other intangibles on july 1, 2002.
amortizable intangible assets we periodically review our amortizable intangible assets, the net value of which was $452.0 million and $310.5 million as of june 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively, for impairment and to assess whether significant events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. such circumstances may include a significant decrease in the market price of an asset, a significant adverse change in the manner in which the asset is being used or in its physical condition or history of operating or cash flow losses associated with the use of the asset. impairment losses could occur when the carrying amount of an asset exceeds the anticipated future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. the amount of the impairment loss to be recorded, if any, is calculated as the excess of the asset's carrying value over its estimated fair value.
in addition, we periodically reassess the estimated remaining useful lives of our long-lived and amortizable intangible assets. changes to estimated useful lives would impact the amount of depreciation and amortization expense recorded in earnings. we have experienced no significant changes in the carrying value or estimated remaining useful lives of our long-lived or amortizable intangible assets.
new accounting pronouncements information regarding the accounting policies adopted during fiscal 2017 and those not yet adopted can be found under caption "note 1: description of business and summary of significant accounting policies" of the notes to the consolidated financial statements appear in item 8 of this report.
subsequent events in july 2017, management determined that cyvek achieved the required revenue threshold for the additional consideration payment discussed in note 4 resulting in a payment of $34.0 million to the former owners.
on september 5, 2017, bio-techne acquired trevigen inc for approximately $11.0 million. the purchase accounting for this acquisition is in progress.
non-gaap financial measures this annual report on form 10-k, including "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" in item 7, contains financial measures that have not been calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the u.s. (gaap). these non-gaap measures include:
●   adjusted gross margin

●   adjusted net earnings

●   adjusted net earnings growth

●   adjusted effective tax rate

we provide these measures as additional information regarding our operating results. we use these non-gaap measures internally to evaluate our performance and in making financial and operational decisions, including with respect to incentive compensation. we believe that our presentation of these measures provides investors with greater transparency with respect to our results of operations and that these measures are useful for period-to-period comparison of results.

our non-gaap financial measures for adjusted gross margin and adjusted net earnings exclude the costs recognized upon the sale of acquired inventory, amortization of acquisition intangibles, and acquisition related expenses. the company excludes amortization of purchased intangible assets and purchase accounting adjustments, including costs recognized upon the sale of acquired inventory and acquisition-related expenses, from this measure because they occur as a result of specific events, and are not reflective of our internal investments, the costs of developing, producing, supporting and selling our products, and the other ongoing costs to support our operating structure. additionally, these amounts can vary significantly from period to period based on current activity.
the company's non-gaap adjusted net earnings also excludes stock based compensation expense and certain adjustments to income tax expense. stock based compensation is excluded from non-gaap adjusted earnings because of the nature of this charge, specifically the varying available valuation methodologies, subjective assumptions, and the variety of award types. the company independently calculates a non-gaap adjusted tax rate to be applied to the identified non-gaap adjustments considering the impact of discrete items on these adjustments and the jurisdictional mix of the adjustments. in addition, the tax impact of other discrete and non-recurring charges which impact our reported gaap tax rate are adjusted from net earnings. we believe these tax items can significantly affect the period-over period assessment of operating results and not necessarily reflect costs and/or income associated with historical trends and future results.
the company periodically reassesses the components of our non-gaap adjustments for changes in how we evaluate our performance, changes in how we make financial and operational decisions, and considers the use of these measures by our competitors and peers to ensure the adjustments are still relevant and meaningful.

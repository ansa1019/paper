utility regulatory risks
(entergy corporation, entergy arkansas, entergy louisiana, entergy mississippi, entergy new orleans, entergy texas, and system energy)
the terms and conditions of service, including electric and gas rates, of the utility operating companies and system energy are determined through regulatory approval proceedings that can be lengthy and subject to appeal that could result in delays in effecting rate changes and uncertainty as to ultimate results.
the rates that the utility operating companies and system energy charge reflect their capital expenditures, operations and maintenance costs, allowed rates of return, financing costs, and related costs of service. these rates significantly influence the financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity of entergy and each of the utility operating companies and system energy. these rates are determined in regulatory proceedings and are subject to periodic regulatory review and adjustment, including adjustment upon the initiative of a regulator or affected stakeholders.
in addition, regulators may initiate proceedings to investigate the prudence of costs in the utility operating companies' base rates and examine, among other things, the reasonableness or prudence of the companies' operation and maintenance practices, level of expenditures (including storm costs and costs associated with capital projects), allowed rates of return and rate base, proposed resource acquisitions, and previously incurred capital expenditures that the operating companies seek to place in rates. the regulators may disallow costs subject to their jurisdiction found not to have been prudently incurred or found not to have been incurred in compliance with applicable tariffs, creating some risk to the ultimate recovery of those costs. regulatory proceedings relating to rates and other matters typically involve multiple parties seeking to limit or reduce rates. traditional base rate proceedings, as opposed to formula rate plans, generally have long timelines, are primarily based on historical costs, and may or may not be limited in scope or duration by statute. the length of these base rate proceedings can cause the utility operating companies and system energy to experience regulatory lag in recovering costs through rates. decisions are typically subject to appeal, potentially leading to additional uncertainty associated with rate case proceedings.
the base rates of entergy texas are established largely in traditional base rate case proceedings. apart from base rate proceedings, entergy texas has also filed to use rate riders to recover the revenue requirements associated with certain authorized historical costs. for example, entergy texas has recovered distribution-related capital investments through the distribution cost recovery factor rider mechanism, transmission-related capital investments and certain non-fuel miso charges through the transmission cost recovery factor rider mechanism, and miso fuel and energy-related costs through the fixed fuel factor mechanism. entergy texas is also required to make a filing every three years, at a minimum, reconciling its fuel and purchased power costs and fuel factor revenues. in the course of this reconciliation, the puct determines whether eligible fuel and fuel-related expenses and revenues are necessary and reasonable, and makes a prudence finding for each of the fuel-related contracts for the reconciliation period.
between base rate cases, entergy arkansas and entergy mississippi are able to adjust base rates annually through formula rate plans that utilize a forward test year (entergy arkansas) or forward-looking features (entergy mississippi). in response to entergy arkansas's application for a general change in rates in 2015, the apsc approved the formula rate plan tariff proposed by entergy arkansas including its use of a projected year test period and an initial five-year term. the initial five-year term expires in 2021 unless entergy arkansas requests, and the apsc approves, the extension of the formula rate plan tariff for an additional five years through 2026. in the event that entergy arkansas's formula rate plan is terminated or is not extended beyond the initial term, entergy arkansas could file an
275
table of contents part i item 1a & 1b entergy corporation, utility operating companies, and system energy application for a general change in rates that may include a request for continued regulation under a formula rate review mechanism. if entergy mississippi's formula rate plan is terminated, it would revert to the more traditional rate case environment or seek approval of a new formula rate plan. entergy arkansas and entergy mississippi recover fuel and purchased energy and certain non-fuel costs through other apsc-approved and mpsc-approved tariffs, respectively.
entergy louisiana historically sets electric base rates annually through a formula rate plan using an historic test year. the form of the formula rate plan, on a combined basis, was approved in connection with the business combination of entergy louisiana and entergy gulf states louisiana and largely followed the formula rate plans that were approved by the lpsc in connection with the full electric base rate cases filed by those companies in february
2013. the formula rate plan was approved for continued use through the test year 2016 filing and included a cap in cost of service increases at a cumulative total of $30 million through the formula rate plan cycle, which cap was not reached. the lpsc also approved in the business combination entergy louisiana's continuation of a mechanism to recover non-fuel miso-related costs, which are calculated separately from the formula rate plan requirements, but embedded in the formula rate plan factor applied on customer bills. this recovery mechanism expired following the
2015 test year, but was renewed for the 2016 test year. miso fuel and energy-related costs are recoverable in entergy louisiana's fuel adjustment clause. the formula rate plan includes exceptions from the rate cap and sharing requirements for certain large capital investment projects, including acquisition or construction of generating facilities, as well as purchase power agreements approved by the lpsc, among other items. in august 2017, entergy louisiana filed to extend the formula rate plan for an additional three years and to reset rates to the authorized mid-point return on equity of 9.95%. the filing also seeks certain modifications to the formula rate plan, including a narrower, 80 basis points earnings sharing bandwidth and implementation of a rider to recover certain transmission-related investments, when those investments begin delivering benefits to customers. in the event that the electric formula rate plan is not renewed or extended, entergy louisiana would revert to the more traditional rate case environment.
entergy new orleans previously operated under a formula rate plan that ended with the 2011 test year. currently, based on a settlement agreement approved by the city council, with limited exceptions, no action may be taken with respect to entergy new orleans's base rates until rates are implemented from a base rate case that must be filed for its electric and gas operations in 2018. the limited exceptions include implementation of the final year of a four-year phased-in rate increase for its algiers operations in the fifteenth ward of the city of new orleans and certain exceptional cost increases or decreases in its base revenue requirement.
the rates of system energy are established by the ferc, and the costs allowed to be charged pursuant to these rates are, in turn, passed through to the participating utility operating companies through the unit power sales agreement, which allows monthly adjustments to reflect the current operating costs of, and investment in, grand gulf.
the utility operating companies and system energy, and the energy industry as a whole, have experienced a period of rising costs and investments, and an upward trend in spending, especially with respect to infrastructure investments, which is likely to continue in the foreseeable future and could result in more frequent rate cases and requests for, and the continuation of, cost recovery mechanisms. for information regarding rate case proceedings and formula rate plans applicable to the utility operating companies, see note 2 to the financial statements.
the utility operating companies recover fuel, purchased power, and associated costs through rate mechanisms that are subject to risks of delay or disallowance in regulatory proceedings.
the utility operating companies recover their fuel, purchased power, and associated costs from their customers through rate mechanisms subject to periodic regulatory review and adjustment. because regulatory review can result in the disallowance of incurred costs found not to have been prudently incurred, including the cost of replacement power purchased when generators experience outages, with the possibility of refunds to ratepayers, there exists some risk to the ultimate recovery of those costs. regulators may also initiate proceedings to investigate the continued usage or the adequacy and operation of the fuel and purchased power recovery clauses of the utility operating companies and, therefore, there can be no assurance that existing recovery mechanisms will remain unchanged or in effect at all.
276
table of contents part i item 1a & 1b entergy corporation, utility operating companies, and system energy the utility operating companies' cash flows can be negatively affected by the time delays between when gas, power, or other commodities are purchased and the ultimate recovery from customers of the costs in rates. on occasion, when the level of incurred costs for fuel and purchased power rises very dramatically, some of the utility operating companies may agree to defer recovery of a portion of that period's fuel and purchased power costs for recovery at a later date, which could increase the near-term working capital and borrowing requirements of those companies. for a description of fuel and purchased power recovery mechanisms and information regarding the regulatory proceedings for fuel and purchased power costs recovery, see note 2 to the financial statements.
there remains uncertainty regarding the effect of the termination of the system agreement on the utility operating companies.
the utility operating companies historically have engaged in the coordinated planning, construction, and operation of generating resources and bulk transmission facilities under the terms of the system agreement, which is a rate schedule that had been approved by the ferc. the system agreement terminated in its entirety on august 31, 2016.
there remains uncertainty regarding the long-term effect of the termination of the system agreement on the utility operating companies because of the significant effect of the agreement on the generation and transmission functions of the utility operating companies and the significant period of time (over 30 years) that it had been in existence. in the absence of the system agreement, there remains uncertainty around the effectiveness of governance processes and the potential absence of federal authority to resolve certain issues among the utility operating companies and their retail regulators.
in addition, although the system agreement terminated in its entirety in august 2016, there are a number of outstanding system agreement proceedings at the ferc that may require future adjustments, including challenges to the level and timing of payments made by entergy arkansas under the system agreement. the outcome and timing of these ferc proceedings and resulting recovery and impact on rates cannot be predicted at this time.
for further information regarding the regulatory proceedings relating to the system agreement, see note 2 to the financial statements.
the utility operating companies are subject to economic risks associated with participation in the miso markets and the allocation of transmission upgrade costs. the operation of the utility operating companies' transmission system pursuant to the miso rto tariff and their participation in the miso rto's wholesale markets may be adversely affected by regulatory or market design changes, as well as liability under, or any future inability to comply with, existing or future regulations or requirements.
on december 19, 2013, the utility operating companies integrated into the miso rto. miso maintains functional control over the combined transmission systems of its members and administers wholesale energy and ancillary services markets for market participants in the miso region, including the utility operating companies. the utility operating companies sell capacity, energy, and ancillary services on a bilateral basis to certain wholesale customers and offer available electricity production of their generating facilities into the miso day-ahead and real-time energy markets pursuant to the miso tariff and market rules. the utility operating companies are subject to economic risks associated with participation in the miso markets. miso tariff rules and system conditions, including transmission congestion, could affect the utility operating companies' ability to sell power in certain regions and/or the economic value of such sales, and miso market rules may change in ways that cause additional risk.
the utility operating companies participate in the miso regional transmission planning process and are subject to risks associated with planning decisions that miso makes in the exercise of control over the planning of the utility operating companies' transmission assets that are under miso's functional control. the utility operating companies pay transmission rates that reflect the cost of transmission projects that the utility operating companies do not own, which could increase cash or financing needs. miso is currently evaluating through its stakeholder process potential changes in the transmission project criteria in miso. these changes, if adopted, could potentially result in a larger
277
table of contents part i item 1a & 1b entergy corporation, utility operating companies, and system energy volume of competitively bid and regionally cost allocated transmission projects. in addition to the cash and financing-related risks arising from the potential additional cost allocation to the utility operating companies from these projects, there is a risk that the utility operating companies' business and financial position could be harmed as a result of lost investment opportunities and other effects that flow from an increased number of competitive projects being approved and constructed that are interconnected with their transmission systems.
further, the terms and conditions of the miso tariff, including provisions related to the design and implementation of wholesale markets and the allocation of transmission upgrade costs, are subject to regulation by the ferc. the operation of the utility operating companies' transmission system pursuant to the miso tariff and their participation in the miso wholesale markets may be adversely affected by regulatory or market design changes, as well as liability under, or any future inability to comply with, existing or future regulations or requirements. in addition, orders from each of the utility operating companies' respective retail regulators generally require that the utility operating companies make periodic filings setting forth the results of analysis of the costs and benefits realized from miso membership as well as the projected costs and benefits of continued membership in miso and/or requesting approval of their continued membership in miso. these filings have been submitted periodically by each of the utility operating companies as required by their respective retail regulators, and the outcome of the resulting proceedings may affect the utility operating companies' continued membership in miso.

a delay or failure in recovering amounts for storm restoration costs incurred as a result of severe weather could have material effects on entergy and those utility operating companies affected by severe weather.
entergy's and its utility operating companies' results of operations, liquidity, and financial condition can be materially affected by the destructive effects of severe weather. severe weather can also result in significant outages for the customers of the utility operating companies and, therefore, reduced revenues for the utility operating companies during the period of the outages. a delay or failure in recovering amounts for storm restoration costs incurred or revenues lost as a result of severe weather could have a material effect on entergy and those utility operating companies affected by severe weather.
nuclear operating, shutdown and regulatory risks
(entergy corporation, entergy arkansas, entergy louisiana, and system energy)
certain of the utility operating companies, system energy, and entergy wholesale commodities must consistently operate their nuclear power plants at high capacity factors in order to be successful, and lower capacity factors could materially affect entergy's and their results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.
nuclear capacity factors significantly affect the results of operations of certain utility operating companies, system energy, and entergy wholesale commodities. nuclear plant operations involve substantial fixed operating costs. consequently, to be successful, a plant owner must consistently operate its nuclear power plants at high capacity factors, consistent with safety requirements. for the utility operating companies that own nuclear plants, lower capacity factors can increase production costs by requiring the affected companies to generate additional energy, sometimes at higher costs, from their fossil facilities or purchase additional energy in the spot or forward markets in order to satisfy their supply needs. for the entergy wholesale commodities nuclear plants, lower capacity factors directly affect revenues and cash flow from operations. entergy wholesale commodities' forward sales are comprised of various hedge products, many of which have some degree of operational-contingent price risk.
certain unit-contingent contracts guarantee specified minimum capacity factors. in the event plants with these contracts were operating below the guaranteed capacity factors, entergy would be subject to price risk for the undelivered power. further, entergy wholesale commodities' nuclear forward sales contracts can also be on a firm ld basis, which subjects entergy to increasing price risk as capacity factors decrease. many of these firm hedge products have damages risk, capped through the use of risk management products.
278
table of contents part i item 1a & 1b entergy corporation, utility operating companies, and system energy certain of the utility operating companies, system energy, and the entergy wholesale commodities nuclear plant owners periodically shut down their nuclear power plants to replenish fuel. plant maintenance and upgrades are often scheduled during such refueling outages. if refueling outages last longer than anticipated or if unplanned outages arise, entergy's and their results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity could be materially affected.
outages at nuclear power plants to replenish fuel require the plant to be "turned off." refueling outages generally are planned to occur once every 18 to 24 months and average approximately 30 days in duration. plant maintenance and upgrades are often scheduled during such planned outages. when refueling outages last longer than anticipated or a plant experiences unplanned outages, capacity factors decrease and maintenance costs may increase. lower than forecasted capacity factors may cause entergy wholesale commodities to experience reduced revenues and may also create damages risk with certain hedge products as previously discussed.
certain of the utility operating companies, system energy, and entergy wholesale commodities face risks related to the purchase of uranium fuel (and its conversion, enrichment, and fabrication). these risks could materially affect entergy's and their results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
based upon currently planned fuel cycles, entergy's nuclear units have a diversified portfolio of contracts and inventory that provides substantially adequate nuclear fuel materials and conversion and enrichment services at what entergy believes are reasonably predictable prices through most of 2018. the nuclear fuel supply portfolio for the entergy wholesale commodities segment is being adjusted to reflect reduced overall requirements related to the planned permanent shutdown of the palisades, pilgrim, indian point 2 and indian point 3 plants over the next two to five years . entergy's ability to purchase nuclear fuel at reasonably predictable prices, however, depends upon the performance reliability of uranium miners. while there are a number of possible alternate suppliers that may be accessed to mitigate any supplier performance failure, the pricing of any such alternate uranium supply from the market will be dependent upon the market for uranium supply at that time. entergy buys uranium from a diversified mix of sellers located in a diversified mix of countries, and from time to time purchases from nearly all qualified reliable major market participants worldwide that sell into the u.s. market prices for nuclear fuel have been extremely volatile from time to time in the past. although entergy's nuclear fuel contract portfolio provides a degree of hedging against market risks for several years, costs for nuclear fuel in the future cannot be predicted with certainty due to normal inherent market uncertainties, and price changes could materially affect the liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations of certain of the utility operating companies, system energy, and entergy wholesale commodities.
entergy's ability to assure nuclear fuel supply also depends upon the performance and reliability of conversion, enrichment, and fabrication services providers. these service providers are fewer in number than uranium suppliers.
for conversion and enrichment services, entergy diversifies its supply by supplier and country and may take special measures to ensure a reliable supply of enriched uranium for fabrication into nuclear fuel. for fabrication services, each plant is dependent upon the performance of the fabricator of that plant's nuclear fuel; therefore, entergy relies upon additional monitoring, inspection, and oversight of the fabrication process to assure reliability and quality of its nuclear fuel. certain of the suppliers and service providers are located in or dependent upon countries, such as russia, in which deteriorating economic conditions or international sanctions could restrict the ability of such suppliers to continue to supply fuel or provide such services. the inability of such suppliers or service providers to perform such obligations could materially affect the liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations of certain of the utility operating companies, system energy, and entergy wholesale commodities.
entergy arkansas, entergy louisiana, system energy, and the entergy wholesale commodities business face the risk that the nrc will change or modify its regulations, suspend, not renew, or revoke their licenses, or increase oversight of their nuclear plants, which could materially affect entergy's and their results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.
under the atomic energy act and energy reorganization act, the nrc regulates the operation of nuclear power plants.
the nrc may modify, suspend, not renew, or revoke licenses, shut down a nuclear facility and impose civil penalties for failure to comply with the atomic energy act, related regulations, or the terms of the licenses for
279
table of contents part i item 1a & 1b entergy corporation, utility operating companies, and system energy nuclear facilities. the license renewal process in some cases may be the subject of significant public debate and legislative review and scrutiny at the federal and, in some cases, state level, though the decision whether to renew is subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the nrc. interested parties may also intervene which could result in prolonged proceedings. a change in the atomic energy act, other applicable statutes, or the applicable regulations or licenses, or the nrc's interpretation thereof, may require a substantial increase in capital expenditures or may result in increased operating or decommissioning costs and could materially affect the results of operations, liquidity, or financial condition of entergy (through entergy wholesale commodities), its utility operating companies, or system energy. a change in the classification of a plant owned by one of these companies under the nrc's reactor oversight process, which is the nrc's program to collect information about plant performance, assess the information for its safety significance, and provide for appropriate licensee and nrc response, also could cause the owner of the plant to incur material additional costs as a result of the increased oversight activity and potential response costs associated with the change in classification. for additional information concerning the current classification of the plants owned by entergy arkansas, entergy louisiana, system energy, and the entergy wholesale commodities business, see "
regulation of entergy's business

- nrc reactor oversight process " in part i, item 1 and note 8 to the financial statements.
events at nuclear plants owned by one of these companies, as well as those owned by others, may lead to a change in laws or regulations or the terms of the applicable licenses, or the nrc's interpretation thereof, or may cause the nrc to increase oversight activity or initiate actions to modify, suspend, or revoke licenses, shut down a nuclear facility, or impose civil penalties. as a result, if an incident were to occur at any nuclear generating unit, whether an entergy nuclear generating unit or not, it could materially affect the financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity of entergy, certain of the utility operating companies, system energy, or entergy wholesale commodities.
certain of the utility operating companies, system energy, and entergy wholesale commodities are exposed to risks and costs related to operating and maintaining their nuclear power plants, and their failure to maintain operational efficiency at their nuclear power plants could materially affect entergy's and their results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.
the nuclear generating units owned by certain of the utility operating companies, system energy, and the entergy wholesale commodities business began commercial operations in the 1970s-1980s. older equipment may require more capital expenditures to keep each of these nuclear power plants operating safely and efficiently. this equipment is also likely to require periodic upgrading and improvement. any unexpected failure, including failure associated with breakdowns, forced outages, or any unanticipated capital expenditures, could result in increased costs, some of which costs may not be fully recoverable by the utility operating companies and system energy in regulatory proceedings. operations at any of the nuclear generating units owned and operated by entergy's subsidiaries could degrade to the point where the affected unit needs to be shut down or operated at less than full capacity. if this were to happen, identifying and correcting the causes may require significant time and expense. a decision may be made to close a unit rather than incur the expense of restarting it or returning the unit to full capacity. for the utility operating companies and system energy, this could result in certain costs being stranded and potentially not fully recoverable in regulatory proceedings. for entergy wholesale commodities, this could result in lost revenue and increased fuel and purchased power expense to meet supply commitments and penalties for failure to perform under their contracts with customers. in addition, the operation and maintenance of entergy's nuclear facilities require the commitment of substantial human resources that can result in increased costs.
the nuclear industry continues to address susceptibility to the effects of stress corrosion cracking and other corrosion mechanisms on certain materials within plant systems. the issue is applicable at all nuclear units to varying degrees and is managed in accordance with industry standard practices and guidelines that include in-
service examinations, replacements, and mitigation strategies. developments in the industry or identification of issues at the nuclear units could require unanticipated remediation efforts that cannot be quantified in advance.
moreover, entergy is becoming more dependent on fewer suppliers for key parts of entergy's nuclear power plants that may need to be replaced or refurbished. in addition, certain major parts have long lead-times to manufacture
280
table of contents part i item 1a & 1b entergy corporation, utility operating companies, and system energy if an unplanned replacement is needed. this dependence on a reduced number of suppliers and long lead-times on certain major parts for unplanned replacements could result in delays in obtaining qualified replacement parts and, therefore, greater expense for entergy.
the costs associated with the storage of the spent nuclear fuel of certain of the utility operating companies, system energy, and the owners of the entergy wholesale commodities nuclear power plants, as well as the costs of and their ability to fully decommission their nuclear power plants, could be significantly affected by the timing of the opening of a spent nuclear fuel disposal facility, as well as interim storage and transportation requirements.
certain of the utility operating companies, system energy and the owners of the entergy wholesale commodities nuclear plants incur costs for the on-site storage of spent nuclear fuel. the approval of a license for a national repository for the disposal of spent nuclear fuel, such as the one proposed for yucca mountain, nevada, or any interim storage facility, and the timing of such facility opening, will significantly affect the costs associated with on-site storage of spent nuclear fuel. for example, while the doe is required by law to proceed with the licensing of yucca mountain and, after the license is granted by the nrc, to construct the repository and commence the receipt of spent fuel, the nrc licensing of the yucca mountain repository is effectively at a standstill. these actions are prolonging the time before spent fuel is removed from entergy's plant sites. because the doe has not accomplished its objectives, it is in non-compliance with the nuclear waste policy act of 1982 and has breached its spent fuel disposal contracts, and entergy has sued the doe for such breach. furthermore, entergy is uncertain as to when the doe will commence acceptance of spent fuel from its facilities for storage or disposal. as a result, continuing future expenditures will be required to increase spent fuel storage capacity at the companies' nuclear sites and maintenance costs on existing storage facilities, including aging management of fuel storage casks, may increase. the costs of on-site storage are also affected by regulatory requirements for such storage. in addition, the availability of a repository or other off-site storage facility for spent nuclear fuel may affect the ability to fully decommission the nuclear units and the costs relating to decommissioning. for further information regarding spent fuel storage, see the "

certain of the utility operating companies, system energy, and the entergy wholesale commodities nuclear plant owners may be required to pay substantial retrospective premiums imposed under the price-anderson act in the event of a nuclear incident, and losses not covered by insurance could have a material effect on entergy's and their results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity.
accidents and other unforeseen problems at nuclear power plants have occurred both in the united states and elsewhere. the price-anderson act limits each reactor owner's public liability (off-site) for a single nuclear incident to the payment of retrospective premiums into a secondary insurance pool of up to approximately $127.3
million per reactor. with 102 reactors currently participating, this translates to a total public liability cap of approximately $13 billion per incident. the limit is subject to change to account for the effects of inflation, a change in the primary limit of insurance coverage, and changes in the number of licensed reactors. as required by the price-anderson act, the utility operating companies, system energy, and entergy wholesale commodities carry the maximum available amount of primary nuclear off-site liability insurance with american nuclear insurers (which is
$450 million for each operating site as of january 1, 2018). claims for any nuclear incident exceeding that amount are covered under the retrospective premiums paid into the secondary insurance pool. as a result, in the event of a nuclear incident that causes damages (off-site) in excess of the primary insurance coverage, each owner of a nuclear plant reactor, including entergy's utility operating companies, system energy, and the entergy wholesale commodities plant owners, regardless of fault or proximity to the incident, will be required to pay a retrospective premium, equal to its proportionate share of the loss in excess of the primary insurance level, up to a maximum of approximately $127.3 million per reactor per incident (entergy's maximum total contingent obligation per incident is $1.146 billion). the retrospective premium payment is currently limited to approximately $19 million per year per incident per reactor until the aggregate public liability for each licensee is paid up to the $127.3 million cap.
281
table of contents part i item 1a & 1b entergy corporation, utility operating companies, and system energy neil is a utility industry mutual insurance company, owned by its members, including the utility operating companies, system energy, and the owners of the entergy wholesale commodities plants. all member plants could be subject to an annual assessment (retrospective premium of up to 10 times current annual premium for all policies)
should the surplus (reserve) be significantly depleted due to insured losses. as of december 31, 2017, the maximum annual assessment amounts total $112.2 million for the utility plants. retrospective premium insurance available through neil's reinsurance treaty can cover the potential assessments and the entergy wholesale commodities plants currently maintain the retrospective premium insurance to cover those potential assessments.
as an owner of nuclear power plants, entergy participates in industry self-insurance programs and could be liable to fund claims should a plant owned by a different company experience a major event. any resulting liability from a nuclear accident may exceed the applicable primary insurance coverage and require contribution of additional funds through the industry-wide program that could significantly affect the results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity of entergy, certain of the utility operating companies, system energy, or the entergy wholesale commodities subsidiaries.
the decommissioning trust fund assets for the nuclear power plants owned by the utility operating companies, system energy and the entergy wholesale commodities nuclear plant owners may not be adequate to meet decommissioning obligations if market performance and other changes decrease the value of assets in the decommissioning trusts, if one or more of entergy's nuclear power plants is retired earlier than the anticipated shutdown date, if the plants cost more to decommission than estimated, or if current regulatory requirements change, which then could require significant additional funding.
owners of nuclear generating plants have an obligation to decommission those plants. certain of the utility operating companies, system energy, and owners of the entergy wholesale commodities nuclear power plants maintain decommissioning trust funds for this purpose. certain of the utility operating companies collect funds from their customers, which are deposited into the trusts covering the units operated for or on behalf of those companies.
those rate collections, as adjusted from time to time by rate regulators, are generally based upon operating license lives and trust fund balances as well as estimated trust fund earnings and decommissioning costs. assets in these trust funds are subject to market fluctuations, will yield uncertain returns that may fall below projected return rates, and may result in losses resulting from the recognition of impairments of the value of certain securities held in these trust funds.
in connection with the acquisition of certain nuclear plants, the entergy wholesale commodities plant owners acquired decommissioning trust funds that are funded in accordance with nrc regulations. under nrc regulations, entergy wholesale commodities' nuclear subsidiaries are permitted to project the nrc-required decommissioning amount, based on an nrc formula or a site-specific estimate, and the amount that will be available in each of the entergy wholesale commodities nuclear power plant's decommissioning trusts combined with other decommissioning financial assurances in place. the projections are made based on the operating license expiration date and the mid-
point of the subsequent decommissioning process, or the anticipated actual completion of decommissioning if a site-
specific estimate is used, for each of these nuclear power plants. as a result, if the projected amount of individual plants' decommissioning trusts exceeds the nrc-required decommissioning amount, then its decommissioning obligations are considered to be funded in accordance with nrc regulations. if the projected costs do not sufficiently reflect the actual costs the applicable entergy subsidiaries would be required to incur to decommission these nuclear power plants, or funding is otherwise inadequate, or if the formula, formula inputs, or site-specific estimate is changed to require increased funding, additional resources would be required.
furthermore, depending upon the level of funding available in the trust funds, the nrc may not permit the trust funds to be used to pay for related costs such as the management of spent nuclear fuel that are not included in the nrc's formula. the nrc may also require a plan for the provision of separate funding for spent fuel management costs. in addition to nrc requirements, there are other decommissioning-related obligations for certain of the entergy wholesale commodities nuclear power plants, which management believes it will be able to satisfy.
further, federal or state regulatory changes, including mandated increases in decommissioning funding or changes in the methods or standards for decommissioning operations, may also increase the funding requirements of,
282
table of contents part i item 1a & 1b entergy corporation, utility operating companies, and system energy or accelerate the timing for funding of, the obligations related to the decommissioning of entergy wholesale commodities nuclear power plants or may restrict the decommissioning-related costs that can be paid from the decommissioning trusts. as a result, under any of these circumstances, entergy's results of operations, liquidity, and financial condition could be materially affected.
an early plant shutdown (either generally or relative to current expectations), poor investment results or higher than anticipated decommissioning costs (including as a result of changing regulatory requirements) could cause trust fund assets to be insufficient to meet the decommissioning obligations, with the result that the utility operating companies, system energy or the entergy wholesale commodities nuclear plant owners may be required to provide significant additional funds or credit support to satisfy regulatory requirements for decommissioning, which, with respect to the utility operating companies, may not be recoverable from customers in a timely fashion or at all.

changes in nrc regulations or other binding regulatory requirements may cause increased funding requirements for nuclear plant decommissioning trusts.
nrc regulations require certain minimum financial assurance requirements for meeting obligations to decommission nuclear power plants. those financial assurance requirements may change from time to time, and certain changes may result in a material increase in the financial assurance required for decommissioning the utility operating companies', system energy's, and owners of entergy wholesale commodities nuclear power plants. such changes could result in the need for additional contributions to decommissioning trusts, or the posting of parent guarantees, letters of credit, or other surety mechanisms. for further information regarding nuclear decommissioning costs, see the "

new or existing safety concerns regarding operating nuclear power plants and nuclear fuel could lead to restrictions upon the operation and decommissioning of entergy's nuclear power plants.
new and existing concerns are being expressed in public forums about the safety of nuclear generating units and nuclear fuel, in particular in the northeastern united states, which is where most of the current fleet of entergy wholesale commodities nuclear power plants is located. these concerns have led to, and are expected to continue to lead to, various proposals to federal regulators and governing bodies in some localities where entergy's subsidiaries own nuclear generating units for legislative and regulatory changes that could lead to the shutdown of nuclear units, denial of license renewal applications, additional requirements or restrictions related to spent nuclear fuel on-site storage and eventual disposal, or other adverse effects on owning, operating and decommissioning nuclear generating units. entergy vigorously responds to these concerns and proposals. if any of the existing proposals, or any proposals that may arise in the future with respect to legislative and regulatory changes, become effective, they could have a material effect on entergy's results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.

a failure to obtain renewed licenses or other approvals required for the continued operation of the entergy wholesale commodities' indian point nuclear power plants could have a material effect on entergy's results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity and could lead to an acceleration of the timing for the funding of decommissioning obligations.
283
table of contents part i item 1a & 1b entergy corporation, utility operating companies, and system energy the license renewal and related processes for the entergy wholesale commodities' indian point nuclear power plants have been and may continue to be the subject of significant public debate and regulatory and legislative review and scrutiny at the federal and, in certain cases, state level. the original expiration date of the operating license for indian point 2 was september 2013 and the original expiration date of the operating license for indian point 3
was december 2015. because these plants filed timely license renewal applications, the nrc's rules provide that these plants may continue to operate under their existing operating licenses until their renewal applications have been finally determined.
in january 2017, entergy announced that it plans to shut down indian point 2 in 2020 and indian point 3 in 2021.
the early and orderly shutdown is part of a settlement under which new york state has agreed to drop legal challenges and support renewal of the operating licenses for indian point. for additional discussion of the settlement agreement with new york state, see the " entergy wholesale commodities authorizations to operate indian point " in entergy corporation and subsidiaries management's financial discussion and analysis.
if the nrc were to deny the applications for the renewal of operating licenses for the indian point nuclear power plants, or if indian point fails to obtain other approvals, entergy's results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity could be materially affected by loss of revenue and cash flow associated with the plant or plants until the proposed shutdown date, potential impairments of the carrying value of the plants, increased depreciation rates, and an accelerated need for decommissioning funds, which could require additional funding. in addition, entergy may incur increased operating costs depending on any conditions that may be imposed in connection with license renewal. for further discussion regarding the license renewal processes for the indian point nuclear power plants, see the " entergy wholesale commodities authorizations to operate indian point " in entergy corporation and subsidiaries management's financial discussion and analysis.
entergy wholesale commodities nuclear power plants are exposed to price risk.
entergy and its subsidiaries do not have a regulator-authorized rate of return on their capital investments in non-
utility businesses. as a result, the sale of capacity and energy from the entergy wholesale commodities nuclear power plants, unless otherwise contracted, is subject to the fluctuation of market power prices. in order to reduce future price risk to desired levels, entergy wholesale commodities utilizes contracts that are unit-contingent and firm ld and various products such as forward sales, options, and collars. as of december 31, 2017, entergy wholesale commodities' nuclear power generation plants had sold forward 98% in 2018, 91% in 2019, 51% in 2020, 74%
in 2021, and 67% in 2022 of its generation portfolio's planned energy output, reflecting the planned shutdown or sale of the entergy wholesale commodities nuclear power plants by mid-2022.
market conditions such as product cost, market liquidity, and other portfolio considerations influence the product and contractual mix. the obligations under unit-contingent agreements depend on a generating asset that is operating; if the generation asset is not operating, the seller generally is not liable for damages. for some unit-
contingent obligations, however, there is also a guarantee of availability that provides for the payment to the power purchaser of contract damages, if incurred, in the event the unit owner fails to deliver power as a result of the failure of the specified generation unit to generate power at or above a specified availability threshold. firm ld sales transactions may be exposed to substantial operational price risk, a portion of which may be capped through the use of risk management products, to the extent that the plants do not run as expected and market prices exceed contract prices.
market prices may fluctuate substantially, sometimes over relatively short periods of time, and at other times experience sustained increases or decreases. demand for electricity and its fuel stock can fluctuate dramatically, creating periods of substantial under- or over-supply. during periods of over-supply, prices might be depressed.
also, from time to time there may be political pressure, or pressure from regulatory authorities with jurisdiction over wholesale and retail energy commodity and transportation rates, to impose price limitations, credit requirements, bidding rules and other mechanisms to address volatility and other issues in these markets.
284
table of contents part i item 1a & 1b entergy corporation, utility operating companies, and system energy the effects of sustained low natural gas prices and power market structure challenges have resulted in lower market prices for electricity in the power regions where the entergy wholesale commodities nuclear power plants are located. in addition, currently the market design under which the plants operate does not adequately compensate merchant nuclear plants for their environmental and fuel diversity benefits in the region. these conditions were primary factors leading to entergy's decision to shut down (or sell) entergy wholesale commodities' nuclear power plants before the end of their operating licenses (or requested operating licenses for indian point 2 and indian point 3).
the price that different counterparties offer for various products including forward sales is influenced both by market conditions as well as the contract terms such as damage provisions, credit support requirements, and the number of available counterparties interested in contracting for the desired forward period. depending on differences between market factors at the time of contracting versus current conditions, entergy wholesale commodities' contract portfolio may have average contract prices above or below current market prices, including at the expiration of the contracts, which may significantly affect entergy wholesale commodities' results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity. new hedges are generally layered into on a rolling forward basis, which tends to drive hedge over-performance to market in a falling price environment, and hedge underperformance to market in a rising price environment; however, hedge timing, product choice, and hedging costs will also affect these results. see the "
market and credit risk sensitive instruments
" section of management's financial discussion and analysis for entergy corporation and subsidiaries. since entergy wholesale commodities has announced the closure (or sale) of its nuclear plants, entergy wholesale commodities may enter into fewer forward sales contracts for output from such plants.
among the factors that could affect market prices for electricity and fuel, all of which are beyond entergy's control to a significant degree, are:
prevailing market prices for natural gas, uranium (and its conversion, enrichment, and fabrication), coal,
•  oil, and other fuels used in electric generation plants, including associated transportation costs, and supplies of such commodities;
•  seasonality and realized weather deviations compared to normalized weather forecasts;
•  availability of competitively priced alternative energy sources and the requirements of a renewable portfolio standard;
•  changes in production and storage levels of natural gas, lignite, coal and crude oil, and refined products;
•  liquidity in the general wholesale electricity market, including the number of creditworthy counterparties available and interested in entering into forward sales agreements for entergy's full hedging term;
the actions of external parties, such as the ferc and local independent system operators and other state or
•  federal energy regulatory bodies, that may impose price limitations and other mechanisms to address some of the volatility in the energy markets;
•  electricity transmission, competing generation or fuel transportation constraints, inoperability, or inefficiencies;
•  the general demand for electricity, which may be significantly affected by national and regional economic conditions;
•  weather conditions affecting demand for electricity or availability of hydroelectric power or fuel supplies;
•  the rate of growth in demand for electricity as a result of population changes, regional economic conditions, and the implementation of conservation programs or distributed generation;
•  regulatory policies of state agencies that affect the willingness of entergy wholesale commodities customers to enter into long-term contracts generally, and contracts for energy in particular;
increases in supplies due to actions of current entergy wholesale commodities competitors or new market
•  entrants, including the development of new generation facilities, expansion of existing generation facilities, the disaggregation of vertically integrated utilities, and improvements in transmission that allow additional supply to reach entergy wholesale commodities' nuclear markets;
•  union and labor relations;
changes in federal and state energy and environmental laws and regulations and other initiatives, such as
•  the regional greenhouse gas initiative, including but not limited to, the price impacts of proposed emission controls;
285
table of contents part i item 1a & 1b entergy corporation, utility operating companies, and system energy
•  changes in law resulting from federal or state energy legislation or legislation subjecting energy derivatives used in hedging and risk management transactions to governmental regulation; and
•  natural disasters, terrorist actions, wars, embargoes, and other catastrophic events.
the entergy wholesale commodities business is subject to substantial governmental regulation and may be adversely affected by legislative, regulatory or market design changes, as well as liability under, or any future inability to comply with, existing or future regulations or requirements.
the entergy wholesale commodities business is subject to extensive regulation under federal, state, and local laws.
compliance with the requirements under these various regulatory regimes may cause the entergy wholesale commodities business to incur significant additional costs, and failure to comply with such requirements could result in the shutdown of the non-complying facility, the imposition of liens, fines and/or civil or criminal liability.
public utilities under the federal power act are required to obtain ferc acceptance of their rate schedules for wholesale sales of electricity. each of the owners of the entergy wholesale commodities nuclear power plants that generates electricity, as well as entergy nuclear power marketing, llc, is a "public utility" under the federal power act by virtue of making wholesale sales of electric energy and/or owning wholesale electric transmission facilities. the ferc has granted these generating and power marketing companies the authority to sell electricity at market-based rates. the ferc's orders that grant the entergy wholesale commodities' generating and power marketing companies market-based rate authority reserve the right to revoke or revise that authority if the ferc subsequently determines that the entergy wholesale commodities business can exercise market power in transmission or generation, create barriers to entry, or engage in abusive affiliate transactions. in addition, the entergy wholesale commodities' market-based sales are subject to certain market behavior rules, and if any of its generating and power marketing companies were deemed to have violated one of those rules, they would be subject to potential disgorgement of profits associated with the violation and/or suspension or revocation of their market-
based rate authority and potential penalties of up to $1 million per day per violation. if the entergy wholesale commodities' generating or power marketing companies were to lose their market-based rate authority, such companies would be required to obtain the ferc's acceptance of a cost-of-service rate schedule and could become subject to the accounting, record-keeping, and reporting requirements that are imposed on utilities with cost-based rate schedules. this could have an adverse effect on the rates the entergy wholesale commodities business charges for power from its facilities.
the entergy wholesale commodities business is also affected by legislative and regulatory changes, as well as changes to market design, market rules, tariffs, cost allocations, and bidding rules imposed by the existing independent system operators. the independent system operators that oversee most of the wholesale power markets may impose, and in the future may continue to impose, mitigation, including price limitations, offer caps and other mechanisms, to address some of the volatility and the potential exercise of market power in these markets. these types of price limitations and other regulatory mechanisms may have an adverse effect on the profitability of the entergy wholesale commodities business' generation facilities that sell energy and capacity into the wholesale power markets. further, the new york independent system operator could determine that the timing of the shutdown of the indian point units could be inconsistent with its market power rules, and impose certain penalties that could affect entergy wholesale commodities. for further information regarding federal, state and local laws and regulation applicable to the entergy wholesale commodities business, see the "
regulation of entergy's business
" section in part i, item 1.
the regulatory environment applicable to the electric power industry is subject to changes as a result of restructuring initiatives at both the state and federal levels. entergy cannot predict the future design of the wholesale power markets or the ultimate effect that the changing regulatory environment will have on the entergy wholesale commodities business. in addition, in some of these markets, interested parties have proposed material market design changes, including the elimination of a single clearing price mechanism, have raised claims that the competitive marketplace is not working because energy prices in wholesale markets exceed the marginal cost of operating nuclear power plants, and have made proposals to re-regulate the markets, impose a generation tax, or require divestitures by generating companies to reduce their market share. other proposals to re-regulate may be made and legislative or other attention to the electric power market restructuring process may delay or reverse the deregulation process, which
286
table of contents part i item 1a & 1b entergy corporation, utility operating companies, and system energy could require material changes to business planning models. if competitive restructuring of the electric power markets is reversed, modified, discontinued, or delayed, the entergy wholesale commodities business' results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity could be materially affected.
the power plants owned by the entergy wholesale commodities business are subject to impairment charges in certain circumstances, which could have a material effect on entergy's results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.
entergy reviews long-lived assets held in all of its business segments whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that recoverability of these assets is uncertain. generally, the determination of recoverability is based on the undiscounted net cash flows expected to result from the operations of such assets. projected net cash flows depend on the expected operating life of the assets, the future operating costs associated with the assets, the efficiency and availability of the assets and generating units, and the future market and price for energy and capacity over the remaining life of the assets. in particular, the assets of the entergy wholesale commodities business are subject to further impairment in connection with the closure or sale of the plants discussed below.
moreover, prior to the closure or sale of these plants, the failure of the entergy wholesale commodities business to achieve forecasted operating results and cash flows, an unfavorable change in forecasted operating results or cash flows, a reduction in the expected remaining useful life of a unit (including if the operating licenses for the indian point power plants are not renewed by the nrc), or a decline in observable industry market multiples could all result in potential additional impairment charges for the affected assets.
on august 27, 2013, entergy announced its plan to close and decommission vermont yankee. vermont yankee ceased power production in the fourth quarter 2014 at the end of a fuel cycle. this decision was approved by the board in august 2013, and resulted in the recognition of impairment charges in 2013 and 2014. in october 2015, entergy determined that it will close the pilgrim and fitzpatrick plants. the pilgrim plant will cease operations no later than june 1, 2019. fitzpatrick was expected to shut down at the end of its current fuel cycle, planned for january
27, 2017, but in march 2017, entergy sold the fitzpatrick plant to exelon generation company, llc which continues to operate the plant. during the third quarter 2015, entergy recorded impairment and other related charges to write down the carrying values of the fitzpatrick and pilgrim plants and related assets to their fair values. in addition, in the fourth quarter 2015, entergy recorded impairment and other related charges to write down the carrying value of the palisades plant and related assets to their fair value. in december 2016, entergy reached an agreement with consumers energy to terminate the ppa for the palisades plant and to shut down the plant in 2018, but the agreement was terminated in september 2017 after the michigan public service commission decided that consumers power could not recover costs incurred under the agreement. entergy intends to shut down the palisades plant permanently on may 31, 2022. in january 2017, entergy announced that it reached a settlement with new york state and plans to close the indian point 2 plant in 2020 and the indian point 3 plant in 2021. as a result, in the fourth quarter of 2016, entergy recorded impairment and other related charges to write down the carrying values of the palisades and indian point 2 and indian point 3 plants and related assets to their fair value. in addition to the impairments and other related charges, entergy has incurred severance and employee retention costs and expects to incur additional charges through 2022 relating to the decisions to shut down vermont yankee, palisades, pilgrim, indian point 2 and indian point 3, and the sale of fitzpatrick.
if entergy concludes that any of its nuclear power plants is unlikely to operate through its planned shutdown date, which conclusion would be based on a variety of factors, such a conclusion could result in a further impairment of part or all of the carrying value of the plant. any impairment charge taken by entergy with respect to its long-
lived assets, including the power plants owned by the entergy wholesale commodities business, would likely be material in the quarter that the charge is taken and could otherwise have a material effect on entergy's results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity. for further information regarding evaluating long-lived assets for impairment, see the "
critical accounting estimates
- impairment of long-lived assets and trust fund investments " section of management's financial discussion and analysis for entergy corporation and subsidiaries and for further discussion of the impairment charges, see note 14

entergy and the utility operating companies depend on access to the capital markets and, at times, may face potential liquidity constraints, which could make it more difficult to handle future contingencies such as natural disasters or substantial increases in gas and fuel prices. disruptions in the capital and credit markets may adversely affect entergy's and its subsidiaries' ability to meet liquidity needs, access capital and operate and grow their businesses, and the cost of capital.
entergy's business is capital intensive and dependent upon its ability to access capital at reasonable rates and other terms. at times there are also spikes in the price for natural gas and other commodities that increase the liquidity requirements of the utility operating companies and entergy wholesale commodities. in addition, entergy's and the utility operating companies' liquidity needs could significantly increase in the event of a hurricane or other weather-related or unforeseen disaster similar to that experienced in entergy's service territory with hurricane katrina and hurricane rita in 2005, hurricane gustav and hurricane ike in 2008, and hurricane isaac in
2012. the occurrence of one or more contingencies, including a delay in regulatory recovery of fuel or purchased power costs or storm restoration costs, higher than expected pension contributions, an acceleration of payments or decreased credit lines, less cash flow from operations than expected, or other unknown events, could cause the financing needs of entergy and its subsidiaries to increase. in addition, accessing the debt capital markets more frequently in these situations may result in an increase in leverage. material leverage increases could negatively affect the credit ratings of entergy and the utility operating companies, which in turn could negatively affect access to the capital markets.
the inability to raise capital on favorable terms, particularly during times of uncertainty in the capital markets, could negatively affect entergy and its subsidiaries' ability to maintain and to expand their businesses. events beyond entergy's control may create uncertainty that could increase its cost of capital or impair its ability to access the capital markets, including the ability to draw on its bank credit facilities. entergy and its subsidiaries are unable to predict the degree of success they will have in renewing or replacing their credit facilities as they come up for renewal. moreover, the size, terms, and covenants of any new credit facilities may not be comparable to, and may be more restrictive than, existing facilities. if entergy and its subsidiaries are unable to access the credit and capital markets on terms that are reasonable, they may have to delay raising capital, issue shorter-term securities and/or bear an unfavorable cost of capital, which, in turn, could impact their ability to grow their businesses, decrease earnings, significantly reduce financial flexibility and/or limit entergy corporation's ability to sustain its current common stock dividend level.

ability to access capital and/or could require entergy corporation or its subsidiaries to post collateral, accelerate certain payments, or repay certain indebtedness.
there are a number of factors that rating agencies evaluate to arrive at credit ratings for each of entergy corporation and the registrant subsidiaries, including each registrant's regulatory framework, ability to recover costs and earn returns, diversification and financial strength and liquidity. if one or more rating agencies downgrade entergy corporation's, any of the utility operating companies', or system energy's ratings, particularly below investment grade, borrowing costs would increase, the potential pool of investors and funding sources would likely decrease, and cash or letter of credit collateral demands may be triggered by the terms of a number of commodity contracts, leases, and other agreements.
288
table of contents part i item 1a & 1b entergy corporation, utility operating companies, and system energy most of entergy corporation's and its subsidiaries' large customers, suppliers, and counterparties require sufficient creditworthiness to enter into transactions. if entergy corporation's or its subsidiaries' ratings decline, particularly below investment grade, or if certain counterparties believe entergy corporation or the utility operating companies are losing creditworthiness and demand adequate assurance under fuel, gas, and purchased power contracts, the counterparties may require posting of collateral in cash or letters of credit, prepayment for fuel, gas or purchased power or accelerated payment, or counterparties may decline business with entergy corporation or its subsidiaries. at december 31, 2017, based on power prices at that time, entergy had liquidity exposure of $167 million under the guarantees in place supporting entergy wholesale commodities transactions and $8 million of posted cash collateral. in the event of a decrease in entergy corporation's credit rating to below investment grade, based on power prices as of december 31, 2017, entergy would have been required to provide approximately $98 million of additional cash or letters of credit under some of the agreements. in the event of a decrease in the credit ratings of entergy's utility operating companies to below investment grade, those companies collectively could be required to provide up to $50 million of additional cash or letters of credit to miso. as of december 31, 2017, the liquidity exposure associated with entergy wholesale commodities assurance requirements, including return of previously received collateral from counterparties, would increase by $372
million for a $1 per mmbtu increase in gas prices in both the short- and long-term markets.
recent u.s. tax legislation may materially adversely affect entergy's financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and credit ratings.
the recently enacted h.r. 1, also known as the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017, will significantly change the u.s.
internal revenue code, including taxation of u.s. corporations, by, among other things, reducing the federal corporate income tax rate, limiting interest deductions, and altering the expensing of capital expenditures. the legislation is unclear in certain respects and will require interpretations and implementing regulations by the irs, as well as state tax authorities, and the legislation could be subject to potential amendments and technical corrections, any of which could lessen or increase certain impacts of the legislation. in addition, the regulatory treatment of the impacts of this legislation, particularly on companies like entergy and the registrant subsidiaries, will be subject to the discretion of federal, state, and local public utility regulators.
as further described in note 3 to the financial statements, entergy recorded a reduction of certain of its net deferred income tax assets (including the value of its net operating loss carryforwards) and regulatory liabilities, resulting in a charge against earnings in the fourth quarter 2017 of $526 million, including a $34
million net-of-tax reduction of regulatory liabilities, and entergy and the utility operating companies recorded a reduction of approximately $3.7 billion on a consolidated basis in certain of its net deferred tax liabilities and a corresponding increase in net regulatory liabilities. depending on the outcome of the ratemaking process, irs examinations, or tax positions and elections that entergy may elect, entergy and the registrant subsidiaries may be required to record additional charges or credits to income tax expense. further, the amount and timing of the return of the deferred taxes to customers is dependent upon the regulatory treatment received, and, if the registrant subsidiaries are unsuccessful in receiving balanced regulatory treatment, entergy's or the utility operating companies' cash flow could be materially adversely affected. further, there may be other material effects resulting from the legislation that have not been identified. while entergy plans to finance its cash needs that result from the act through a combination of registrant subsidiary debt and entergy corporation debt and equity, there can be no assurance that entergy or the registrant subsidiaries will obtain debt or equity financing on terms that are satisfactory or consistent with their current expectations.
in addition, while moody's changed the ratings outlooks for entergy corporation to negative from stable in reaction to the legislation, it is unclear when or how capital markets, other credit rating agencies, the ferc or state or local regulators may respond to this legislation. entergy expects that certain financial metrics used by credit rating agencies will be negatively affected as a result of the return of excess deferred taxes to customers, increased debt, and the decrease in the registrant subsidiaries' revenue requirements, and related decrease in operating cash flows, expected as a consequence of the lower federal corporate income tax rate while, at the same time, the loss of the bonus depreciation tax deduction will increase taxable income in the future. also, the timing of the return of excess deferred income taxes
289
table of contents part i item 1a & 1b entergy corporation, utility operating companies, and system energy to customers will not exactly match the lower taxes that entergy will be paying which will result in cash outflows to customers. it is also uncertain how other credit rating agencies will treat the impacts of this legislation on their credit ratings and metrics, and whether additional avenues will evolve for companies to manage the adverse aspects of this legislation. these avenues, to the extent available and if successfully applied, could lessen the impacts on certain credit metrics, although there can be no assurance in this regard.
entergy believes that interpretations and implementing regulations by the irs, as well as potential amendments and technical corrections, could result in lessening the impacts of certain aspects of this legislation. if entergy is unable to successfully pursue avenues to manage the effects of the new tax legislation, or if additional interpretations, regulations, amendments, or technical corrections exacerbate the effects of the legislation, the legislation could have a material effect on entergy's results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows, and could result in additional credit rating agency actions. any such actions by credit rating agencies may make it more difficult and costly for entergy to issue debt securities and certain other types of financing and could increase borrowing costs under its credit facilities.
for further information regarding the effects of the act, see the "
income tax legislation
" section of management's financial discussion and analysis for entergy. also, note 3 to the financial statements contains additional discussion of the effect of the act on 2017 results of operations and financial position, the provisions of the act, and the uncertainties associated with accounting for the act, and note 2 to the financial statements discusses proceedings commenced or other responses by entergy's regulators to the act.
changes in taxation as well as the inherent difficulty in quantifying potential tax effects of business decisions could negatively impact entergy's, the utility operating companies', and system energy's results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
entergy and its subsidiaries make judgments regarding the potential tax effects of various transactions and results of operations to estimate their obligations to taxing authorities. these tax obligations include income, franchise, real estate, sales and use, and employment-related taxes. these judgments include provisions for potential adverse outcomes regarding tax positions that have been taken. entergy and its subsidiaries also estimate their ability to utilize tax benefits, including those in the form of carryforwards for which the benefits have already been reflected in the financial statements. changes in federal, state, or local tax laws, adverse tax audit results or adverse tax rulings on positions taken by entergy and its subsidiaries could negatively affect entergy's, the utility operating companies', and system energy's results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. for further information regarding entergy's income taxes, see note 3 to the financial statements.
entergy and its subsidiaries' ability to successfully complete strategic transactions, including merger, acquisition, divestiture, joint venture, restructuring or other strategic transactions, is subject to significant risks, including the risk that required regulatory or governmental approvals may not be obtained, risks relating to unknown or undisclosed problems or liabilities, and the risk that for these or other reasons, entergy and its subsidiaries may be unable to achieve some or all of the benefits that they anticipate from such transactions.
from time to time, entergy and its subsidiaries have pursued and may continue to pursue strategic transactions including merger, acquisition, divestiture, joint venture, restructuring or other strategic transactions. for example, in november 2016, entergy announced that it had entered into a purchase and sale agreement with northstar for the sale of 100% of the membership interests in entergy nuclear vermont yankee, which owns the vermont yankee plant. in addition, as part of entergy's plan to exit the merchant power business, it plans to shut down its remaining merchant nuclear power plants by mid-2022. these transactions and plans are or may become subject to regulatory approval and other material conditions or contingencies. the failure to complete these transactions or plans or any future strategic transaction successfully or on a timely basis could have an adverse effect on entergy's financial condition, results of operations and the market's perception of entergy's ability to execute its strategy. further, these transactions, and any completed or future strategic transactions, involve substantial risks, including the following:
290
table of contents part i item 1a & 1b entergy corporation, utility operating companies, and system energy the disposition of a business or asset may involve continued financial involvement in the divested business,
•  such as through continuing equity ownership, transition service agreements, guarantees, indemnities, or other current or contingent financial obligations;
entergy may encounter difficulty in finding buyers or executing alternative exit strategies on acceptable terms in a timely manner when it decides to sell an asset or a business, which could delay the
•  accomplishment of its strategic objectives. alternatively, entergy may dispose of a business or asset at a price or on terms that are less than what it had anticipated, or with the exclusion of assets that must be divested or run off separately;
•  the disposition of a business could result in impairments and related write-offs of the carrying values of the relevant assets;
•  acquired businesses or assets may not produce revenues, earnings or cash flow at anticipated levels;
•  acquired businesses or assets could have environmental, permitting or other problems for which contractual protections prove inadequate;
•  entergy and/or its subsidiaries may assume liabilities that were not disclosed to them, that exceed their estimates, or for which their rights to indemnification from the seller are limited;
•  the disposition of a business, including entergy's planned exit from the merchant power business, could divert management's attention from other business concerns;
entergy and/or its subsidiaries may be unable to obtain the necessary regulatory or governmental approvals
•  to close a transaction, such approvals may be granted subject to terms that are unacceptable to them, or entergy or its subsidiaries otherwise may be unable to achieve anticipated regulatory treatment of any such transaction or acquired business or assets; and
•  entergy or its subsidiaries otherwise may be unable to achieve the full strategic and financial benefits that they anticipate from the transaction, or such benefits may be delayed or may not occur at all.
entergy may not be successful in managing these or any other significant risks that it may encounter in acquiring or divesting a business, or engaging in other strategic transactions, which could have a material effect on its business.
the construction of, and capital improvements to, power generation facilities involve substantial risks. should construction or capital improvement efforts be unsuccessful, the financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity of entergy and the utility operating companies could be materially affected.
entergy's and the utility operating companies' ability to complete construction of power generation facilities, or make other capital improvements, in a timely manner and within budget is contingent upon many variables and subject to substantial risks. these variables include, but are not limited to, project management expertise and escalating costs for materials, labor, and environmental compliance. delays in obtaining permits, shortages in materials and qualified labor, suppliers and contractors not performing as required under their contracts, changes in the scope and timing of projects, poor quality initial cost estimates from contractors, the inability to raise capital on favorable terms, changes in commodity prices affecting revenue, fuel costs, or materials costs, downward changes in the economy, changes in law or regulation, including environmental compliance requirements, and other events beyond the control of the utility operating companies or the entergy wholesale commodities business may occur that may materially affect the schedule, cost, and performance of these projects. if these projects or other capital improvements are significantly delayed or become subject to cost overruns or cancellation, entergy and the utility operating companies could incur additional costs and termination payments, or face increased risk of potential write-off of the investment in the project. in addition, the utility operating companies could be exposed to higher costs and market volatility, which could affect cash flow and cost recovery, should their respective regulators decline to approve the construction of new generation needed to meet the reliability needs of customers at the lowest reasonable cost.

table of contents part i item 1a & 1b entergy corporation, utility operating companies, and system energy the utility operating companies, system energy, and the entergy wholesale commodities business may incur substantial costs to fulfill their obligations related to environmental and other matters.
the businesses in which the utility operating companies, system energy, and the entergy wholesale commodities business operate are subject to extensive environmental regulation by local, state, and federal authorities. these laws and regulations affect the manner in which the utility operating companies, system energy, and the entergy wholesale commodities business conduct their operations and make capital expenditures. these laws and regulations also affect how the utility operating companies, system energy, and the entergy wholesale commodities business manage air emissions, discharges to water, wetlands impacts, solid and hazardous waste storage and disposal, cooling and service water intake, the protection of threatened and endangered species, certain migratory birds and eagles, hazardous materials transportation, and similar matters. federal, state, and local authorities continually revise these laws and regulations, and the laws and regulations are subject to judicial interpretation and to the permitting and enforcement discretion vested in the implementing agencies. developing and implementing plans for facility compliance with these requirements can lead to capital, personnel, and operation and maintenance expenditures. violations of these requirements can subject the utility operating companies, system energy, and the entergy wholesale commodities business to enforcement actions, capital expenditures to bring existing facilities into compliance, additional operating costs or operating restrictions to achieve compliance, remediation and clean-
up costs, civil penalties, and exposure to third parties' claims for alleged health or property damages or for violations of applicable permits or standards. in addition, the utility operating companies, system energy, and the entergy wholesale commodities business potentially are subject to liability under these laws for the costs of remediation of environmental contamination of property now or formerly owned or operated by the utility operating companies, system energy, and entergy wholesale commodities and of property contaminated by hazardous substances they generate. the utility operating companies are currently involved in proceedings relating to sites where hazardous substances have been released and may be subject to additional proceedings in the future. the utility operating companies, system energy, and the entergy wholesale commodities business have incurred and expect to incur significant costs related to environmental compliance.
emissions of nitrogen and sulfur oxides, mercury, particulates, greenhouse gases, and other regulated air emissions from generating plants are potentially subject to increased regulation, controls and mitigation expenses. in addition, existing air regulations and programs promulgated by the epa often are challenged legally, sometimes resulting in large-scale changes to anticipated regulatory regimes and the resulting need to shift course, both operationally and economically, depending on the nature of the changes. risks relating to global climate change, initiatives to compel greenhouse gas emission reductions, and water availability issues are discussed below.
entergy and its subsidiaries may not be able to obtain or maintain all required environmental regulatory approvals.
if there is a delay in obtaining any required environmental regulatory approvals, or if entergy and its subsidiaries fail to obtain, maintain, or comply with any such approval, the operation of its facilities could be stopped or become subject to additional costs. for further information regarding environmental regulation and environmental matters, see the "

" section of part i, item 1.
the utility operating companies, system energy, and the entergy wholesale commodities business may incur substantial costs related to reliability standards.
entergy's business is subject to extensive and mandatory reliability standards. such standards, which are established by the north american electric reliability corporation (nerc), the serc reliability corporation (serc), and other regional enforcement entities, are approved by the ferc and frequently are reviewed, amended, and supplemented. failure to comply with such standards could result in the imposition of fines or civil penalties, and potential exposure to third party claims for alleged violations of such standards. the standards, as well as the laws and regulations that govern them, are subject to judicial interpretation and to the enforcement discretion vested in the implementing agencies. in addition to exposure to civil penalties and fines, the utility operating companies have incurred and expect to incur significant costs related to compliance with new and existing reliability standards, including costs associated with the utility operating companies' transmission system and generation assets. the changes to the
292
table of contents part i item 1a & 1b entergy corporation, utility operating companies, and system energy reliability standards applicable to the electric power industry are ongoing, and entergy cannot predict the ultimate effect that the reliability standards will have on its utility and entergy wholesale commodities.

the effects of weather and economic conditions, and the related impact on electricity and gas usage, may materially affect the utility operating companies
'
results of operations.
temperatures above normal levels in the summer tend to increase electric cooling demand and revenues, and temperatures below normal levels in the winter tend to increase electric and gas heating demand and revenues. as a corollary, moderate temperatures in either season tend to decrease usage of energy and resulting revenues. seasonal pricing differentials, coupled with higher consumption levels, typically cause the utility operating companies to report higher revenues in the third quarter of the fiscal year than in the other quarters. extreme weather conditions or storms, however, may stress the utility operating companies' generation facilities and transmission and distribution systems, resulting in increased maintenance and capital costs (and potential increased financing needs), limits on their ability to meet peak customer demand, increased regulatory oversight, and lower customer satisfaction. these extreme conditions could have a material effect on the utility operating companies' financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity.
entergy's electricity sales volumes are affected by a number of factors, including economic conditions, weather, customer bill sizes (large bills tend to induce conservation), trends in energy efficiency, new technologies and self-generation alternatives, including the willingness and ability of large industrial customers to develop co-
generation facilities that greatly reduce their demand from entergy. some of these factors are inherently cyclical or temporary in nature, such as the weather or economic conditions, and rarely have a long-lasting effect on entergy's operating results. others, such as the increasing adoption of energy efficient appliances, new building codes, distributed energy resources, energy storage, demand side management and new technologies such as rooftop solar are having a more permanent effect of reducing sales growth rates from historical norms. as a result of these emerging efficiencies and technologies, the utility operating companies may experience lower usage per customer in the residential and commercial classes, and further advances have the potential to limit sales growth in the future. electricity sales to industrial customers, in particular, benefit from steady economic growth and favorable commodity prices; however, they are sensitive to changes in conditions in the markets in which its customers operate. any negative change in any of these or other factors has the potential to result in slower sales growth or sales declines and increased bad debt expense, which could materially affect entergy's and the utility operating companies' results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.
the effects of climate change and environmental and regulatory obligations intended to compel greenhouse gas emission reductions or to place a price on greenhouse gas emissions could materially affect the financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity of entergy, the utility operating companies, system energy, and the entergy wholesale commodities business.
in an effort to address climate change concerns, federal, state, and local authorities are calling for additional laws and regulations aimed at known or suspected causes of climate change. for example, in response to the united states supreme court's 2007 decision holding that the epa has authority to regulate emissions of co 2 and other
"greenhouse gases" under the clean air act, the epa, various environmental interest groups, and other organizations are focusing considerable attention on co 2 emissions from power generation facilities and their potential role in climate change. in 2010, the epa promulgated its first regulations controlling greenhouse gas emissions from certain vehicles and from new and significantly modified stationary sources of emissions, including electric generating units. during 2012 and 2014, the epa proposed co 2 emission standards for new and existing sources. the epa finalized these standards in 2015; however, in late 2017, the epa proposed to repeal the regulations and issued an advanced notice of proposed rulemaking for replacing certain aspects of the standards for existing sources. as examples of state action, in the northeast, the regional greenhouse gas initiative establishes a cap on co 2
emissions from electric power plants and requires generators to purchase emission permits to cover their co 2
emissions, and a similar program has been
293
table of contents part i item 1a & 1b entergy corporation, utility operating companies, and system energy developed in california. the impact that recent changes in the federal government will have on existing and pending environmental laws and regulations related to greenhouse gas emissions is currently unclear.
developing and implementing plans for compliance with greenhouse gas emissions reduction requirements can lead to additional capital, personnel, and operation and maintenance expenditures and could significantly affect the economic position of existing facilities and proposed projects; moreover, long-term planning to meet environmental requirements can be negatively impacted and costs may increase to the extent laws and regulations change prior to full implementation. these requirements could, in turn, lead to changes in the planning or operations of balancing authorities or organized markets in areas where the utility operating companies, system energy, or entergy wholesale commodities do business. violations of such requirements may subject entergy wholesale commodities and the utility operating companies to enforcement actions, capital expenditures to bring existing facilities into compliance, additional operating costs or operating restrictions to achieve compliance, civil penalties, and exposure to third parties' claims for alleged health or property damages or for violations of applicable permits or standards. to the extent entergy believes any of these costs are recoverable in rates, however, additional material rate increases for customers could be resisted by entergy's regulators and, in extreme cases, entergy's regulators might deny or defer timely recovery of these costs. future changes in environmental regulation governing the emission of co 2 and other greenhouse gases could make some of entergy's electric generating units uneconomical to maintain or operate, and could increase the difficulty that entergy and its subsidiaries have with obtaining or maintaining required environmental regulatory approvals, which could also materially affect the financial condition, results of operations and liquidity of entergy and its subsidiaries. in addition, lawsuits have occurred or are reasonably expected against emitters of greenhouse gases alleging that these companies are liable for personal injuries and property damage caused by climate change. these lawsuits may seek injunctive relief, monetary compensation, and punitive damages.
in addition to the regulatory and financial risks associated with climate change discussed above, potential physical risks from climate change include an increase in sea level, wind and storm surge damages, wetland and barrier island erosion, risks of flooding and changes in weather conditions, (such as increases in precipitation, drought, or changes in average temperatures), and potential increased impacts of extreme weather conditions or storms. entergy subsidiaries own assets in, and serve, communities that are at risk from sea level rise, changes in weather conditions, storms, and loss of the protection offered by coastal wetlands. a significant portion of the nation's oil and gas infrastructure is located in these areas and susceptible to storm damage that could be aggravated by wetland and barrier island erosion, which could give rise to fuel supply interruptions and price spikes. entergy and its subsidiaries also face the risk that climate change could impact the availability and quality of water supply necessary for operations.
these and other physical changes could result in changes in customer demand, increased costs associated with repairing and maintaining generation facilities and transmission and distribution systems resulting in increased maintenance and capital costs (and potential increased financing needs), limits on the entergy system's ability to meet peak customer demand, increased regulatory oversight, and lower customer satisfaction. also, to the extent that climate change adversely impacts the economic health of a region or results in energy conservation or demand side management programs, it may adversely impact customer demand and revenues. such physical or operational risks could have a material effect on entergy's, entergy wholesale commodities', system energy's, and the utility operating companies' financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity.
continued and future availability and quality of water for cooling, process, and sanitary uses could materially affect the financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity of the utility operating companies, system energy, and the entergy wholesale commodities business.
water is a vital natural resource that is also critical to the utility operating companies', system energy's, and entergy wholesale commodities' business operations. entergy's facilities use water for cooling, boiler make-up, sanitary uses, potable supply, and many other uses. three of entergy's utility operating companies own and/or operate hydroelectric facilities. accordingly, water availability and quality are critical to entergy's business operations. impacts to water availability or quality could negatively impact both operations and revenues.
294
table of contents part i item 1a & 1b entergy corporation, utility operating companies, and system energy entergy secures water through various mechanisms (ground water wells, surface waters intakes, municipal supply, etc.) and operates under the provisions and conditions set forth by the provider and/or regulatory authorities.
entergy also obtains and operates in substantial compliance with water discharge permits issued under various provisions of the clean water act and/or state water pollution control provisions. regulations and authorizations for both water intake and use and for waste discharge can become more stringent in times of water shortages, low flows in rivers, low lake levels, low groundwater aquifer volumes, and similar conditions. the increased use of water by industry, agriculture, and the population at large, population growth, and the potential impacts of climate change on water resources may cause water use restrictions that affect entergy and its subsidiaries.
entergy and its subsidiaries may not be adequately hedged against changes in commodity prices, which could materially affect entergy's and its subsidiaries' results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.
to manage near-term financial exposure related to commodity price fluctuations, entergy and its subsidiaries, including the utility operating companies and the entergy wholesale commodities business, may enter into contracts to hedge portions of their purchase and sale commitments, fuel requirements, and inventories of natural gas, uranium and its conversion and enrichment, coal, refined products, and other commodities, within established risk management guidelines. as part of this strategy, entergy and its subsidiaries may utilize fixed- and variable-price forward physical purchase and sales contracts, futures, financial swaps, and option contracts traded in the over-
the-counter markets or on exchanges. however, entergy and its subsidiaries normally cover only a portion of the exposure of their assets and positions to market price volatility, and the coverage will vary over time. in addition, entergy also elects to leave certain volumes during certain years unhedged. to the extent entergy and its subsidiaries have unhedged positions, fluctuating commodity prices can materially affect entergy's and its subsidiaries' results of operations and financial position.
although entergy and its subsidiaries devote a considerable effort to these risk management strategies, they cannot eliminate all the risks associated with these activities. as a result of these and other factors, entergy and its subsidiaries cannot predict with precision the impact that risk management decisions may have on their business, results of operations, or financial position.
entergy's over-the-counter financial derivatives are subject to rules implementing the dodd-frank wall street reform and consumer protection act that are designed to promote transparency, mitigate systemic risk and protect against market abuse. entergy cannot predict the impact any proposed or not fully-implemented final rules will have on its ability to hedge its commodity price risk or on over-the-counter derivatives markets as a whole, but such rules and regulations could have a material effect on entergy's risk exposure, as well as reduce market liquidity and further increase the cost of hedging activities.
entergy has guaranteed or indemnified the performance of a portion of the obligations relating to hedging and risk management activities. reductions in entergy's or its subsidiaries' credit quality or changes in the market prices of energy commodities could increase the cash or letter of credit collateral required to be posted in connection with hedging and risk management activities, which could materially affect entergy's or its subsidiaries' liquidity and financial position.
the utility operating companies and the entergy wholesale commodities business are exposed to the risk that counterparties may not meet their obligations, which may materially affect the utility operating companies and entergy wholesale commodities.
the hedging and risk management practices of the utility operating companies and the entergy wholesale commodities business are exposed to the risk that counterparties that owe entergy and its subsidiaries money, energy, or other commodities will not perform their obligations. currently, some hedging agreements contain provisions that require the counterparties to provide credit support to secure all or part of their obligations to entergy or its subsidiaries. if the counterparties to these arrangements fail to perform, entergy or its subsidiaries may enforce and recover the proceeds from the credit support provided and acquire alternative hedging arrangements, which credit
295
table of contents part i item 1a & 1b entergy corporation, utility operating companies, and system energy support may not always be adequate to cover the related obligations. in such event, entergy and its subsidiaries might incur losses in addition to amounts, if any, already paid to the counterparties. in addition, the credit commitments of entergy's lenders under its bank facilities may not be honored for a variety of reasons, including unexpected periods of financial distress affecting such lenders, which could materially affect the adequacy of its liquidity sources.
market performance and other changes may decrease the value of benefit plan assets, which then could require additional funding and result in increased benefit plan costs.
the performance of the capital markets affects the values of the assets held in trust under entergy's pension and postretirement benefit plans. a decline in the market value of the assets may increase the funding requirements relating to entergy's benefit plan liabilities and also result in higher benefit costs. as the value of the assets decreases, the "expected return on assets" component of benefit costs decreases, resulting in higher benefits costs. additionally, asset losses are incorporated into benefit costs over time, thus increasing benefits costs.
volatility in the capital markets has affected the market value of these assets, which may affect entergy's planned levels of contributions in the future. additionally, changes in interest rates affect the liabilities under entergy's pension and postretirement benefit plans; as interest rates decrease, the liabilities increase, potentially requiring additional funding and recognition of higher liability carrying costs. the funding requirements of the obligations related to the pension benefit plans can also increase as a result of changes in, among other factors, retirement rates, life expectancy assumptions, or federal regulations. for further information regarding entergy's pension and other postretirement benefit plans, refer to the "
critical accounting estimates
- qualified pension and other postretirement benefits " section of management's financial discussion and analysis for entergy and each of its registrant subsidiaries and note 11 to the financial statements.
the litigation environment in the states in which certain entergy subsidiaries operate poses a significant risk to those businesses.
entergy and its subsidiaries are involved in the ordinary course of business in a number of lawsuits involving employment, commercial, asbestos, hazardous material and ratepayer matters, and injuries and damages issues, among other matters. the states in which the utility operating companies operate, in particular louisiana, mississippi, and texas, have proven to be unusually litigious environments. judges and juries in these states have demonstrated a willingness to grant large verdicts, including punitive damages, to plaintiffs in personal injury, property damage, and business tort cases. entergy and its subsidiaries use legal and appropriate means to contest litigation threatened or filed against them, but the litigation environment in these states poses a significant business risk.
domestic or international terrorist attacks, including cyber attacks, and failures or breaches of entergy's and its subsidiaries' technology systems may adversely affect entergy's results of operations.
as power generators and distributors, entergy and its subsidiaries face heightened risk of an act or threat of terrorism, including physical and cyber attacks, either as a direct act against one of entergy's generation facilities, transmission operations centers, or distribution infrastructure used to manage and transport power to customers. an actual act could affect entergy's ability to operate, including its ability to operate the information technology systems and network infrastructure on which it relies to conduct its business. while malware was recently discovered on our corporate network and remediated on a timely basis, it did not affect the company's operational systems, nuclear plants or transmission network, nor did it have a material effect on our operations.
additionally, within entergy's industry, there have been attacks on energy infrastructure, but with minimal impact to operations, and there may be more attacks in the future. the utility operating companies also face heightened risk of an act or threat by cyber criminals intent on accessing personal information for the purpose of committing identity theft, taking company-sensitive data, or disrupting the company's ability to operate.
entergy and its subsidiaries operate in a highly regulated industry that requires the continued operation of sophisticated information technology systems and network infrastructure in accordance with mandatory and prescriptive standards. despite the implementation of multiple layers of security by entergy and its subsidiaries,
296
table of contents part i item 1a & 1b entergy corporation, utility operating companies, and system energy technology systems remain vulnerable to potential threats that could lead to unauthorized access or loss of availability to critical systems essential to the reliable operation of entergy's electric system. moreover, the functionality of entergy's technology systems depends on both its and third-party systems to which entergy is connected directly or indirectly (such as systems belonging to suppliers, vendors and contractors). while entergy has processes in place to assess systems of certain of these suppliers, vendors and contractors, entergy does not ultimately control the adequacy of their defenses against cyber and other attacks, but has implemented oversight measures to assess maturity and manage third-party risk. if entergy's or its subsidiaries' technology systems were compromised and unable to detect or recover in a timely fashion to a normal state of operations, entergy or its subsidiaries may be unable to perform critical business functions that are essential to the company's well-being and the health, safety, and security needs of its customers. in addition, an attack on its information technology infrastructure may result in a loss of its confidential, sensitive, and proprietary information, including personal information of its customers, employees, vendors, and others in entergy's care.
any such attacks, failures or breaches could have a material effect on entergy's and the utility operating companies' business, financial condition, results of operations or reputation. insurance may not be adequate to cover losses that might arise in connection with these events. the risk of such attacks, failures, or breaches may cause entergy and the utility operating companies to incur increased capital and operating costs to implement increased security for its power generation, transmission, and distribution assets and other facilities, such as additional physical facility security and security personnel, and for systems to protect its information technology and network infrastructure systems. such events may also expose entergy to an increased risk of litigation (and associated damages and fines).
(entergy new orleans)
the effect of higher purchased gas cost charges to customers taking gas service may adversely affect entergy new orleans's results of operations and liquidity.
gas rates charged to retail gas customers are comprised primarily of purchased gas cost charges, which provide no return or profit to entergy new orleans, and distribution charges, which provide a return or profit to the utility.
distribution charges are affected by the amount of gas sold to customers. purchased gas cost charges, which comprise most of a customer's bill and may be adjusted monthly, represent gas commodity costs that entergy new orleans recovers from its customers. entergy new orleans's cash flows can be affected by differences between the time period when gas is purchased and the time when ultimate recovery from customers occurs. when purchased gas cost charges increase substantially reflecting higher gas procurement costs incurred by entergy new orleans, customer usage may decrease, especially in weaker economic times, resulting in lower distribution charges for entergy new orleans, which could adversely affect results of operations.
(system energy)
system energy owns and, through an affiliate, operates a single nuclear generating facility, and it is dependent on affiliated companies for all of its revenues.
system energy's operating revenues are derived from the allocation of the capacity, energy, and related costs associated with its 90% ownership/leasehold interest in grand gulf. charges under the unit power sales agreement are paid by the utility operating companies as consideration for their respective entitlements to receive capacity and energy. the useful economic life of grand gulf is finite and is limited by the terms of its operating license, which expires in november 2044. system energy's financial condition depends both on the receipt of payments from the utility operating companies under the unit power sales agreement and on the continued commercial operation of grand gulf.

(entergy corporation)
as a holding company, entergy corporation depends on cash distributions from its subsidiaries to meet its debt service and other financial obligations and to pay dividends on its common stock.
entergy corporation is a holding company with no material revenue generating operations of its own or material assets other than the stock of its subsidiaries. accordingly, all of its operations are conducted by its subsidiaries. entergy corporation's ability to satisfy its financial obligations, including the payment of interest and principal on its outstanding debt, and to pay dividends on its common stock depends on the payment to it of dividends or distributions by its subsidiaries. the payments of dividends or distributions to entergy corporation by its subsidiaries in turn depend on their results of operations and cash flows and other items affecting retained earnings, and on any applicable legal, regulatory, or contractual limitations on subsidiaries' ability to pay such dividends or distributions. provisions in the articles of incorporation of certain of entergy corporation's subsidiaries restrict the payment of cash dividends to entergy corporation. for further information regarding dividend or distribution restrictions to entergy corporation, see note 7 to the financial statements.

the decrease was partially offset by an increase of $24.1 million in nuclear generation expenses primarily due to an overall higher scope of work performed during plant outages and higher nuclear labor costs compared to prior year and an increase of $8.2 million in fossil-fueled generation expenses primarily due to the purchase of power block 2 of the union power station in march 2016. see note 14 to the financial statements for further discussion of the union power station purchase.
taxes other than income taxes decreased primarily due to a decrease in local franchise taxes resulting from lower residential and commercial revenues compared to the prior year and a decrease in payroll taxes.
depreciation and amortization expenses increased primarily due to additions to plant in service, including power block 2 of the union power station purchased in march 2016. see note 14 to the financial statements for further discussion of the union power station purchase.
interest expense increased primarily due to:
$5.1 millionin estimated interest expense recorded in connection with the ferc orders issued in april 2016
•  in the opportunity sales proceeding.  see note 2 to the financial statements for further discussion of the opportunity sales proceeding; and
•  the net issuance of$230 millionof first mortgage bonds in 2016.  see note 5 to the financial statements for further discussion of long-term debt.

net debt consists of debt less cash and cash equivalents. debt consists of short-term borrowings and long-term debt, including the currently maturing portion. capital consists of debt, preferred stock without sinking fund, and common equity. net capital consists of capital less cash and cash equivalents. entergy arkansas uses the debt to capital ratios excluding securitization bonds in analyzing its financial condition and believes they provide useful information to its investors and creditors in evaluating entergy arkansas's financial condition because the securitization bonds are non-recourse to entergy arkansas, as more fully described in note 5 to the financial statements. entergy arkansas also uses the net debt to net capital ratio excluding securitization bonds in analyzing its financial condition and believes it provides useful information to its investors and creditors in evaluating entergy arkansas's financial condition because net debt indicates entergy arkansas's outstanding debt position that could not be readily satisfied by cash and cash equivalents on hand.
entergy arkansas seeks to optimize its capital structure in accordance with its regulatory requirements and to control its cost of capital while also maintaining equity capitalization at a level consistent with investment-
grade debt ratings. to the extent that operating cash flows are in excess of planned investments, cash may be used to reduce outstanding debt or may be paid as a dividend, or both, in appropriate amounts to maintain the targeted capital structure. to the extent that operating cash flows are insufficient to support planned investments, entergy arkansas may issue incremental debt or reduce dividends, or both, to maintain its targeted capital structure. in addition, in certain infrequent circumstances, such as large transactions that would materially alter the capital structure if financed entirely with debt and reducing dividends, entergy arkansas may receive equity contributions to maintain the targeted capital structure.
uses of capital entergy arkansas requires capital resources for:
•  construction and other capital investments;
•  debt and preferred stock maturities or retirements;
•  working capital purposes, including the financing of fuel and purchased power costs; and
•  dividend and interest payments.

also in addition to the contractual obligations, entergy arkansas has ($117.7) million of unrecognized tax benefits and interest net of unused tax attributes for which the timing of payments beyond 12 months cannot be reasonably estimated due to uncertainties in the timing of effective settlement of tax positions. see note 3 to the financial statements for additional information regarding unrecognized tax benefits.
in addition to routine capital spending to maintain operations, the planned capital investment estimate for entergy arkansas includes specific investments, such as transmission projects to enhance reliability, reduce congestion, and enable economic growth; distribution spending to enhance reliability and improve service to customers, including investment to support advanced metering; resource planning, including potential generation projects;
system improvements; investments in ano 1 and 2; and other investments. estimated capital expenditures are subject to periodic review and modification and may vary based on the ongoing effects of regulatory constraints and requirements, environmental compliance, business opportunities, market volatility, economic trends, business restructuring, changes in project plans, and the ability to access capital. management provides more information on long-term debt and preferred stock maturities in notes 5 and 6 to the financial statements.

advanced metering infrastructure (ami)
in september 2016, entergy arkansas filed an application seeking a finding from the apsc that entergy arkansas's deployment of ami is in the public interest. entergy arkansas proposed to replace existing meters with advanced meters that enable two-way data communication; design and build a secure and reliable network to support such communications; and implement support systems. ami is intended to serve as the foundation of entergy arkansas's modernized power grid. the filing included an estimate of implementation costs for ami of $208 million . the filing identified a number of quantified and unquantified benefits, and entergy arkansas provided a cost benefit analysis showing that its ami deployment is expected to produce a nominal net benefit to customers of $406 million. entergy arkansas also sought to continue to include in rate base the remaining book value of existing meters, which was approximately $57 million at december 31, 2015, that will be retired as part of the ami deployment and also to depreciate those assets using current depreciation rates. entergy arkansas proposed a 15-year depreciable life for the new advanced meters, the three-year deployment of which is expected to begin in 2019. deployment of the communications network is expected to begin in 2018. entergy arkansas proposed to include the ami deployment costs and the quantified benefits in future formula rate plan filings, and the 2018 costs were approved in the 2017
formula rate plan filing. in june 2017 the apsc staff and arkansas attorney general filed direct testimony. the apsc staff generally supported entergy arkansas's ami deployment conditioned on various recommendations. the arkansas attorney general's consultant primarily recommended denial of entergy arkansas's application but alternatively suggested recommendations in the event the apsc approves entergy arkansas's proposal. entergy arkansas filed rebuttal testimony in june 2017, substantially accepting the apsc staff's recommendations. in august
2017, entergy arkansas and the parties to the proceeding filed a joint motion to approve a unanimous settlement agreement. in october 2017 the apsc issued an order finding that entergy arkansas's ami deployment is in the public interest and approving the settlement agreement subject to a minor modification. entergy arkansas expects to recover the undepreciated balance of its existing meters through a regulatory asset to be amortized over 15 years.
entergy arkansas has begun discussions with the other parties to implement the items in the settlement agreement including pre-pay and time of use programs.
sources of capital entergy arkansas's sources to meet its capital requirements include:
•  internally generated funds;
•  cash on hand;
•  debt or preferred stock issuances; and
•  bank financing under new or existing facilities.
entergy arkansas may refinance, redeem, or otherwise retire debt and preferred stock prior to maturity, to the extent market conditions and interest and dividend rates are favorable.
all debt and common and preferred stock issuances by entergy arkansas require prior regulatory approval. preferred stock and debt issuances are also subject to issuance tests set forth in entergy arkansas's corporate charters, bond indentures, and other agreements. entergy arkansas has sufficient capacity under these tests to meet its foreseeable capital needs.

production cost allocation rider the apsc approved a production cost allocation rider for recovery from customers of the retail portion of the costs allocated to entergy arkansas as a result of the system agreement proceedings, which are discussed in the "
system agreement cost equalization proceedings
" section below. these costs cause an increase in entergy arkansas's deferred fuel cost balance because entergy arkansas pays the costs over seven months but collects the costs from customers over twelve months .
in may 2014, entergy arkansas filed its annual redetermination of the production cost allocation rider to recover the $3 million unrecovered retail balance as of december 31, 2013 and the $67.8 million system agreement bandwidth remedy payment made in may 2014 as a result of the compliance filing pursuant to the ferc's february 2014 orders related to the bandwidth payments/receipts for the june - december 2005 period. in january 2015 the apsc issued an order approving entergy arkansas's request for recovery of the $3 million under-recovered amount based on the true-
up of the production cost allocation rider and the $67.8 million may 2014 system agreement bandwidth remedy payment subject to refund with interest, with recovery of these payments concluding with the last billing cycle in december
2015. the apsc also found that entergy arkansas is entitled to carrying charges pursuant to the current terms of the production cost allocation rider. entergy arkansas made its compliance filing pursuant to the order in january

2015 production cost allocation rider update continued through june 2016.
in may 2016, entergy arkansas filed its annual redetermination pursuant to the production cost allocation rider, which reflected recovery of the production cost allocation rider true-up adjustment of the 2014 and 2015
unrecovered retail balance in the amount of $1.9 million . additionally, the redetermined rates reflected the recovery of a $1.9 million system agreement bandwidth remedy payment resulting from a compliance filing pursuant to the ferc's december 2015 order related to test year 2009 production costs. the rates for the 2016 production cost allocation rider update became effective with the first billing cycle of july 2016, and the rates were effective through june 2017.
in may 2017, entergy arkansas filed its annual redetermination pursuant to the production cost allocation rider, which reflected a credit amount of $0.3 million resulting from a compliance filing pursuant to the ferc's september
2016 order. additionally, the redetermined rate reflected recovery of the production cost allocation rider true-up adjustment of the 2016 unrecovered retail balance in the amount of $0.3 million. because of the small effect of the
2017 production cost allocation rider update, entergy arkansas proposed to reduce the effective period of the update to one month, july 2017. after the one month collection period, rates were set to zero for all rate classes for the period august 2017 through june 2018.
energy cost recovery rider entergy arkansas's retail rates include an energy cost recovery rider to recover fuel and purchased energy costs in monthly customer bills. the rider utilizes the prior calendar-year energy costs and projected energy sales for the twelve -month period commencing on april 1 of each year to develop an energy cost rate, which is redetermined annually and includes a true-up adjustment reflecting the over- or under-recovery, including carrying charges, of the energy costs for the prior calendar year. the energy cost recovery rider tariff also allows an interim rate request depending upon the level of over- or under-recovery of fuel and purchased energy costs.
in january 2014, entergy arkansas filed a motion with the apsc relating to its redetermination of its energy cost rate that was subsequently filed in march 2014. in that motion, entergy arkansas requested that the apsc authorize entergy arkansas to exclude $65.9 million of deferred fuel and purchased energy costs incurred in 2013 from the redetermination of its 2014 energy cost rate. the $65.9 million is an estimate of the incremental fuel and replacement energy costs that entergy arkansas incurred as a result of the ano stator incident. entergy arkansas requested that the apsc authorize entergy arkansas to retain that amount in its deferred fuel balance, with recovery to be reviewed in a later period after more information is available regarding various claims associated with the ano stator incident. the apsc approved entergy arkansas's request in february 2014. in july 2017, entergy arkansas filed for a change in rates pursuant to its formula rate plan rider. in that proceeding, the apsc approved a settlement agreement agreed upon by the parties, including a provision that requires entergy arkansas to initiate a proceeding for the purpose of recovering funds currently withheld from rates and related to the stator incident, including the $65.9 million of deferred fuel and purchased energy costs previously noted, subject to certain timelines and conditions set forth in the settlement agreement. see the "
ano damage, outage, and nrc reviews
" section in note 8 to the financial statements for further discussion of the ano stator incident.

table of contents entergy arkansas, inc. and subsidiaries management's financial discussion and analysis opportunity sales proceeding in june 2009 the lpsc filed a complaint requesting that the ferc determine that certain of entergy arkansas's sales of electric energy to third parties: (a) violated the provisions of the system agreement that allocated the energy generated by entergy system resources, (b) imprudently denied the entergy system and its ultimate consumers the benefits of low-cost entergy system generating capacity, and (c) violated the provision of the system agreement that prohibited sales to third parties by individual companies absent an offer of a right-of-first-refusal to other utility operating companies. the lpsc's complaint challenged sales made beginning in 2002 and requests refunds. in july 2009 the utility operating companies filed a response to the complaint requesting that the ferc dismiss the complaint on the merits without hearing because the lpsc has failed to meet its burden of showing any violation of the system agreement and failed to produce any evidence of imprudent action by the entergy system. in their response, the utility operating companies explained that the system agreement clearly contemplates that the utility operating companies may make sales to third parties for their own account, subject to the requirement that those sales be included in the load (or load shape) for the applicable utility operating company. the ferc subsequently ordered a hearing in the proceeding.
the lpsc filed direct testimony in the proceeding alleging, among other things, (1) that entergy violated the system agreement by permitting entergy arkansas to make non-requirements sales to non-affiliated third parties rather than making such energy available to the other utility operating companies' customers; and (2) that over the period 2000 - 2009, these non-requirements sales caused harm to the utility operating companies' customers and these customers should be compensated for this harm by entergy. in subsequent testimony, the lpsc modified its original damages claim in favor of quantifying damages by re-running intra-system bills. the utility operating companies believe the lpsc's allegations are without merit. a hearing in the matter was held in august 2010.
in december 2010 the alj issued an initial decision. the alj found that the system agreement allowed for entergy arkansas to make the sales to third parties but concluded that the sales should be accounted for in the same manner as joint account sales. the alj concluded that "shareholders" should make refunds of the damages to the utility operating companies, along with interest. entergy disagreed with several aspects of the alj's initial decision and in january 2011 filed with the ferc exceptions to the decision.
the ferc issued a decision in june 2012 and held that, while the system agreement is ambiguous, it does provide authority for individual utility operating companies to make opportunity sales for their own account and entergy arkansas made and priced these sales in good faith. the ferc found, however, that the system agreement does not provide authority for an individual utility operating company to allocate the energy associated with such opportunity sales as part of its load, but provides a different allocation authority. the ferc further found that the after-the-fact accounting methodology used to allocate the energy used to supply the sales was inconsistent with the system agreement. quantifying the effect of the ferc's decision requires re-running intra-system bills for a ten-year period, and the ferc in its decision established further hearing procedures to determine the calculation of the effects. in july 2012, entergy and the lpsc filed requests for rehearing of the ferc's june 2012 decision. a hearing was held in may 2013 to quantify the effect of repricing the opportunity sales in accordance with the ferc's june 2012 decision.
in august 2013 the presiding judge issued an initial decision in the calculation proceeding. the initial decision concluded that the methodology proposed by the lpsc, rather than the methodologies proposed by entergy or the ferc staff, should be used to calculate the payments that entergy arkansas is to make to the other utility operating companies. the initial decision also concluded that the other system agreement service schedules should not be adjusted and that payments by entergy arkansas should not be reflected in the rough production cost equalization bandwidth calculations for the applicable years. the initial decision recognized that the lpsc's methodology would result in an inequitable windfall to the other utility operating companies and, therefore, concluded that any payments by entergy arkansas should be reduced by 20% . the lpsc, apsc, city council, and ferc staff filed briefs on exceptions and/or briefs opposing exceptions. entergy filed a brief on exceptions requesting that the ferc reverse the initial decision and a brief opposing certain exceptions taken by the lpsc and ferc staff.

table of contents entergy arkansas, inc. and subsidiaries management's financial discussion and analysis in april 2016 the ferc issued orders addressing requests for rehearing filed in july 2012 and the alj's august 2013
initial decision. the first order denied entergy's request for rehearing and affirmed the ferc's earlier rulings that entergy's original methodology for allocating energy costs to the opportunity sales was incorrect and, as a result, entergy arkansas must make payments to the other utility operating companies to put them in the same position that they would have been in absent the incorrect allocation. the ferc clarified that interest should be included with the payments. the second order affirmed in part, and reversed in part, the rulings in the alj's august 2013 initial decision regarding the methodology that should be used to calculate the payments entergy arkansas is to make to the other utility operating companies. the ferc affirmed the alj's ruling that a full re-run of intra-system bills should be performed, but required that methodology be modified so that the sales have the same priority for purposes of energy allocation as joint account sales. the ferc reversed the alj's decision that any payments by entergy arkansas should be reduced by 20% . the ferc also reversed the alj's decision that adjustments to other system agreement service schedules and excess bandwidth payments should not be taken into account when calculating the payments to be made by entergy arkansas. the ferc held that such adjustments and excess bandwidth payments should be taken into account, but ordered further proceedings before an alj to address whether a cap on any reduction due to bandwidth payments was necessary and to implement the other adjustments to the calculation methodology.
in may 2016, entergy services filed a request for rehearing of the ferc's april 2016 order arguing that payments made by entergy arkansas should be reduced as a result of the timing of the lpsc's approval of certain contracts.
entergy services also filed a request for clarification and/or rehearing of the ferc's april 2016 order addressing the alj's august 2013 initial decision. the apsc and the lpsc also filed requests for rehearing of the ferc's april
2016 order. in september 2017 the ferc issued an order denying the request for rehearing on the issue of whether any payments by entergy arkansas to the other utility operating companies should be reduced due to the timing of the lpsc's approval of entergy arkansas's wholesale baseload contract with entergy louisiana. in november 2017 the ferc issued an order denying all of the remaining requests for rehearing of the april 2016 order. in november 2017, entergy services filed a petition for review in the d.c. circuit of the ferc's orders in the first two phases of the opportunity sales case. in december 2017 the d.c. circuit granted entergy services's request to hold the appeal in abeyance pending final resolution of the related proceeding still pending with the ferc. in january 2018 the apsc and the lpsc filed separate petitions for review in the d.c. circuit, and the d.c. circuit consolidated the appeals with entergy services's appeal and held all of the appeals in abeyance.
pursuant to the procedural schedule established in the case, entergy services re-ran intra-system bills for the ten-year period 2000-2009 to quantify the effects of the ferc's ruling. in november 2016 the lpsc submitted testimony disputing certain aspects of the calculations. a hearing was held in may 2017. in july 2017, the alj issued an initial decision concluding that entergy arkansas should pay $86 million plus interest to the other utility operating companies. in august 2017 the utility operating companies, the lpsc, the apsc, and ferc staff filed individual briefs on exceptions challenging various aspects of the initial decision. in september 2017 the utility operating companies, the lpsc, the apsc, the mpsc, the city council, and ferc staff filed separate briefs opposing exceptions taken by various parties. the case is pending before the ferc. no payments will be made or received by the utility operating companies until the ferc issues an order reviewing the initial decision and entergy submits a subsequent filing to comply with that order.
the effect of the ferc's decisions thus far in the case would be that entergy arkansas will make payments to some or all of the other utility operating companies. because further proceedings will still occur in the case, the amount and recipients of payments by entergy arkansas are unknown at this time. based on testimony previously submitted in the case and its assessment of the april 2016 ferc orders, in the first quarter 2016, entergy arkansas recorded a liability of $87 million , which includes interest, for its estimated increased costs and payment to the other utility operating companies. this estimate is subject to change depending on how the ferc resolves the issues that are still outstanding in the case, including its review of the july 2017 initial decision. entergy arkansas's increased costs will be attributed to entergy arkansas's retail and wholesale businesses, and it is not probable that entergy arkansas will recover the wholesale portion. entergy arkansas, therefore, recorded a deferred fuel regulatory asset in the first quarter 2016 of approximately $75 million , which represents its estimate of the retail portion of the costs. following its assessment of the course of the proceedings, including the ferc's denial of rehearing in november 2017
314
table of contents entergy arkansas, inc. and subsidiaries management's financial discussion and analysis described above, in the fourth quarter 2017, entergy arkansas recorded an additional liability of $35 million and a regulatory asset of $31 million. because management currently expects to recover the retail portion of the costs through a base rate proceeding or newly proposed rider, the regulatory asset is reflected as other regulatory assets as of december 31, 2017.

table of contents entergy louisiana, llc and subsidiaries management's financial discussion and analysis results of operations net income
2017 compared to 2016
net income decreased $305.7 million primarily due to the effect of the enactment of the tax cuts and jobs act, in december 2017, which resulted in a decrease of $182.6 million in net income in 2017, and the effect of a settlement with the irs related to the 2010-2011 irs audit, which resulted in a $136.1 million reduction of income tax expense in 2016. also contributing to the decrease in net income were higher other operation and maintenance expenses. the decrease was partially offset by higher net revenue and higher other income. see note 3 to the financial statements for discussion of the effects of the tax cuts and jobs act and the irs audit.
2016 compared to 2015
net income increased $175.4 million primarily due to the effect of a settlement with the irs related to the
2010-2011 irs audit, which resulted in a $136.1 million reduction of income tax expense in 2016. also contributing to the increase were lower other operation and maintenance expenses, higher net revenue, and higher other income.
the increase was partially offset by higher depreciation and amortization expenses, higher interest expense, and higher nuclear refueling outage expenses. see note 3 to the financial statements for discussion of the irs audit.

the regulatory credit resulting from reduction of the federal corporate income tax rate variance is due to the reduction of the vidalia purchased power agreement regulatory liability by $30.5 million and the reduction of the louisiana act 55 financing savings obligation regulatory liabilities by $25 million as a result of the enactment of the tax cuts and jobs act, in december 2017, which lowered the federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%.
the effects of the tax cuts and jobs act are discussed further in note 3 to the financial statements.

table of contents entergy louisiana, llc and subsidiaries management's financial discussion and analysis the retail electric price variance is primarily due to an increase in formula rate plan revenues, implemented with the first billing cycle of march 2016, to collect the estimated first-year revenue requirement related to the purchase of power blocks 3 and 4 of the union power station in march 2016 and a provision recorded in 2016 related to the settlement of the waterford 3 replacement steam generator prudence review proceeding. see note 2 to the financial statements for further discussion of the formula rate plan revenues and the waterford 3 replacement steam generator prudence review proceeding.
the louisiana act 55 financing savings obligation variance results from a regulatory charge recorded in 2016 for tax savings to be shared with customers per an agreement approved by the lpsc. the tax savings resulted from the
2010-2011 irs audit settlement on the treatment of the louisiana act 55 financing of storm costs for hurricane gustav and hurricane ike. see note 3 to the financial statements for additional discussion of the settlement and benefit sharing.
the volume/weather variance is primarily due to the effect of less favorable weather on residential and commercial sales and decreased usage during the unbilled sales period. the decrease was partially offset by an increase of
1,237 gwh, or 4%, in industrial usage primarily due to an increase in demand from existing customers and expansion projects in the chemicals industry.

other income statement variances
2017 compared to 2016
other operation and maintenance expenses increased primarily due to:
an increase of $17.8 million in nuclear generation expenses primarily due to higher nuclear labor costs,
•  including contract labor, to position the nuclear fleet to meet its operational goals, partially offset by a lower scope of work performed during plant outages in 2017;
•  an increase of $9.5 millionin compensation and benefits costs primarily due to higher incentive-based compensation accruals in 2017 as compared to the prior year;
•  an increase of $4.1 million as a result of the amount of transmission costs allocated by miso.see note 2 to the financial statements for further information on the recovery of these costs;
•  an increase of $3.6 million in transmission and distribution expenses due to higher vegetation maintenance costs; and
•  an increase of $3.2 million in write-offs of customer accounts.
taxes other than income taxes increased primarily due to increases in ad valorem taxes, state franchise taxes, and payroll taxes. ad valorem taxes increased primarily due to higher assessments, including the assessment of arkansas ad valorem taxes on the union power station beginning in 2017. state franchise taxes increased primarily due to a change in the louisiana franchise tax law which became effective for 2017.
depreciation and amortization expenses increased primarily due to additions to plant in service, including power blocks 3 and 4 of the union power station purchased in march 2016, and the effects of recording in third quarter
2016 final court decisions in the river bend and waterford 3 lawsuits against the doe related to spent nuclear fuel storage costs. the damages awarded include the reimbursement of approximately $6 million of spent nuclear fuel storage costs previously recorded as depreciation expense. see note 14 to the financial statements for discussion of the union power station purchase. see note 8 to the financial statements for discussion of the spent nuclear fuel litigation.
other income increased primarily due to an increase in the allowance for equity funds used during construction due to higher construction work in progress in 2017, which includes the st. charles power station project, and higher realized gains in 2017 on the river bend decommissioning trust fund investments, including portfolio rebalancing to the 30% interest in river bend formerly owned by cajun.
interest expense decreased primarily due to an increase in the allowance for borrowed funds used during construction due to higher construction work in progress in 2017, which includes the st. charles power station project.
2016 compared to 2015
nuclear refueling outage expenses increased primarily due to the amortization of higher expenses associated with the refueling outages at waterford 3.
other operation and maintenance expenses decreased primarily due to:
the $45 million write-off recorded in 2015 to recognize the portion of the assets associated with the
•  waterford 3 replacement steam generator project no longer probable of recovery.  see note 2 to the financial statements for further discussion of the prudence review proceeding; and
328
table of contents entergy louisiana, llc and subsidiaries management's financial discussion and analysis a decrease of $35 million in compensation and benefits costs primarily due to a decrease in net periodic pension and other postretirement costs as a result of higher discount rates used to value the benefit
•  liabilities and a refinement in the approach used to estimate the service cost and interest cost components of pension and other postretirement costs. see "critical accounting estimates- qualified pension and other postretirement benefits" below and note 11 to the financial statements for further discussion of pension and other postretirement benefit costs.
the decrease was partially offset by an increase of $19.9 million in nuclear generation expenses primarily due to higher nuclear labor costs, including contract labor.
depreciation and amortization expenses increased primarily due to additions to plant in service, including power blocks 3 and 4 of the union power station purchased in march 2016.
other income increased primarily due to an increase in the allowance for equity funds used during construction due to higher construction work in progress in 2016, which included the st. charles power station project, and increased distribution and transmission spending. the increase was also due to higher income in 2016 on the river bend and waterford 3 decommissioning trust fund investments.
interest expense increased primarily due to:
•  the issuance in march 2016 of $425 million of 3.25% series collateral trust mortgage bonds;
•  the issuance in march 2016 of $200 million of 4.95% series first mortgage bonds; and
•  the issuance in october 2016 of $400 million of 2.40% series collateral trust mortgage bonds.
the increase was partially offset by the refinancing at lower interest rates of certain first mortgage bonds. see note 5 to the financial statements for details of long-term debt.
income taxes the effective income tax rates for 2017, 2016, and 2015 were 60.5%, 12.6%, and 28.6%, respectively. the difference in the effective income tax rate of 60.5% for 2017 versus the statutory rate of 35% for 2017 was primarily due to the enactment of the tax cuts and jobs act, signed by president trump in december 2017, which changed the federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective in 2018. see note 3 to the financial statements for further discussion of the effects of the tax cuts and jobs act. the difference in the effective income tax rate of 12.6%
for 2016 versus the statutory rate of 35% for 2016 was primarily due to the reversal of a portion of the provision for uncertain tax positions as a result of the settlement of the 2010-2011 irs audit in the second quarter 2016 and book and tax differences related to the non-taxable income distributions earned on preferred membership interests, partially offset by state income taxes. see note 3 to the financial statements for a reconciliation of the federal statutory rate of 35% to the effective income tax rates.

net debt consists of debt less cash and cash equivalents. debt consists of short-term borrowings and long-term debt, including the currently maturing portion. capital consists of debt and common equity. net capital consists of capital less cash and cash equivalents. entergy louisiana uses the debt to capital ratios excluding securitization bonds in analyzing its financial condition and believes they provide useful information to its investors and creditors in evaluating entergy louisiana's financial condition because the securitization bonds are non-recourse to entergy louisiana, as more fully described in note 5 to the financial statements. entergy louisiana also uses the net debt to net capital ratio excluding securitization bonds in analyzing its financial condition and believes it provides useful information to its investors and creditors in evaluating entergy louisiana's financial condition because net debt indicates entergy louisiana's outstanding debt position that could not be readily satisfied by cash and cash equivalents on hand.
entergy louisiana seeks to optimize its capital structure in accordance with its regulatory requirements and to control its cost of capital while also maintaining equity capitalization at a level consistent with investment-
grade debt ratings. to the extent that operating cash flows are in excess of planned investments, cash may be used to reduce outstanding debt or may be paid as a dividend, or both, in appropriate amounts to maintain the targeted capital structure. to the extent that operating cash flows are insufficient to support planned investments, entergy louisiana may issue incremental debt or reduce dividends, or both, to maintain its targeted capital structure. in addition, in certain infrequent circumstances, such as large transactions that would materially alter the capital structure if financed entirely with debt and reducing dividends, entergy louisiana may receive equity contributions to maintain the targeted capital structure.
uses of capital entergy louisiana requires capital resources for:
•  construction and other capital investments;
•  debt maturities or retirements;
•  working capital purposes, including the financing of fuel and purchased power costs; and

entergy louisiana is, therefore, subject to the risks related to owning and operating nuclear plants. these include risks related to: the use, storage, and handling and disposal of high-level and low-level radioactive materials;
the substantial financial requirements, both for capital investments and operational needs, to position entergy's nuclear fleet to meet its operational goals, including the financial requirements to address emerging issues like stress corrosion cracking of certain materials within the plant systems and the fukushima event; regulatory requirements and potential future regulatory changes, including changes affecting the regulations governing nuclear plant ownership, operations, license renewal and amendments, and decommissioning; the performance and capacity factors of these nuclear plants; the availability of interim or permanent sites for the disposal of spent nuclear fuel and nuclear waste, including the fees charged for such disposal; the sufficiency of nuclear decommissioning trust fund assets and earnings to complete decommissioning of each site when required; and limitations on the amounts and types of insurance commercially available for losses in connection with nuclear plant operations and catastrophic events such as a nuclear accident. in the event of an unanticipated early shutdown of river bend or waterford 3, entergy louisiana may be required to provide additional funds or credit support to satisfy regulatory requirements for decommissioning.

management's financial discussion and analysis results of operations net income
2017 compared to 2016
net income increased $0.8 million primarily due to higher other income, lower other operation and maintenance expenses, and lower interest expense, substantially offset by higher depreciation and amortization expenses and a higher effective income tax rate.
2016 compared to 2015
net income increased $16.5 million primarily due to lower other operation and maintenance expenses, higher net revenues, and a lower effective income tax rate, partially offset by higher depreciation and amortization expenses.
net revenue
2017 compared to 2016
net revenue consists of operating revenues net of: 1) fuel, fuel-related expenses, and gas purchased for resale, 2)
purchased power expenses, and 3) other regulatory credits. following is an analysis of the change in net revenue comparing 2017 to 2016.
amount
-in millions
2016 net revenue               $705.4

other                             2.4
2017 net revenue               $703.1
the volume/weather variance is primarily due to the effect of less favorable weather on residential and commercial sales.
the retail electric price variance is primarily due to a $19.4 million net annual increase in rates, effective with the first billing cycle of july 2016, and an increase in the energy efficiency rider, effective with the first billing cycle of february 2017, each as approved by the mpsc. the increase was partially offset by decreased storm damage rider revenues due to resetting the storm damage provision to zero beginning with the november 2016 billing cycle. entergy mississippi resumed billing the storm damage rider effective with the september 2017 billing cycle.
see note 2 to the financial statements for more discussion of the formula rate plan and the storm damage rider.

2016 net revenue               $705.4
the retail electric price variance is primarily due to a $19.4 million net annual increase in revenues, as approved by the mpsc, effective with the first billing cycle of july 2016, and an increase in revenues collected through the storm damage rider. see note 2 to the financial statements for more discussion of the formula rate plan and the storm damage rider.
the volume/weather variance is primarily due to an increase of 153 gwh, or 1%, in billed electricity usage, including an increase in industrial usage, partially offset by the effect of less favorable weather on residential and commercial sales. the increase in industrial usage is primarily due to expansion projects in the pulp and paper industry, increased demand for existing customers, primarily in the metals industry, and new customers in the wood products industry.
the net wholesale revenue variance is primarily due to entergy mississippi's exit from the system agreement in november 2015.
the reserve equalization revenue variance is primarily due to the absence of reserve equalization revenue as compared to the same period in 2015 resulting from entergy mississippi's exit from the system agreement in november
2015.
other income statement variances
2017 compared to 2016
other operation and maintenance expenses decreased primarily due to:
a decrease of $12 million in fossil-fueled generation expenses primarily due to lower long-term service
•  agreement costs and a lower scope of work done during plant outages in 2017 as compared to the same period in 2016; and
•  a decrease of $3.6 million in storm damage provisions.  see note 2 to the financial statements for a discussion on storm cost recovery.
the decrease was partially offset by an increase of $4.8 million in energy efficiency costs and an increase of $2.7
million in compensation and benefits costs primarily due to higher incentive-based compensation accruals in 2017 as compared to the prior year.
357
table of contents entergy mississippi, inc.
management's financial discussion and analysis depreciation and amortization expenses increased primarily due to additions to plant in service.
other income increased primarily due to interest income recorded in connection with the opportunity sales proceeding, interest income recorded on the deferred fuel balance, and an increase in the allowance for equity funds used during construction due to higher construction work in progress in 2017 as compared to 2016. see note 2
to the financial statements for further discussion of the opportunity sales proceeding.
interest expense decreased primarily due to the refinancing at lower interest rates of certain first mortgage bonds in 2016 and the retirement, at maturity, of $125 million of 3.25% series first mortgage bonds in june 2016. see note 5 to the financial statements for details of long-term debt.
2016 compared to 2015
other operation and maintenance expenses decreased primarily due to:
•  a decrease of $9.4 million in fossil-fueled generation expenses primarily due to a lower scope of work done during plant outages in 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015;
a decrease of $6.1 million in compensation and benefits costs primarily due to a decrease in net periodic pension and other postretirement benefits costs as a result of an increase in the discount rate used to value the benefit liabilities and a refinement in the approach used to estimate the service cost and
•  interest cost components of pension and other postretirement costs.  see "management's financial discussion and analysis-critical accounting estimates- qualified pension and other postretirement benefits" below and note 11 to the financial statements for further discussion of pension and other postretirement benefit costs;
•  a decrease of $2 million due to lower write-offs of uncollectible customer accounts in 2016;
•  a decrease of $2 million in energy efficiency costs; and

period operating activities net cash flow provided by operating activities increased $14.3 million in 2017 primarily due to the timing of recovery of fuel and purchased power costs in 2017 as compared to 2016 and an increase of $12.6 million in income tax refunds in 2017 as compared to 2016. entergy mississippi had income tax refunds in 2017 and 2016 in accordance with an intercompany income tax allocation agreement. the 2017 income tax refunds were primarily due to the utilization of entergy mississippi's federal net operating losses and state income tax refunds resulting from the carryback of net operating losses. the increase was partially offset by the timing of payments to vendors.
net cash flow provided by operating activities decreased $160 million in 2016 primarily due to the timing of recovery of fuel and purchased power costs in 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015 and $15.3 million in insurance proceeds received in 2015 related to the unplanned outage event that occurred at the baxter wilson (unit
1) power plant in september 2013. the decrease was partially offset by income tax refunds of $12.5 million in 2016
compared to income tax payments of $61.3 million in 2015. entergy mississippi had income tax refunds in 2016 and income tax payments in 2015 in accordance with an intercompany income tax allocation agreement. the 2016 income tax refunds resulted primarily from adjustments associated with the settlement of the 2010-2011 irs audit whereas the income tax payments in 2015 were primarily due to the results of operations and the reversal of taxable temporary differences as well as final settlement of amounts outstanding associated with the 2006-2007 irs audit. see note 3
to the financial statements for a discussion of the income tax audits.
investing activities net cash flow used in investing activities increased $127.8 million in 2017 primarily due to:

•  insurance proceeds of $12.9 million received in 2015 related to the unplanned outage event that occurred at the baxter wilson (unit 1) power plant in september 2013;
•  an increase of $11.4 million in distribution construction expenditures primarily due to a higher scope of non-storm related work performed in 2016 as compared to 2015; and
•  an increase of $10.1 million due to various information technology projects and upgrades.
the increase was partially offset by a decrease of $20.1 million in fossil-fueled generation construction expenditures primarily due to a decreased scope of work performed during plant outages in 2016 as compared to 2015
and money pool activity.

million in 2015. the money pool is an inter-company borrowing arrangement designed to reduce the utility subsidiaries' need for external short-term borrowings.
financing activities net cash flow provided by financing activities increased $111.5 million in 2017 primarily due to the issuance of
$150 million of 3.25% series first mortgage bonds in november 2017 and the redemption of $30 million of 6.25%
series preferred stock in 2016, partially offset by the net issuance of $61.4 million of long-term debt in 2016.
entergy mississippi's financing activities provided $8.4 million of cash in 2016 compared to using $43.2 million in
2015 primarily due to the net issuance of $61.4 million of long-term debt in 2016 and a decrease of $16 million in common stock dividends paid in 2016, partially offset by the redemption of $30 million of 6.25% series preferred stock. the decrease in dividends paid was primarily because of lower operating cash flows and higher capital expenditures, each discussed above.
see note 5 to the financial statements for details on long-term debt.

•  construction and other capital investments;
•  debt and preferred stock maturities or retirements;

in january 2014 the u.s. supreme court issued a decision in which it held that cases brought by attorneys general as the sole plaintiff to enforce state laws were not considered "mass actions" under the class action fairness act, so as to establish federal subject matter jurisdiction. one day later the attorney general renewed his motion to remand the entergy case back to state court, citing the u.s. supreme court's decision. the defendant entergy companies responded to that motion reiterating the additional grounds asserted for federal question jurisdiction, and the district court held oral argument on the renewed motion to remand in february 2014. in april 2015 the district court entered an order denying the renewed motion to remand, holding that the district court has federal question subject matter jurisdiction. the attorney general appealed to the u.s. fifth circuit court of appeals the denial of the motion to remand. in july 2015 the fifth circuit issued an order denying the appeal, and the attorney general subsequently filed a petition for rehearing of the request for interlocutory appeal, which was also denied.

net debt consists of debt less cash and cash equivalents. debt consists of short-term borrowings, long-term debt, including the currently maturing portion, and the long-term payable to entergy louisiana. capital consists of debt, preferred stock without sinking fund, and common equity. net capital consists of capital less cash and cash equivalents. entergy new orleans uses the debt to capital ratios excluding securitization bonds in analyzing its financial condition and believes they provide useful information to its investors and creditors in evaluating entergy new orleans's financial condition because the securitization bonds are non-recourse to entergy new orleans, as more fully described in note 5 to the financial statements. entergy new orleans also uses the net debt to net capital ratio excluding securitization bonds in analyzing its financial condition and believes it provides useful information to its investors and creditors in evaluating entergy new orleans's financial condition because net debt indicates entergy new orleans's outstanding debt position that could not be readily satisfied by cash and cash equivalents on hand.
entergy new orleans seeks to optimize its capital structure in accordance with its regulatory requirements and to control its cost of capital while also maintaining equity capitalization at a level consistent with investment-
grade debt ratings. to the extent that operating cash flows are in excess of planned investments, cash may be used to reduce outstanding debt or may be paid as a dividend, or both, in appropriate amounts to maintain the targeted capital structure. to the extent that operating cash flows are insufficient to support planned investments, entergy new orleans may issue incremental debt or reduce dividends, or both, to maintain its targeted capital structure. in addition, in certain infrequent circumstances, such as large transactions that would materially alter the capital structure if financed entirely with debt and reducing dividends, entergy new orleans may receive equity contributions to maintain the targeted capital structure.

•  construction and other capital investments;

31, 2016. in january 2017 several intervenors filed testimony opposing the construction of the new orleans power station on various grounds. in july 2017, entergy new orleans submitted a supplemental and amending application to the city council seeking approval to construct either the originally proposed 226 mw advanced combustion turbine, or alternatively, a 128 mw unit composed of natural gas-fired reciprocating engines and a related cost recovery plan. the application included an updated cost estimate of $232 million for the 226 mw advanced combustion turbine.
the cost estimate for the alternative 128 mw unit is $210 million. in addition, the application renewed the commitment to pursue up to 100 mw of renewable resources to serve new orleans. in testimony filed subsequent to entergy new orleans's supplemental and amending application, several intervenors oppose city council approval of either alternative, while the city council advisors and one intervenor support the smaller alternative. a contested hearing was held in december 2017 and post-hearing briefs were filed in january 2018. in february 2018 the city council utility committee adopted a resolution approving construction of the 128 mw unit. the full city council is expected to vote on the resolution in march 2018. the commercial operation date is dependent on the alternative selected by the city council and the receipt of other permits and approvals.
gas infrastructure rebuild plan in september 2016, entergy new orleans submitted to the city council a request for authorization for entergy new orleans to proceed with annual incremental capital funding of $12.5 million for its gas infrastructure rebuild plan, which would replace of all of entergy new orleans's low pressure cast iron, steel, and vintage plastic pipe over a ten-year period commencing in 2017. entergy new orleans also proposed that recovery of the investment to fund its gas infrastructure replacement plan be determined in connection with its next base rate case, which is anticipated to be filed in 2018. the city council has authorized entergy new orleans to proceed with its replacement plans at the requested pace until such time that rates resulting from the anticipated 2018 rate case are implemented (approximately 13 months after filing). as a result of the anticipated 2018 rate case, the city council may establish new overall gas base rates to allow entergy new orleans to continue to recover these replacement costs. the city council has established a schedule for proceedings in advance of the rate case intended to provide an opportunity for evaluation of the gas infrastructure replacement plan that would best serve the public interest and the effect on customers of the approval of any such plan.
advanced metering infrastructure (ami)
in october 2016, entergy new orleans filed an application seeking a finding from the city council that entergy new orleans's deployment of advanced electric and gas metering infrastructure is in the public interest. entergy new orleans proposed to deploy advanced meters that enable two-way data communication; design and build a secure and reliable network to support such communications; and implement support systems. ami is intended to serve as the foundation of entergy new orleans's modernized power grid. the filing included an estimate of implementation costs for ami of $75 million . the filing identified a number of quantified and unquantified benefits, and entergy new orleans provided a cost/benefit analysis showing that its combined electric and gas ami deployment is expected to produce a nominal net benefit to customers of $101 million. entergy new orleans also sought to continue to include in rate base the remaining book value, approximately $21 million at december 31, 2015, of the existing electric meters and also to depreciate those assets using current depreciation rates. entergy new orleans proposed a 15-year depreciable life for the new advanced meters, the three-year deployment of which is expected to begin in 2019.
deployment of the information technology infrastructure began in 2017 and deployment of the communications network is expected to begin in 2018. entergy new orleans proposed to recover the cost of ami through the implementation of a customer charge, net of certain benefits, phased in over the period 2019 through 2022. the city council's advisors filed testimony in may 2017 recommending the adoption of ami subject to certain modifications, including the denial of entergy new orleans's proposed customer charge as a cost recovery mechanism. in january 2018 a settlement was reached between

385
table of contents entergy new orleans, llc and subsidiaries management's financial discussion and analysis from a base rate case that must be filed for its electric and gas operations in 2018. this provision eliminated the formula rate plan applicable to algiers operations. the limited exceptions included continued implementation of the then-remaining two years of the four-year phased-in rate increase for the algiers area and certain exceptional cost increases or decreases in the base revenue requirement. an additional provision of the settlement agreement allowed for continued recovery of the revenue requirement associated with the capacity and energy from ninemile 6 received by entergy new orleans under a power purchase agreement with entergy louisiana (algiers ppa). the settlement authorized entergy new orleans to recover the remaining revenue requirement related to the algiers ppa through base rates charged to algiers customers. the settlement also provided for continued implementation of the algiers miso recovery rider.
in addition to the algiers ppa, entergy new orleans has a separate power purchase agreement with entergy louisiana for 20% of the capacity and energy from ninemile 6 (ninemile ppa), which commenced operation in december 2014.
initially, recovery of the non-fuel costs associated with the ninemile ppa was authorized through a special ninemile 6 rider billed only to entergy new orleans customers outside of algiers.
in august 2015, entergy new orleans filed an application with the city council seeking authorization to proceed with the purchase of union power block 1, with an expected base purchase price of approximately $237 million , subject to adjustments, and seeking approval of the recovery of the associated costs. in november 2015 the city council issued written resolutions and an order approving an agreement in principle between entergy new orleans and city council advisors providing that the purchase of union power block 1 and related assets by entergy new orleans is prudent and in the public interest. the city council authorized expansion of the terms of the purchased power and capacity acquisition cost recovery rider to recover the non-fuel purchased power expense from ninemile 6, the revenue requirement associated with the purchase of power block 1 of the union power station, and a credit to customers of $400 thousand monthly beginning june 2016 in recognition of the decrease in other operation and maintenance expenses that would result with the deactivation of michoud units 2 and 3. in march 2016, entergy new orleans purchased power block 1 of the union power station for approximately $237 million and initiated recovery of these costs with march 2016 bills. in july 2016, entergy new orleans and the city council utility committee agreed to a temporary increase in the michoud credit to customers to a total of $1.4 million monthly for august 2016
through december 2016.
a 2008 rate case settlement included $3.1 million per year in electric rates to fund the energy smart energy efficiency programs. the rate settlement provided an incentive for entergy new orleans to meet or exceed energy savings targets set by the city council and provided a mechanism for entergy new orleans to recover lost contribution to fixed costs associated with the energy savings generated from the energy efficiency programs. in january 2015 the city council approved funding for the energy smart program from april 2015 through march 2017
using the remainder of the approximately $12.8 million of 2014 rough production cost equalization funds, with any remaining costs being recovered through the fuel adjustment clause. this funding methodology was modified in november 2015 when the city council directed entergy new orleans to use a combination of guaranteed customer savings related to a prior agreement with the city council and rough production cost equalization funds to cover program costs prior to recovering any costs through the fuel adjustment clause. in april 2017 the city council approved an implementation plan for the energy smart program from april 2017 through december 2019. the city council directed that the $11.8 million balance reported for energy smart funds be used to continue funding the program for entergy new orleans's legacy customers and that the energy smart algiers program continue to be funded through the algiers fuel adjustment clause, until additional customer funding is required for the legacy customers.
in september 2017, entergy new orleans filed a supplemental plan and proposed several options for an interim cost recovery mechanism necessary to recover program costs during the period between when existing funds directed to energy smart programs are depleted (estimated to be june 2018) and when new rates from the anticipated 2018
combined rate case, which will include a cost recovery mechanism for energy smart funding, take effect (estimated to be august 2019). entergy new orleans requested that the city council approve a cost recovery mechanism prior to june 2018. in december 2017 the city council approved an energy efficiency cost recovery rider as an interim funding mechanism for energy smart, subject to verification that no additional funding sources exist.

due to higher fuel costs associated in part with the extended grand gulf outage and the partially simultaneous union power block 1 planned outage, for the december 2016, january 2017, and february 2017 billing months, the city council authorized entergy new orleans to cap the fuel adjustment charge billed to customers at $0.035 per kwh and to defer billing of all fuel costs in excess of the capped amount by including such costs in the over- or under-
recovery account.
due to higher fuel costs for the operating month of january 2018 resulting in part from recent cold weather, higher henry hub prices, and an increase in total fuel and purchased power costs associated in part with certain plant outages, entergy new orleans has proposed to cap the fuel adjustment charge to be billed in march 2018 to non-
transmission entergy new orleans legacy customers and entergy new orleans algiers customers at $0.035323 per kwh and $0.025446 per kwh, respectively. entergy new orleans has also proposed to cap the fuel adjustment charge to be billed in march 2018 for entergy new orleans legacy transmission customers at $0.034609 per kwh and to defer billing of all fuel costs in excess of the capped amount by including such costs in the over- or under-recovery account.
algiers asset transfer in october 2014, entergy louisiana and entergy new orleans filed an application with the city council seeking authorization to undertake a transaction that would result in the transfer from entergy louisiana to entergy new orleans of certain assets that supported the provision of service to entergy louisiana's customers in algiers. in april 2015 the ferc issued an order approving the algiers assets transfer. in may 2015 the parties filed a settlement agreement authorizing the algiers assets transfer and the settlement agreement was approved by a city council resolution in may 2015. on september 1, 2015, entergy louisiana transferred its algiers assets to entergy new orleans for a purchase price of approximately $85 million . entergy new orleans paid entergy louisiana $59.6
million , including final true-ups, from available cash and issued a note payable to entergy louisiana in the amount of $25.5 million .
show cause order in july 2016 the city council approved the issuance of a show cause order, which directed entergy new orleans to make a filing on or before september 29, 2016 to demonstrate the reasonableness of its actions or positions with regard to certain issues in four existing dockets that relate to entergy new orleans's: (i) storm hardening proposal; (ii) 2015 integrated resource plan; (iii) gas infrastructure rebuild proposal; and (iv) proposed sizing of the new orleans power station and its community outreach prior to the filing. in september 2016, entergy new orleans filed its response to the city council's show cause order. the city council has not established any further procedural schedule with regard to this proceeding.

table of contents entergy texas, inc. and subsidiaries management's financial discussion and analysis results of operations net income
2017 compared to 2016
net income decreased $31.4 million primarily due to lower net revenue, higher depreciation and amortization expenses, higher other operation and maintenance expenses, and higher taxes other than income taxes.
2016 compared to 2015
net income increased $37.9 million primarily due to lower other operation and maintenance expenses, the asset write-off of its receivable associated with the spindletop gas storage facility in 2015, and higher net revenue.
net revenue
2017 compared to 2016
net revenue consists of operating revenues net of: 1) fuel, fuel-related expenses, and gas purchased for resale, 2)
purchased power expenses, and 3) other regulatory charges. following is an analysis of the change in net revenue comparing 2017 to 2016.

2016 net revenue                  $644.2
net wholesale revenue              (35.1  )

2017 net revenue                  $626.8
the net wholesale revenue variance is primarily due to lower net capacity revenues resulting from the termination of the purchased power agreements between entergy louisiana and entergy texas in august 2016.
the purchased power capacity variance is primarily due to increased expenses due to capacity cost changes for ongoing purchased power capacity contracts.
the transmission revenue variance is primarily due to a decrease in the amount of transmission revenues allocated by miso.
the reserve equalization variance is due to the absence of reserve equalization expenses in 2017 as a result of entergy texas's exit from the system agreement in august 2016. see note 2 to the financial statements for a discussion of the system agreement.

2016 net revenue                  $644.2
the reserve equalization variance is primarily due to a reduction in reserve equalization expense primarily due to changes in the entergy system generation mix compared to the same period in 2015 as a result of the execution of a new purchased power agreement and entergy mississippi's exit from the system agreement, each in november 2015, and entergy texas's exit from the system agreement in august 2016. see note 2 to the financial statements for a discussion of the system agreement.
the purchased power capacity variance is primarily due to decreased expenses due to the termination of the purchased power agreements between entergy louisiana and entergy texas in august 2016, as well as capacity cost changes for ongoing purchased power capacity contracts.
the transmission revenue variance is primarily due to an increase in attachment o rates charged by miso to transmission customers and a settlement of attachment o rates previously billed to transmission customers by miso.
the retail electric price variance is primarily due to the implementation of the transmission cost recovery factor rider, as approved by the puct and implemented in september 2016, and the increase in the distribution cost recovery rider, as approved by the puct and implemented in january 2016. this increase was partially offset by a decrease in energy efficiency revenues. see note 2 to the financial statements for further discussion of the transmission cost recovery factor rider and distribution cost recovery factor rider filings.

table of contents entergy texas, inc. and subsidiaries management's financial discussion and analysis other income statement variances
2017 compared to 2016
other operation and maintenance expenses increased primarily due to:
•  an increase of $5.1 million in transmission and distribution expenses primarily due to higher vegetation maintenance costs;
•  an increase of $4.3 million in fossil-fueled generation expenses primarily due to a higher scope of work performed during plant outages in 2017 as compared to 2016; and
•  an increase of $2.8 million in compensation and benefits costs primarily due to higher incentive-based compensation accruals in 2017 as compared to 2016.
the increase was partially offset by a decrease of $4.5 million due to the absence of transmission equalization expenses, as allocated under the system agreement, as a result of entergy texas's exit from the system agreement in august 2016.
taxes other than income taxes increased primarily due to an increase in ad valorem taxes resulting from higher assessments and a true-up to the sales and use tax accruals recorded in 2016 resulting from an audit settlement.
depreciation and amortization expenses increased primarily due to additions to plant in service.
2016 compared to 2015
other operation and maintenance expenses decreased primarily due to:
•  a decrease of $11.2 million in fossil-fueled generation expenses primarily due to an overall lower scope of work performed in 2016 as compared to 2015;
a decrease of $7 million in transmission expenses primarily due to lower transmission equalization expenses,
•  as allocated under the system agreement, as compared to the same period in 2015 as a result of entergy mississippi's exit from the system agreement in november 2015 and entergy texas's exit from the system agreement in august 2016;
a decrease of $5.7 million in compensation and benefits costs primarily due to a decrease in net periodic pension and other postretirement benefits costs as a result of an increase in the discount rate used to
•  value the benefit liabilities and a refinement in the approach used to estimate the service cost and interest cost components of pension and other postretirement costs. see "critical accounting estimates-
qualified pension and other postretirement benefits" below and note 11 to the financial statements for further discussion of pension and other postretirement benefit costs;
the write-off in the third quarter 2015 of $4.3 million of rate case expenses and acquisition costs related
•  to the proposed union power station acquisition upon entergy texas's withdrawal of its 2015 rate case and dismissal of its certificate of convenience and necessity filing; and
•  a decrease of $4.2 million in energy efficiency costs.
the asset write-off variance is due to the $23.5 million ($15.3 million net-of-tax) write-off recorded in 2015 of the receivable associated with the spindletop gas storage facility. see note 2 to the financial statements for discussion of the write-off.
income taxes the effective income tax rates for 2017, 2016, and 2015 were 38.9%, 37.0%, and 34.9%, respectively. see note 3 to the financial statements for a reconciliation of the federal statutory rate of 35% to the effective income tax rates.

period operating activities net cash flow provided by operating activities decreased $5.2 million in 2017 primarily due to lower net income, the timing of recovery of fuel and purchased power costs, and an increase of $13.7 million in storm spending primarily as a result of hurricane harvey. the decrease was partially offset by income tax refunds of $21.1 million in 2017 compared to income tax payments of $28.5 million in 2016. entergy texas had income tax refunds in 2017 and income tax payments in 2016 in accordance with an intercompany income tax allocation agreement. the income tax refunds in 2017 primarily resulted from deductible temporary differences. the income tax payments in 2016 resulted primarily from adjustments associated with the settlement of the 2010-2011 irs audit. see note 3 to the financial statements for a discussion of the income tax audit.
net cash flow provided by operating activities increased $22.3 million in 2016 primarily due to increased net income and a decrease of $31.8 million in income tax payments in 2016. entergy texas had income tax payments in
2016 and 2015 in accordance with an intercompany income tax allocation agreement. the income tax payments in 2016
resulted primarily from adjustments associated with the settlement of the 2010-2011 irs audit. the income tax payments in 2015 resulted primarily from the results of operations and the reversal of taxable temporary differences. see note 3 to the financial statements for a discussion of the income tax audit. the increase was partially offset by an increase of $5.2 million in interest paid in 2016 due to the issuance of $125 million of
2.55% series first mortgage bonds in march 2016 and the timing of collections from customers.

income taxes the effective income tax rates for 2017, 2016, and 2015 were 47.1%, 42.3%, and 32.3%, respectively. the difference in the effective income tax rate of 47.1% for 2017 versus the statutory rate of 35% for 2017 was primarily due to certain book and tax differences related to utility plant items and state income taxes. see note 3 to the financial statements for a reconciliation of the federal statutory rate of 35% to the effective income tax rates.

management's financial discussion and analysis investing activities net cash flow used in investing activities decreased $58.4 million in 2017 primarily due to a decrease of $159.4
million as a result of fluctuations in nuclear fuel activity because of variations from year to year in the timing and pricing of fuel reload requirements in the utility business, material and services deliveries, and the timing of cash payments during the nuclear fuel cycle. the decrease was partially offset by money pool activity and proceeds of $15.8 million received in august 2016 from the doe resulting from litigation regarding spent nuclear fuel storage costs that were previously capitalized. see note 8 to the financial statements for discussion of the spent nuclear fuel litigation.
increases in system energy's receivable from the money pool are a use of cash flow and system energy's receivable from the money pool increased by $77.9 million in 2017 compared to decreasing by $6.1 million in 2016. the money pool is an inter-company borrowing arrangement designed to reduce the utility subsidiaries' need for external short-term borrowings.
net cash flow used in investing activities increased $95 million in 2016 primarily due to:
fluctuations in nuclear fuel activity because of variations from year to year in the timing and pricing of
•  fuel reload requirements in the utility business, material and services deliveries, and the timing of cash payments during the nuclear fuel cycle; and an increase in nuclear construction expenditures primarily as a result of a higher scope of work performed
•  in 2016 on grand gulf outage projects, partially offset by decreased spending in 2016 on compliance with nrc post-fukushima requirements.
the increase was partially offset by money pool activity and proceeds of $15.8 million received in august 2016 from the doe resulting from litigation regarding spent nuclear fuel storage costs that were previously capitalized. see note 8 to the financial statements for discussion of the spent nuclear fuel litigation.

financing activities net cash flow used in financing activities increased $61.6 million in 2017 primarily due to:
net repayments of short-term borrowings of $49.1 million on the nuclear fuel company variable interest
•  entity's credit facility in 2017 as compared to net short-term borrowings of $66.9 million on the nuclear fuel variable interest entity's credit facility in 2016; and

see note 5 to the financial statements for details of long-term debt.
capital structure system energy's capitalization is balanced between equity and debt, as shown in the following table. the decrease in the debt to capital ratio for system energy is primarily due to the payment in february 2017, at maturity, of
$50 million of the system energy nuclear fuel company variable interest entity's 4.02% series h notes.

net debt to net capital      28.5  %                    33.5  %
net debt consists of debt less cash and cash equivalents. debt consists of short-term borrowings and long-term debt, including the currently maturing portion. capital consists of debt and common equity. net capital consists of capital less cash and cash equivalents. system energy uses the debt to capital ratio in analyzing its financial condition and believes it provides useful information to its investors and creditors in evaluating system energy's financial condition. system energy uses the net debt to net capital ratio in analyzing its financial condition and believes it provides useful information to its investors and creditors in evaluating system energy's financial condition because net debt indicates system energy's outstanding debt position that could not be readily satisfied by cash and cash equivalents on hand.
system energy seeks to optimize its capital structure in accordance with its regulatory requirements and to control its cost of capital while also maintaining equity capitalization at a level consistent with investment-grade debt ratings. to the extent that operating cash flows are in excess of planned investments, cash may be used to reduce outstanding debt or may be paid as a dividend, or both, in appropriate amounts to maintain the targeted capital structure. to the extent that operating cash flows are insufficient to support planned investments, system energy may issue incremental debt or reduce dividends, or both, to maintain its targeted capital structure.
uses of capital system energy requires capital resources for:
•  construction and other capital investments;
•  debt maturities or retirements;

also in addition to the contractual obligations, system energy has $433 million of unrecognized tax benefits and interest net of unused tax attributes and payments for which the timing of payments beyond 12 months cannot be reasonably estimated due to uncertainties in the timing of effective settlement of tax positions. see note 3 to the financial statements for additional information regarding unrecognized tax benefits.
in addition to routine spending to maintain operations, the planned capital investment estimate includes specific grand gulf investments and initiatives.
as a wholly-owned subsidiary, system energy dividends its earnings to entergy corporation at a percentage determined monthly.
sources of capital system energy's sources to meet its capital requirements include:
•  internally generated funds;
•  cash on hand;
•  debt issuances; and
•  bank financing under new or existing facilities.

complaint against system energy in january 2017 the apsc and mpsc filed a complaint with the ferc against system energy. the complaint seeks a reduction in the return on equity component of the unit power sales agreement pursuant to which system energy sells its grand gulf capacity and energy to entergy arkansas, entergy louisiana, entergy mississippi, and entergy new orleans. entergy arkansas also sells some of its grand gulf capacity and energy to entergy louisiana, entergy mississippi, and entergy new orleans under separate agreements. the current return on equity under the unit power sales agreement is 10.94% . the complaint alleges that the return on equity is unjust and unreasonable because current capital market and other considerations indicate that it is excessive. the complaint requests the ferc to institute proceedings to investigate the return on equity and establish a lower return on equity, and also requests that the ferc establish january 23, 2017 as a refund effective date. the complaint includes return on equity analysis that purports to establish that the range of reasonable return on equity for system energy is between
8.37% and 8.67% . system energy answered the complaint in february 2017 and disputes that a return on equity of
8.37% to 8.67% is just and reasonable. the lpsc and the city council intervened in the proceeding expressing support for the complaint. system energy is recording a provision against revenue for the potential outcome of this proceeding. in september 2017 the ferc established a refund effective date of january 23, 2017, consolidated the return on equity complaint with the proceeding described in unit power sales agreement below, and directed the parties to engage in settlement

unit power sales agreement in august 2017, system energy submitted to the ferc proposed amendments to the unit power sales agreement pursuant to which system energy sells its grand gulf capacity and energy to entergy arkansas, entergy louisiana, entergy mississippi, and entergy new orleans. the filing proposes limited amendments to the unit power sales agreement to adopt (1) updated rates for use in calculating grand gulf plant depreciation and amortization expenses and (2)
updated nuclear decommissioning cost annual revenue requirements, both of which are recovered through the unit power sales agreement rate formula. the proposed amendments would result in lower charges to the utility operating companies that buy capacity and energy from system energy under the unit power sales agreement. the proposed changes are based on updated depreciation and nuclear decommissioning studies that take into account the renewal of grand gulf's operating license for a term through november 1, 2044. system energy requested that the ferc accept the amendments effective october 1, 2017.
in september 2017 the ferc accepted system energy's proposed unit power sales agreement amendments, subject to further proceedings to consider the justness and reasonableness of the amendments. because the amendments propose a rate decrease, the ferc also initiated an investigation under section 206 of the federal power act to determine if the rate decrease should be lower than proposed. the ferc accepted the proposed amendments effective october 1,
2017, subject to refund pending the outcome of the further settlement and/or hearing proceedings, and established a refund effective date of october 11, 2017 with respect to the rate decrease. the ferc also consolidated the unit power sales agreement amendment proceeding with the proceeding described in complaint against system energy above, and directed the parties to engage in settlement proceedings before an alj. if the parties fail to come to an agreement during settlement proceedings, a prehearing conference will be held to establish a procedural schedule for hearing proceedings.
nuclear matters system energy owns and, through an affiliate, operates grand gulf. system energy is, therefore, subject to the risks related to owning and operating a nuclear plant. these include risks related to: the use, storage, and handling and disposal of high-level and low-level radioactive materials; the substantial financial requirements, both for capital investments and operational needs, to position entergy's nuclear fleet to meet its operational goals, including the financial requirements to address emerging issues like stress corrosion cracking of certain materials within the plant systems and the fukushima event; regulatory requirements and potential future regulatory changes, including changes affecting the regulations governing nuclear plant ownership, operations, license renewal and amendments, and decommissioning; the performance and capacity factors of these nuclear plants; the availability of interim or permanent sites for the disposal of spent nuclear fuel and nuclear waste, including the fees charged for such disposal; the sufficiency of nuclear decommissioning trust fund assets and earnings to complete decommissioning of each site when required; and limitations on the amounts and types of insurance commercially available for losses in connection with nuclear plant operations and catastrophic events such as a nuclear accident. in the event of an unanticipated early shutdown of grand gulf, system energy may be required to provide additional funds or credit support to satisfy regulatory requirements for decommissioning. in december 2016, the nrc granted the extension of grand gulf's operating license to 2044.
grand gulf outage and nrc review grand gulf began a maintenance outage on september 8, 2016 to replace a residual heat removal pump. although the pump had been replaced, on september 27, 2016 management decided to keep the plant in an outage for additional training and other steps to support management's operational goals. grand gulf returned to service on january 31,
2017.
426
table of contents system energy resources, inc.
management's financial discussion and analysis based on the plant's performance indicators, in november 2016 the nrc placed grand gulf in the "regulatory response column," or column 2, of its reactor oversight process action matrix. entergy is implementing a plan to restore grand gulf to column 1, including addressing the issues related to the three very low safety significance non-cited violations identified in the nrc's report on the results of its october 2016 special inspection. depending on the success of implementing that plan and the plant's performance indicators, there is risk that the nrc could move grand gulf into the "degraded cornerstone column," or column 3, of the nrc's reactor oversight process action matrix.
environmental risks system energy's facilities and operations are subject to regulation by various governmental authorities having jurisdiction over air quality, water quality, control of toxic substances and hazardous and solid wastes, and other environmental matters. management believes that system energy is in substantial compliance with environmental regulations currently applicable to its facilities and operations, with reference to possible exceptions noted in "
regulation of entergy's business

environmental regulation
" in part i, item 1. because environmental regulations are subject to change, future compliance costs cannot be precisely estimated.
critical accounting estimates the preparation of system energy's financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to apply appropriate accounting policies and to make estimates and judgments that can have a significant effect on reported financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. management has identified the following accounting policies and estimates as critical because they are based on assumptions and measurements that involve a high degree of uncertainty, and there is the potential for future changes in the assumptions and measurements that could produce estimates that would have a material impact on the presentation of system energy's financial position or results of operations.

in accordance with entergy's stock-based compensation plans, entergy periodically grants stock options to key employees, which may be exercised to obtain shares of entergy's common stock. according to the plans, these shares can be newly issued shares, treasury stock, or shares purchased on the open market. entergy's management has been authorized by the board to repurchase on the open market shares up to an amount sufficient to fund the exercise of grants under the plans. in addition to this authority, the board has authorized share repurchase programs to enable opportunistic purchases in response to market conditions. in october 2010 the board granted authority for a $500
million share repurchase program. the amount of share repurchases under these programs may vary as a result of material changes in business results or capital spending or new investment opportunities. in addition, in the first quarter 2017, entergy withheld 1,054 shares of its common stock at $70.58 per share, 122,148 shares of its common stock at $70.61 per share, and 31,243 shares of its common stock at $71.89 per share to pay income taxes due upon vesting of restricted stock granted and payout of performance units as part of its long-term incentive program.

definition and limitations of internal control over financial reporting a company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. a company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

table of contents entergy corporation's pay for performance philosophy entergy corporation's executive compensation programs are based on a philosophy of pay for performance that is embodied in the design of its annual and long-term incentive plans. it believes the executive pay programs described in this section and in the accompanying tables have played a significant role in its ability to drive strong financial and operational results and to attract and retain a highly experienced and successful management team. the annual incentive plan incentivizes and rewards the achievement of financial metrics that are deemed by the personnel committee to be consistent with the overall goals and strategic direction that the entergy corporation board has approved for entergy corporation. the long-term incentive programs further align the interests of entergy corporation's executives and its shareholders by directly tying the value of the equity awards granted to executives under these programs to entergy corporation's stock price performance and total shareholder return. by incentivizing officers to achieve important financial and operational objectives and create long-term shareholder value, these programs play a key role in creating sustainable value for the benefit of all of entergy corporation's stakeholders, including owners, customers, employees, and communities.
incentive programs and 2017 incentive pay outcomes entergy corporation believes that the 2017 incentive pay outcomes for the named executive officers demonstrated the application of its pay for performance philosophy.
annual incentive plan awards under the executive annual incentive plan, or annual incentive plan, are tied to entergy corporation's financial and operational performance through the entergy achievement multiplier (eam), which is the performance metric used to determine the maximum funding available for awards under the plan. the 2017 eam was determined based in equal part on entergy corporation's success in achieving its consolidated operational earnings per share and consolidated operational operating cash flow goals set at the beginning of the year. these goals were approved by the personnel committee based on entergy corporation's financial plan and the board's overall goals for entergy corporation and were consistent with its published earnings guidance.
2017 annual incentive plan payout.for 2017, the personnel committee, based on a recommendation of the finance committee, determined that management exceeded its consolidated operational earnings per share goal of $5.05 per share by $2.17, but fell short of its consolidated operational operating cash flow goal of
$3.000 billion by approximately $227 million. based on the targets and ranges previously established by the committee, these results resulted in a calculated eam of 129%.  this determined the maximum funding level
•  for the plan and the maximum award, as a percentage of target, that could be received by any of the executive officers, subject to downward adjustment based on individual performance.  after considering individual performance, including the role played by each of the named executive officers, who are members of the office of the chief executive, in advancing entergy corporation's strategies and delivering the strong financial results in 2017, the personnel committee approved payouts of 129% of target for each of the named executive officers, who are members of the office of the chief executive.
after the eam was established to determine overall funding for the annual incentive plan, entergy corporation's chief executive officer allocated incentive award funding to individual business units based on business unit results. individual awards were determined for the named executive officers who are not members of the office of the chief executive by their immediate supervisor based on the individual officer's key accountabilities, accomplishments, and performance. this resulted in payouts that ranged from 79% of target to 204% of target for the named executive officers who are not members of entergy corporation's office of the chief executive.
long-term incentives long term incentives consist of three components to incentivize long-term value creation - performance units, stock options, and restricted stock. performance under the long-term performance unit program is measured over
453
table of contents a three-year period by assessing entergy corporation's total shareholder return in relation to the total shareholder return of the companies included in the philadelphia utility index. payouts, if any, are based on entergy corporation's total shareholder return performance in relation to its peers and are not subject to adjustment by the personnel committee. beginning with the 2018-2020 performance period, entergy corporation will be using a cumulative utility earnings measure, as well as relative total shareholder return to assess performance under the long-term performance unit program. entergy corporation also uses stock options, which reward increases in the market value of its common stock, and restricted stock, which is an effective retention mechanism.
long-term performance unit program payout.for the three-year performance period ending in 2017, entergy
•  corporation's total shareholder return was in the third quartile, resulting in a payout of 31% of target for its executive officers.  payouts were made in shares of entergy corporation common stock which are required to be held by executive officers until they satisfy the executive stock ownership guidelines.
what entergy corporation pays and why how entergy corporation sets target pay to develop a competitive compensation program, the personnel committee annually reviews compensation data from two sources:
use of competitive data the personnel committee uses published and private compensation survey data to develop marketplace compensation levels for entergy corporation's executive officers. the data compiled by the committee's independent compensation consultant, pay governance llc, compare the current compensation opportunities provided to each of the executive officers against the compensation opportunities provided to executives holding similar positions at companies with corporate revenues similar to entergy corporation's. the committee reviews:
•  for non-industry specific positions, general industry data for total cash compensation (base salary and annual incentive) since the market for talent is broader than the utility sector.
•  for management positions that are industry-specific, such as group president, utility operations, data from utility companies for total cash compensation.
•  for all positions, utility market data for long-term incentives.
the survey data reviewed by the committee cover hundreds of companies across a broad range of industries and approximately 60 investor-owned utility companies. in evaluating compensation levels against the survey data, the committee considers only the aggregated survey data. the identities of the companies participating in the compensation survey data are not disclosed to, or considered by, the committee in its decision-making process and, thus, are not considered material by the committee.
the committee uses this survey data to develop compensation opportunities that are designed to deliver total target compensation at approximately the 50th percentile of the surveyed companies in the aggregate. the survey data are the primary data used for purposes of assessing target compensation. as a result, mr. denault, entergy corporation's chief executive officer, is compensated at a higher level than the other named executive officers, reflecting market practices that compensate chief executive officers at greater potential compensation levels with more pay "at risk" than other named executive officers, due to the greater responsibilities and accountability required of a chief executive officer. in most cases, the committee considers its objectives to have been met if entergy corporation's chief executive officer and the 7 other executive officers who constitute what is referred to as the office of the chief executive each has a target compensation opportunity that falls within the range of 85%
- 115% of the 50th percentile of the survey data. promoted officers or officers who are new to their roles may be transitioned into the targeted market range over time. actual compensation received by an individual officer may be above or below the targeted range based on an individual officer's skills, performance, experience, and responsibilities, entergy corporation performance, and internal pay equity.
454
table of contents proxy analysis although the survey data described above are the primary data used in benchmarking compensation, the committee reviews data derived from the proxy statements of companies included in the philadelphia utility index as an additional point of comparison. the personnel committee identified the philadelphia utility index as the appropriate industry peer group because the companies included in this index, in the aggregate, are comparable to entergy corporation in terms of business and scale. the proxy data are used to compare the compensation levels of the named executive officers with the compensation levels of the corresponding top five highest paid executive officers of the companies included in the philadelphia utility index, as reported in their proxy statements. the personnel committee uses this analysis to evaluate the overall reasonableness of entergy corporation's compensation programs. the following companies were included in the philadelphia utility index at the time the proxy data from the 2016 filings were compiled:

based compensation levels, and individual performance.

fixed compensation base salary the personnel committee determines the base salaries for all of the named executive officers who are members of the office of the chief executive based on competitive compensation data, performance considerations, and advice provided by the committee's independent compensation consultant. for the other named executive officers, their salaries are established by their immediate supervisors using the same criteria. the committee also considers internal pay equity; however, the committee has not established any predetermined formula against which the base salary of one named executive officer is measured against another officer or employee.
in 2017, all of the named executive officers received merit increases in their base salaries ranging from approximately 1.5% to 7.3%. the increases in base salary were based on the market data previously discussed in this cd&a under "what entergy corporation pays and why - how entergy corporation sets target pay," as well as an internal pay equity comparison.
the following table sets forth the 2016 and 2017 base salaries for the named executive officers. changes in base salaries for 2017 were effective in april 2017.

variable compensation short-term incentive compensation annual incentive plan entergy corporation includes performance-based incentives in the named executive officers' compensation packages because it believes performance-based incentives encourage the named executive officers to pursue objectives consistent with the overall goals and strategic direction that the board has approved for entergy corporation. the eam is the performance metric used to determine the maximum percentage of target annual plan opportunities that will be paid each year to each named executive officer who are members of the office of the chief executive under the annual incentive plan. once the eam has been determined, individual awards for the office of the chief
457
table of contents executive members may be adjusted downward, but not upward, from the eam at the personnel committee's discretion, based on individual performance and other factors deemed relevant by the personnel committee. for 2017, the target annual incentive plan opportunities for each of the named executive officers, expressed as a percentage of the officer's base salary, were:
•  135% for mr. denault;
•  70% for mr. bakken, mr. brown, mr. marsh, and mr. west;
•  60% for mr. may; and
•  40% for mr. fisackerly, ms. rainer, mr. rice, and mr. riley.
the target opportunities established for these officers were comparable to the target opportunities historically set for these positions and levels of responsibility. target opportunities for the named executive officers who are members of the office of the chief executive are established by the personnel committee, and these named executive officers may earn a maximum payout ranging from 0% to 200% of their target opportunity, calculated as described in the table below.
target award opportunities are set based on an executive officer's position and executive management level within the entergy organization. executive management levels at entergy corporation range from level 1 through level 4. at december 31, 2017, mr. denault held a level 1 position, messrs. bakken, brown, marsh, and west held positions in level 2, mr. may held a level 3 position, and the remaining named executive officers held positions in level 4.
accordingly, their respective incentive award opportunities differ from one another based on their management level and the external market data developed by the committee's independent compensation consultant.
each year the personnel committee reviews the performance measures used to determine the eam pool. in december
2016, the personnel committee decided to retain consolidated operational earnings per share and consolidated operational operating cash flow, each measure weighted equally, as the performance measures for determining the eam pool. the committee considered a variety of other potential measures, but determined that consolidated operational earnings per share and consolidated operational operating cash flow continued to be the best metrics to use because, among other things, they are objective measures that entergy corporation's investors consider to be important in evaluating its financial performance and because entergy corporation's goals in that regard are broadly communicated both internally and externally. this provides both discipline and transparency that the committee believes are important objectives of any well designed incentive compensation plan.
the personnel committee also engages in a rigorous process each year to establish the target achievement levels for each of the eam performance measures with a goal of establishing target achievement levels that are consistent with entergy corporation's strategy and business objectives for the upcoming year, as reflected in its financial plan, and sufficient to drive results that represent a high level of achievement, taking into consideration the applicable business environment and specific challenges facing it. these targets are approved based on a comprehensive review by the full board of entergy corporation's financial plan, conducted in december of the preceding year and updated in january to reflect the most current information concerning changes in commodity market conditions and other key drivers of anticipated changes in performance from the preceding year. the committee also reviews the effects on plan results of various risks and opportunities that are recognized at the time the plan is set, to assure that targets that are determined based on the plan reflect an appropriate balance of risks and opportunities. the committee further confirms that the earnings target it approves is aligned with the earnings guidance that will be communicated to the financial markets, thus ensuring that the internal earnings target set for purposes of entergy corporation's incentive compensation plans is aligned with the external expectations set and communicated to entergy corporation's shareholders.
in january 2017, after full board review of management's 2017 financial plan for entergy corporation and engaging in the process discussed above, the committee determined the annual incentive plan targets to be used for purposes of determining annual incentive plan awards for 2017. in keeping with its past practice, the committee also determined that for purposes of measuring performance against such targets, the committee would exclude the effect on reported results of any major storms that may occur during the year. this exclusion was viewed by the committee
458
table of contents as appropriate because although entergy corporation includes estimates for storm costs in its financial plan, it does not include estimates for a major storm event, such as a hurricane. the committee also approved exclusions from reported results, for purposes of calculating achievement levels, for the impact of certain longstanding unresolved litigation relating to the system agreement among the utility operating companies, and for the potential effects of changes in tax laws, given the possibility that significant unanticipated changes in tax laws might be enacted during the year that could impact reported results. the committee believed that each of these adjustments was appropriate because of the significant uncertainty around each such item and management's inability to influence any of the related outcomes.
in determining the targets to set for 2017, the committee reviewed anticipated drivers for consolidated operational earnings per share and consolidated operational operating cash flow for 2017 as set forth in entergy corporation's financial plan and as reflected in its published earnings guidance. under the plan, consolidated operational earnings per share were expected to decline from 2016 results due primarily to the significant impact on 2016
operational results of certain tax benefits and, to a lesser extent, favorable weather, which were not anticipated to recur in 2017. together, these factors accounted for $2.06 of consolidated operational earnings per share for
2016. under the plan, consolidated operational operating cash flow was expected to increase slightly in 2017 from
2016 results.
in evaluating the proposed targets, the committee considered the potential impact on consolidated operational earnings per share and consolidated operational operating cash flow of certain risks and opportunities, including differences in wholesale energy prices and capacity factors at entergy wholesale commodities, utility sales, operations and maintenance costs, interest expense, and certain tax and regulatory risks. this evaluation indicated that there was significantly more downside risk than upside opportunity in the targets and, as a result, that there was a reasonable degree of challenge embedded in the targets.
after adjusting to eliminate the impact of weather and tax benefits, the 2017 plan targets required management to achieve (i) slight growth in utility operational earnings despite higher nuclear and pension costs and the absence of certain favorable items from 2016 and (ii) modest growth in entergy wholesale commodities operational earnings, despite an expectation for further declines in wholesale energy and capacity revenues due in part to the sale of fitzpatrick in the first quarter of 2017. while the resulting earnings target represented a decline from 2016
operational results, the committee recognized that in addition to the favorable weather and tax items that were not expected to recur in 2017, management would be challenged in 2017 by significantly higher nuclear costs as they executed on its nuclear strategic plan. thus, the committee concluded, based on a careful review of the overall plan, that the targets derived from the plan challenged management appropriately to deliver growth in entergy corporation's core business while continuing to manage the significant risks at entergy wholesale commodities and represented an appropriate balancing of entergy corporation's business risks and opportunities for 2017.
the following table shows the resulting annual incentive plan targets established by the personnel committee in january 2017, and 2017 results:

table of contents in january 2018, the finance and personnel committees jointly reviewed entergy corporation's financial results against the performance objectives reflected in the table above. management discussed with the committees the consolidated operational earnings per share and consolidated operational operating cash flow results for 2017, including primary factors explaining how those results compared to the 2017 business plan and annual incentive plan targets. consolidated operational earnings per share exceeded the operational earnings per share goal of $5.05 per share set at the beginning of the year by $2.17, due in large part to a non-cash restructuring tax benefit, but management fell short of achieving its consolidated operational operating cash flow goal of $3.000 billion by approximately $227 million, leading to a calculated eam of 129%. operational results excluded the impact of certain special items that were excluded from as-reported (gaap) earnings per share and operating cash flow to determine consolidated operational earnings per share and consolidated operational operating cash flow, including asset impairments and related write-offs at entergy wholesale commodities related to entergy corporation's 2016 decision to close two nuclear generating plants, and certain costs associated with nuclear plant closings, and charges recorded at the end of 2017 relating to the impact of recently enacted federal income tax law changes. consistent with determinations made by the personnel committee when the targets were set, adjustments were made to the reported results to exclude the impact of hurricane harvey and the resolution of certain longstanding system agreement litigation, but these adjustments had only a negligible impact on the calculated eam.
the committee reviewed certain sensitivities as part of its review of the calculation of the eam and noted that entergy corporation far exceeded its consolidated operational earnings per share goal in 2017, as noted, due in large part to a restructuring tax benefit, partially offset by unfavorable weather at the utility, and that unfavorable weather at the utility also accounted for approximately $128 million of the $227 million shortfall in consolidated operational operating cash flow. had the eam been calculated to exclude both the impact of the restructuring tax benefit and unfavorable weather, the calculated eam would have been 140%. this indicated that the underlying performance of the core business, without regard to the impact of tax items and weather, was significantly stronger than implied by the calculated eam. however, consistent with the plan design, the personnel committee did not make any adjustments for these factors to the consolidated operational earnings per share and consolidated operational operating cash flow results to determine the eam for 2017. the committee also noted that its utility, parent, and other adjusted earnings of $4.57 per share for 2017 were slightly above the high end of the guidance range entergy corporation had provided to investors at the beginning of the year for this extremely important measure of its core utility earnings.
in determining individual executive officer awards under the annual incentive plan, for entergy corporation's chief executive officers and the named executive officers, who are members of the office of the chief executive, the committee considered individual performance and, in particular, whether there were additional factors beyond those captured by the eam measures that should be taken into account in determining whether to exercise negative discretion to reduce awards below the levels determined by the eam. in determining the extent of negative discretion, if any, that it would exercise with respect to each executive officer, the committee considered the executive's key accountabilities and accomplishments, and individual performance executing on entergy corporation's strategies in 2017. based on these considerations, the committee decided to award a payout equal to the eam, or
129% of target, for entergy corporation's chief executive officer and the other named executive officers who are members of the office of the chief executive.
after the eam was established to determine overall funding for the annual incentive plan, entergy corporation's chief executive officer allocated incentive award funding to individual business units based on business unit results. individual awards were determined for the remaining named executive officers who are not members of the office of the chief executive by their immediate supervisor based on the individual officer's key accountabilities, accomplishments, and performance. this resulted in payouts that ranged from 79% of target to 204% of target for the named executive officers who are not members of the office of the chief executive.

nuclear retention plan mr. bakken participates in the nuclear retention plan, a retention plan for officers and other leaders with expertise in the nuclear industry. the personnel committee authorized this plan to attract and retain key management and employee talent in the nuclear power field, a field that requires unique technical and other expertise that is in great demand in the utility industry. the plan provides for bonuses to be paid annually over a three-year employment period with the bonus opportunity dependent on the participant's management level and continued employment. each annual payment is equal to an amount ranging from 15% to 30% of the employee's base salary as of their date of enrollment in the plan. mr. bakken's participation in the plan commenced in may 2016 and in accordance with the terms and conditions of the plan, in may 2017, 2018, and 2019, subject to his continued employment, mr. bakken will receive a cash bonus equal to 30% of his base salary as of may 1, 2016. this plan does not allow for accelerated or prorated payout upon termination of any kind. the three-year coverage period and percentage of base salary payable under the plan are consistent with the terms of participation of other senior nuclear officers who participate in this plan. in may 2017, mr. bakken received a cash bonus of $181,500 which equaled 30% of his may 1, 2016, base salary of $605,000.
long-term incentive compensation entergy corporation's goal for its long-term incentive compensation is to focus the executive officers on building shareholder value and to increase the executive officers' ownership of entergy corporation's common stock in order to more closely align their interest with those of entergy corporation's shareholders. in its long-term incentive compensation programs, entergy corporation uses a mix of performance units, restricted stock, and stock options.
performance units are used to deliver more than a majority of the total target long-term incentive awards. for periods through the end of 2017, performance units reward the named executive officers on the basis of total shareholder return, which is a measure of stock price appreciation and dividend payments, in relation to the companies in the philadelphia utility index. beginning with the 2018-2020 performance period, a cumulative utility earnings metric has been added to the long-term performance unit program to supplement the relative total shareholder return measure that historically has been used in this program with each measure equally weighted.
restricted stock ties the executive officers' long-term financial interest to the long-term financial interests of entergy corporation's shareholders. stock options provide a direct incentive to increase the value of entergy corporation's common stock. in general, entergy corporation seeks to allocate the total value of long-term incentive compensation 60% to performance units and 40% to a combination of stock options and restricted stock, equally divided in value, based on the value the compensation model seeks to deliver. awards for individual named executive officers may vary from this target as a result of individual performance, promotions, and internal pay equity.
the performance units for the 2015-2017 performance period were awarded under the 2011 equity ownership plan and long-term cash incentive plan (the "2011 equity ownership plan") and the performance units for the
461

2016-2018 and 2017-2019 performance periods and all of the shares of restricted stock and stock options granted to the named executive officers in 2017 were granted pursuant to the 2015 equity ownership plan (the "2015 equity ownership plan," and together with the 2011 equity ownership plan (the "equity ownership plans"). the equity ownership plans require both a change in control and an involuntary job loss or substantial diminution of duties (a
"double trigger") for the acceleration of these awards upon a change in control.
performance unit program entergy corporation issues performance unit awards to the named executive officers under its long-term performance unit program. each performance unit represents the value of one share of entergy corporation common stock at the end of the three-year performance period, plus dividends accrued during the performance period. the personnel committee sets payout opportunities for the program at the outset of each performance period, and the program is structured to reward named executive officers only if performance goals approved by the personnel committee are met. the personnel committee has no discretion to make awards if minimum performance goals are not achieved.
the performance units granted under the long-term performance unit program and accrued dividends on any shares earned during the performance period are settled in shares of entergy corporation common stock rather than cash. no shares are issued, including shares attributable to accrued dividends, unless performance goals are achieved. all shares paid out under the long-term performance unit program are required to be retained by the officers until applicable executive stock ownership requirements are met.
the long-term performance unit program specifies a minimum, target, and maximum achievement level, the achievement of which will determine the number of performance units that may be earned by each participant. entergy corporation measures performance by assessing entergy corporation's total shareholder return relative to the total shareholder return of the companies in the philadelphia utility index, which entergy corporation refers to as it peer companies. the personnel committee identified the philadelphia utility index as the appropriate industry peer group for this purpose because the companies included in this index, in the aggregate, are comparable to entergy corporation in terms of business and scale. the personnel committee chose relative total shareholder return as a measure of performance because it reflects entergy corporation's creation of shareholder value relative to other electric utilities over the performance period. it also takes into account dividends paid by the companies in this index and normalizes certain events that affect the industry as a whole. minimum, target, and maximum performance levels are determined by reference to the ranking of entergy corporation's total shareholder return against the total shareholder return of the companies in the philadelphia utility index.
performance unit program grants . at any given time, a participant in the long-term performance unit program may be participating in up to three performance periods. during 2017, eligible participants were participating in the

(1)  asa new hire in 2016, mr. bakken received pro-rated target award opportunities for the 2015-2017 and
2016-2018 performance periods.
the range of potential payouts for the 2015-2017, 2016-2018, and 2017-2019 performance periods under the program is shown below.
performance level         zero             minimum                          target             maximum total shareholder return  fourth quartile  bottom of third quartile         median percentile  top quartile payout                    no payout        minimum payout of 25% of target  100% of target     200% of target for all performance periods, there is no payout for performance that falls within the lowest quartile of performance of the peer companies, and for top quartile performance a maximum payout of 200% of target is earned.
payouts between minimum and target and between target and maximum are calculated by interpolating between the performance of the company at the top of the fourth quartile of performance of the peer companies and the median or between the median and the performance of the company at the bottom position of the top quartile of performance of the peer companies, respectively.
payout for the 2015-2017 performance period . in january 2018, the committee reviewed entergy corporation's total shareholder return for the 2015-2017 performance period in order to determine the payout to participants. the committee compared entergy corporation's total shareholder return against the total shareholder return of the companies that comprise the philadelphia utility index, with the performance measures and range of potential payouts for the 2015-2017 performance period similar to that discussed above. as recommended by the finance committee, the personnel committee concluded that entergy corporation's relative total shareholder return for the
2015-2017 performance period fell in the bottom of the third quartile, yielding a payout of 31% of target for the named executive officers.

stock options and restricted stock entergy corporation grants stock options and restricted stock as a long-term incentive to its executive officers.
as previously discussed, the personnel committee considers several factors in determining the number of stock options and shares of restricted stock it will grant to the named executive officers, including entergy corporation and individual performance, internal pay equity, prevailing market practice, targeted long-term value created by the use of stock options and restricted stock, and the potential dilutive effect of stock option and restricted stock grants. of these factors, the committee's assessment of individual performance of each named executive officer is the most important factor in determining the number of shares of restricted stock and stock options awarded, except with respect to the chief executive officer for whom comparative market data is the most important factor. the committee, in consultation with entergy corporation's chief executive officer, reviews each of the other named executive officer's performance, role and responsibilities, strengths, and developmental opportunities.
stock option and restricted stock awards for entergy corporation's chief executive officer are determined solely by the personnel committee on the basis of the same considerations.
the following table sets forth the number of stock options and shares of restricted stock granted to each named executive officer in 2017. the exercise price for each option was $70.53, which was the closing price of entergy corporation's common stock on the date of grant.

medical, dental, and vision coverage, life and accidental death and dismemberment insurance, business travel accident insurance, and long-term disability insurance.
health & welfare benefits  eligibility, coverage levels, potential employee contributions, and other plan design features are the same for the named executive officers as for the broad employee population.
corporate aircraft usage, annual physical exams, relocation assistance, and event tickets.  the office of the chief executive members do not receive tax gross ups on any benefits, except for relocation assistance.named executive officers who are not
2017 perquisites           members of the office of the chief executive also were provided in 2017 with club dues and tax gross up payments on some perquisites.for additional information regarding perquisites, see the "all other compensation" column in the 2017 summary compensation table.
the named executive officers are eligible to defer up to 100% of their base salary deferred compensation      and annual incentive plan awards into an entergy corporation-sponsored executive deferred compensation plan.
eligible individuals who become disabled under the terms of the plan are eligible executive disability plan  for 65% of the difference between their annual base salary and $276,923 (i.e. the annual base salary that produces the maximum $15,000 monthly disability payment under the general long-term disability plan).
entergy corporation provides these benefits to its named executive officers as part of providing a competitive executive compensation program and because it believes that these benefits are important retention and recruitment tools since many of the companies with which it competes for executive talent provide similar arrangements to their senior executive officers.
465
table of contents compensation arrangements the personnel committee believes that retention and transitional compensation arrangements are an important part of overall compensation. the committee believes that these arrangements help to secure the continued employment and dedication of the named executive officers, notwithstanding any concern that they might have at the time of a change in control regarding their own continued employment. in addition, the committee believes that these arrangements are important as recruitment and retention devices, as many of the companies with which entergy corporation competes for executive talent have similar arrangements in place for their senior employees.
to achieve these objectives, entergy corporation has established a system executive continuity plan under which each of the named executive officers is entitled to receive "change in control" payments and benefits if such officer's employment is involuntarily terminated in connection with a change in control of entergy corporation and its subsidiaries. severance payments under the system executive continuity plan generally are based on a multiple of the sum of an executive officer's annual base salary plus his or her average annual incentive plan award for the two calendar years immediately preceding the calendar year in which the termination of employment occurs. under entergy corporation's policy, under no circumstances can this multiple exceed 2.99 times the sum of the executive officer's annual base salary and his or her annual incentive, calculated in accordance with this policy. entergy corporation strives to ensure that the benefits and payment levels under the system executive continuity plan are consistent with market practices. entergy corporation's executive officers, including the named executive officers, will not receive any tax gross up payments on any severance benefits received under this plan. for more information regarding the system executive continuity plan, see "2017 potential payments upon termination or change in control-
system executive continuity plan."
in certain cases, the committee may approve the execution of a retention agreement with an individual executive officer. these decisions are made on a case by case basis to reflect specific retention needs or other factors, including market practice. if a retention agreement is entered into with an individual officer, the committee considers the economic value associated with that agreement in making overall compensation decisions for that officer. entergy corporation has voluntarily adopted a policy that any employment or severance agreements providing severance benefits in excess of 2.99 times the sum of an officer's annual base salary and annual incentive award
(other than the value of the vesting or payment of an outstanding equity-based award or the pro rata vesting or payment of an outstanding long-term incentive award) must be approved by entergy corporation's shareholders.
entergy corporation currently has a retention agreement with mr. denault. in general, mr. denault's retention agreement provides for certain payments and benefits in the event of his termination of employment by his entergy employer other than for cause, by mr. denault for good reason or on account of his death or disability. see "2017
potential payments upon termination or change in control - mr. denault's 2006 retention agreement." because mr.
denault has reached age 55, certain severance payment provisions in his retention agreement no longer apply. mr.
denault will not receive tax gross up payments on any payments or benefits he may receive under his agreement. mr.
denault's retention agreement was entered into in 2006 when he was entergy corporation's chief financial officer and was designed to reflect the competition for chief financial officer talent in the marketplace at that time and the committee's assessment of the critical role this position played in executing entergy corporation's long-term financial and other strategic objectives. based on the market data provided by its former independent compensation consultant, the committee, at the time the agreement was entered into, believed the benefits and payment levels under mr. denault's retention agreement were consistent with market practices.
466
table of contents compensation policies and practices entergy corporation strives to ensure that its compensation philosophy and practices are in line with the best practices of companies in its industry as well as other companies in the s&p 500. some of these practices include the following:
clawback provisions entergy corporation has adopted a clawback policy that covers all individuals subject to section 16 of the securities exchange act of 1934 (the exchange act), including the members of the office of the chief executive.
under the policy, which goes beyond the requirements of sarbanes-oxley act of 2002 (sarbanes-oxley), the committee will require reimbursement of incentives paid to these executive officers where:
(i) the payment was predicated upon the achievement of certain financial results with respect to the applicable performance period that were subsequently determined to be the subject of a material restatement
•  other than a restatement due to changes in accounting policy; or (ii) a material miscalculation of a performance award occurs, whether or not the financial statements were restated and, in either such case, a lower payment would have been made to the executive officer based upon the restated financial results or correct calculation; or in the board of directors' view, the executive officer engaged in fraud that caused or partially caused the
•  need for a restatement or caused a material miscalculation of a performance award, in each case, whether or not the financial statements were restated.
the amount the committee requires to be reimbursed is equal to the excess of the gross incentive payment made over the gross payment that would have been made if the original payment had been determined based on the restated financial results or correct calculation. further, following a material restatement of entergy corporation's financial statements, it will seek to recover any compensation received by its chief executive officer and chief financial officer that is required to be reimbursed under sarbanes-oxley.
stock ownership guidelines and share retention requirements for many years, entergy corporation has had stock ownership guidelines for executives, including the named executive officers. these guidelines are designed to align the executives' long-term financial interests with those of shareholders. annually, the personnel committee monitors the executive officers' compliance with these guidelines.
entergy corporation's ownership guidelines are as follows:
role                       value of common stock to be owned chief executive officer    6 times base salary executive vice presidents  3 times base salary senior vice presidents     2 times base salary vice presidents            1 time base salary further, to ensure compliance with the guidelines, until an executive officer satisfies the stock ownership guidelines, the officer must retain:
•  all net after-tax shares paid out under the long-term performance unit program;
•  all net after-tax shares of restricted stock and restricted stock units received upon vesting; and at least 75% of the after-tax net shares received upon the exercise of entergy corporation stock options, except for stock options granted before january 1, 2014, as to which the executive officer must retain at least 75% of the after-tax net shares until the earlier of achievement of the stock ownership guidelines or
•  five years from the date of exercise.

table of contents trading controls and anti-pledging and anti-hedging policies executive officers, including the named executive officers, are required to receive the permission of entergy corporation's general counsel prior to entering into any transaction involving entergy corporation securities, including gifts, other than the exercise of employee stock options. trading is generally permitted only during specified open trading windows beginning immediately following the release of earnings. employees, who are subject to trading restrictions, including the named executive officers, may enter into trading plans under rule 10b5-1 of the exchange act, but these trading plans may be entered into only during an open trading window and must be approved by entergy corporation. the named executive officer bears full responsibility if he or she violates the policy by permitting shares to be bought or sold without pre-approval or when trading is restricted.
entergy corporation also prohibits its directors and executive officers, including the named executive officers, from pledging any entergy corporation securities or entering into margin accounts involving entergy corporation securities. these transactions are prohibited because of the potential that sales of entergy corporation securities could occur outside trading periods and without the required approval of the general counsel.
entergy corporation has also adopted an anti-hedging policy that prohibits officers, directors, and employees from entering into hedging or monetization transactions involving entergy corporation common stock. prohibited transactions include, without limitation, zero-cost collars, forward sale contracts, purchase or sale of options, puts, calls, straddles or equity swaps or other derivatives that are directly linked to entergy corporation's common stock or transactions involving "short-sales" of entergy corporation's common stock. the board adopted this policy to require officers, directors, and employees to continue to own entergy corporation's common stock with the full risks and rewards of ownership, thereby ensuring continued alignment of their objectives with those of entergy corporation's other shareholders.
how entergy corporation makes compensation decisions role of the personnel committee the personnel committee has overall responsibility for approving the compensation program for the named executive officers and makes all final compensation decisions regarding entergy corporation's named executive officers. the committee works with entergy corporation's executive management to ensure that the compensation policies and practices are consistent with its values and support the successful recruitment, development, and retention of executive talent so that entergy corporation can achieve its business objectives and optimize its long-term financial returns. annually, management presents the personnel committee with the proposed compensation model for the following year, including the compensation elements, mix of elements, and measures for each element, and consults with entergy corporation's chief executive officer on recommended compensation for senior executives. the committee evaluates executive pay each year to ensure that entergy corporation's compensation policies and practices are consistent with its philosophy. the personnel committee is responsible for, among its other duties, the following actions related to the named executive officers:
•  developing and implementing compensation policies and programs for hiring, evaluating, and setting compensation for executive officers, including any employment agreement with an executive officer;
•  evaluating the performance of entergy corporation's chairman and chief executive officer; and
•  reporting, at least annually, to the board on succession planning, including succession planning for the chief executive officer.
role of the chief executive officer the personnel committee solicits recommendations from entergy corporation's chief executive officer with respect to compensation decisions for the other named executive officers who are members of entergy corporation's office of the chief executive. entergy corporation's chief executive officer provides the personnel committee with an assessment of the performance of each of these named executive officers and recommends compensation levels to be awarded to each of them. in addition, the committee may request that the chief executive
468
table of contents officer provide management feedback and recommendations on changes in the design of compensation programs, such as special retention plans or changes in incentive program structure. however, the chief executive officer does not play any role with respect to any matter affecting his own compensation, nor does he have any role determining or recommending the amount or form of director compensation. the personnel committee also relies on the recommendations of entergy corporation's senior vice president, human resources with respect to compensation decisions, policies, and practices.
the chief executive officer may attend meetings of the personnel committee only at the invitation of the chair of the personnel committee and cannot call a meeting of the committee. since he is not a member of the committee, he has no vote on matters submitted to the committee. during 2017, mr. denault attended 9 meetings of the personnel committee.
role of the compensation consultant entergy corporation's personnel committee has the sole authority for the appointment, compensation, and oversight of its outside compensation consultant. the committee conducts an annual review of the compensation consultant, and in 2017, it retained pay governance llc as its independent compensation consultant to assist it in, among other things, evaluating different compensation programs and developing market data to assess entergy corporation's compensation programs. also in 2017, the corporate governance committee retained pay governance to review and perform a competitive analysis of non-employee director compensation.
during 2017, pay governance assisted the committee with its responsibilities related to entergy corporation's compensation programs for its executives. the committee directed pay governance to: (i) regularly attend meetings of the committee; (ii) conduct studies of competitive compensation practices; (iii) identify entergy corporation's market surveys and proxy peer group; (iv) review base salary, annual incentives, and long-term incentive compensation opportunities relative to competitive practices; and (v) develop conclusions and recommendations related to the executive compensation programs for consideration by the committee. a senior consultant from pay governance attended all personnel committee meetings to which he was invited in 2017.
compensation consultant independence to maintain the independence of the personnel committee's compensation consultant, the board has adopted a policy that any consultant (including its affiliates) retained by the board of directors or any committee of the board of directors to provide advice or recommendations on the amount or form of executive or director compensation should not be retained by entergy corporation or any of its affiliates to provide other services in an aggregate amount that exceeds $120,000 in any year. in 2017, the personnel committee's independent compensation consultant, pay governance, did not provide any services to entergy corporation other than its services to the personnel committee and the corporate governance committee in connection with entergy corporation's non-employee director compensation program. annually, the committee reviews the relationship with its compensation consultant, including services provided, quality of those services, and fees associated with services in its evaluation of the executive compensation consultant's independence. the committee also assesses pay governance's independence under nyse rules and has concluded that no conflict of interests exists that would prevent pay governance from independently advising the personnel committee.
tax and accounting considerations section 162(m) of the internal revenue code (the code) limits the tax deductibility by a publicly-held corporation of compensation in excess of $1 million paid to the chief executive officer and any of its other section 162(m)
covered employees. historically, an exception was provided for compensation that was "performance-based compensation" within the meaning of section 162(m). effective as of january 1, 2018, this exception no longer applies, other than with respect to certain grandfathered arrangements. in structuring the compensation packages that are provided to the named executive officers, the personnel committee takes into account the tax effects of section 162(m) and considers the financial accounting consequences. however, the personnel committee and the board believe that it is in the best interest of entergy corporation that the personnel committee retains the discretion
469
table of contents to make compensation awards, whether or not deductible. this flexibility is necessary to foster achievement of performance goals established by the personnel committee, as well as other corporate goals that the committee deems important to entergy corporation's success, such as encouraging employee retention and rewarding achievement of key corporate goals.
personnel committee report the personnel committee report included in the entergy corporation proxy statement is incorporated by reference, but will not be deemed to be "filed" in this annual report on form 10-k. none of the subsidiaries has a compensation committee or other board committee performing equivalent functions. the board of directors of each of the subsidiaries is comprised of individuals who are officers or employees of entergy corporation or one of the subsidiaries. these boards do not make determinations regarding the compensation paid to executive officers of the subsidiaries.

table of contents the amounts in columns (f), (g), and (h) represent the minimum, target, and maximum payment levels under the long-term performance unit program.  performance under the program is measured by entergy corporation's total shareholder return relative to the total shareholder returns of the companies included
(2)  in the philadelphia utility index.  there is no payout under the program if entergy corporation's total shareholder return falls within the lowest quartile of the peer companies in the philadelphia utility index.  subject to the achievement of performance targets, each unit will be converted into one share of entergy corporation's common stock on the last day of the performance period (december 31, 2019.)  accrued dividends on the shares earned will also be paid in entergy corporation common stock.
the amounts in column (i) represent shares of restricted stock granted under the 2015 equity ownership
(3)  plan.  shares of restricted stock vest one-third on each of the first through third anniversaries of the grant date, have voting rights, and accrue dividends during the vesting period.
the amounts in column (j) represent options to purchase shares of entergy corporation's common stock.  the
(4)  options vest one-third on each of the first through third anniversaries of the grant date and have a ten-year term from the date of grant.  the options were granted under the 2015 equity ownership plan.
the amounts in column (l) are valued based on the aggregate grant date fair value of the award calculated
(5)  in accordance with fasb asc topic 718 and, in the case of the performance units, are based on the probable outcome of the applicable performance conditions.  see notes 4 and 5 to the 2017 summary compensation table for a discussion of the relevant assumptions used in calculating the grant date fair value.

performance units:
with respect to mr. denault, in the event of a termination event (as defined in mr. denault's 2006
retention agreement), he is entitled to a target ltip award, as defined in his 2006 retention agreement, calculated by using the average annual number of performance units with respect to the two most recent performance periods preceding the calendar year in which his employment termination occurs, assuming all performance goals were achieved at target.  for purposes of the table, the value of mr. denault's retention
6)  payment was calculated by taking an average of the target performance units from the 2013-2015 performance unit program (38,000) and from the 2014-2016 performance unit program (40,000).  this average number of units (39,000) multiplied by the closing price of entergy corporation's common stock on december 29, 2017
($81.39) would equal a payment of $3,174,210.  in the event of death or disability, mr. denault receives the greater of the target ltip award calculated as described above or the sum of the amount that would be payable under the provisions of each open performance unit program as described in note 7 below.
in the event of a qualifying termination related to a change in control, each named executive officer would have forfeited his or her performance units for the 2016-2018 and 2017-2019 performance periods and would have been entitled to receive, pursuant to the 2015 equity ownership plan, a single-lump sum payment in lieu of any payment for each performance award that would not be based on any outstanding performance period.  the payments for the 2016-2018 and the 2017-2019 performance periods would have been calculated using the most recent performance period preceding (but not including) the calendar year in which his or her termination occurs.  for purposes of the table, the value of mr. denault's payments was calculated by multiplying the target performance units for the 2014-2016 performance unit program (40,000) by the closing
7)  price of entergy corporation's common stock on december 29, 2017 ($81.39), which would equal a payment of
$3,255,600 for the forfeited performance units for each performance period.  the value of the payments for the other named executive officers was calculated by multiplying the target performance units for the
2014-2016 performance unit program (9,400) by the closing price of entergy corporation's common stock on december 29, 2017 ($81.39), which would equal a payment of $765,066 for the forfeited performance units for each performance period.  in the event his death or disability, mr. denault would receive the greater of the target long-term performance incentive award as described in note 6 above or a pro-rated number of performance units for all open performance periods, based on the number of months of his participation in each open performance period.
in the event of retirement in the case of mr. brown, mr. denault, mr. may, ms. rainer, or mr. riley, or upon death or disability, other than mr. denault, each named executive officer would not have forfeited his or her performance units for all open performance periods, but rather such performance unit awards would have been pro-rated based on his or her number of months of participation in each open performance unit program performance period, in accordance with his grant agreement under the performance unit program. the amount of the award is based on actual performance achieved, with a stock price set as of the end of the performance period, and payable in the form of a lump sum after the completion of the performance period. for purposes of the table, the values of the awards were calculated as follows:

table of contents entergy audit committee guidelines for pre-approval of independent auditor services the audit committee has adopted the following guidelines regarding the engagement of entergy's independent auditor to perform services for entergy:
the independent auditor will provide the audit committee, for approval, an annual engagement letter
1.  outlining the scope of services proposed to be performed during the fiscal year, including audit services and other permissible non-audit services (e.g. audit-related services, tax services, and all other services).
for other permissible services not included in the engagement letter, entergy management will submit a description of the proposed service, including a budget estimate, to the audit committee for pre-approval.
2.  management and the independent auditor must agree that the requested service is consistent with the sec's rules on auditor independence prior to submission to the audit committee.  the audit committee, at its discretion, will pre-approve permissible services and has established the following additional guidelines for permissible non-audit services provided by the independent auditor:
•  aggregate non-audit service fees are targeted at fifty percent or less of the approved audit service fee.
•  all other services should only be provided by the independent auditor if it is a highly qualified provider of that service or if the audit committee pre-approves the independent audit firm to provide the service.
3.  the audit committee will be informed quarterly as to the status of pre-approved services actually provided by the independent auditor.
to ensure prompt handling of unexpected matters, the audit committee delegates to the audit committee chair
4.  or its designee the authority to approve permissible services and fees.  the audit committee chair or designee will report action taken to the audit committee at the next scheduled audit committee meeting.
5.  the vice president and general auditor will be responsible for tracking all independent auditor fees and will report quarterly to the audit committee.

our operating results are dependent on the following trends, events and uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control:
homebuilding industry. our business is driven primarily by the residential new construction market and the residential repair and remodel market, which are in turn dependent upon a number of factors, including demographic trends, interest rates, consumer confidence, employment rates, foreclosure rates, the availability of skilled construction labor, and the health of the economy and mortgage markets. according to the u.s. census bureau, annual u.s. total and single-family housing starts were 1,202,900 and 848,900, respectively, in 2017. however, both total and single-family housing starts remain well below the normalized historical averages (from 1959 through 2017) of 1.5 million and 1.1 million, respectively. we believe the housing industry is currently experiencing a shortage of skilled construction labor, which is constraining
•  housing activity. due to the lower levels in housing starts and increased competition for homebuilder business, we have seen and may continue to experience downward competitive pressure on our gross margins.
in addition to these factors, there has been a trend of consolidation within the building products supply industry. however, our industry remains highly fragmented and competitive and we will continue to face significant competition from local and regional suppliers. we still believe there are several meaningful trends that indicate u.s. housing demand will recover to the historical average in the long term and that the downturn in the housing industry was a trough in the cyclical nature of the residential construction industry. these trends include relatively low interest rates, the aging of housing stock, and normal population growth due to immigration and birthrate exceeding death rate. industry forecasters, including the
24
national association of homebuilders ("nahb"), expect to see continued improvement in housing demand over the next few years.
targeting large production homebuilders. over the past ten years, the homebuilding industry has undergone consolidation, and the larger homebuilders have increased their market share. we expect that trend to continue as larger homebuilders have better liquidity and land positions relative to the smaller, less capitalized homebuilders. our focus is on maintaining relationships and market share with these customers
•  while balancing the competitive pressures we are facing in servicing large homebuilders with certain profitability expectations. we expect that our ability to maintain strong relationships with the largest builders will be vital to our ability to expand into new markets as well as grow our market share.
additionally, we have been successful in expanding our custom homebuilder base while maintaining acceptable credit standards.
repair and remodel end market.  although the repair and remodel end market is influenced by housing starts to a lesser degree than the homebuilding market, the repair and remodel end market is still dependent upon
•  some of the same factors as the homebuilding market, including demographic trends, interest rates, consumer confidence, employment rates, foreclosure rates, and the health of the economy and home financing markets.
we expect that our ability to remain competitive in this space as well as grow our market share will depend on our continued ability to provide a high level of customer service coupled with a broad product offering.
use of prefabricated components. homebuilders are increasingly using prefabricated components in order to realize increased efficiency and improved quality. shortening cycle time from start to completion is a key
•  imperative of the homebuilders during periods of strong consumer demand. while the conversion of customers to this product offering slowed during the downturn, we see the demand for prefabricated components increasing as the residential new construction market continues to strengthen and the availability of skilled construction labor remains limited.
economic conditions. economic changes both nationally and locally in our markets impact our financial performance. the building products supply industry is highly dependent upon new home construction and subject to cyclical market changes. our operations are subject to fluctuations arising from changes in
•  supply and demand, national and local economic conditions, labor costs and availability, competition, government regulation, trade policies and other factors that affect the homebuilding industry such as demographic trends, interest rates, housing starts, the availability of suitable building lots, employment levels, consumer confidence, and the availability of credit to homebuilders, contractors, and homeowners.
cost of materials. prices of wood products, which are subject to cyclical market fluctuations, may adversely impact operating income when prices rapidly rise or fall within a relatively short period of time. we purchase certain materials, including lumber products, which are then sold to customers as well as used as
•  direct production inputs for our manufactured and prefabricated products. short-term changes in the cost of these materials, some of which are subject to significant fluctuations, are sometimes passed on to our customers, but our pricing quotation periods may limit our ability to pass on such price changes. we may also be limited in our ability to pass on increases on in-bound freight costs on our products. our inability to pass on material price increases to our customers could adversely impact our operating results.
controlling expenses. another important aspect of our strategy is controlling costs and striving to be the
•  low-cost building materials supplier in the markets we serve. we pay close attention to managing our working capital and operating expenses. further, we pay careful attention to our logistics function and its effect on our shipping and handling costs.
multi-family and light commercial business. our primary focus has been, and continues to be, on
•  single-family residential new construction and the repair and remodel end market. however, we will continue to identify opportunities for profitable growth in the multi-family and light commercial markets.
•  reduction of debt: as a result of our historical growth through acquisitions, we have substantial indebtedness. debt reduction will continue to be a key area of focus for the company.
recent developments during the year ended december 31, 2017, the company executed three debt transactions which are described in note 8
to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k. these transactions further extended our debt maturity profile and reduced our annual cash interest on a go forward basis.
on december 22, 2017, the 2017 tax act became enacted law. the effects of the 2017 tax act on our financial statements for the year ended december 31, 2017 are discussed in more detail below as well as in note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k. the 2017 tax act, among several other substantial changes, reduces the statutory federal income tax rate from 35% to 21% for periods beginning after december 31, 2017. we generally expect the 2017 tax act to have a positive impact on our business due to the anticipated reduction in federal cash tax payments.

current operating conditions and outlook though the level of housing starts remains below the historical average, the homebuilding industry has shown improvement since 2011. according to the u.s. census bureau, actual u.s. total housing starts for 2017 were
1,202,900, an increase of 2.5% compared to 2016. actual u.s. single-family housing starts for 2017 were 848,900, an increase of 8.6% compared to 2016. while the housing industry has strengthened over the past few years, the limited availability of credit to smaller homebuilders and potential homebuyers, as well as the high demand for a limited supply of skilled construction labor, among other factors, have hampered a stronger recovery. a composite of third party sources, including the nahb, are forecasting 1,292,000 u.s. total housing starts and 921,000 u.s. single-
family housing starts for 2018, which are increases of 7.4% and 8.5%, respectively, from 2017. in addition, the home improvement research institute ("hiri") is forecasting sales in the professional repair and remodel end market to increase approximately 2.5% in 2018 compared to 2017.
our net sales for the year ended december 31, 2017 were up 10.5% over the same period last year. we estimate that our sales volume increased 4.3%, while commodity price inflation resulted in an additional 6.2% increase in sales in 2017 compared to 2016. for the year ended december 31, 2017 sales volume growth in single-family and the repair and remodel end market were partially offset by declines in multi-family. our gross margin percentage decreased by
0.5% during the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to the year ended december 31, 2016. our gross margin percentage decreased primarily due to gross profit margin compression on commodity products resulting from inflation in the lumber and lumber sheet goods markets during most of 2017. we continue to invest in our business to improve our operating efficiency, which has allowed us to better leverage our operating costs against changes in net sales. our selling, general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of net sales, were 20.5% for the year ended december 31, 2017, a 0.9% decrease from 21.4% in 2016. the decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of net sales, was due to cost leverage as well as the decline in depreciation and amortization on acquired probuild assets, partially offset by investments the company made towards growth initiatives, including additional sales associates and new locations.
we believe the long-term outlook for the housing industry is positive due to growth in the underlying demographics.
we feel we are well-positioned to take advantage of the construction activity in our markets and to increase our market share, which may include strategic acquisitions. we will continue to focus on working capital by closely monitoring the credit exposure of our customers and by working with our vendors to improve our payment terms and pricing on our products. we strive to achieve the appropriate balance of short-term expense control while maintaining the expertise and capacity to grow the business as market conditions improve. in addition, debt reduction will continue to be a key area of focus for the company.

2017 compared with 2016
sales. sales for the year ended december 31, 2017 were $7,034.2 million, a 10.5% increase from sales of $6,367.3
million for 2016. we estimate that our sales volume increased 4.3%, while commodity price inflation resulted in an additional 6.2% increase in sales in 2017 compared to 2016. for the year ended december 31, 2017, sales volume growth in single-family and the repair and remodel end market were partially offset by declines in multi-family.

we achieved increased net sales across all of our product categories. the impact of commodity price inflation in
2017 resulted in the sales growth of our lumber and lumber sheet goods category exceeding the sales growth of our other product categories.
gross margin. gross margin increased $130.6 million to $1,727.4 million. our gross margin percentage decreased to
24.6% in 2017 from 25.1% in 2016, a 0.5% decrease. our gross margin percentage decreased primarily due to gross profit margin compression on commodity products resulting from inflation in the lumber and lumber sheet goods markets during most of 2017.
selling, general and administrative expenses. selling, general and administrative expenses increased $81.9 million, or 6.0%. our salaries and benefits expense was $935.5 million, an increase of $41.1 million from 2016, and stock compensation increased $3.0 million. office general and administrative increased $13.9 million, delivery expense increased $10.1 million and occupancy expense increased $5.9 million. in addition, we recognized a $4.2 million loss on the disposal of assets during the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to a gain of $5.0 million during the year ended december 31, 2016.
as a percentage of net sales, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased from 21.4% in 2016 to 20.5% in
2017 due to cost leverage as well as the decline in depreciation and amortization on acquired probuild assets, partially offset by investments the company made towards growth initiatives, including additional sales associates and new locations.
interest expense, net. interest expense was $193.2 million in 2017, a decrease of $21.5 million from 2016. this decrease was largely attributable to the positive results of our debt transactions executed in fiscal years 2016
and 2017. interest expense for the years ended december 31, 2017 and 2016 included one-time charges related to the debt financing transactions of $58.7 million and $57.0 million, respectively.
income tax expense. we recorded income tax expense of $53.1 million during the year ended december 31, 2017
compared to an income tax benefit of $122.7 million during the year ended december 31, 2016. due to the enactment of the 2017 tax act, we recorded income tax expense of $29.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2017 related to the revaluation of our net deferred tax assets. we recorded reductions of $2.8 million and $131.7 million in the after tax non-cash valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets for the years ended december 31, 2017 and
2016, respectively. for the year ended december 31, 2017, our effective tax rate was 57.8% largely due to the impact of the additional income tax expense recognized in connection with the enactment of the 2017 tax act. our effective rate for the year ended december 31, 2016 was (566.1%) primarily due to the release of the valuation allowance against our net federal and some state deferred tax assets in that period. absent the effect of the 2017
tax act and the changes to our valuation allowance, our effective rate would have been 29.4% and 41.8% for the years ended december 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
27
2016 compared with 2015
sales. sales for the year ended december 31, 2016 were $6,367.3 million, a 78.6% increase from sales of $3,564.4
million for 2015. net sales increased $2,659.1 million, or approximately 75%, due to the probuild acquisition.
excluding the impact of the probuild acquisition, we estimate net sales increased $143.8 million, or approximately
4% due to increased volume.

due to the probuild acquisition, we achieved increased net sales across all product categories. our sales classification by product categories has shifted as we diversified our product offerings to support a broader customer base across 40 states through the probuild acquisition.
gross margin. gross margin increased $695.3 million to $1,596.7 million. of this increase, $656.8 million is due to the probuild acquisition. our gross margin percentage decreased to 25.1% in 2016 from 25.3% in 2015, a 0.2%
decrease. our gross margin percentage decreased primarily due to the impact of commodity price inflation relative to our short-term customer pricing commitments during the year ended december 31, 2016. however, this decrease was mostly offset by an increase in our gross margin percentage largely attributable to the probuild acquisition, the result of probuild's higher mix of higher margin repair & remodel and retail sales.
selling, general and administrative expenses. selling, general and administrative expenses increased $549.7
million, or 67.8%, largely due to the probuild acquisition. our salaries and benefits expense was $894.3 million, an increase of $383.7 million from 2015, largely due to increased full-time equivalent employees following the probuild acquisition. delivery expense increased $65.9 million, office general and administrative expense increased
$46.5 million, occupancy expense increased $45.9 million and intangible asset amortization increased $10.7 million.
these increases were primarily a result of the probuild acquisition, the related integration activities and increased sales volume. these increases were partially offset by a $4.2 million decrease in facility closure costs.
as a percentage of net sales, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased from 22.7% in 2015 to 21.4% in
2016 largely due to the benefit of synergy cost savings. synergy cost savings were primarily attributable to reduced payroll and benefits expense, as well as decreased delivery costs and location consolidations.
interest expense, net. interest expense was $214.7 million in 2016, an increase of $105.5 million from 2015. of the
$105.5 million increase, $49.6 million was attributable to increased interest expense associated with our increased debt balances following the probuild acquisition financing and subsequent refinancing transactions, $28.1 million was attributable to losses on debt extinguishment largely due to the payment of redemption premiums on our 2021 and
2023 notes, $17.6 million was related to increased amortization and write-off of debt discount and debt issuance costs largely due to our debt transactions during the year ended december 31, 2016, and $14.2 million was due to interest expense primarily related to lease obligations assumed in the probuild acquisition. these increases were partially offset by a $4.6 million decrease in interest expense due to non-cash fair value adjustments related to the exercise of all remaining stock warrants in 2015.
income tax expense. we recorded an income tax benefit of $122.7 million during the year ended december 31, 2016
compared to income tax expense of $4.4 million during the year ended december 31, 2015. in the third quarter of
2016, we released the valuation allowance against our net federal and some state deferred tax assets. we recorded a reduction of the after-tax, non-cash valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets of $131.7 million during the year ended december 31, 2016 compared to an increase of $9.7 million during the year ended december 31, 2015.
absent the valuation allowance our effective tax rate would have been 41.8% and 28.5% for the years ended december
31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

we have four reportable segments based on an aggregation of the geographic regions in which we operate. while there is some geographic similarity between our reportable segments and the regions as defined by the u.s. census bureau, our reportable segments do not necessarily fully align with any single u.s. census bureau region.
according to the u.s. census bureau, actual single-family housing starts during the year ended december 31, 2017
increased 3.2%, 7.7%, 7.6% and 13.6% in the northeast region, midwest region, south region and west region, respectively. for the year ended december 31, 2017, we achieved increased net sales and profitability compared to
2016 across all of our reportable segments, due to the impact of commodity price inflation as well as an increase in sales volume.
according to the u.s. census bureau, actual single-family housing starts during the year ended december 31, 2016
increased 8.8%, 9.5%, 8.7% and 12.8% in the south region, northeast region, west region and midwest region, respectively. for the year ended december 31, 2016, we achieved increased net sales and profitability compared to
2015 across all our reportable segments, primarily due to the probuild acquisition and sales volume increases.
liquidity and capital resources our primary capital requirements are to fund working capital needs and operating expenses, meet required interest and principal payments, and to fund capital expenditures and potential future acquisitions. our capital resources at december 31, 2017 consist of cash on hand and borrowing availability under our 2022 facility.
our 2022 facility will be primarily used for working capital, general corporate purposes, and funding acquisitions.
in addition, we may use the 2022 facility to facilitate debt repayment and consolidation. availability under the
2022 facility is determined by a borrowing base. our borrowing base consists of trade accounts receivable, inventory, other receivables, including progress billings and credit card receivables, and qualified cash that all meet specific criteria contained within the credit agreement, minus agent specified reserves. net excess borrowing availability is equal to the maximum borrowing amount minus outstanding borrowings and letters of credit.

revolving facility as of december 31, 2017, we had $350.0 million in outstanding borrowings under our 2022 facility and our net excess borrowing availability was $436.8 million after being reduced by outstanding letters of credit of approximately
$84.9 million. we are required to meet a fixed charge coverage ratio of 1:00 to 1:00 if our excess availability falls below the greater of $80.0 million or 10% of the maximum borrowing amount, which was $87.2 million as of december 31, 2017. we were not in violation of any covenants or restrictions imposed by any of our debt agreements at december 31, 2017.
liquidity our liquidity at december 31, 2017 was $494.3 million, which consists of net borrowing availability under the 2022
facility and cash on hand. we are expecting continued improvement in the housing industry in 2018. beyond 2018, it is difficult for us to predict what will happen as our industry is dependent on a number of factors, including national economic conditions, employment levels, the availability of credit for homebuilders and potential home buyers, the level of foreclosures, existing home inventory, and interest rates.
we have substantial indebtedness following our recent acquisitions, which increased our interest expense and could have the effect of, among other things, reducing our flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions. from time to time, based on market conditions and other factors and subject to compliance with applicable laws and regulations, the company may repurchase or call the 2024 notes, repay debt, or otherwise enter into transactions regarding its capital structure.
should the current industry conditions deteriorate or we pursue additional acquisitions, we may be required to raise additional funds through the sale of capital stock or debt in the public capital markets or in privately negotiated transactions. there can be no assurance that any of these financing options would be available on favorable terms, if at all. alternatives to help supplement our liquidity position could include, but are not limited to, idling or permanently closing additional facilities, adjusting our headcount in response to current business conditions, attempts to renegotiate leases, managing our working capital and/or divesting of non-core businesses. there are no assurances that these steps would prove successful or materially improve our liquidity position.
consolidated cash flows cash provided by operating activities was $178.5 million and $158.2 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively. the increase in cash provided by operations is due to increased sales and profitability during the year ended december
31, 2017. however, this increase in cash provided by operating activities was mostly offset by the working capital increase of $94.1 million for 2017 exceeding the working capital increase of $43.9 million in 2016. this increased investment in working capital is primarily related to accounts receivable and inventory during the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to the prior year due to a $666.9 million increase in sales over the same period. in addition, the larger increase in working capital for 2017 was also due to a decrease in accrued liabilities in the current year compared to an increase in accrued liabilities in 2016. the decrease in accrued liabilities in 2017 is primarily due to a decrease in accrued interest attributable to the redemption of the 2023 notes in december 2017.
these increases were partially offset by the increase in accounts payable for 2017 exceeding the increase in 2016
primarily due to increased purchases in the current year.
30
cash providedby operating activities was $158.2million and $177.0 millionin2016 and 2015, respectively.our working capital increased $43.9 million in 2016 compared to a decrease of $99.0 million in 2015. the change in working capital is largely due to the probuild acquisition, as well as increases in receivables and inventory and increased customer demand. these increases were partially offset by increases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities largely due to increased purchases and increased accounts payable days. cash interest payments increased $99.5
million in 2016 compared to 2015. the remaining change is due to an increase in cash provided by operationsprimarily related to increased sales and profitability during the year ended december 31, 2016 as a result of the probuild acquisition and higher sales volume.
cash used in investing activities was $59.4 million and $38.3 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively. the increase in cash used in investing activities is largely due to a $19.7 million increase in capital expenditures in 2017
compared to 2016. the increase in capital expenditures in 2017 largely relates to facility improvements and the purchase of machinery and equipment to support sales growth.
cash used in investing activities was $38.3 million and $1,508.0 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively. the change is primarily due to $1,462.7 million in cash used for the probuild acquisition in 2015. the remaining change is largely due to an increase in proceeds from the sale of property, plant and equipment and a decrease in capital expenditures in 2016 compared to 2015.
cash used in financing activities was $76.0 million and $170.5 million for the years ended december 31, 2017 and
2016, respectively. cash used in financing activities in 2017 was primarily attributable to the $379.9 million in payments of long-term debt, largely due to the extinguishment of our 2023 notes. in connection with the extinguishment of the 2023 notes we paid $48.7 million in debt extinguishment costs. these payments were largely offset by $350.0 million in net borrowings under the 2022 facility. cash used in financing activities in 2016
largely relates to the debt transactions executed in that period which are described below.
cash used in financing activities was $170.5 million in 2016 compared to cash provided by financing activities of
$1,378.3 million in 2015. cash used in financing activities in 2016 was primarily attributable to $807.5 million in payments of long-term debt, largely due to the extinguishment of our 2021 notes, the partial pay down of the 2015
term loan and 2023 notes. in addition, we repaid $60.0 million, net, under the 2015 facility, paid $42.9 million of debt extinguishment costs and $15.7 million in debt issuance costs. these payments were partially offset by $750.0
million in proceeds from the 2024 notes issuance. cash provided by financing activities for 2015 is attributable to the financing activities executed in connection with the probuild acquisition.
capital expenditures capital expenditures vary depending on prevailing business factors, including current and anticipated market conditions. historically, capital expenditures have for the most part remained at relatively low levels in comparison to the operating cash flows generated during the corresponding periods. we expect our 2018 capital expenditures to be in the range of approximately $120 million to $130 million primarily related to rolling stock, equipment and facility improvements to support our operations.

cash obligations we had $350.0 million in outstanding borrowings under the 2022 facility as of december 31, 2017.
borrowings under the 2022 facility bear interest at a variable rate. therefore, actual interest may differ
(1)  from the amounts presented above due to interest rate changes or any future borrowing activity under the
2022 facility. the 2024 term loan also bears interest at a variable rate, therefore actual interest may differ from the amounts presented above due to interest rate changes.
(2)  future minimum commitments for lease finance obligations and capital lease obligations.
the amounts reflected in the table above for operating leases represent future minimum lease payments under non-
cancelable operating leases with an initial or remaining term in excess of one year at december 31, 2017. purchase orders entered into in the ordinary course of business are excluded from the above table because they are payable within one year. amounts for which we are
31
liable under purchase orders are reflected on our consolidated balance sheet as accounts payable and accrued liabilities.where it makes economic sense to do so, weplan to leasecertainequipment during 2018to support anticipated sales growth.these operating leases are not included in the table above.
other cash obligations not reflected in the balance sheet in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states, commonly referred to as gaap, our operating leases are not recorded in our balance sheet. in addition to the lease obligations included in the above table, we have residual value guarantees on certain equipment leases. under these leases we have the option of (1)
purchasing the equipment at the end of the lease term, (2) arranging for the sale of the equipment to a third party, or (3) returning the equipment to the lessor to sell the equipment. if the sales proceeds in either case are less than the residual value, then we are required to reimburse the lessor for the deficiency up to a specified level as stated in each lease agreement. the guarantees under these leases for the residual values of equipment at the end of the respective operating lease periods approximated $5.6 million as of december 31, 2017.
based upon the expectation that none of these leased assets will have a residual value at the end of the lease term that is materially less than the value specified in the related operating lease agreement or that we will purchase the equipment at the end of the lease term, we do not believe it is probable that we will be required to fund any amounts under the terms of these guarantee arrangements. accordingly, no accruals have been recognized for these guarantees.
in addition, the company is party to certain agreements related to its lease finance obligations which commit the company to perform certain repairs and maintenance obligations under the leases in a specified manner and timeframe that generally will occur throughout the next year.
critical accounting policies and estimates critical accounting policies are those that both are important to the accurate portrayal of a company's financial condition and results, and require subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain.
in order to prepare financial statements that conform to gaap, we make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and accompanying notes. certain estimates are particularly sensitive due to their significance to the financial statements and the possibility that future events may be significantly different from our expectations.
we have identified the following accounting policy that requires us to make the most subjective or complex judgments in order to fairly present our consolidated financial position and results of operations.
goodwill. goodwill represents the excess of the amount we paid to acquire businesses over the estimated fair value of tangible assets and identifiable intangible assets acquired, less liabilities assumed. at december 31, 2017, our goodwill balance was $740.4 million, representing 24.6% of our total assets.
we test goodwill for impairment in the fourth quarter of each year or at any other time when impairment indicators exist by comparing the estimated implied value of a reporting units' goodwill to its book value. examples of such indicators that could cause us to test goodwill for impairment between annual tests include a significant change in the business climate, unexpected competition or a significant deterioration in market share. we may also consider market capitalization relative to our net assets. housing starts are a significant sales driver for us. if there is a significant decline or an expected decline in housing starts, this could adversely affect our expectations for a reporting unit and the value of that reporting unit.
in connection with our annual goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of 2017 we elected to adopt updated guidance which simplifies the accounting for goodwill impairment. this updated guidance is described in note 2to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k.
the process of evaluating goodwill for impairment involves the determination of the fair value of our reporting units. our reporting units are aligned with our nine geographic regions which are also determined to be our operating segments. in evaluating goodwill for impairment, the company first assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value. if it is concluded that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, then no further testing of the goodwill is required.
however, if we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, we perform a quantitative goodwill impairment test. this test identifies both the existence of and the amount of goodwill impairment
32
by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit toits carryingamount, including goodwill. if the fair valueof a reporting unit exceeds itscarrying amountgoodwill is not impaired. if thecarrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair valuean impairment loss is recognized in amount equal to that excess, limited to the amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.
in performing our annual impairment tests at december 31, 2017, we developed a range of fair values for our reporting units using a five-year discounted cash flow methodology. inherent in such fair value determinations are estimates relating to future cash flows, including revenue growth, gross margins, operating expenses and long-term growth rates, and our interpretation of current economic indicators and market conditions and their impact on our strategic plans and operations. due to the uncertainties associated with such estimates, interpretations and assumptions, actual results could differ from projected results, which could result in impairment of goodwill could be recorded.
significant information and assumptions utilized in estimating future cash flows for our reporting units includes projections of market share gains as well as publicly available industry information on projected single-family housing starts and lumber commodity prices which are used to project revenue. projected gross margins and operating expenses reflect current headcount levels and cost structure and are flexed in future years based upon historical trends at various revenue levels. long-term growth was based upon terminal value earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("ebitda") multiples of 5.0x for all reporting units to reflect the relevant expected acquisition price. a discount rate of 12.5% was used for all reporting units and is intended to reflect the weighted average cost of capital for a potential market participant and includes all risks of ownership and the associated risks of realizing the stream of projected future cash flows. decreasing the long-term growth to an ebitda multiple of 4.0x, or increasing the discount rate by 1.0% to 13.5%, would not have changed the results of our impairment testing.
at december 31, 2017, the fair values of each of our reporting units were substantially in excess of their respective carrying amounts. the excess (or "cushion") of the fair values over the carrying amounts of our nine reporting units ranged from $122 million to $315 million. factors that could negatively impact the estimated fair value of our reporting units and potentially trigger additional impairment include, but are not limited to, unexpected competition, lower than expected housing starts, an increase in market participant weighted average cost of capital, increases in material or labor cost, and significant declines in our market capitalization. future impairment of goodwill would have the effect of decreasing our earnings or increasing our losses in such period, but would not impact our current outstanding debt obligations or compliance with covenants contained in the related debt agreements. we did not have any goodwill impairments in 2017, 2016 or 2015.
recently issued accounting standards information regarding recent accounting pronouncements is discussed in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k.
item 7a.quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we may experience changes in interest expense if changes in our debt occur. changes in market interest rates could also affect our interest expense. our 2024 notes bear interest at a fixed rate, therefore, our interest expense related to these notes would not be affected by an increase in market interest rates. borrowings under the 2022
facility and the 2024 term loan bear interest at either a base rate or eurodollar rate, plus, in each case, an applicable margin. at december 31, 2017, a 1.0% increase in interest rates on the 2024 term loan would, subject to the interest rate floor specified in the agreement, result in approximately $4.6 million in additional interest expense annually. at december 31, 2017, a 1.0% increase in interest rates on the 2022 facility would result in approximately $3.5 million in additional interest expense annually. the 2022 facility also assesses variable commitment and outstanding letter of credit fees based on quarterly average loan utilization.
we purchase certain materials, including lumber products, which are then sold to customers as well as used as direct production inputs for our manufactured products that we deliver. short-term changes in the cost of these materials and the related in-bound freight costs, some of which are subject to significant fluctuations, are sometimes, but not always, passed on to our customers. delays in our ability to pass on material price increases to our customers can adversely impact our operating results.

in our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the company as of december 31, 2017 and 2016, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended december 31, 2017 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america. also in our opinion, the company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31, 2017, based on criteria established in internal control - integrated framework (2013) issued by the coso.
basis for opinions the company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in management's report on internal control over financial reporting appearing under item 9a. our responsibility is to express opinions on the company's consolidated financial statements and on the company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. we are a public accounting firm registered with the public company accounting oversight board (united states) ("pcaob") and are required to be independent with respect to the company in accordance with the u.s. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the securities and exchange commission and the pcaob.
we conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the pcaob. those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. we believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
definition and limitations of internal control over financial reporting a company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. a company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
35
because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

builders firstsource, inc. and subsidiaries notes to consolidated financial statements
1.description of the business builders firstsource, inc., a delaware corporation formed in 1998, is a leading supplier of building materials, manufactured components and construction services to professional contractors, sub-contractors, and consumers. the company operates 402 locations in 40 states across the united states.
in this annual report, references to the "company," "we," "our," "ours" or "us" refer to builders firstsource, inc.
and its consolidated subsidiaries (including probuild holdings llc ("probuild") as of july 31, 2015), unless otherwise stated or the context otherwise requires.
2.summary of significant accounting policies principles of consolidation the consolidated financial statements present the results of operations, financial position, and cash flows of builders firstsource, inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. all intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles ("gaap") in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. actual results could materially differ from those estimates.
estimates are used when accounting for items such as revenue, vendor rebates, allowance for returns, discounts and doubtful accounts, employee compensation programs, depreciation and amortization periods, income taxes, inventory values, insurance programs, goodwill, other intangible assets and long-lived assets.
sales recognition we recognize sales of building products upon delivery to the customer. for contracts with service elements, sales are generally recognized on the completed contract method as these contracts are usually completed within 30 days with the percentage of completion method applied to the remaining contracts with service elements. contract costs include all direct material and labor, equipment costs and those indirect costs related to contract performance.
provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are recognized in the period in which such losses are determined. prepayments for materials or services are deferred until such materials have been delivered or services have been provided. all sales recognized are net of allowances for discounts and estimated returns, based on historical experience. we present all sales tax on a net basis in our consolidated financial statements. the company records sales incentives provided to customers as a reduction of revenue.
cash and cash equivalents & checks outstanding cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on hand and all highly liquid investments with an original maturity date of three months or less. also included in cash and cash equivalents are proceeds due from credit card transactions that generally settle within two business days. we maintain cash at financial institutions in excess of federally insured limits. further, we maintain various banking relationships with different financial institutions.
accordingly, when there is a negative net book cash balance resulting from outstanding checks that had not yet been paid by any single financial institution, they are reflected in checks outstanding on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
accounts receivable we extend credit to qualified professional homebuilders and contractors, in many cases on a non-collateralized basis. accounts receivable potentially expose us to concentrations of credit risk. because our customers are dispersed among our various markets, our credit risk to any one customer or geographic economy is not significant.
41
our customer mix is a balance of large national homebuilders, regional homebuilders,local homebuildersand repair and remodeling contractors. forthe year ended december 31, 2017, our top 10 customers accounted for approximately16.0% of our sales,and no single customer accounted for more than5% of sales.
the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on management's assessment of the amount which may become uncollectible in the future and is estimated using specific review of problem accounts, overall portfolio quality, current economic conditions that may affect the borrower's ability to pay, and historical experience. accounts receivable are written off when deemed uncollectible. other receivables consist primarily of vendor rebates receivable.
we also establish reserves for credit memos and customer returns. the reserve balance was $6.8 million and $5.6
million at december 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. the activity in this reserve was not significant for each year presented.
accounts receivable consisted of the following at december 31:

inventories inventories consist principally of materials purchased for resale, including lumber, sheet goods, windows, doors and millwork, as well as certain manufactured products and are stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value. cost is determined using the weighted average method, the use of which approximates the first-in, first-out method. we accrue for shrink based on the actual historical shrink results of our most recent physical inventories adjusted, if necessary, for current economic conditions. these estimates are compared with actual results as physical inventory counts are taken and reconciled to the general ledger.
during the year, we monitor our inventory levels by market and record provisions for excess inventories based on slower moving inventory. we define potential excess inventory as the amount of inventory on hand in excess of the historical usage, excluding special order items purchased in the last six months. we then apply our judgment as to forecasted demand and other factors, including liquidation value, to determine the required adjustments to net realizable value. our inventories are generally not susceptible to technological obsolescence.
our arrangements with vendors provide for rebates of a specified amount of consideration, payable when certain measures, generally related to a stipulated level of purchases, have been achieved. we account for estimated rebates as a reduction of the prices of the vendor's inventory until the product is sold, at which time such rebates reduce cost of sales in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income
(loss). throughout the year we estimate the amount of the rebates based upon the expected level of purchases. we continually revise these estimates based on actual purchase levels.
we source products from a large number of suppliers. no materials purchased from any single supplier represented more than 8% of our total materials purchased in 2017.
shipping and handling costs handling costs incurred in manufacturing activities are included in cost of sales. all other shipping and handling costs are included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income (loss) and totaled $296.2 million, $269.8 million and $171.9 million in 2017,
2016 and 2015, respectively.
42
income taxes we account for income taxes utilizing the liability method described in the income taxes topic of the fasb accounting standards codification ("codification"). deferred income taxes are recorded to reflect consequences on future years of differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts at each year-end based on enacted tax laws and statutory tax rates applicable to the periods in which differences are expected to affect taxable earnings. we record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
warranty expense we have warranty obligations with respect to most manufactured products; however, the liability for the warranty obligations is not significant as a result of third-party inspection and acceptance processes.
debt issuance costs and debt discount loan costs are capitalized upon the issuance of long-term debt and amortized over the life of the related debt.
debt issuance costs associated with term debt are presented as a reduction to long-term debt. debt issuance costs associated with revolving debt arrangements are presented as a component of other assets. debt issuance costs incurred in connection with revolving debt arrangements are amortized using the straight-line method. debt issuance costs incurred in connection with term debt are amortized using the effective interest method. debt discount is amortized over the life of the related debt using the effective interest method. amortization of debt issuance costs and the debt discount are included in interest expense. upon changes to our debt structure, we evaluate debt issuance costs in accordance with the debt topic of the codification. we adjust debt issuance costs as necessary based on the results of this evaluation, as discussed in note 8.
property, plant and equipment property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. the estimated lives of the various classes of assets are as follows:
buildings and improvements    10 to 40 years machinery and equipment       3 to 10 years furniture and fixtures        3 to 5 years leasehold improvements        the shorter of the estimated useful life or the remaining lease term major additions and improvements are capitalized, while maintenance and repairs that do not extend the useful life of the property are charged to expense as incurred. gains or losses from dispositions of property, plant and equipment are recorded in the period incurred. we also capitalize certain costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use, including interest, provided that those costs are not research and development, and certain other criteria are met. internal use computer software costs are included in machinery and equipment and generally depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, generally three years.
we periodically evaluate the commercial and strategic operation of the land, related buildings and improvements of our facilities. in connection with these evaluations, some facilities may be consolidated, and others may be sold or leased. nonoperating assets primarily related to land and building real estate assets associated with location closures that are actively being marketed for sale within a year are classified as assets held for sale and recorded at fair value, usually the quoted market price obtained from an independent third-party less the cost to sell. until the assets are sold, an estimate of the fair value is reassessed at each reporting period. net gains or losses related to the sale of real estate and equipment or impairment adjustments related to assets held for sale are recorded as selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income (loss).
43
long-lived assets we evaluate our long-lived assets, other than goodwill, for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate, in our judgment, that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable. the determination of whether or not impairment exists is based on our estimate of undiscounted future cash flows before interest attributable to the assets as compared to the net carrying value of the assets. if impairment is indicated, the amount of the impairment recognized is determined by estimating the fair value of the assets based on estimated discounted future cash flows and recording a provision for loss if the carrying value is greater than estimated fair value. the net carrying value of assets identified to be disposed of in the future is compared to their estimated fair value, usually the quoted market price obtained from an independent third-party less the cost to sell, to determine if impairment exists. until the assets are disposed of, an estimate of the fair value is reassessed when related events or circumstances change.
insurance we have established insurance programs to cover certain insurable risks consisting primarily of physical loss to property, business interruptions resulting from such loss, workers' compensation, employee healthcare, and comprehensive general and auto liability. third party insurance coverage is obtained for exposures above predetermined deductibles as well as for those risks required to be insured by law or contract. on a quarterly basis, we engage an external actuarial professional to independently assess and estimate the total liability outstanding. provisions for losses are developed from these valuations which rely upon our past claims experience, which considers both the frequency and settlement of claims. we discount our workers' compensation liability based upon estimated future payment streams at our risk-free rate. our total insurance reserve balances were $78.0
million and $80.4 million as of december 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. of these balances $45.6 million and $43.6
million were recorded as other long-term liabilities as of december 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. included in these reserve balances as of december 31, 2017 and 2016, were approximately $8.9 million and $9.4 million, respectively, of claims that exceeded stop-loss limits and are expected to be recovered under insurance policies which are also recorded as other receivables and other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet.
net income (loss) per common share net income (loss) per common share, or earnings per share ("eps"), is calculated in accordance with the earnings per share topic of the codification which requires the presentation of basic and diluted eps. basic eps is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. diluted eps is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period, plus the dilutive effect of potential common shares.
the table below presents a reconciliation of weighted average common shares used in the calculation of basic and diluted eps for the years ended december 31:
2017       2016       2015
-in thousands weighted average shares for basic eps            112,587    110,754    103,190

weighted average shares for diluted eps          115,597    113,585    103,190
for the purpose of computing diluted eps, weighted average shares outstanding have been adjusted for common shares underlying 2,104,000 options to purchase common stock and 2,249,000 restricted stock units ("rsus") for 2017.
weighted average shares outstanding have been adjusted for common shares underlying 3,515,000 options and 2,177,000
rsus for 2016. options to purchase 4,998,000 shares of common stock and 1,516,000 rsus were not included in the computation of diluted eps for 2015 because their effect was anti-dilutive. incremental shares attributable to average warrants outstanding during 2015 were not included in the computation of diluted eps for 2015 as their effect was anti-dilutive.
goodwill and other intangible assets intangibles subject to amortization we recognize an acquired intangible asset apart from goodwill whenever the intangible asset arises from contractual or other legal rights, or whenever it can be separated or divided from the acquired entity and sold, transferred, licensed, rented, or exchanged, either individually or in combination with a related contract, asset or liability.
impairment losses are recognized if the carrying value of an intangible asset subject to amortization is not recoverable from expected future cash flows and its carrying amount exceeds its estimated fair value.
44
goodwill we recognize goodwill as the excess cost of an acquired entity over the net amount assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed. goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests whenever impairment is indicated. this annual test takes place as of december 31 each year. impairment losses are recognized whenever the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value.
stock-based compensation we have four stock-based employee compensation plans, which are described more fully in note 10. we issue new common stock shares upon exercises of stock options and vesting of rsus. we recognize the effect of pre-vesting forfeitures in the period they actually occur.
the fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using the black-scholes option-pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions for the year ended december 31:
2017         2016         2015
expected life              6.0 years    6.0 years    6.0 years expected volatility            59.2%        60.9%        75.2%
expected dividend yield        0.00%        0.00%        0.00%
risk-free rate                 2.20%        1.41%        1.75%
the expected life represents the period of time the options are expected to be outstanding. we used the simplified method for determining the expected life assumption due to limited historical exercise experience on our stock options. the expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of our common stock over the most recent period equal to the expected life of the option. the expected dividend yield is based on our history of not paying regular dividends in the past and our current intention to not pay regular dividends in the foreseeable future. the risk-free rate is based on the u.s. treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant and has a term equal to the expected life of the options.
the fair value of rsu awards subject to market conditions is estimated on the date of grant using the monte carlo simulation model with the following weighted average assumptions for the year ended december 31:
2017     2016
expected volatility (company)               73.7%    53.6%
expected volatility (peer group median)     33.8%    17.3%
correlation between the company and peer     0.33     0.47
group median expected dividend yield                     0.00%    0.00%
risk-free rate                              1.50%    1.29%
the expected volatilities and correlation are based on the historical daily returns of our common stock and the common stocks of the constituents of the company's peer group over the most recent period equal to the measurement period. the expected dividend yield is based on our history of not paying regular dividends in the past and our current intention to not pay regular dividends in the foreseeable future. the risk-free rate is based on the u.s.
treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant and has a term equal to the measurement period. we did not grant any rsus subject to market conditions in 2015.
fair value the fair value measurements and disclosures topic of the codification provides a framework for measuring the fair value of assets and liabilities and establishes a fair value hierarchy that requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. the fair value hierarchy can be summarized as follows:
level 1 - unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets accessible by us level 2 - inputs that are observable in the marketplace other than those inputs classified as level 1
level 3 - inputs that are unobservable in the marketplace and significant to the valuation if a financial instrument uses inputs that fall in different levels of the hierarchy, the instrument will be categorized based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value calculation. the only financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis were our warrants as discussed in note 8.
45
as of december 31, 2017 and 2016the company does not have any financial instruments which are measured at fair value on a recurring basis.we have elected to report the value of our 5.625% senior secured notes due 2024 ("2024
notes"),$467.7millionsenior securedterm loan facility due 2024 ("2024term loan")and $900.0 million revolving credit facility ("2022 facility") atamortized cost. the fair values ofthe 2024 notes and the 2024term loan at december 31,
2017were approximately $777.3million and $464.1million, respectively, and were determined using level 2 inputs based on market prices.the carrying value of the 2022 facility at december 31, 2017 approximates fair value as therates are comparable to those at which we could currently borrow under similar terms, are variable and incorporate a measure of our credit risk. as such, the fair value of the 2022 facility was also classified as level
2 in the hierarchy.

comprehensive income (loss)
comprehensive income (loss) is defined as the change in equity (net assets) of a business enterprise during a period from transactions and other events and circumstances from non-owner sources. it consists of net income
(loss) and other gains and losses affecting stockholders' equity that, under gaap, are excluded from net income. we had no items of other comprehensive income (loss) for the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015.
recently issued accounting pronouncements in may 2017, the financial accounting standards board ("fasb") issued an update to the existing guidance under the compensation-stock compensation topic of the accounting standards codification ("codification") to clarify when modification accounting would be applied for a change to the terms or conditions of a share-based award. under this new guidance modification accounting is required only if the fair value, the vesting conditions, or the classification of the award changes as a result of the change in terms or conditions. this guidance is required to be adopted on a prospective basis for annual periods beginning on or after december 15, 2017 with early adoption permitted. the company will adopt this guidance on january 1, 2018. as we do not regularlymodify the terms and conditions of our share-based awards we do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a significant impact on our financial statements upon adoption.
in january 2017, the fasb issued an update to the existing guidance under the intangibles-goodwill and other topic of the codification to simplify the accounting for goodwill impairment. the guidance removes step 2 of the goodwill impairment test, which requires a hypothetical purchase price allocation. a goodwill impairment will now be the amount by which a reporting unit's carrying value exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill. all of the other goodwill impairment guidance will remain largely unchanged, including the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine if a quantitative impairment test is necessary. this update is effective for annual and any interim goodwill impairment tests in fiscal years beginning after december 15, 2019.
early adoption of this guidance is permitted for annual or interim goodwill tests performed after january 1, 2017.
as such, we adopted this guidance on a prospective basis in the fourth quarter of 2017 in connection with our annual goodwill impairment test. the adoption of this guidance did not have an impact on our financial statements.
in january 2017, the fasb issued an update to the existing guidance under the business combinationstopic of the codification. this update revises the definition of a business. under this guidance when substantially all of the assets acquired are concentrated in a single asset (or group of similar assets) the assets acquired would not be considered a business. if this initial screen is met the need for further assessment is eliminated. if this screen is not met in order to be considered a business an acquisition would have to include an input and a substantive process that together significantly contribute to the ability to create outputs. this update is effective for public companies for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after december 15, 2017. early adoption of this guidance is permitted. this guidance requires prospective application following adoption. the company will adopt this guidance on january 1, 2018 and the impact on our financial statements will depend upon the occurrence of any future acquisition activity.

in march 2016, the fasb issued an update to the existing guidance under thecompensation-stock compensationtopic of the codification. this update simplifies several aspects of accounting for stock compensation including accounting for income taxes, classification of awards as liabilities or equity, forfeitures and classification on the statement of cash flows. this update was effective for public companies for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after december 15, 2016. as such, we adopted this guidance effective january 1, 2017. upon adoption the company recognized $8.9 million in previously unrecorded windfall benefits on a modified retrospective basis through a cumulative-effect adjustment to the beginning balance of our accumulated deficit. all windfalls or shortfalls are now recognized as a component of income tax expense in the period they occur. the company elected to recognize the effect of pre-vesting forfeitures as they actually occur rather than estimating forfeitures each period.
in february 2016, the fasb issued an update to the existing guidance under the leases topic of the codification.
under the new guidance, lessees will be required to recognize the following for all leases, with the exception of short-term leases, at the commencement date: (1) a lease liability, which is a lessee's obligation to make lease payments arising from a lease, measured on a discounted basis; and (2) a right-of-use asset, which is an asset that represents the lessee's right to use, or control the use of, a specified asset for the lease term. this update requires a modified retrospective transition as of the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements. this update is effective for public companies for fiscal years beginning after december
15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. the company has a significant number of leases, primarily related to real estate and rolling stock, which are accounted for as operating leases under existing guidance. while we are currently evaluating the impact of this new guidance on our financial statements, we are expecting a significant impact to our balance sheet upon adoption related to the establishment of lease liabilities and the corresponding right-of-use assets.
in july 2015, the fasb issued an update to the existing guidance under the inventorytopic of the codification. this update changes the subsequent measurement of inventory from lower of cost or market to lower of cost and net realizable value. we adopted this guidance effective january 1, 2017 on a prospective basis. the adoption of this guidance did not have an impact on our financial statements.
in may 2014, the fasb issued an update to the existing guidance under the revenue recognition topic of the codification which is a comprehensive new revenue recognition model requiring a company to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. subsequent to issuance of the original update, the fasb issued several further updates amending this new guidance. in april 2016, the fasb issued an update clarifying issues related to identifying performance obligations and licensing. in may 2016, the fasb issued an update regarding the assessment of collectability criteria, presentation of sales taxes, measurement of noncash consideration and transition guidance for completed contracts and contract modifications. the company will adopt this guidance beginning on january 1, 2018 on a modified retrospective basis. under current guidance, we recognize sales from contracts with service elements on the completed contract method when these contracts are completed within 30 days. the remaining contracts with service elements are recognized under the percentage of completion method. under this updated guidance, revenue related to our contracts with service elements will generally be recognized over time based on the extent of progress towards completion of the performance obligation because of continuous transfer of control to the customer. we have assessed and updated our business processes, systems and controls to ensure compliance with the recognition and disclosure requirements of the new standard upon adoption. the impact from adoption will primarily be associated with deferred revenue on contracts outstanding at december 31, 2017 accounted for under the completed contract method, which will be generally recognized earlier under this new guidance. the adoption of this guidance will not have a significant impact on our financial statements.
3.acquisitions on july 31, 2015, the company acquired all of the operating affiliates of probuild through the purchase of all issued and outstanding equity interests in probuild for $1.63 billion in cash, subject to certain adjustments. the purchase price was funded by the net proceeds received from the financing transactions described in note 8.
previously headquartered in denver, colorado, probuild is one of the nation's largest professional building materials suppliers. as a result of the probuild acquisition, the company has a greater diversification of products and services and a significantly improved geographic footprint.
this acquisition was accounted for by the acquisition method, and accordingly the results of operations were included in the company's consolidated financial statements from the acquisition date. the purchase price was allocated to the assets acquired based on estimated fair values at the acquisition date, with the excess of purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired recorded as goodwill.
we incurred acquisition related costs of $20.9 million related to the probuild acquisition during the year ended december 31, 2015. these costs include due diligence costs and transaction costs to complete the acquisition, and have been recognized in selling,
47
general and administrative expense in the accompanying condensed consolidated statementof operations andcomprehensive income (loss).we did not incur any acquisition costs related to this acquisitionduring the yearsended december 31,2017 and2016.
the operating results of the probuild acquisition have been included in the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income (loss) from the acquisition date through december 31, 2017. net sales and net income attributable to probuild were approximately $4,994 million and $212 million, respectively for the year ended december 31, 2017. net sales and net income attributable to probuild were approximately $4,520 million and $190
million, respectively for the year ended december 31, 2016. net sales and net income attributable to probuild were approximately $1,860 million and $50 million, respectively, for the period of august 1, 2015 through december 31,
2015. net income attributable to probuild does not include an allocation of income tax expense or of the additional interest expense incurred by the company as a result of the probuild acquisition financing transactions and is also impacted by changes in the business post-acquisition.
the following table reflects the pro forma operating results for the company which gives effect to the acquisition of probuild as if it had occurred on january 1, 2014. the pro forma results are based on assumptions that the company believes are reasonable under the circumstances. the pro forma results are not necessarily indicative of future results. the pro forma financial information includes the historical results of the company and probuild adjusted for certain items, which are described below, and does not include the effects of any synergies or cost reduction initiatives related to the acquisition of probuild.

we closely monitor trends in economic factors and their effects on operating results to determine if an impairment trigger was present that would warrant a reassessment of the recoverability of the carrying amount of goodwill prior to the required annual impairment test in accordance with the intangibles - goodwill and other topic of the codification.
the process of evaluating goodwill for impairment involves the determination of fair value of our reporting units.
inherent in such fair value determinations are certain judgments and estimates relating to future cash flows, including our interpretation of current economic indicators and market valuations and assumptions about our strategic plans with regard to our operations. due to the uncertainties associated with such estimates, actual results could differ from such estimates resulting in further impairment of goodwill.
in performing our impairment analysis, we developed a range of fair values for our reporting units using a discounted cash flow methodology. the discounted cash flow methodology establishes fair value by estimating the present value of the projected future cash flows to be generated from the reporting unit. the discount rate applied to the projected future cash flows to arrive at the present value is intended to reflect all risks of ownership and the associated risks of realizing the stream of projected future cash flows. the discounted cash flow methodology uses our projections of financial performance for a five-year period. the most significant assumptions used in the discounted cash flow methodology are the discount rate, the terminal value and the expected future revenues, gross margins and operating expenses, which vary among reporting units. significant assumptions used in our financial projections include housing starts, lumber commodity prices, and market share gains.
we recorded no goodwill impairment charges in 2017, 2016, and 2015.

net of current maturities probuild acquisition financing as described in note 3, we acquired all of the operating affiliates of probuild on july 31, 2015 through the purchase of all issued and outstanding equity interests of probuild for $1.63 billion in cash, subject to certain adjustments. the purchase price was funded with the net cash proceeds from (i) the sale of $700.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 10.75% senior unsecured notes due 2023 (the "2023 notes"), (ii) entry into a $600.0
million term loan credit agreement (the "2015 term loan"), (iii) a $295.0 million draw on an amended and restated
$800.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility (the "2015 facility"), and (iv) a public offering of 9.2
million new shares of our common stock at an offering price of $12.80 per share (the "equity offering").
in connection with the financing transactions described above, we incurred approximately $65.0 million of various third-party fees and expenses. of these costs, $18.1 million were allocated to the 2023 notes, $16.0 million were allocated to the 2015 term loan, $11.2 million were allocated to the 2015 facility and $6.5 million were allocated to the equity offering. the costs allocated to the 2023 notes and the 2015 term loan were recorded as reductions to long-term debt. the costs allocated to the 2015 facility were recorded as other assets. the costs allocated to the equity offering were recorded as a reduction to additional paid-in capital. in addition, $13.2 million in costs relate to commitment fees paid for bridge and backstop financing facilities entered into in connection with these financing transactions, neither of which was utilized. as such, these fees were recorded as interest expense for the year ended december 31, 2015. at the closing of these transactions, there were approximately $3.0 million in unamortized debt issuance costs associated with our previous revolving credit facility, of which approximately $0.9
million were recorded as interest expense for the year ended december 31, 2015. the remaining $2.1 million in unamortized costs associated with our previous revolving credit facility were carried over to the 2015 facility.
2016 debt transactions during the year ended december 31, 2016, the company executed several debt transactions which are described in more detail below. these transactions include two debt exchanges, complete extinguishment of our 7.625% senior secured notes due 2021 (the "2021 notes"), repricing and partially repaying our 2015 term loan and a cash tender offer in which we further reduced the aggregate principal amount of outstanding 2023 notes.
note exchange transactions on february 12, 2016, we completed separate privately negotiated note exchange transactions in which $218.6 million in aggregate principal amount of our 2023 notes was exchanged for $207.6 million in aggregate principal amount of our previously outstanding 2021 notes. on february 29, 2016, we completed additional separate privately negotiated note exchange transactions in which $63.8 million in aggregate principal amount of our 2023 notes was exchanged for
$60.0 million in aggregate principal amount of our previously outstanding 2021 notes.
the note exchange transactions were considered to be debt extinguishments. as such, we recognized a net gain of
$7.8 million which was recorded as an offset to interest expense in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income (loss) for the year ended december 31, 2016. of this $7.8 million gain, $14.8
million was attributable to the reduction in outstanding principal which was partially offset by the write-off of
$7.0 million of unamortized debt issuance costs associated with the 2023 notes which were extinguished in the exchange transactions.
51
in connection with issuance of the 2021 notes in the exchange transactions, we incurred $4.9 million of various third-party fees and expenses. these costs werepreviously recorded as a reduction to long-term debt and were subsequently written off to interest expense in the third quarter of 2016 in connection with the extinguishment of the 2021 notes as described in the "2016 refinancing transactions" section below.
note redemption transaction in may 2016, the company exercised its contractual right to redeem $35.0 million in aggregate principal amount of
2021 notes at a price of 103.0%, plus accrued and unpaid interest. the redemption transaction was considered to be a debt extinguishment. as such, we recognized a loss of $1.7 million which was recorded as a component of interest expense in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income (loss) for the year ended december 31, 2016. of this $1.7 million loss,$1.1 million was attributable to the payment of the redemption premium and $0.6 million was attributable to the write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs associated with the redeemed notes.
2016 refinancing transactions in august 2016, we completed a private offering of $750.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 5.625% senior secured notes due 2024 ("2024 notes") at an issue price equal to 100% of their face value. at the same time the company also repriced its 2015 term loan. this repricing lowered the applicable margin to 3.75% in the case of eurodollar loans and 2.75% in the case of base rate loans. this reduction represents a 1.25% decrease in the applicable margin for both eurodollar and base rate loans. in connection with the repricing, the mandatory quarterly principal repayments were reduced from $1.375 million to $1.175 million.
the proceeds from the issuance of the 2024 notes were used, together with cash on hand and borrowings on the 2015
facility, to fully redeem the $582.6 million in aggregate outstanding principal amount of 2021 notes, to pay down
$125.9 million of the 2015 term loan and to pay related transaction fees and expenses.
the redemption of the 2021 notes was considered to be a debt extinguishment. as such, we recognized a loss of $43.9
million which was recorded as a component of interest expense in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income (loss) for the year ended december 31, 2016. of this $43.9 million loss,$33.3
million was attributable to the payment of the redemption premium and $10.6 million was attributable to the write-
off of unamortized debt issuance costs associated with the redeemed notes. in addition, in connection with the repricing and pay down of the 2015 term loan we recognized $8.2 million in interest expense in the third quarter of
2016 related to the write-off of unamortized debt discount and debt issuance costs.
in connection with the issuance of the 2024 notes and the 2015 term loan repricing, we incurred approximately $12.0
million of various third-party fees and expenses. of these costs $10.5 million were allocated to the 2024 notes and have been recorded as a reduction to long-term debt. these costs are being amortized over the contractual life of the 2024 notes using the effective interest method. the remaining $1.5 million in costs incurred were allocated to the 2015 term loan. of this $1.5 million, $1.2 million was recorded to interest expense in the third quarter of
2016. the remaining $0.3 million of new third-party costs together with $10.9 million in remaining unamortized debt discount and debt issuance costs have been recorded as a reduction of long-term debt and are being be amortized over the remaining contractual life of the 2015 term loan using the effective interest method.
tender offer in october 2016, we purchased $50.0 million in aggregate principal amount of our 2023 notes pursuant to the terms of a cash tender offer at a price of 117.0% of par value plus accrued and unpaid interest. the purchase of the 2023
notes was funded with cash on hand and borrowings under our 2015 facility.
the tender offer transaction was considered to be a debt extinguishment. as such, we recognized a loss on extinguishment of $9.7 million which was recorded as a component of interest expense in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income (loss) for the year ended december 31, 2016. of this loss, approximately $8.5 million was attributable to the purchase premium paid to the lenders and $1.2 million was attributable to the write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs associated with the redeemed notes. in addition to the loss described above, we incurred approximately $0.1 million in third party costs which were recorded to selling, general, and administrative expense in the fourth quarter of 2016.
2017 debt transactions during the year ended december 31, 2017, the company executed several debt transactions which are described in more detail below. these transactions included a repricing and extension of the 2015 term loan as well as increasing the borrowing capacity and
52
extending the maturity of our 2015 facility and the complete extinguishment of our 2023 notes. our 2017 and 2016
debt transactions have extended our debt maturity profile and reduced our annual cash interest on a go forward basis.
term loan amendment on february 23, 2017, we repriced our 2015 term loan through an amendment and extension of the term loan credit agreement providing for a $467.7 million senior secured term loan facility due 2024 ("2024 term loan"). this repricing reduces the interest rate by 0.75% and extends the maturity by 19 months to february 29, 2024. deutsche bank ag new york branch continues to serve as administrative agent and collateral agent under the 2024 term loan agreement.
in connection with the 2024 term loan amendment we recognized $0.4 million in interest expense for the year ended december 31, 2017 related to the write-off of unamortized debt discount and debt issuance costs. we incurred $1.2
million in lender fees which, together with $10.0 million in remaining unamortized debt discount and debt issuance costs, have been recorded as a reduction of long-term debt and are being amortized over the remaining contractual life of the 2024 term loan using the effective interest method. in addition, we also incurred $1.4 million in various third-party fees and expenses related to the 2024 term loan amendment which were recorded to interest expense for the year ended december 31, 2017.
revolving credit facility amendment on march 22, 2017, the company extended the maturity date and increased the revolving commitments under its 2015
facility. this transaction resulted in an amended and restated $900.0 million revolving credit facility ("2022
facility") and extended the maturity by 20 months to march 22, 2022. suntrust bank continues to serve as administrative agent and collateral agent under the 2022 facility agreement. all other material terms of the 2022
facility remain unchanged from those of the 2015 facility.
in connection with the 2022 facility amendment, we recognized $0.6 million in interest expense for the year ended december 31, 2017 related to the write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs. we incurred $1.6 million in lender and third-party fees which, together with $8.5 million in remaining unamortized debt issuance costs, have been recorded as other assets and are being amortized over the remaining contractual life of the 2022 facility on a straight-line basis.
2023 notes redemption in december 2017, the company exercised its contractual right to redeem $367.6 million in aggregate principal amount of 2023 notes at a total redemption price of 113.249%, plus accrued and unpaid interest. the redemption of the 2023 notes was funded with a combination of borrowings under the 2022 facility and cash on hand.
the redemption of the 2023 notes was considered to be a debt extinguishment. as such, we recognized a loss on extinguishment of $56.3 million which was recorded as a component of interest expense in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income (loss) for the year ended december 31, 2017. of this
$56.3 million loss,$48.7 million was attributable to the payment of the redemption premium and $7.6 million was attributable to the write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs associated with the redeemed notes.
2024 term loan credit agreement as of december 31, 2017, we have $463.0 million outstanding under the 2024 term loan, which matures on february 29,
2024. the 2024 term loan bears interest based on either a eurodollar or base rate (a rate equal to the highest of an agreed commercially available benchmark rate, the federal funds effective rate plus 0.50% or the eurodollar rate plus 1.0%, as selected by the company) plus, in each case, an applicable margin. the applicable margin in the 2024
term loan is (x) 3% in the case of eurodollar rate loans and (y) 2% in the case of base rate loans. the 2024 term loan has mandatory principal repayments of $1.175 million which are payable in march, june, september, and december of each year provided that each such payment is subject to reduction as a result of certain prepayments of the loans in accordance with the loan documentation. the weighted average interest rate of the term loan was 4.3%
during the year ended december 31, 2017.
2022 revolving credit facility the 2022 facility provides for a $900.0 million revolving credit line to be used for working capital, general corporate purposes and funding acquisitions. in addition, we may use the 2022 facility to facilitate debt repayment and consolidation. the available borrowing capacity, or borrowing base, is derived from a percentage of the company's eligible receivables and inventory, as defined by the agreement, subject to certain reserves. as of december 31, 2017, we had $350.0 million in outstanding borrowings under our 2022 facility and our net excess borrowing availability was $436.8 million after being reduced by outstanding letters of credit of
53
approximately $84.9 million.duringthe year ended december 31, 2017, we borrowed $1,370.0million and repaid
$1,020.0million at a weighted average interest rate of2.9%.the 2022facility matures onmarch 22, 2022.
borrowings under the 2022 facility bear interest, at our option, at either a eurodollar rate or a base rate, plus, in each case an applicable margin. the applicable margin ranges from 1.25% to 1.75% per annum in the case of eurodollar rate loans and 0.25% to 0.75% per annum in the case of base rate loans. the margin in either case is based on a measure of availability under the 2022 facility. a variable commitment fee, currently 0.375% per annum, is charged on the unused amount of the revolver based on quarterly average loan utilization. letters of credit under the 2022 facility are assessed at a rate equal to the applicable eurodollar margin, currently 1.25%, as well as a fronting fee at a rate of 0.125% per annum. these fees are payable quarterly in arrears at the end of march, june, september, and december.
all obligations under the 2024 term loan and 2022 facility will be guaranteed jointly and severally by the company and all other subsidiaries that guarantee the 2024 notes. all obligations and the guarantees of those obligations will be secured by substantially all of the assets of the company and the guarantors subject to certain exceptions and permitted liens, including (i) with respect to the 2024 term loan, a first-priority security interest in such assets that constitute notes collateral (as defined below) and a second priority security interest in such assets that constitute abl collateral (as defined below), and (ii) with respect to the 2022 facility, a first-priority security interest in such assets that constitute abl collateral and a second-priority security interest in such assets that constitute notes collateral.
"abl collateral" includes substantially all presently owned and after-acquired accounts receivable, inventory, rights of unpaid vendors with respect to inventory, deposit accounts, commodity accounts, securities accounts and lock boxes, investment property, cash and cash equivalents, and general intangibles, books and records, supporting obligations and documents and related letters of credit, commercial tort claims or other claims related to and proceeds of each of the foregoing. "notes collateral" includes all collateral which is not abl collateral.

$87.2 million as of december 31, 2017.
senior secured notes due 2024
as of december 31, 2017 we have $750.0 million outstanding in aggregate principal amount of the 2024 notes which mature on september 1, 2024. interest accrues on the 2024 notes at a rate of 5.625% per annum and is payable semi-
annually on march 1 and september 1 of each year.
the terms of the 2024 notes are governed by the indenture, dated as of august 22, 2016 (the "indenture"), among the company, the guarantors named therein (the "guarantors") and wilmington trust, national association, as trustee
(the "trustee") and notes collateral agent (the "notes collateral agent"). the 2024 notes, subject to certain exceptions, are guaranteed, jointly and severally, on a senior secured basis, by certain of our direct and indirect wholly owned subsidiaries. all obligations under the 2024 notes, and the guarantees of those obligations, are secured by substantially all of the assets of the company and the guarantors subject to certain exceptions and permitted liens, including a first-priority security interest in such assets that constitute notes collateral (as defined above) and a second-priority security interest in such assets that constitute abl collateral (as defined above).
the notes collateral agent became a party to the abl/bond intercreditor agreement, dated as of may 29, 2013, among suntrust bank, as agent under the company's 2022 facility, the wilmington trust, national association, the company and the guarantors, and the pari passu intercreditor agreement, dated as of july 31, 2015, among deutsche bank ag new york branch, as term collateral agent under the company's 2024 term loan, wilmington trust, national association, the company and the guarantors. these documents govern all arrangements in respect of the priority of the security interests in the abl collateral and the notes collateral among the parties to the indenture, the 2022
facility and the 2024 term loan. the 2024 notes constitute senior secured obligations of the company and guarantors, rank senior in right of payment to all future debt of the company and guarantors that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the 2024 notes, and rank equally in right of payment with all existing and future liabilities of the company and guarantors that are not so subordinated, including the 2022 facility.

warrants our previous term loan included detachable warrants that allowed for the purchase of up to 1.6 million shares of our common stock at a price of $2.50 per share. in april 2015, the remaining 0.7 million of outstanding, detachable warrants were exercised. the warrants were considered to be derivative financial instruments and were classified as liabilities. as such, they were measured at fair value on a recurring basis. our share price and, to a lesser extent, the historical volatility of our common stock were the primary factors in the changes to our fair value measurements related to the warrants. all other inputs being equal, an increase or decrease in our share price or volatility resulted in an increase or decrease in the fair value of our warrants and an increase or decrease in interest expense.
non-cash fair value adjustments related to our derivative financial instrument recorded as interest expense in the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income (loss) for the years ended december 31 (in thousands)
were as follows:
derivative not designated               location of loss                amount of loss as hedging               recognized in income            recognized in income instruments

we used the income approach to value our warrants by using the black-scholes option-pricing model. using this model, the risk-free interest rate was based on the u.s. treasury yield curve in effect on the valuation date. the expected life was based on the period of time until the expiration of the warrants. expected volatility was based on the historical volatility of our common stock over the most recent period equal to the expected life of the warrants. the expected dividend yield was based on our history of not paying regular dividends in the past.
these techniques incorporated level 1 and level 2 inputs. significant inputs to the derivative valuation for the warrants were observable in the active markets and are classified as level 2 in the hierarchy.

lease finance obligations the company is party to 141 individual property lease agreements with a single lessor as of december 31, 2017.
these lease agreements have initial terms ranging from nine to fifteen years (expiring through 2021) and renewal options in five-year increments providing for up to approximately 30-year remaining total lease terms. a related agreement between the lessor and the company gives the company the right to acquire a limited number of the leased facilities at fair market value. as a result of these purchase rights, the company treats all of the properties that it leases from this lessor as a financing arrangement. the company is also party to certain additional agreements with the same lessor which commit the company to perform certain repair and maintenance obligations under the leases in a specified manner and timeframe.
in 2006, we completed construction on a new multi-purpose facility. based on the evaluation of the construction project in accordance with the leases topic of the codification, we were deemed the owner of the facility during the construction period. effectively, a sale and leaseback of the facility occurred when construction was completed and the lease term began. this transaction did not qualify for sale-leaseback accounting. as a result the company treats the lease of this facility as a financing arrangement.
as of december 31, 2017, lease finance obligations consist of $225.1 million, with cash payments of $22.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2017. these lease finance obligations are included on the consolidated balance sheet as a component of long-term debt and lease obligations. the related assets are recorded as components of property, plant, and equipment on the consolidated balance sheet.

as discussed in note 2 the company adopted updated guidance related to the accounting for stock compensation in
2017. as a result of this updated guidance all windfalls and shortfalls are now recognized as a component of income tax expense in the period they occur.
on december 22, 2017, the president signed into law the 2017 tax act, which includes a broad range of tax reform proposals affecting businesses, including corporate tax rates and business deductions. the 2017 tax act reduces the statutory federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% for periods beginning after december 31, 2017. the income taxes topic of the codification requires that the effect of a tax rate change on deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized in the period the rate change was enacted. as such, we recorded income tax expense of
$29.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2017 related to the revaluation of our net deferred tax assets. we do not expect the 2017 tax act to impact the realizability of our deferred tax assets. there were no other material impacts recognized or unrecognized for the year ended december 31, 2017 as a result of the enactment of the 2017
tax act.
at december 31, 2017 and 2016, the company had deferred tax assets, net of deferred tax liabilities, of $77.5
million and $120.1 million, respectively, offset by valuation allowances of $2.4 million and $4.8 million, respectively. we have $338.5 million of state net operating loss carryforwards and $2.8 million of state tax credit carryforwards expiring at various dates through 2037. we also have $190.8 million of federal net operating loss carryforwards and $11.4 million of federal tax credit carryforwards expiring at various dates through 2037. as of december 31, 2017, the company needed to generate approximately $281.4 million of pre-tax income in future periods to realize its federal deferred tax assets.
60
we evaluate our deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis to determine whether a valuation allowance is required. in accordance with theincome taxestopic of the codification we assess whether it is more likely than not that some or all of our deferred tax assets will not be realized. significant judgment is required in estimating valuation allowances for deferred tax assets and in making this determination, we consider all available positive and negative evidence and make certain assumptions. the realization of a deferred tax asset ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income in the applicable carryback or carryforward periods. weconsider nature, frequency, and severity of current and cumulative losses, as well as historical and forecasted financial results, the overall business environment, our industry's historic cyclicality, the reversal of existing deferred tax liabilities, andtax planning strategies in our assessment. changes in our estimates of future taxable income and tax planning strategies will affect our estimate of the realization of the tax benefits of these tax carryforwards.
we recorded a full valuation allowance in 2008 due to our cumulative three year loss position at that time, compounded by the negative industry-wide business trends and outlook. we remained in a cumulative three year loss position until the second quarter of 2016. in the third quarter of 2016, management determined that there was sufficient positive evidence to conclude that it was more likely than not that the valuation allowance should be released against our net federal and some state deferred tax assets. as a result, for the year ended december 31,
2016 we recorded a cumulative reduction to the valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets of $131.7
million. during 2017, as a result of various activities and tax initiatives that impacted our assessment of the future utilization and realizability of our state net operating losses ("nols") we recorded a reduction to the associated valuation allowance of $2.8 million for the year ended december 31, 2017. for the year ended december
31, 2015, we recorded a valuation allowance of $9.7 million related to our continuing operations.
section 382 of the internal revenue code imposes annual limitations on the utilization of nol carryforwards, other tax carryforwards, and certain built-in losses upon an ownership change as defined under that section. in general terms, an ownership change may result from transactions that increase the aggregate ownership of certain stockholders in the company's stock by more than 50 percentage points over a three year testing period ("section
382 ownership change"). in 2017, affiliates of a significant shareholder sold their investment in the company, which triggered a section 382 ownership change. as a result of triggering a section 382 ownership change, an annual limitation is now imposed on the company's tax attributes, including its nols and other credits. the company has evaluated the impact of this limitation on its nols and other credits and does not expect it to have a material impact on their future utilization or realizability.
we base our estimate of deferred tax assets and liabilities on current tax laws and rates. in certain cases, we also base our estimate on business plan forecasts and other expectations about future outcomes. changes in existing tax laws or rates could affect our actual tax results, and future business results may affect the amount of our deferred tax liabilities or the valuation of our deferred tax assets over time. due to uncertainties in the estimation process, particularly with respect to changes in facts and circumstances in future reporting periods, as well as the residential homebuilding industry's cyclicality and sensitivity to changes in economic conditions, it is possible that actual results could differ from the estimates used in previous analyses.
accounting for deferred taxes is based upon estimates of future results. differences between the anticipated and actual outcomes of these future results could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position.
the following table shows the changes in our valuation allowance:

the balance for uncertain tax positions, excluding penalties and interest, was $0.3 million, $0.2 million and
$0.2million as of december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively with no significant impact recorded in the company's consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income (loss) for the years ended december 31,
2017, 2016 or 2015.we accrue interestand penalties on our uncertain tax positions as a component of our provision for income taxes. we accruedno significantinterest and penalties in 2017, 2016or2015.
we are subject to u.s. federal income tax as well as income tax of multiple state jurisdictions. based on completed examinations and the expiration of statutes of limitations, we have concluded all u.s. federal income tax matters for years through 2013. we report in 41 states with various years open to examination.
12.employee benefit plans we maintain one active defined contribution 401(k) plan. our employees are eligible to participate in the plans subject to certain employment eligibility provisions. participants can contribute up to 75% of their annual compensation, subject to federally mandated maximums. participants are immediately vested in their own contributions. we match a certain percentage of the contributions made by participating employees, subject to irs limitations. our matching contributions are subject to a pro-rata five-year vesting schedule. we recognized expense of $4.6 million, $4.6 million and $6.5 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, for contributions to the plan.
the company contributes to multiple collectively bargained union retirement plans including multiemployer plans.
the company does not administer the multiemployer plans, and contributions are determined in accordance with the provisions of negotiated labor contracts. the risks of participating in multiemployer plans are different from single-employer plans. assets contributed to the multiemployer plan by one employer may be used to provide benefits to employees of other participating employers. if a participating employer stops contributing to a multiemployer plan, the unfunded obligations of that multiemployer plan may be borne by the remaining participating employers. if the company chooses to stop participating in a multiemployer plan, the company may be required to pay that plan an amount ("withdrawal liability") based on the plan's formula and the underfunded status of the plan attributable to the company. contributions to the plans for the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 were not significant.
13.commitments and contingencies we lease certain land, buildings and equipment used in operations. these leases are generally accounted for as operating leases with initial terms ranging from one to 20 years and they generally contain renewal options.
certain operating leases are subject to contingent rentals based on various measures, primarily consumer price index increases. we also lease certain properties from related parties, including current employees and non-
affiliate stockholders. total rent expense under operating leases was approximately $77.9 million, $68.7 million and $43.6 million for the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively.
in addition, we have residual value guarantees on certain equipment leases. under these leases we have the option of (a) purchasing the equipment at the end of the lease term, (b) arranging for the sale of the equipment to a third party, or (c) returning the equipment to the lessor to sell the equipment. if the sales proceeds in any case are less than the residual value, we are required to reimburse the lessor for the deficiency up to a specified level as stated in each lease agreement. if the sales proceeds exceed the residual value, we are entitled to all of such excess amounts. the guarantees under these leases for the residual values of equipment at the end of the respective operating lease periods approximated $5.6 million as of december 31, 2017. based upon the expectation that none of these leased assets will have a residual value at the end of the lease term that is materially less than the value specified in the related operating lease agreement or that we will purchase the equipment at the end of the lease term, we do not believe it is probable that we will be required to fund any amounts under the terms of these guarantee arrangements. accordingly, no accruals have been recognized for these guarantees.

as of december 31, 2017, we had outstanding letters of credit totaling $84.9 million under our 2022 facility that principally support our self-insurance programs.
the company has a number of known and threatened construction defect legal claims. while these claims are generally covered under the company's existing insurance programs to the extent any loss exceeds the deductible, there is a reasonable possibility of loss that is not able to be estimated at this time because (i) many of the proceedings are in the discovery stage, (ii) the outcome of future litigation is uncertain, and/or (iii) the complex nature of the claims. although the company cannot estimate a reasonable range of loss based on currently available information, the resolution of these matters could have a material adverse effect on the company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
in addition, we are involved in various other claims and lawsuits incidental to the conduct of our business in the ordinary course. we carry insurance coverage in such amounts in excess of our self-insured retention as we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances and that may or may not cover any or all of our liabilities in respect of such claims and lawsuits. although the ultimate disposition of these other proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty, management believes the outcome of any such claims that are pending or threatened, either individually or on a combined basis, will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, cash flows or results of operations. however, there can be no assurances that future adverse judgments and costs would not be material to our results of operations or liquidity for a particular period.
14.segment and product information we offer an integrated solution to our customers providing manufacturing, supply, and installation of a full range of structural and related building products. we provide a wide variety of building products and services directly to homebuilder customers. we manufacture floor trusses, roof trusses, wall panels, stairs, millwork, windows, and doors. we also provide a full range of construction services. these product and service offerings are distributed across 402 locations operating in 40 states across the united states, which have been organized into nine geographical regions. centralized financial and operational oversight, including resource allocation and assessment of performance on an income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes basis, is performed by our ceo, whom we have determined to be our chief operating decision maker ("codm").
the company has nine operating segments aligned with its nine geographical regions (regions 1 through 9). while all of our operating segments have similar nature of products, distribution methods and customers, certain of our operating segments have been aggregated due to also containing similar economic characteristics, resulting in the following composition of reportable segments:
•  regions 1 and 2 have been aggregated to form the "northeast" reportable segment
•  regions 3 and 5 have been aggregated to form the "southeast" reportable segment
•  regions 4 and 6 have been aggregated to form the "south" reportable segment
•  region 7, 8 and 9 have been aggregated to form the "west" reportable segment in addition to our reportable segments, our consolidated results include corporate overhead, other various operating activities that are not internally allocated to a geographical region nor separately reported to the codm, and certain reconciling items primarily related to allocations of corporate overhead and rent expense, which have collectively been presented as "all other". the accounting policies of the segments are consistent with those described in note 2, except for noted reconciling items.

item 9a.controls and procedures disclosure controls evaluation and related ceo and cfo certifications.our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer ("ceo") and principal financial officer ("cfo") conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this annual report.
certifications of our ceo and our cfo, which are required in accordance with rule 13a-14 of the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended ("exchange act"), are attached as exhibits to this annual report. this "controls and procedures" section includes the information concerning the controls evaluation referred to in the certifications, and it should be read in conjunction with the certifications for a more complete understanding of the topics presented.
limitations on the effectiveness of controls.we do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all errors and all fraud. a system of controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the system are met. because of the limitations in all such systems, no evaluation can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the company have been detected. furthermore, the design of any system of controls and procedures is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions, regardless of how unlikely. because of these inherent limitations in a cost-effective system of controls and procedures, misstatements or omissions due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.
scope of the controls evaluation.the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures included a review of their objectives and design, the company's implementation of the controls and procedures and the effect of the controls and procedures on the information generated for use in this annual report. in the course of the evaluation, we sought to identify whether we had any data errors, control problems or acts of fraud and to confirm that appropriate corrective action, including process improvements, were being undertaken if needed. this type of evaluation is performed on a quarterly basis so that conclusions concerning the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures can be reported in our quarterly reports on form 10-q. many of the components of our disclosure controls and procedures are also evaluated by our internal audit department, our legal department and by personnel in our finance organization. the overall goals of these various evaluation activities are to monitor our disclosure controls and procedures on an ongoing basis, and to maintain them as dynamic systems that change as conditions warrant.
conclusions regarding disclosure controls.based on the required evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures, our ceo and cfo have concluded that, as of december 31, 2017, we maintained disclosure controls and procedures that were effective in providing reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the exchange act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the sec's rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our ceo and cfo, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
management's report on internal control over financial reporting.our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in rule 13a-15(f) of the exchange act. internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("gaap"). internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with existing policies or procedures may deteriorate.
66
under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our ceo andcfo, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework set forth ininternal control- integrated framework(2013)issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission. based on our evaluation under the framework set forth ininternal control - integrated framework(2013), our management concluded that ourinternal control over financial reporting was effective as of december 31, 2017.
the effectiveness of the company's internal control over financial reporting as of december 31, 2017, has been audited by pricewaterhousecoopers llp, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears herein.
changes in internal control over financial reporting.during the quarter ended december 31, 2017, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

we offer an integrated solution to our customers providing manufacturing, supply and installation of a full range of structural and related building products. our manufactured products include our factory-built roof and floor trusses, wall panels and stairs, vinyl windows, custom millwork and trim, as well as engineered wood that we design, cut, and assemble for each home. we also assemble interior and exterior doors into pre-hung units. additionally, we supply our customers with a broad offering of professional grade building products not manufactured by us, such as dimensional lumber and lumber sheet goods and various window, door and millwork lines. our full range of construction-related services includes professional installation, turn-key framing and shell construction, and spans all our product categories.
we group our building products into six product categories:
•   lumber &amp; lumber sheet goods. lumber &amp; lumber sheet goods include dimensional lumber, plywood, and osb products used in on-site house framing.

•   manufactured products. manufactured products consist of wood floor and roof trusses, steel roof trusses, wall panels, stairs, and engineered wood.

•   windows, door &amp; millwork. windows &amp; doors are comprised of the manufacturing, assembly, and distribution of windows and the assembly and distribution of interior and exterior door units. millwork includes interior trim and custom features that we manufacture under the synboard ® brand name.

•   gypsum, roofing &amp; insulation. gypsum, roofing, &amp; insulation include wallboard, ceilings, joint treatment and finishes.

•   siding, metal, and concrete. siding, metal, and concrete includes vinyl, composite, and wood siding, exterior trim, other exteriors, metal studs and cement.

•   other building products &amp; services. other building products &amp; services are comprised of products such as cabinets and hardware as well as services such as turn-key framing, shell construction, design assistance, and professional installation spanning the majority of our product categories.

our operating results are dependent on the following trends, events and uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control:
•   homebuilding industry. our business is driven primarily by the residential new construction market and the residential repair and remodel market, which are in turn dependent upon a number of factors, including demographic trends, interest rates, consumer confidence, employment rates, foreclosure rates, the availability of skilled construction labor, and the health of the economy and mortgage markets. according to the u.s. census bureau, annual u.s. total and single-family housing starts were 1,202,900 and 848,900, respectively, in 2017. however, both total and single-family housing starts remain well below the normalized historical averages (from 1959 through 2017) of 1.5 million and 1.1 million, respectively. we believe the housing industry is currently experiencing a shortage of skilled construction labor, which is constraining housing activity. due to the lower levels in housing starts and increased competition for homebuilder business, we have seen and may continue to experience downward competitive pressure on our gross margins. in addition to these factors, there has been a trend of consolidation within the building products supply industry. however, our industry remains highly fragmented and competitive and we will continue to face significant competition from local and regional suppliers. we still believe there are several meaningful trends that indicate u.s. housing demand will recover to the historical average in the long term and that the downturn in the housing industry was a trough in the cyclical nature of the residential construction industry. these trends include relatively low interest rates, the aging of housing stock, and normal population growth due to immigration and birthrate exceeding death rate. industry forecasters, including the

24
national association of homebuilders ("nahb"), expect to see continued improvement in housing demand over the next few years.

•   targeting large production homebuilders. over the past ten years, the homebuilding industry has undergone consolidation, and the larger homebuilders have increased their market share. we expect that trend to continue as larger homebuilders have better liquidity and land positions relative to the smaller, less capitalized homebuilders. our focus is on maintaining relationships and market share with these customers while balancing the competitive pressures we are facing in servicing large homebuilders with certain profitability expectations. we expect that our ability to maintain strong relationships with the largest builders will be vital to our ability to expand into new markets as well as grow our market share. additionally, we have been successful in expanding our custom homebuilder base while maintaining acceptable credit standards.

•   repair and remodel end market. although the repair and remodel end market is influenced by housing starts to a lesser degree than the homebuilding market, the repair and remodel end market is still dependent upon some of the same factors as the homebuilding market, including demographic trends, interest rates, consumer confidence, employment rates, foreclosure rates, and the health of the economy and home financing markets. we expect that our ability to remain competitive in this space as well as grow our market share will depend on our continued ability to provide a high level of customer service coupled with a broad product offering.

•   use of prefabricated components. homebuilders are increasingly using prefabricated components in order to realize increased efficiency and improved quality. shortening cycle time from start to completion is a key imperative of the homebuilders during periods of strong consumer demand. while the conversion of customers to this product offering slowed during the downturn, we see the demand for prefabricated components increasing as the residential new construction market continues to strengthen and the availability of skilled construction labor remains limited.

•   economic conditions. economic changes both nationally and locally in our markets impact our financial performance. the building products supply industry is highly dependent upon new home construction and subject to cyclical market changes. our operations are subject to fluctuations arising from changes in supply and demand, national and local economic conditions, labor costs and availability, competition, government regulation, trade policies and other factors that affect the homebuilding industry such as demographic trends, interest rates, housing starts, the availability of suitable building lots, employment levels, consumer confidence, and the availability of credit to homebuilders, contractors, and homeowners.

•   cost of materials. prices of wood products, which are subject to cyclical market fluctuations, may adversely impact operating income when prices rapidly rise or fall within a relatively short period of time. we purchase certain materials, including lumber products, which are then sold to customers as well as used as direct production inputs for our manufactured and prefabricated products. short-term changes in the cost of these materials, some of which are subject to significant fluctuations, are sometimes passed on to our customers, but our pricing quotation periods may limit our ability to pass on such price changes. we may also be limited in our ability to pass on increases on in-bound freight costs on our products. our inability to pass on material price increases to our customers could adversely impact our operating results.

•   controlling expenses. another important aspect of our strategy is controlling costs and striving to be the low-cost building materials supplier in the markets we serve. we pay close attention to managing our working capital and operating expenses. further, we pay careful attention to our logistics function and its effect on our shipping and handling costs.

•   multi-family and light commercial business. our primary focus has been, and continues to be, on single-family residential new construction and the repair and remodel end market. however, we will continue to identify opportunities for profitable growth in the multi-family and light commercial markets.

•   reduction of debt: as a result of our historical growth through acquisitions, we have substantial indebtedness. debt reduction will continue to be a key area of focus for the company.

recent developments during the year ended december 31, 2017, the company executed three debt transactions which are described in note 8 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k. these transactions further extended our debt maturity profile and reduced our annual cash interest on a go forward basis.
on december 22, 2017, the 2017 tax act became enacted law. the effects of the 2017 tax act on our financial statements for the year ended december 31, 2017 are discussed in more detail below as well as in note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k.  the 2017 tax act, among several other substantial changes, reduces the statutory federal income tax rate from 35% to 21% for periods beginning after december 31, 2017. we generally expect the 2017 tax act to have a positive impact on our business due to the anticipated reduction in federal cash tax payments.

current operating conditions and outlook though the level of housing starts remains below the historical average, the homebuilding industry has shown improvement since 2011. according to the u.s. census bureau, actual u.s. total housing starts for 2017 were 1,202,900, an increase of 2.5% compared to 2016. actual u.s. single-family housing starts for 2017 were 848,900, an increase of 8.6% compared to 2016. while the housing industry has strengthened over the past few years, the limited availability of credit to smaller homebuilders and potential homebuyers, as well as the high demand for a limited supply of skilled construction labor, among other factors, have hampered a stronger recovery. a composite of third party sources, including the nahb, are forecasting 1,292,000 u.s. total housing starts and 921,000 u.s. single-family housing starts for 2018, which are increases of 7.4% and 8.5%, respectively, from 2017. in addition, the home improvement research institute ("hiri") is forecasting sales in the professional repair and remodel end market to increase approximately 2.5% in 2018 compared to 2017.
our net sales for the year ended december 31, 2017 were up 10.5% over the same period last year. we estimate that our sales volume increased 4.3%, while commodity price inflation resulted in an additional 6.2% increase in sales in 2017 compared to 2016. for the year ended december 31, 2017 sales volume growth in single-family and the repair and remodel end market were partially offset by declines in multi-family. our gross margin percentage decreased by 0.5% during the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to the year ended december 31, 2016. our gross margin percentage decreased primarily due to gross profit margin compression on commodity products resulting from inflation in the lumber and lumber sheet goods markets during most of 2017. we continue to invest in our business to improve our operating efficiency, which has allowed us to better leverage our operating costs against changes in net sales. our selling, general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of net sales, were 20.5% for the year ended december 31, 2017, a 0.9% decrease from 21.4% in 2016. the decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of net sales, was due to cost leverage as well as the decline in depreciation and amortization on acquired probuild assets, partially offset by investments the company made towards growth initiatives, including additional sales associates and new locations.
we believe the long-term outlook for the housing industry is positive due to growth in the underlying demographics. we feel we are well-positioned to take advantage of the construction activity in our markets and to increase our market share, which may include strategic acquisitions. we will continue to focus on working capital by closely monitoring the credit exposure of our customers and by working with our vendors to improve our payment terms and pricing on our products. we strive to achieve the appropriate balance of short-term expense control while maintaining the expertise and capacity to grow the business as market conditions improve. in addition, debt reduction will continue to be a key area of focus for the company.

we achieved increased net sales across all of our product categories. the impact of commodity price inflation in 2017 resulted in the sales growth of our lumber and lumber sheet goods category exceeding the sales growth of our other product categories.
gross margin. gross margin increased $130.6 million to $1,727.4 million. our gross margin percentage decreased to 24.6% in 2017 from 25.1% in 2016, a 0.5% decrease. our gross margin percentage decreased primarily due to gross profit margin compression on commodity products resulting from inflation in the lumber and lumber sheet goods markets during most of 2017.
selling, general and administrative expenses. selling, general and administrative expenses increased $81.9 million, or 6.0%. our salaries and benefits expense was $935.5 million, an increase of $41.1 million from 2016, and stock compensation increased $3.0 million. office general and administrative increased $13.9 million, delivery expense increased $10.1 million and occupancy expense increased $5.9 million. in addition, we recognized a $4.2 million loss on the disposal of assets during the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to a gain of $5.0 million during the year ended december 31, 2016.
as a percentage of net sales, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased from 21.4% in 2016 to 20.5% in 2017 due to cost leverage as well as the decline in depreciation and amortization on acquired probuild assets, partially offset by investments the company made towards growth initiatives, including additional sales associates and new locations.
interest expense, net. interest expense was $193.2 million in 2017, a decrease of $21.5 million from 2016. this decrease was largely attributable to the positive results of our debt transactions executed in fiscal years 2016 and 2017. interest expense for the years ended december 31, 2017 and 2016 included one-time charges related to the debt financing transactions of $58.7 million and $57.0 million, respectively.
income tax expense. we recorded income tax expense of $53.1 million during the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to an income tax benefit of $122.7 million during the year ended december 31, 2016. due to the enactment of the 2017 tax act, we recorded income tax expense of $29.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2017 related to the revaluation of our net deferred tax assets. we recorded reductions of $2.8 million and $131.7 million in the after tax non-cash valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets for the years ended december 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. for the year ended december 31, 2017, our effective tax rate was 57.8% largely due to the impact of the additional income tax expense recognized in connection with the enactment of the 2017 tax act. our effective rate for the year ended december 31, 2016 was (566.1%) primarily due to the release of the valuation allowance against our net federal and some state deferred tax assets in that period. absent the effect of the 2017 tax act and the changes to our valuation allowance, our effective rate would have been 29.4% and 41.8% for the years ended december 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

2016 compared with 2015
sales. sales for the year ended december 31, 2016 were $6,367.3 million, a 78.6% increase from sales of $3,564.4 million for 2015. net sales increased $2,659.1 million, or approximately 75%, due to the probuild acquisition. excluding the impact of the probuild acquisition, we estimate net sales increased $143.8 million, or approximately 4% due to increased volume.

due to the probuild acquisition, we achieved increased net sales across all product categories.  our sales classification by product categories has shifted as we diversified our product offerings to support a broader customer base across 40 states through the probuild acquisition.
gross margin. gross margin increased $695.3 million to $1,596.7 million. of this increase, $656.8 million is due to the probuild acquisition. our gross margin percentage decreased to 25.1% in 2016 from 25.3% in 2015, a 0.2% decrease. our gross margin percentage decreased primarily due to the impact of commodity price inflation relative to our short-term customer pricing commitments during the year ended december 31, 2016. however, this decrease was mostly offset by an increase in our gross margin percentage largely attributable to the probuild acquisition, the result of probuild's higher mix of higher margin repair & remodel and retail sales.
selling, general and administrative expenses. selling, general and administrative expenses increased $549.7 million, or 67.8%, largely due to the probuild acquisition. our salaries and benefits expense was $894.3 million, an increase of $383.7 million from 2015, largely due to increased full-time equivalent employees following the probuild acquisition. delivery expense increased $65.9 million, office general and administrative expense increased $46.5 million, occupancy expense increased $45.9 million and intangible asset amortization increased $10.7 million. these increases were primarily a result of the probuild acquisition, the related integration activities and increased sales volume. these increases were partially offset by a $4.2 million decrease in facility closure costs.
as a percentage of net sales, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased from 22.7% in 2015 to 21.4% in 2016 largely due to the benefit of synergy cost savings. synergy cost savings were primarily attributable to reduced payroll and benefits expense, as well as decreased delivery costs and location consolidations.
interest expense, net. interest expense was $214.7 million in 2016, an increase of $105.5 million from 2015. of the $105.5 million increase, $49.6 million was attributable to increased interest expense associated with our increased debt balances following the probuild acquisition financing and subsequent refinancing transactions, $28.1 million was attributable to losses on debt extinguishment largely due to the payment of redemption premiums on our 2021 and 2023 notes, $17.6 million was related to increased amortization and write-off of debt discount and debt issuance costs largely due to our debt transactions during the year ended december 31, 2016, and $14.2 million was due to interest expense primarily related to lease obligations assumed in the probuild acquisition. these increases were partially offset by a $4.6 million decrease in interest expense due to non-cash fair value adjustments related to the exercise of all remaining stock warrants in 2015.
income tax expense. we recorded an income tax benefit of $122.7 million during the year ended december 31, 2016 compared to income tax expense of $4.4 million during the year ended december 31, 2015. in the third quarter of 2016, we released the valuation allowance against our net federal and some state deferred tax assets. we recorded a reduction of the after-tax, non-cash valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets of $131.7 million during the year ended december 31, 2016 compared to an increase of $9.7 million during the year ended december 31, 2015.  absent the valuation allowance our effective tax rate would have been 41.8% and 28.5% for the years ended december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

we have four reportable segments based on an aggregation of the geographic regions in which we operate. while there is some geographic similarity between our reportable segments and the regions as defined by the u.s. census bureau, our reportable segments do not necessarily fully align with any single u.s. census bureau region.
according to the u.s. census bureau, actual single-family housing starts during the year ended december 31, 2017 increased 3.2%, 7.7%, 7.6% and 13.6% in the northeast region, midwest region, south region and west region, respectively. for the year ended december 31, 2017, we achieved increased net sales and profitability compared to 2016 across all of our reportable segments, due to the impact of commodity price inflation as well as an increase in sales volume.
according to the u.s. census bureau, actual single-family housing starts during the year ended december 31, 2016 increased 8.8%, 9.5%, 8.7% and 12.8% in the south region, northeast region, west region and midwest region, respectively. for the year ended december 31, 2016, we achieved increased net sales and profitability compared to 2015 across all our reportable segments, primarily due to the probuild acquisition and sales volume increases.
liquidity and capital resources our primary capital requirements are to fund working capital needs and operating expenses, meet required interest and principal payments, and to fund capital expenditures and potential future acquisitions. our capital resources at december 31, 2017 consist of cash on hand and borrowing availability under our 2022 facility.
our 2022 facility will be primarily used for working capital, general corporate purposes, and funding acquisitions. in addition, we may use the 2022 facility to facilitate debt repayment and consolidation. availability under the 2022 facility is determined by a borrowing base. our borrowing base consists of trade accounts receivable, inventory, other receivables, including progress billings and credit card receivables, and qualified cash that all meet specific criteria contained within the credit agreement, minus agent specified reserves. net excess borrowing availability is equal to the maximum borrowing amount minus outstanding borrowings and letters of credit.

net excess borrowing availability on revolving facility            $436.8                   $667.2
as of december 31, 2017, we had $350.0 million in outstanding borrowings under our 2022 facility and our net excess borrowing availability was $436.8 million after being reduced by outstanding letters of credit of approximately $84.9 million. we are required to meet a fixed charge coverage ratio of 1:00 to 1:00 if our excess availability falls below the greater of $80.0 million or 10% of the maximum borrowing amount, which was $87.2 million as of december 31, 2017. we were not in violation of any covenants or restrictions imposed by any of our debt agreements at december 31, 2017.
liquidity our liquidity at december 31, 2017 was $494.3 million, which consists of net borrowing availability under the 2022 facility and cash on hand. we are expecting continued improvement in the housing industry in 2018. beyond 2018, it is difficult for us to predict what will happen as our industry is dependent on a number of factors, including national economic conditions, employment levels, the availability of credit for homebuilders and potential home buyers, the level of foreclosures, existing home inventory, and interest rates.
we have substantial indebtedness following our recent acquisitions, which increased our interest expense and could have the effect of, among other things, reducing our flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions. from time to time, based on market conditions and other factors and subject to compliance with applicable laws and regulations, the company may repurchase or call the 2024 notes, repay debt, or otherwise enter into transactions regarding its capital structure.
should the current industry conditions deteriorate or we pursue additional acquisitions, we may be required to raise additional funds through the sale of capital stock or debt in the public capital markets or in privately negotiated transactions. there can be no assurance that any of these financing options would be available on favorable terms, if at all. alternatives to help supplement our liquidity position could include, but are not limited to, idling or permanently closing additional facilities, adjusting our headcount in response to current business conditions, attempts to renegotiate leases, managing our working capital and/or divesting of non-core businesses. there are no assurances that these steps would prove successful or materially improve our liquidity position.
consolidated cash flows cash provided by operating activities was $178.5 million and $158.2 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively. the increase in cash provided by operations is due to increased sales and profitability during the year ended december 31, 2017. however, this increase in cash provided by operating activities was mostly offset by the working capital increase of $94.1 million for 2017 exceeding the working capital increase of $43.9 million in 2016. this increased investment in working capital is primarily related to accounts receivable and inventory during the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to the prior year due to a $666.9 million increase in sales over the same period. in addition, the larger increase in working capital for 2017 was also due to a decrease in accrued liabilities in the current year compared to an increase in accrued liabilities in 2016. the decrease in accrued liabilities in 2017 is primarily due to a decrease in accrued interest attributable to the redemption of the 2023 notes in december 2017. these increases were partially offset by the increase in accounts payable for 2017 exceeding the increase in 2016 primarily due to increased purchases in the current year.
30
cash provided by operating activities was $158.2 million and $177.0 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively.  our working capital increased $43.9 million in 2016 compared to a decrease of $99.0 million in 2015. the change in working capital is largely due to the probuild acquisition, as well as increases in receivables and inventory and increased customer demand. these increases were partially offset by increases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities largely due to increased purchases and increased accounts payable days. cash interest payments increased $99.5 million in 2016 compared to 2015. the remaining change is due to an increase in cash provided by operations primarily related to increased sales and profitability during the year ended december 31, 2016 as a result of the probuild acquisition and higher sales volume.
cash used in investing activities was $59.4 million and $38.3 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively. the increase in cash used in investing activities is largely due to a $19.7 million increase in capital expenditures in 2017 compared to 2016. the increase in capital expenditures in 2017 largely relates to facility improvements and the purchase of machinery and equipment to support sales growth.
cash used in investing activities was $38.3 million and $1,508.0 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively. the change is primarily due to $1,462.7 million in cash used for the probuild acquisition in 2015. the remaining change is largely due to an increase in proceeds from the sale of property, plant and equipment and a decrease in capital expenditures in 2016 compared to 2015.
cash used in financing activities was $76.0 million and $170.5 million for the years ended december 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. cash used in financing activities in 2017 was primarily attributable to the $379.9 million in payments of long-term debt, largely due to the extinguishment of our 2023 notes. in connection with the extinguishment of the 2023 notes we paid $48.7 million in debt extinguishment costs.  these payments were largely offset by $350.0 million in net borrowings under the 2022 facility. cash used in financing activities in 2016 largely relates to the debt transactions executed in that period which are described below.
cash used in financing activities was $170.5 million in 2016 compared to cash provided by financing activities of $1,378.3 million in 2015. cash used in financing activities in 2016 was primarily attributable to $807.5 million in payments of long-term debt, largely due to the extinguishment of our 2021 notes, the partial pay down of the 2015 term loan and 2023 notes. in addition, we repaid $60.0 million, net, under the 2015 facility, paid $42.9 million of debt extinguishment costs and $15.7 million in debt issuance costs. these payments were partially offset by $750.0 million in proceeds from the 2024 notes issuance. cash provided by financing activities for 2015 is attributable to the financing activities executed in connection with the probuild acquisition.
capital expenditures capital expenditures vary depending on prevailing business factors, including current and anticipated market conditions. historically, capital expenditures have for the most part remained at relatively low levels in comparison to the operating cash flows generated during the corresponding periods. we expect our 2018 capital expenditures to be in the range of approximately $120 million to $130 million primarily related to rolling stock, equipment and facility improvements to support our operations.

(1)   we had $350.0 million in outstanding borrowings under the 2022 facility as of december 31, 2017. borrowings under the 2022 facility bear interest at a variable rate. therefore, actual interest may differ from the amounts presented above due to interest rate changes or any future borrowing activity under the 2022 facility. the 2024 term loan also bears interest at a variable rate, therefore actual interest may differ from the amounts presented above due to interest rate changes.

(2)   future minimum commitments for lease finance obligations and capital lease obligations.

the amounts reflected in the table above for operating leases represent future minimum lease payments under non-cancelable operating leases with an initial or remaining term in excess of one year at december 31, 2017. purchase orders entered into in the ordinary course of business are excluded from the above table because they are payable within one year. amounts for which we are
31
liable under purchase orders are reflected on our consolidated balance sheet as accounts payable and accrued liabilities. where it makes economic sense to do so, we plan to lease certain equipment during 2018 to support anticipated sales growth. these operating leases are not included in the table above.
other cash obligations not reflected in the balance sheet in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states, commonly referred to as gaap, our operating leases are not recorded in our balance sheet. in addition to the lease obligations included in the above table, we have residual value guarantees on certain equipment leases. under these leases we have the option of (1) purchasing the equipment at the end of the lease term, (2) arranging for the sale of the equipment to a third party, or (3) returning the equipment to the lessor to sell the equipment. if the sales proceeds in either case are less than the residual value, then we are required to reimburse the lessor for the deficiency up to a specified level as stated in each lease agreement. the guarantees under these leases for the residual values of equipment at the end of the respective operating lease periods approximated $5.6 million as of december 31, 2017.
based upon the expectation that none of these leased assets will have a residual value at the end of the lease term that is materially less than the value specified in the related operating lease agreement or that we will purchase the equipment at the end of the lease term, we do not believe it is probable that we will be required to fund any amounts under the terms of these guarantee arrangements. accordingly, no accruals have been recognized for these guarantees.
in addition, the company is party to certain agreements related to its lease finance obligations which commit the company to perform certain repairs and maintenance obligations under the leases in a specified manner and timeframe that generally will occur throughout the next year.
critical accounting policies and estimates critical accounting policies are those that both are important to the accurate portrayal of a company's financial condition and results, and require subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain.
in order to prepare financial statements that conform to gaap, we make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and accompanying notes. certain estimates are particularly sensitive due to their significance to the financial statements and the possibility that future events may be significantly different from our expectations.
we have identified the following accounting policy that requires us to make the most subjective or complex judgments in order to fairly present our consolidated financial position and results of operations.
goodwill. goodwill represents the excess of the amount we paid to acquire businesses over the estimated fair value of tangible assets and identifiable intangible assets acquired, less liabilities assumed. at december 31, 2017, our goodwill balance was $740.4 million, representing 24.6% of our total assets.
we test goodwill for impairment in the fourth quarter of each year or at any other time when impairment indicators exist by comparing the estimated implied value of a reporting units' goodwill to its book value. examples of such indicators that could cause us to test goodwill for impairment between annual tests include a significant change in the business climate, unexpected competition or a significant deterioration in market share. we may also consider market capitalization relative to our net assets. housing starts are a significant sales driver for us. if there is a significant decline or an expected decline in housing starts, this could adversely affect our expectations for a reporting unit and the value of that reporting unit.
in connection with our annual goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of 2017 we elected to adopt updated guidance which simplifies the accounting for goodwill impairment. this updated guidance is described in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k.
the process of evaluating goodwill for impairment involves the determination of the fair value of our reporting units. our reporting units are aligned with our nine geographic regions which are also determined to be our operating segments. in evaluating goodwill for impairment, the company first assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value. if it is concluded that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, then no further testing of the goodwill is required.
however, if we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, we perform a quantitative goodwill impairment test. this test identifies both the existence of and the amount of goodwill impairment

by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying amount, including goodwill. if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount goodwill is not impaired. if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value an impairment loss is recognized in amount equal to that excess, limited to the amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.
in performing our annual impairment tests at december 31, 2017, we developed a range of fair values for our reporting units using a five-year discounted cash flow methodology. inherent in such fair value determinations are estimates relating to future cash flows, including revenue growth, gross margins, operating expenses and long-term growth rates, and our interpretation of current economic indicators and market conditions and their impact on our strategic plans and operations. due to the uncertainties associated with such estimates, interpretations and assumptions, actual results could differ from projected results, which could result in impairment of goodwill could be recorded.
significant information and assumptions utilized in estimating future cash flows for our reporting units includes projections of market share gains as well as publicly available industry information on projected single-family housing starts and lumber commodity prices which are used to project revenue. projected gross margins and operating expenses reflect current headcount levels and cost structure and are flexed in future years based upon historical trends at various revenue levels. long-term growth was based upon terminal value earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("ebitda") multiples of 5.0x for all reporting units to reflect the relevant expected acquisition price. a discount rate of 12.5% was used for all reporting units and is intended to reflect the weighted average cost of capital for a potential market participant and includes all risks of ownership and the associated risks of realizing the stream of projected future cash flows. decreasing the long-term growth to an ebitda multiple of 4.0x, or increasing the discount rate by 1.0% to 13.5%, would not have changed the results of our impairment testing.
at december 31, 2017, the fair values of each of our reporting units were substantially in excess of their respective carrying amounts. the excess (or "cushion") of the fair values over the carrying amounts of our nine reporting units ranged from $122 million to $315 million. factors that could negatively impact the estimated fair value of our reporting units and potentially trigger additional impairment include, but are not limited to, unexpected competition, lower than expected housing starts, an increase in market participant weighted average cost of capital, increases in material or labor cost, and significant declines in our market capitalization. future impairment of goodwill would have the effect of decreasing our earnings or increasing our losses in such period, but would not impact our current outstanding debt obligations or compliance with covenants contained in the related debt agreements. we did not have any goodwill impairments in 2017, 2016 or 2015.
recently issued accounting standards information regarding recent accounting pronouncements is discussed in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k.

item 1a. risk factors risk factors relating to delta our business and results of operations are dependent on the price of aircraft fuel. high fuel costs or cost increases, including in the cost of crude oil, could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.
our operating results are significantly impacted by changes in the price of aircraft fuel. over the last decade, fuel prices have increased substantially at times and have been highly volatile during the last several years. in 2017, our average fuel price per gallon, including the impact of fuel hedges, was $1.68, a 12.8% increase from our average fuel price in 2016. in 2016, our average fuel price per gallon was $1.49, a 21.6% decrease from our average fuel price in 2015. in 2015, our average fuel price per gallon was $1.90, a 45.2% decrease from our average fuel price in 2014. fuel costs represented 19.2%, 18.3% and 23.0% of our operating expense in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
our ability to pass along rapidly increasing fuel costs to our customers may be affected by the competitive nature of the airline industry. because passengers often purchase tickets well in advance of their travel, a significant rapid increase in fuel price may result in the fare charged not covering that increase. at times in the past, we often were not able to increase our fares to offset fully the effect of increases in fuel costs, and we may not be able to do so in the future.
we acquire a significant amount of jet fuel from our wholly owned subsidiary, monroe, and through strategic agreements that monroe has with third parties. the cost of the fuel we purchase under these arrangements remains subject to volatility in the cost of crude oil and jet fuel. in addition, we continue to purchase a significant amount of aircraft fuel in addition to what we obtain from monroe. our aircraft fuel purchase contracts alone do not provide material protection against price increases as these contracts typically establish the price based on industry standard market price indices.
fuel hedging activities are intended to manage the financial impact of the volatility in the price of jet fuel. the effects of rebalancing our hedge portfolio and mark-to-market adjustments may have a negative effect on our financial results.
we have recently managed our fuel price risk through a hedging program intended to reduce the financial impact from changes in the price of fuel as fuel prices are subject to potential volatility. we may utilize different contract and commodity types in this program and test their economic effectiveness against our financial targets. we closely monitor the hedge portfolio and rebalance the portfolio based on market conditions, which may result in locking in gains or losses on hedge contracts prior to their settlement dates. our hedging program may not be successful in providing price protection due to market conditions and the choice of hedging instruments. in addition, we record mark-to-market adjustments ("mtm adjustments") on our fuel hedges. mtm adjustments are based on market prices at the end of the reporting period for contracts settling in future periods. losses from rebalancing or mtm adjustments (or both) may have a negative impact on our financial results.
our fuel hedge contracts may contain margin funding requirements, which require us to post margin to counterparties or cause counterparties to post margin to us as market prices in the underlying hedged items change. if fuel prices decrease significantly from the levels existing at the time we enter into fuel hedge contracts, we may be required to post a significant amount of margin, which could have a material impact on the level of our unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments.
significant extended disruptions in the supply of aircraft fuel, including from monroe, could have a material adverse effect on our operations and operating results.
weather-related events, natural disasters, political disruptions or wars involving oil-producing countries, changes in governmental policy concerning aircraft fuel production, transportation, taxes or marketing, changes in refining capacity, environmental concerns and other unpredictable events may impact crude oil and fuel supply and could result in shortages in the future. shortages in fuel supplies could have negative effects on our results of operations and financial condition.
12
because we acquire a large amount of our jet fuel from monroe, the disruption or interruption of production at the refinery could have an impact on our ability to acquire jet fuel needed for our operations. disruptions or interruptions of production at the refinery could result from various sources including a major accident or mechanical failure, interruption of supply or delivery of crude oil, work stoppages relating to organized labor issues, or damage from severe weather or other natural or man-made disasters, including acts of terrorism. if the refinery were to experience an interruption in operations, disruptions in fuel supplies could have negative effects on our results of operations and financial condition. in addition, the financial benefits from the operation of the refinery could be materially adversely affected (to the extent not recoverable through insurance) because of lost production and repair costs.
if monroe's cost of producing non-jet fuel products exceeds the value it receives for those products, the financial benefits we expect to achieve through the ownership of the refinery and our consolidated results of operations could be materially adversely affected.
our significant investments in airlines in other parts of the world and the commercial relationships that we have with those carriers may not produce the returns or results we expect.
an important part of our strategy to expand our global network has been to make significant investments in airlines in other parts of the world and expand our commercial relationships with these carriers. we expect to continue exploring ways to expand our relationships with other carriers as part of our global business strategy. these investments and relationships involve significant challenges and risks, including that we may not realize a satisfactory return on our investment, that they may distract management from our operations or that they may not generate the expected revenue synergies. these events could have a material adverse effect on our operating results or financial condition.
in addition, we are dependent on these other carriers for significant aspects of our network in the regions in which they operate. while we work closely with these carriers, we do not have control over their operations or business methods. to the extent that the operations of any of these carriers are disrupted over an extended period of time or their actions subject us to the consequences of failure to comply with laws and regulations, our results of operations may be adversely affected. we also may be subject to consequences from any improper behavior of joint venture partners, including for failure to comply with anti-corruption laws such as the united states foreign corrupt practices act.
we are at risk of losses and adverse publicity stemming from a serious accident involving our aircraft or aircraft of our airline partners.
an aircraft crash or other serious accident could expose us to significant liability. although we believe that our insurance coverage is appropriate, we may be forced to bear substantial losses from an accident in the event that the coverage was not sufficient.
in addition, any accident involving an aircraft that we operate or an aircraft that is operated by an airline that is one of our regional carriers or codeshare, alliance or joint venture partners could create a negative public perception about safety, which could harm our reputation, resulting in air travelers being reluctant to fly on our aircraft and therefore harm our business.
breaches or lapses in the security of our technology systems and the data we store could compromise passenger or employee information and expose us to liability, possibly having a material adverse effect on our business.
as a regular part of our ordinary business operations, we collect and store sensitive data, including personal information of our passengers and employees and information of our business partners. the secure operation of the networks and systems on which this type of information is stored, processed and maintained is critical to our business operations and strategy.
13
our information systems are subject to an increasing threat of continually evolving cybersecurity risks. unauthorized parties may attempt to gain access to our systems or information, including through fraud or other means of deception. hardware or software we develop or acquire may contain defects that could unexpectedly compromise information security. the methods used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service or sabotage systems are constantly evolving and may be difficult to anticipate or to detect for long periods of time. as a result of these types of risks and regular attacks, we regularly review and update procedures and processes to prevent and protect against unauthorized access to our systems and information and inadvertent misuse of data. however, the constantly changing nature of the threats means that we may not be able to prevent all data security breaches or misuse of data. the compromise of our technology systems resulting in the loss, disclosure, misappropriation of, or access to, customers', employees' or business partners' information or failure to comply with regulatory or contractual obligations with respect to such information could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability or regulatory penalties under laws protecting the privacy of personal information, disruption to our operations and damage to our reputation, any or all of which could adversely affect our business.
disruptions of our information technology infrastructure could interfere with our operations, possibly having a material adverse effect on our business.
disruptions in our information technology network could result from a technology error or failure impacting our internal systems, whether hosted internally at our data centers or externally at third-party locations, or large scale external interruption in technology infrastructure support on which we depend, such as power, telecommunications or the internet. the operation of our technology systems and the use of related data may also be vulnerable to a variety of other sources of interruption, including natural disasters, terrorist attacks, computer viruses, hackers and other security issues. a significant individual, sustained or repeated failure of our network, including third-party networks we utilize and on which we depend, could impact our customer service and result in increased costs. while we have in place initiatives to prevent disruptions and disaster recovery plans and continue to invest in improvements to these initiatives and plans, these measures may not be adequate to prevent a business disruption and its adverse financial and reputational consequences to our business.
failure of our technology to perform effectively could have an adverse effect on our business.
we are dependent on technology initiatives to provide customer service and operational effectiveness in order to compete in the current business environment. for example, we have made and continue to make significant investments in customer facing technology such as delta.com, mobile device applications, check-in kiosks, customer service applications, airport information displays and related initiatives, including security for these initiatives. we are also investing in significant upgrades to technology infrastructure and other supporting systems. the performance, reliability and security of the technology are critical to our ability to serve customers. if our technology does not perform effectively, our business and operations would be negatively affected, which could be material.
agreements governing our debt, including credit agreements, include financial and other covenants. failure to comply with these covenants could result in events of default.
our credit facilities have various financial and other covenants that require us to maintain, depending on the particular agreement, minimum fixed charge coverage ratios, minimum liquidity and/or minimum collateral coverage ratios. the value of the collateral that has been pledged in each facility may change over time due to appraisals of collateral required by our credit agreements and indentures. these changes could result from factors that are not under our control. a decline in the value of collateral could result in a situation where it may be difficult to maintain the collateral coverage ratio. in addition, the credit facilities contain other negative covenants customary for such financings. these covenants are subject to important exceptions and qualifications. if we fail to comply with these covenants and are unable to remedy or obtain a waiver or amendment, an event of default would result.
the credit facilities also contain other events of default customary for such financings. if an event of default were to occur, the lenders could, among other things, declare outstanding amounts due and payable. in addition, an event of default or declaration of acceleration under any of the credit facilities could also result in an event of default under other of our financing agreements. the acceleration of significant amounts of debt could require us to renegotiate, repay or refinance the obligations under the credit facilities or other financing arrangements.
14
employee strikes and other labor-related disruptions may adversely affect our operations.
our business is labor intensive, utilizing large numbers of pilots, flight attendants, aircraft maintenance technicians, ground support personnel and other personnel. as of december 31, 2017, approximately 19% of our workforce, primarily pilots, was unionized. relations between air carriers and labor unions in the united states are governed by the railway labor act, which provides that a collective bargaining agreement between an airline and a labor union does not expire, but instead becomes amendable as of a stated date. the railway labor act generally prohibits strikes or other types of self help actions both before and after a collective bargaining agreement becomes amendable, unless and until the collective bargaining processes required by the railway labor act have been exhausted. monroe's relations with unions representing its employees are governed by the nlra, which generally allows self help after a collective bargaining agreement expires.
if we or our subsidiaries are unable to reach agreement with any of our unionized work groups on future negotiations regarding the terms of their collective bargaining agreements or if additional segments of our workforce become unionized, we may be subject to work interruptions or stoppages, subject to the requirements of the railway labor act or the nlra, as the case may be. strikes or labor disputes with our unionized employees may adversely affect our ability to conduct business. likewise, if third-party regional carriers with whom we have contract carrier agreements are unable to reach agreement with their unionized work groups in current or future negotiations regarding the terms of their collective bargaining agreements, those carriers may be subject to work interruptions or stoppages, subject to the requirements of the railway labor act, which could have a negative impact on our operations.
our results can fluctuate due to the effects of weather, natural disasters and seasonality.
our results of operations are impacted by severe weather, natural disasters and seasonality. severe weather conditions and natural disasters (or other environmental events) can significantly disrupt service and create air traffic control problems. these events decrease revenue and can also increase costs. in addition, increases in the frequency, severity or duration of thunderstorms, hurricanes, typhoons or other severe weather events, including from changes in the global climate, could result in increases in delays and cancellations, turbulence-related injuries and fuel consumption to avoid such weather, any of which could result in loss of revenue and higher costs. in addition, demand for air travel is typically higher in the june and september quarters, particularly in international markets, because there is more vacation travel during these periods than during the remainder of the year. the seasonal shifting of demand causes our financial results to vary on a seasonal basis. because of fluctuations in our results from weather, natural disasters and seasonality, operating results for a historical period are not necessarily indicative of operating results for a future period and operating results for an interim period are not necessarily indicative of operating results for an entire year.
an extended disruption in services provided by third parties, including third-party regional carriers, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
we utilize the services of third parties in a number of areas in support of our operations that are integral to our business, including third-party carriers in the delta connection program. while we have agreements with these providers that define expected service performance, we do not have direct control over their operations. in particular, some third-party regional carriers are facing a shortage of qualified pilots due to government mandated increases in flight experience required for pilots working for airlines. if this shortage becomes more widespread, third-party regional carriers may not be able to comply with their obligations to us. to the extent that a significant disruption in services occurs because third party providers, including regional carriers, are unable to perform their obligations over an extended period of time, our revenue may be reduced or our expenses may be increased resulting in a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
15
the failure or inability of insurance to cover a significant liability related to an environmental or other incident associated with the operation of the monroe refinery could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial results.
monroe's refining operations are subject to various hazards unique to refinery operations, including explosions, fires, toxic emissions and natural catastrophes. monroe could incur substantial losses, including cleanup costs, fines and other sanctions and third-party claims, and its operations could be interrupted, as a result of such an incident. monroe's insurance coverage does not cover all potential losses, costs or liabilities, and monroe could suffer losses for uninsurable or uninsured risks or in amounts greater than its insurance coverage. in addition, monroe's ability to obtain and maintain adequate insurance may be affected by conditions in the insurance market over which it has no control. if monroe were to incur a significant liability for which it is not fully insured or for which insurance companies do not or are unable to provide coverage, this could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial results of operations or consolidated financial position.
the operation of the refinery by monroe is subject to significant environmental regulation. failure to comply with environmental regulations or the enactment of additional regulation could have a negative impact on our consolidated financial results.
monroe's operations are subject to extensive environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those relating to the discharge of materials into the environment, waste management, pollution prevention measures and greenhouse gas emissions. monroe could incur fines and other sanctions, cleanup costs and third-party claims as a result of violations of or liabilities under environmental, health and safety requirements, which if significant, could have a material adverse effect on our financial results. in addition, the enactment of new environmental laws and regulations, including any laws or regulations relating to greenhouse gas emissions, could significantly increase the level of expenditures required for monroe or restrict its operations.
in particular, under the energy independence and security act of 2007, the epa has adopted rfs that mandate the blending of renewable fuels into transportation fuels. rins are assigned to renewable fuels produced or imported into the u.s. that are blended into transportation fuels to demonstrate compliance with this obligation. a refinery may meet its obligation under rfs by blending the necessary volumes of renewable fuels with transportation fuels or by purchasing rins in the open market or through a combination of blending and purchasing rins.
because the refinery operated by monroe does not blend renewable fuels, it must purchase its rins requirement in the secondary market or obtain a waiver from the epa. as a result, monroe is exposed to the market price of rins. market prices for rins have been volatile, marked by periods of sharp increases and decreases. we cannot predict the future prices of rins. purchasing rins at elevated prices could have a material impact on our results of operations and cash flows.
existing laws or regulations could change, and the minimum volumes of renewable fuels that must be blended with refined petroleum products may increase. increases in the volume of renewable fuels that must be blended into monroe's products could limit the refinery's production if sufficient numbers of rins are not available for purchase or relief from this requirement is not obtained, which could have an adverse effect on our consolidated financial results.
if we lose senior management and other key employees and they are not replaced by individuals with comparable skills, our operating results could be adversely affected.
we are dependent on the experience and industry knowledge of our officers and other key employees to design and execute our business plans. if we experience a substantial turnover in our leadership and other key employees, and these persons are not replaced by individuals with comparable skills, our performance could be materially adversely impacted. furthermore, we may be unable to attract and retain additional qualified executives as needed in the future.
our reputation and brand could be damaged if we are exposed to significant adverse publicity through social media.
we operate in a highly visible, public environment with significant exposure to social media. adverse publicity, whether justified or not, can rapidly spread through social or digital media. in particular, passengers can use social media to provide feedback about their interaction with us in a manner that can be quickly and broadly disseminated. to the extent we are unable to respond timely and appropriately to adverse publicity, our brand and reputation may be damaged. significant damage to our overall reputation and brand image could have a negative impact on our financial results.
16
risk factors relating to the airline industry terrorist attacks, geopolitical conflict or security events may adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.
terrorist attacks, geopolitical conflict or security events, or fear of such events, could have a significant adverse effect on our business. despite significant security measures at airports and airlines, the airline industry remains a high profile target for terrorist groups. we constantly monitor threats from terrorist groups and individuals, including from violent extremists both internationally and domestically, with respect to direct threats against our operations and in ways not directly related to the airline industry. in addition, the impact on our operations of avoiding areas of the world, including airspace, in which there are geopolitical conflicts and the targeting of commercial aircraft by parties to those conflicts can be significant. security events, primarily from external sources but also from potential insider threats, also pose a significant risk to our passenger and cargo operations. these events could include random acts of violence and could occur in public areas that we cannot control.
terrorist attacks, geopolitical conflict or security events, or fear of such events, even if not made directly on or involving the airline industry, could have significant negative impact on us by discouraging passengers from flying, leading to decreased ticket sales and increased refunds. in addition, potential costs from these types of events include increased security costs, impacts from avoiding flight paths over areas in which conflict is occurring, reputational harm and other costs. if any or all of these types of events occur, they could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
the global airline industry is highly competitive and, if we cannot successfully compete in the marketplace, our business, financial condition and operating results will be materially adversely affected.
the airline industry is highly competitive, marked by significant competition with respect to routes, fares, schedules (both timing and frequency), services, products, customer service and frequent flyer programs. consolidation in the airline industry, the rise of well-funded government sponsored international carriers, changes in international alliances and the creation of immunized joint ventures have altered and will continue to alter the competitive landscape in the industry, resulting in the formation of airlines and alliances with increased financial resources, more extensive global networks and competitive cost structures.
our domestic operations are subject to competition from traditional network carriers, including american airlines and united airlines, national point-to-point carriers, including alaska airlines, jetblue airways and southwest airlines, and discount carriers, some of which may have lower costs than we do and provide service at low fares to destinations served by us. point-to-point, discount and ultra low-cost carriers, including spirit airlines and allegiant air, place significant competitive pressure on network carriers in the domestic market. as a result, we face significant competition at our domestic hub and gateway airports either directly at those airports or at the hubs of other airlines that are located in close proximity to our hubs and gateways. we also face competition in smaller to medium-sized markets from regional jet operations of other carriers. our ability to compete in the domestic market effectively depends, in part, on our ability to maintain a competitive cost structure. if we cannot maintain our costs at a competitive level, then our business, financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected.
our international operations are subject to competition from both foreign and domestic carriers. competition is significant from government-owned and -funded carriers in the gulf region, including emirates, etihad airways and qatar airways. these carriers have large numbers of international widebody aircraft on order and are increasing service to the u.s. from their hubs in the middle east. several of these carriers, along with carriers from china, india and southeast asia, are government-subsidized, which has allowed them to grow quickly, reinvest in their product and expand their global presence at the expense of u.s. airlines.
through alliance and other marketing and codesharing agreements with foreign carriers, u.s. carriers have increased their ability to sell international transportation, such as services to and beyond traditional european and asian gateway cities. similarly, foreign carriers have obtained increased access to interior u.s. passenger traffic beyond traditional u.s. gateway cities through these relationships. in addition, several joint ventures among u.s. and foreign carriers have received grants of antitrust immunity allowing the participating carriers to coordinate schedules, pricing, sales and inventory.
increased competition in both the domestic and international markets may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.
17
extended interruptions or disruptions in service at major airports in which we operate could have a material adverse impact on our operations.
the airline industry is heavily dependent on business models that concentrate operations in major airports in the united states and throughout the world. an extended interruption or disruption at an airport where we have significant operations could have a material impact on our business, financial condition and results of operation.
the airline industry is subject to extensive government regulation, and new regulations may increase our operating costs.
airlines are subject to extensive regulatory and legal compliance requirements that result in significant costs. for instance, the faa from time to time issues directives and other regulations relating to the maintenance and operation of aircraft that necessitate significant expenditures. we expect to continue incurring significant expenses to comply with the faa's regulations.
other laws, regulations, taxes and airport rates and charges have also been imposed from time to time that significantly increase the cost of airline operations or reduce revenues. the industry is heavily taxed. for example, the aviation and transportation security act mandates the federalization of certain airport security procedures and imposes security requirements on airports and airlines, most of which are funded by a per ticket tax on passengers and a tax on airlines. additional taxes and fees, if implemented, could negatively impact our results of operations.
proposals to address congestion issues at certain airports or in certain airspace, particularly in the northeast u.s., have included concepts such as "congestion-based" landing fees, "slot auctions" or other alternatives that could impose a significant cost on the airlines operating in those airports or airspace and impact the ability of those airlines to respond to competitive actions by other airlines. in addition, the failure of the federal government to upgrade the u.s. air traffic control system has resulted in delays and disruptions of air traffic during peak travel periods in certain congested markets. the failure to improve the air traffic control system could lead to increased delays and inefficiencies in flight operations as demand for u.s. air travel increases, having a material adverse effect on our operations. failure to update the air traffic control system in a timely manner, and the substantial funding requirements of an updated system that may be imposed on air carriers, may have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.
future regulatory action concerning climate change, aircraft emissions and noise emissions could have a significant effect on the airline industry. while the specific nature of future actions is hard to predict, new environmental laws or regulations adopted in the u.s. or other countries could impose significant additional costs on our operations, either through direct costs in our operations or through increases in costs that our suppliers pass along to us.
we and other u.s. carriers are subject to domestic and foreign laws regarding privacy of passenger and employee data that are not consistent in all countries in which we operate. in addition to the heightened level of concern regarding privacy of passenger data in the u.s., certain european government agencies are reviewing airline privacy practices. compliance with these regulatory regimes is expected to result in additional operating costs and could impact our operations and any future expansion.
prolonged periods of stagnant or weak economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.
as a result of the discretionary nature of air travel, the airline industry has been cyclical and particularly sensitive to changes in economic conditions. because we operate globally, with approximately 30% of our revenues from operations outside of the u.s., our business is subject to economic conditions throughout the world. during periods of unfavorable or volatile economic conditions in the global economy, demand for air travel can be significantly impacted as business and leisure travelers choose not to travel, seek alternative forms of transportation for short trips or conduct business through videoconferencing. if unfavorable economic conditions occur, particularly for an extended period, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected. in addition, significant or volatile changes in exchange rates between the u.s. dollar and other currencies, and the imposition of exchange controls or other currency restrictions, may have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, financial conditions and results of operations.
18
economic conditions and regulatory changes leading up to and following the united kingdom's exit from the european union could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
following a referendum in june 2016 in which voters in the u.k. approved an exit from the european union ("eu"), the u.k. government has initiated a process to leave the eu (often referred to as brexit) and begun negotiating the terms of the u.k.'s future relationship with the eu. the airline industry faces substantial uncertainty regarding the impact of the exit of the u.k. from the eu. adverse consequences such as deterioration in economic conditions, volatility in currency exchange rates or adverse changes in regulation of the airline industry or bilateral agreements governing air travel could have a negative impact on our operations, financial condition and results of operations.
the rapid spread of contagious illnesses can have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
the rapid spread of a contagious illness, or fear of such an event, can have a material adverse effect on the demand for worldwide air travel and therefore have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. moreover, our operations could be negatively affected if employees are quarantined as the result of exposure to a contagious illness. similarly, travel restrictions or operational issues resulting from the rapid spread of contagious illnesses in a part of the world in which we have significant operations may have a materially adverse impact on our business and results of operations.
item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations financial highlights - 2017 compared to 2016
our pre-tax income for 2017 was $5.7 billion, representing a $935 million decrease compared to the prior year primarily due to higher fuel costs, salaries and related costs and depreciation expense, which were partially offset by increased operating revenue. pre-tax income, adjusted for special items (a non-gaap financial measure) was $5.5 billion, a decrease of $621 million, or 10.2%. special items were primarily related to fuel hedge mtm adjustments and settlements of $259 million in 2017 compared to $450 million in 2016.
revenue. compared to 2016, our operating revenue increased $1.6 billion, or 4.0%, on 1.0% higher capacity combined with robust demand and strong revenue momentum, closing 2017 with three consecutive quarters of year-over-year passenger unit revenue growth. passenger revenue per available seat mile ("prasm") increased 2.1% led by (1) strong domestic leisure yields, (2) expanded distribution of branded fares, (3) an improving business fare environment, (4) strength in the atlantic region leveraged through u.s. point-of-sale traffic gains, along with business cabin traffic and yield growth, and (5) strong performance in the caribbean, central america, brazil and mexico leisure markets. other revenue increased 9.7% partially resulting from growth in our co-brand credit card partnership with american express.
operating expense. total operating expense increased $2.4 billion and our consolidated operating cost per available seat mile ("casm") increased 6.4% compared to 2016 to 13.81 cents, primarily due to higher fuel costs, salaries and related costs and depreciation expense. including our regional carriers, fuel expense increased $771 million compared to the prior year due to a 22.3% increase in the market price per gallon of fuel, partially offset by reduced fuel hedge losses compared to the prior year and profits generated within our refinery segment. salaries and related costs were higher due to increases for eligible merit, ground and flight attendant employees implemented in the june 2017 quarter. the increase in depreciation expense primarily results from new aircraft deliveries, including b-737-900er, a321-200, a330-300 and a350-900 aircraft, fleet modifications and accelerated depreciation due to the planned retirement of our md-88 fleet and two b-767-300er aircraft.
non-fuel unit costs ("casm-ex, including profit sharing" a non-gaap financial measure) increased 4.3% to 10.57 cents due to the pay rate increases and depreciation expense discussed above, which were partially offset by productivity gains from our fleet, technology and supply chain initiatives.
the non-gaap financial measures for pre-tax income, adjusted for special items, and casm-ex, including profit sharing, both used above, are defined and reconciled in "supplemental information" below.

unit revenues of the domestic region increased 1.7%, resulting from our commercial initiatives, including differentiated products for our customers, known as branded fares, and an improving revenue environment. we continue to differentiate our product offerings and enable customer choice through segmentation, including offering basic economy throughout our domestic network. our domestic operations closed 2017 with three consecutive quarters of year-over-year unit revenue growth, with robust demand for both business and leisure. we continue to see improvements in business markets with 81 of the top 100 business markets producing positive yields during the december 2017 quarter, up from 50% from earlier in the year.
passenger revenues related to our international regions increased 0.5% year-over-year primarily due to strength in the atlantic and latin america regions, partially offset by revenue declines in the pacific. during 2017, we continued to roll out the expansion of our branded fares product throughout the international regions.
the atlantic region closed 2017 with three consecutive quarters of year-over-year unit revenue growth on strong business class bookings. we continue to leverage our alliance partners' hub positions in europe's leading business markets of london, amsterdam and paris to increase the volume of u.s. point-of-sale traffic. the u.k. was particularly robust, with unit revenue growth throughout 2017, including double-digit growth in the second half of 2017. during the year, we expanded our basic economy product to mitigate the impact of ultra-low cost carrier capacity increases.
unit revenue declines in the pacific primarily resulted from industry capacity growth in the region. we continued to optimize the pacific region with a 7.7% reduction in capacity during 2017, focused on refining the network to generate incremental value from our chinese and korean alliances and differentiating our product offerings, including expanding basic economy and selling comfort+ as a separate fare product. during 2017, we reached an agreement to create a trans-pacific joint venture with korean air, offering an enhanced and expanded network, industry-leading products and service, and a seamless customer experience between the u.s. and asia. we also retired our last b-747-400 and introduced our new a350-900 with delta one suites and the delta premium select cabin on routes from detroit to tokyo-narita and seoul-incheon, which are driving improvements in both profitability and customer feedback. these efforts are beginning to show results as the pacific returned to positive prasm growth during the december 2017 quarter for the first time in more than four years.

unit revenues increased in latin america principally resulting from unit revenue improvement in brazil, related to both improved traffic and higher fares. this improvement was driven by the strengthening of the brazilian economy and additional connectivity for our customers provided by our relationship with gol. increased leisure traffic to mexico and the caribbean, and the incremental value provided by our alliance with aeroméxico also contributed to the latin america unit revenue improvement. although unit revenue improved in the caribbean, hurricane damage in several markets during 2017 resulted in temporary service adjustments. finally, we continued to differentiate our product offerings, including expanding basic economy and selling comfort+ as a separate fare product in latin america.

loyalty programs. we sell mileage credits to credit card companies, hotels and car rental agencies under marketing agreements. we allocate the consideration received from mileage credit sales to the individual products and services bundled with the sale based on their relative selling prices. we defer the travel component as part of frequent flyer deferred revenue and recognize passenger revenue as the mileage credits are redeemed for travel. the revenue allocated to the remaining deliverables (such as lounge access, baggage fee waivers and brand usage) is recorded in other revenue. we recognize the revenue for these services as they are performed.
the amount of loyalty program revenue changes based on the price paid for mileage credits, the volume of credits sold and our allocation of selling price to the individual products and services. with the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard in 2018, we will increase the value we use to account for the travel component within mileage credit sales. this new value for the travel component will cause a re-allocation of the consideration received from mileage credit sales. the re-allocation will result in less revenue recognized for loyalty programs in other revenue and more revenue in passenger revenue as the frequent flyer awards are redeemed.
loyalty program revenue increased compared to 2016 related to growth in our co-brand credit card partnership with american express. additional information about our frequent flyer program accounting policies can be found in note 1 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
administrative fees, club and on-board sales. these revenues primarily relate to travel-related services such as ticket changes and unaccompanied minors and also include amounts collected for on-board sales and sky club lounge memberships. we recognize revenue as these services are performed. a significant portion of these fees are travel-related and performed in conjunction with the passenger's flight. therefore, the majority of these fees will be reclassified to passenger revenue with our adoption of the new revenue recognition standard in 2018.
ancillary businesses and refinery. ancillary businesses and refinery includes aircraft maintenance and staffing services we provide to third parties, our vacation wholesale operations and refinery sales to third parties. ancillary businesses and refinery revenues are not related to the generation of a seat mile. ancillary businesses and refinery sales primarily increased due to sales of non-jet fuel products to third parties by our oil refinery, consistent with stronger pricing of refined products throughout the oil industry.
baggage fees. the revenue amount shown above represents baggage fees that were sold as a separate component of the passenger's ticket. similar to administrative fees described above, baggage services are performed and earned in conjunction with the passenger's flight, and these fees will be reclassified to passenger revenue with our adoption of the new revenue recognition standard in 2018.

depreciation and amortization. the increase in depreciation expense primarily results from new aircraft deliveries, including b-737-900er, a321-200, a330-300 and a350-900 aircraft, fleet modifications and accelerated depreciation due to the planned retirement of our md-88 fleet and two b-767-300er aircraft.
contracted services. the increase in contracted services expense predominantly relates to additional contract labor expenses associated with investments in our technology infrastructure and other activities to improve the customer experience.
aircraft maintenance materials and outside repairs. aircraft maintenance materials and outside repairs consist of costs associated with the maintenance of aircraft used in our operations and costs associated with maintenance sales to third parties by our mro business. the increase in aircraft maintenance materials and outside repairs expense primarily relates to an increase in maintenance activity in order to enhance service reliability of certain aircraft.
passenger service. passenger service expense includes the costs of onboard food and beverage, cleaning and supplies. the increase in passenger service expense predominantly relates to costs associated with enhancements to our onboard product offering and higher traffic.
aircraft rent. the increase in aircraft rent primarily results from new leased aircraft deliveries since the prior year, including b-737-900er and a321-200 aircraft.
other. the increase in other expense primarily relates to costs associated with sales of non-jet fuel products to third parties by our oil refinery.

unit revenues of the domestic region decreased 5.2%, resulting from weakness in the close-in yield environment during most of the year despite strong volume.
revenues related to our international regions decreased 7.2% year-over-year primarily due to yield declines resulting from imbalances between supply and demand, principally in the atlantic region and china, the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, continued reductions in international fuel surcharges and economic challenges in certain regions.
in the atlantic, the unit revenue decline predominantly resulted from lower yields driven by industry capacity growth outpacing passenger demand and the strength of the u.s. dollar. in core european markets, u.s. point-of-sale demand was strong and recovered quickly following the brussels airport terrorist attack in march 2016. however, europe point-of sale demand was soft largely due to the impact of weaker euro exchange rates.
unit revenue declines in the pacific compared to 2015 primarily resulted from lower yen hedge gains, lower international fuel surcharges and yield declines resulting from industry capacity growth between the u.s. and china. during the september 2016 quarter, the u.s. department of transportation announced that we were awarded two daytime slot pairs at tokyo's haneda airport (from los angeles and minneapolis). we commenced these routes and canceled other routes in the pacific region during the december 2016 quarter as part of our ongoing optimization of the pacific region.
although latin america unit revenues declined compared to 2015, unit revenues improved in the second half of 2016 compared to the second half of 2015. an open skies agreement between the u.s. and mexico took effect in august 2016 and our application for antitrust immunity with aeroméxico was approved in the december 2016 quarter, which continued to strengthen our performance in the important mexican business markets.
cargo revenue cargo revenue decreased $145 million, or 17.8%, primarily due to weaker international demand compared to the prior year.

salaries and related costs. the increase in salaries and related costs was principally due to pay rate increases given to eligible employees, which includes an 18% pay rate increase for pilots resulting from a new pilot contract ratified in the december 2016 quarter that was retroactive to january 1, 2016. additionally, in the december 2015 quarter, base pay rates increased 14.5% for eligible merit, ground and flight attendant employees in conjunction with changes in their profit sharing program.

aircraft fuel and related taxes. including our regional carriers, fuel expense decreased $1.6 billion compared to the prior year due to an 18% decrease in the market price per gallon of fuel and lower fuel hedge losses, partially offset by a loss from our refinery segment in the current year compared to a profit in the prior year and a 0.7% increase in consumption.

(3)   mtm adjustments and settlements include the effects of the derivative transactions discussed in note 4 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements. for additional information and the reason for adjusting fuel expense, see "supplemental information" below.
regional carriers expense. the increase in regional carriers expense was primarily due to increases in aircraft maintenance and scheduled contract carrier rate escalations, partially offset by lower fuel cost from the decrease in the market price of fuel.
contracted services. the increase in contracted services expense predominantly related to costs associated with the 2.1% increase in capacity and additional temporary staffing.
profit sharing. the decrease in profit sharing was primarily due to an adjustment to the profit sharing calculation during 2016 (paid out in 2017) for merit, ground and flight attendant employees. this adjusted calculation paid 10% of annual profit (as defined by the terms of the program) and, if we exceeded our prior-year results, the program paid 20% of the year-over-year increase in profit to eligible employees. in 2015, our profit sharing program paid 10% to all eligible employees for the first $2.5 billion of annual profit and 20% of annual profit above $2.5 billion. the profit sharing program for pilots remained unchanged from the prior year.

at december 31, 2016, the principal amount of debt and capital leases was $7.4 billion. during 2017, we issued $2.5 billion of unsecured notes. as a result of the debt issuances, partially offset by scheduled principal payments, the amount of debt and capital leases was $8.9 billion at december 31, 2017.
miscellaneous, net is primarily composed of our proportionate share of earnings from our equity investments in virgin atlantic and grupo aeroméxico, foreign exchange gains/losses and charitable contributions. our equity investment earnings and foreign exchange gains/losses vary and impact the comparability of miscellaneous, net from period to period.
income taxes our effective tax rate for 2017 was 37.2%. we recorded a provisional estimate of $150 million related to the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017, resulting in a 2.6% increase to our effective tax rate. we expect our annual effective tax rate to be between 21% and 23% for 2018. at december 31, 2017, we had approximately $5.1 billion of u.s. federal pre-tax net operating loss carryforwards, which do not begin to expire until 2027. accordingly, we believe we will not pay cash federal income taxes before 2019. see note 11 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for more information.
refinery segment the refinery primarily produces gasoline, diesel and jet fuel. monroe exchanges the non-jet fuel products the refinery produces with third parties for jet fuel consumed in our airline operations. the jet fuel produced and procured through exchanging gasoline and diesel fuel produced by the refinery provided approximately 200,000 barrels per day for use in our airline operations during 2017. we believe that the jet fuel supply resulting from the refinery's operation has contributed to the reduction in the market price of jet fuel, and thus lowered our cost of jet fuel compared to what it otherwise would have been.
the refinery recorded operating revenues of $5.0 billion in 2017, compared to $3.8 billion in 2016. operating revenues in 2017 were primarily composed of $3.2 billion of non-jet fuel products exchanged with third parties to procure jet fuel and $886 million of sales of jet fuel to the airline segment. refinery revenues increased compared to the prior year due to higher product demand and an increase in margins during the second half of 2017 due to hurricanes that caused extensive refinery closures on the gulf coast for several weeks.
the refinery recorded income of $110 million in 2017, compared to a loss of $125 million recorded in 2016. the refinery's income in 2017 was primarily due to higher refined product cracks, lower crude costs and higher throughput levels.
a refinery is subject to annual epa requirements to blend renewable fuels into the gasoline and on-road diesel fuel it produces. alternatively, a refinery may purchase renewable energy credits, called rins, from third parties in the secondary market. the refinery, operated by monroe purchases the majority of its rins requirement in the secondary market. we recognized $159 million and $171 million of expense related to the rins requirement in 2017 and 2016, respectively. rins expense decreased during 2017 primarily as a result of a slight decrease in the unit cost of rins during 2017 after a significant increase in the unit cost of rins during 2016.
the monroe refinery is planning for a shutdown of approximately 60 days in the december 2018 quarter. this planned outage, called a turnaround, is in accordance with the long term maintenance plan for the facility to allow for the safe completion of major repairs and upgrades. during that planned outage, we have identified other sources of fuel to maintain service levels and to mitigate the financial impact.
for more information regarding the refinery's results, see note 14 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.

financial condition and liquidity we expect to meet our cash needs for the next 12 months from cash flows from operations, cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and financing arrangements. as of december 31, 2017, we had $5.1 billion in unrestricted liquidity, consisting of $2.6 billion in cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments and $2.5 billion in undrawn revolving credit facilities. during 2017, we used existing cash and cash generated from operations to fund capital expenditures of $3.9 billion, purchase shares of grupo aeroméxico and air france-klm for $1.2 billion and return $2.4 billion to shareholders. in addition, we used the proceeds from a debt offering and cash generated from operations to contribute $3.2 billion in cash to fund our pension obligation.
sources of liquidity operating activities cash flows from operating activities continue to provide our primary source of liquidity. we generated positive cash flows from operations of $5.1 billion in 2017, $7.2 billion in 2016 and $7.9 billion in 2015. we also expect to generate positive cash flows from operations in 2018. we had lower operating cash flows in 2017 compared to prior years primarily due to incremental pension plan contributions partially funded through $2.0 billion of debt issuance.
our operating cash flows can be impacted by the following factors:
seasonality of advance ticket sales. we sell tickets for air travel in advance of the customer's travel date. when we receive a cash payment at the time of sale, we record the cash received on advance sales as deferred revenue in air traffic liability. the air traffic liability increases during the winter and spring as advanced ticket sales grow prior to the summer peak travel season and decreases during the summer and fall months.
fuel. including our regional carriers, fuel expense represented 19.2% of our total operating expenses for 2017. the market price for jet fuel is highly volatile, which can impact the comparability of our cash flows from operations from period to period.
pension contributions. we sponsor defined benefit pension plans for eligible employees and retirees. these plans are closed to new entrants and are frozen for future benefit accruals. our funding obligations for these plans are governed by the employee retirement income security act, as modified by the pension protection act of 2006. in the first half of 2017, we contributed $3.5 billion to our qualified defined benefit pension plans using net proceeds from a $2.0 billion debt issuance, shares of our common stock from treasury with a value of $350 million and existing cash. as a result of these contributions, we satisfied, on an accelerated basis, our 2017 required contributions for our defined benefit plans, including more than $3.0 billion above the minimum funding requirements. we contributed $1.3 billion and $1.2 billion in 2016 and 2015, respectively. we have no minimum funding requirements in 2018. however, in january 2018, we voluntarily contributed approximately $500 million to these plans.
profit sharing. our broad-based employee profit sharing program provides that, for each year in which we have an annual pre-tax profit, as defined by the terms of the program, we will pay a specified portion of that profit to employees. in determining the amount of profit sharing, the program defines profit as pre-tax profit adjusted for profit sharing and certain other items.
we paid $1.1 billion in february 2017, $1.5 billion in february 2016, and $1.1 billion in two payments, $756 million in february 2015 and more than $300 million in october 2014, to our employees in recognition of their contributions toward meeting our financial goals. during the year ended december 2017, we recorded $1.1 billion in profit sharing expense based on 2017 pre-tax profit, which was paid to employees in february 2018.
effective october 1, 2017, we aligned our profit sharing plans under a single formula. under this formula, our profit sharing program pays 10% to all eligible employees for the first $2.5 billion of annual profit and 20% of annual profit above $2.5 billion. prior to that time, the profit sharing program for pilots used this formula but for 2016 and the first nine months of 2017, the profit sharing program for merit, ground and flight attendant employees paid 10% of annual profit (as defined by the terms of the program) and, if we exceeded our prior-year results, the program paid 20% of the year-over-year increase in profit to eligible employees. for years prior to 2016, the profit sharing program for merit, ground and flight attendant employees paid according to the current formula. going forward, all eligible employees will be paid profit sharing under the current formula.

investing activities capital expenditures. our capital expenditures were $3.9 billion in 2017, $3.4 billion in 2016 and $2.9 billion in 2015. our capital expenditures during 2017 were primarily related to the purchase of b-737-900er aircraft to replace a portion of our older b-757-200 aircraft, purchases of a321-200 and a330-300 aircraft, advanced deposit payments on future aircraft order commitments and seat density projects for our domestic fleet. our capital expenditures during 2016 and 2015 were primarily for the purchase of aircraft and modifications to upgrade aircraft interiors that enhance our product offering.
we have committed to future aircraft purchases that will require significant capital investment and have obtained long-term financing commitments for a substantial portion of the purchase price of these aircraft. we expect that we will invest approximately $4.5 billion in 2018 primarily for (1) aircraft, including deliveries of b-737-900ers, a321-200s and a350-900s, along with advance deposit payments for these and our new a330-900neo and cs100 orders as well as for (2) aircraft modifications, the majority of which relate to increasing the seat density and enhancing the cabins on our domestic fleet. we expect that the 2018 investments will be funded primarily through cash flows from operations.
equity investments. during 2017, we completed a $622 million tender offer and settled derivative contracts for $173 million to obtain additional capital stock of grupo aeroméxico, increasing our ownership percentage to a non-controlling 49% equity stake in grupo aeroméxico. during the december 2017 quarter, we acquired shares of air france-klm for $450 million, which provides us with a 10% ownership interest.
los angeles international airport construction. during 2016, we executed a new lease agreement with los angeles world airports ("lawa"), which owns and operates lax, and announced plans to modernize, upgrade and connect terminals 2 and 3 at lax over the next seven years. based on the lease agreement, we are designing and managing the construction of the initial investment of $350 million to renovate gate areas, support space and other amenities for passengers, upgrade the baggage handling systems in the terminals and facilitate the relocation of those airlines located in terminals 2 and 3 to terminals 5 and 6 and tom bradley international terminal ("tbit"). the relocation activities were completed during the june 2017 quarter. subject to required approvals, we have an option to expand the project, which could cost an additional $1.5 billion and would include (1) redevelopment of terminal 3 and enhancement of terminal 2, (2) rebuild of the ticketing, arrival hall and security checkpoint, (3) construction of infrastructure for the planned airport people mover, (4) ramp improvements and (5) construction of a secure connector to the north side of tbit.
a substantial majority of the project costs will be funded through the regional airports improvement corporation ("raic"), a california public benefit corporation, using an $800 million revolving credit facility provided by a group of lenders. the credit facility was executed during 2017. loans made under the credit facility will be repaid with the proceeds from lawa's purchase of completed project assets. we have guaranteed the obligations of the raic under the credit facility. we expect to spend approximately $200 million on this project in 2018 using funding provided by the credit agreement and/or cash flows from operations.
new york-laguardia redevelopment. as part of the terminal redevelopment project at laguardia airport, we are partnering with the port authority of new york and new jersey (the "port authority") to replace terminals c and d with a new state-of-the-art terminal facility consisting of 37 gates across four concourses connected to a central headhouse. the terminal will feature a new, larger delta sky club, wider concourses, more gate seating and 30 percent more concessions space than the existing terminals. the facility will also offer direct access between the parking garage and terminal and improved roadways and drop-off/pick-up areas. the design of the new terminal will integrate sustainable technologies and improvements in energy efficiency. construction will be phased to limit passenger inconvenience and is expected to be completed by 2026.
in connection with the redevelopment, during 2017, we entered into an amended and restated terminal lease with the port authority with a term through 2050. pursuant to the lease agreement we will (1) fund (through debt issuance and existing cash) and undertake the design, management and construction of the terminal and certain off-premises supporting facilities, (2) receive a port authority contribution of $600 million to facilitate construction of the terminal and other supporting infrastructure, (3) be responsible for all operations and maintenance during the term of the lease and (4) have preferential rights to all gates in the terminal subject to port authority requirements with respect to accommodation of designated carriers. we currently expect our costs for the project to be approximately $3.3 billion and we bear the risks of project construction, including if the project's actual costs exceed the projected costs. we expect to spend approximately $550 million on this project in 2018 using funding provided by cash flows from operations and/or financing arrangements.
37
financing activities debt and capital leases. the principal amount of debt and capital leases was $8.9 billion at december 31, 2017. since december 31, 2009, we have reduced our principal amount of debt and capital leases by $9.4 billion.
during the march 2017 quarter, we issued $2.0 billion in aggregate principal amount of unsecured notes, consisting of $1.0 billion of 2.785% notes due 2020 and $1.0 billion of 3.625% notes due 2022. as discussed above, we used the net proceeds from this issuance to make a cash contribution to our qualified defined benefit pension plans. during the december 2017 quarter, we issued $450 million in aggregate principal amount of 2.600% notes due 2020.
our pacific facilities (including the term loan with a principal balance of $1.0 billion) mature in october 2018. we expect to repay this obligation with cash flows from operations, cash and cash equivalents and/or new financing arrangements.
during 2017, we received an upgrade to our credit rating from standard & poor's to an investment-grade rating of bbb-. we now have investment-grade ratings from all three major credit rating agencies.
at december 31, 2017, our corporate ratings were:
rating agency           current rating   outlook fitch                   bbb-             stable moody's                 baa3             stable standard &amp; poor's   bbb-             stable capital returns to shareholders. since first implementing our quarterly dividend in 2013, we have increased the dividend per share by 50% annually and paid $1.9 billion in total dividends, including $731 million in 2017. through dividends and share repurchases, we have returned $9.8 billion to shareholders since 2013, while reducing outstanding shares by approximately 18% compared to the beginning of 2013. during 2017 alone, we repurchased and retired 33 million shares at a cost of $1.7 billion.

on february 9, 2018, the board of directors declared a $0.3050 per share dividend for shareholders of record as of february 23, 2018.
fuel hedge restructuring. during 2016, we entered into transactions to defer settlement of a portion of our hedge portfolio until 2017. these deferral transactions, excluding market movements from the date of inception, provided approximately $300 million in cash receipts during the second half of 2016 and required approximately $300 million in cash payments in 2017.
during the june 2016 quarter, we early terminated certain of our outstanding deferral transactions and made cash payments of $170 million, including normal settlements. as a result, during the year ended december 31, 2017, we reported $20 million in cash receipts and $244 million in cash payments associated with these transactions. for additional information regarding these transactions, see note 4 to the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
undrawn lines of credit we have $2.5 billion available in undrawn revolving lines of credit. our credit facilities have covenants, including minimum collateral coverage ratios. if we are not in compliance with these covenants, we may be required to repay amounts borrowed under the credit facilities or we may not be able to draw on them. we currently have a substantial amount of unencumbered assets available to pledge as collateral.
covenants we were in compliance with the covenants in our financing agreements at december 31, 2017.

long-term debt, principal amount. represents scheduled principal payments on long-term debt.
long-term debt, interest payments. represents estimated interest payments under our long-term debt based on the interest rates specified in the applicable debt agreements. interest payments on variable interest rate debt were calculated using london interbank offered rates ("libor") at december 31, 2017.
operating lease payments. represents our minimum rental commitments under noncancelable operating leases (including certain aircraft flown by regional carriers).
aircraft purchase commitments. represents our commitments to purchase 100 a321-200neo, 93 a321-200, 75 cs100, 41 b-737-900er, 25 a330-900neo and 19 a350-900 aircraft.
contract carrier obligations. represents our estimated minimum fixed obligations under capacity purchase agreements with third-party regional carriers. the reported amounts are based on (1) the required minimum levels of flying by our contract carriers under the applicable agreements and (2) assumptions regarding the costs associated with such minimum levels of flying.
employee benefit obligations. represents primarily (1) our estimated minimum required funding for our qualified defined benefit pension plans based on actuarially determined estimates and (2) projected future benefit payments from our unfunded postretirement and postemployment plans. for additional information about our defined benefit pension plan obligations, see "critical accounting policies and estimates."
other obligations. represents estimated purchase obligations under which we are required to make minimum payments for goods and services, including, but not limited to, insurance, marketing, maintenance, technology, sponsorships and other third-party services and products.

critical accounting policies and estimates our critical accounting policies and estimates are those that require significant judgments and estimates. accordingly, the actual results may differ materially from these estimates. for a discussion of these and other accounting policies, see note 1 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
frequent flyer program our skymiles program offers incentives to travel on delta. this program allows customers to earn mileage credits by flying on delta, delta connection and airlines that participate in the skymiles program, as well as through participating companies such as credit card companies, hotels and car rental agencies. we sell mileage credits to non-airline businesses, customers and other airlines. effective january 1, 2015, the skymiles program was modified from a model in which customers earn redeemable mileage credits based on distance traveled to a model based on ticket price. this award change did not affect the way we account for the program.
the skymiles program includes two types of transactions that are considered revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables. as discussed below, these are (1) passenger ticket sales earning mileage credits and (2) the sale of mileage credits to participating companies with which we have marketing agreements. mileage credits are a separate unit of accounting as they can be redeemed by customers in future periods for air travel on delta and participating airlines, membership in our sky club and other program awards.
passenger ticket sales earning mileage credits. passenger ticket sales earning mileage credits under our skymiles program provide customers with (1) mileage credits earned and (2) air transportation. we value each deliverable on a standalone basis. our estimate of the selling price of a mileage credit is based on an analysis of our sales of mileage credits to other airlines and customers, which is re-evaluated at least annually. we use established ticket prices to determine the estimated selling price of air transportation. we allocate the total amount collected from passenger ticket sales between the deliverables based on their relative selling prices.
we defer revenue for the mileage credits related to passenger ticket sales when the credits are earned and recognize it as passenger revenue when miles are redeemed and services are provided. we record the air transportation portion of the passenger ticket sales in air traffic liability and recognize these amounts in passenger revenue when we provide transportation or when the ticket expires unused. a hypothetical 10% increase in our estimate of the standalone selling price of a mileage credit would decrease passenger revenue by approximately $50 million, as a result of an increase in the amount of revenue deferred from the mileage component of passenger ticket sales.
sale of mileage credits. customers may earn mileage credits through participating companies such as credit card companies, hotels and car rental agencies with which we have marketing agreements to sell mileage credits. our contracts to sell mileage credits under these marketing agreements have multiple deliverables, as defined below.
our most significant contract to sell mileage credits relates to our co-brand credit card relationship with american express. in december 2014, we amended our marketing agreements with american express, which increased the value we receive under the agreements through 2022. the amended agreements became effective january 1, 2015. we account for the agreements consistent with the accounting method that allocates the consideration received to the individual products and services delivered based on their relative selling prices. we determined our best estimate of the selling prices by considering discounted cash flow analysis using multiple inputs and assumptions, including: (1) the expected number of miles awarded and number of miles redeemed, (2) the rate at which we sell mileage credits to other airlines, (3) published rates on our website for baggage fees, discounted access to delta sky club lounges and other benefits while traveling on delta and (4) brand value. the increased value received under the amended agreements increases the amount of deferred revenue for the travel component and increases the value of the other deliverables, which are recognized in other revenue as they are provided.
we recognize revenue as we deliver each sales element. we defer the travel deliverable (mileage credits) as part of frequent flyer deferred revenue and recognize passenger revenue as the mileage credits are used for travel. the revenue allocated to the remaining deliverables is recorded in other revenue. we recognize the revenue for these services as they are performed.
40
breakage. for mileage credits that we estimate are not likely to be redeemed ("breakage"), we recognize the associated value proportionally during the period in which the remaining mileage credits are expected to be redeemed. we use statistical models to estimate breakage based on historical redemption patterns. a change in assumptions as to the period over which mileage credits are expected to be redeemed, the actual redemption activity for mileage credits or the estimated fair value of mileage credits expected to be redeemed could have a material impact on our revenue in the year in which the change occurs and in future years. at december 31, 2017, the aggregate deferred revenue balance associated with the skymiles program was $4.1 billion. a hypothetical 1% change in the number of outstanding miles estimated to be redeemed would result in a $34 million impact on our deferred revenue liability at december 31, 2017.
goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets we apply a fair value-based impairment test to the carrying value of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets on an annual basis (as of october 1) and, if certain events or circumstances indicate that an impairment loss may have been incurred, on an interim basis. we assess the value of our goodwill and indefinite-lived assets under either a qualitative or quantitative approach. under a qualitative approach, we consider various market factors, including the key assumptions listed below. we analyze these factors to determine if events and circumstances have affected the fair value of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets. if we determine that it is more likely than not that the asset may be impaired, we use the quantitative approach to assess the asset's fair value and the amount of the impairment. under a quantitative approach, we calculate the fair value of the asset using the key assumptions listed below.
when we evaluate goodwill for impairment using a quantitative approach, we estimate the fair value of the reporting unit by considering both market capitalization and projected discounted future cash flows (an income approach). when we perform a quantitative impairment assessment of our indefinite-lived intangible assets, fair value is estimated based on (1) recent market transactions, where available, (2) the royalty method for the delta tradename (which assumes hypothetical royalties generated from using our tradename) or (3) projected discounted future cash flows (an income approach).
key assumptions. the key assumptions in our impairment tests include: (1) forecasted revenues, expenses and cash flows, (2) terminal period revenue growth and cash flows, (3) an estimated weighted average cost of capital, (4) assumed discount rates depending on the asset and (5) a tax rate. these assumptions are consistent with those hypothetical market participants would use. since we are required to make estimates and assumptions when evaluating goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment, actual transaction amounts may differ materially from these estimates. in addition, we consider the amount by which the intangible assets' fair values exceeded their respective carrying values in the most recent fair value measurements calculated using a quantitative approach.
changes in certain events and circumstances could result in impairment or a change from indefinite-lived to definite-lived. factors which could cause impairment include, but are not limited to, (1) negative trends in our market capitalization, (2) reduced profitability resulting from lower passenger mile yields or higher input costs (primarily related to fuel and employees), (3) lower passenger demand as a result of weakened u.s. and global economies, (4) interruption to our operations due to a prolonged employee strike, terrorist attack or other reasons, (5) changes to the regulatory environment (e.g., diminished slot restrictions or additional open skies agreements), (6) competitive changes by other airlines and (7) strategic changes to our operations leading to diminished utilization of the intangible assets.
we assessed each of the above assumptions in our most recent impairment analyses. the combination of our most recently completed annual results and our projected revenues, expenses and cash flows more than offset any negative events and circumstances. the stabilized operating environment for u.s. airlines has also contributed to improved financial results.
goodwill. our goodwill balance, which is related to the airline segment, was $9.8 billion at december 31, 2017. based upon our qualitative assessment of all relevant factors, including applicable factors noted in "key assumptions" above, we determined that there was no indication that goodwill was impaired.
identifiable intangible assets. our identifiable intangible assets, which are related to the airline segment, had a net carrying amount of $4.8 billion at december 31, 2017, of which $4.7 billion related to indefinite-lived intangible assets. indefinite-lived assets are not amortized and consist primarily of routes, slots, the delta tradename and assets related to skyteam and collaborative arrangements. definite-lived assets consist primarily of marketing and maintenance service agreements.
we performed qualitative assessments of our indefinite-lived intangible assets, including applicable factors noted in "key assumptions" above, and determined that there was no indication that the assets were impaired. our qualitative assessments include analyses and weighting of all relevant factors, which impact the fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets.
41
long-lived assets our flight equipment and other long-lived assets have a recorded value of $26.6 billion at december 31, 2017. this value is based on various factors, including the assets' estimated useful lives and salvage values. we review flight equipment and other long-lived assets used in operations for impairment losses when events and circumstances indicate the assets may be impaired. factors which could be indicators of impairment include, but are not limited to, (1) a decision to permanently remove flight equipment or other long-lived assets from operations, (2) significant changes in the estimated useful life, (3) significant changes in projected cash flows, (4) permanent and significant declines in fleet fair values and (5) changes to the regulatory environment. for long-lived assets held for sale, we discontinue depreciation and record impairment losses when the carrying amount of these assets is greater than the fair value less the cost to sell.
to determine whether impairments exist for aircraft used in operations, we group assets at the fleet-type level (the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows) and then estimate future cash flows based on projections of capacity, passenger mile yield, fuel costs, labor costs and other relevant factors. if an impairment occurs, the impairment loss recognized is the amount by which the fleet's carrying amount exceeds its estimated fair value. we estimate aircraft fair values using published sources, appraisals and bids received from third parties, as available.
defined benefit pension plans we sponsor defined benefit pension plans for eligible employees and retirees. these plans are closed to new entrants and frozen for future benefit accruals. as of december 31, 2017, the unfunded benefit obligation for these plans recorded on our consolidated balance sheet was $7.0 billion. during 2017, we contributed $3.5 billion to these plans. we have no minimum funding requirements in 2018. however, in january 2018, we voluntarily contributed approximately $500 million to these plans. the most critical assumptions impacting our defined benefit pension plan obligations and expenses are the discount rate, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and life expectancy.
weighted average discount rate. we determine our weighted average discount rate on our measurement date primarily by reference to annualized rates earned on high-quality fixed income investments and yield-to-maturity analysis specific to our estimated future benefit payments. we used a weighted average discount rate to value the obligations of 3.69% and 4.20% at december 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. our weighted average discount rate for net periodic pension benefit cost in each of the past three years has varied from the rate selected on our measurement date, ranging from 4.13% to 4.57% between 2015 and 2017.
expected long-term rate of return. our expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is based primarily on plan-specific investment studies using historical market return and volatility data. modest excess return expectations versus some public market indices are incorporated into the return projections based on the actively managed structure of the investment programs and their records of achieving such returns historically. we also expect to receive a premium for investing in less liquid private markets. we review our rate of return on plan assets assumptions annually. our annual investment performance for one particular year does not, by itself, significantly influence our evaluation. the investment strategy for our defined benefit pension plan assets is to earn a long-term return that meets or exceeds our annualized return target while taking an acceptable level of risk and maintaining sufficient liquidity to pay current benefits and other cash obligations of the plan. this is achieved by investing in a globally diversified mix of public and private equity, fixed income, real assets, hedge funds and other assets and instruments. our expected long-term rate of return on assets for net periodic pension benefit cost for the year ended december 31, 2017 was 8.96%.
the impact of a 0.50% change in these assumptions is shown in the table below:

life expectancy. changes in life expectancy may significantly change our benefit obligations and future expense. we use the society of actuaries ("soa") published mortality data, other publicly available information and our own perspective of future longevity to develop our best estimate of life expectancy. the soa publishes annual updated mortality tables for u.s. plans and updated improvement scale. each year we consider updates by the soa in setting our mortality assumptions for purposes of measuring pension and other postretirement and postemployment benefit obligations.
funding. our funding obligations for qualified defined benefit plans are governed by the employee retirement income security act. the pension protection act of 2006 allows commercial airlines to elect alternative funding rules ("alternative funding rules") for defined benefit plans that are frozen. we elected the alternative funding rules under which the unfunded liability for a frozen defined benefit plan may be amortized over a fixed 17-year period and is calculated using an 8.85% discount rate.
while the pension protection act makes our funding obligations for these plans more predictable, factors outside our control continue to have an impact on the funding requirements. estimates of future funding requirements are based on various assumptions and can vary materially from actual funding requirements. assumptions include, among other things, the actual and projected market performance of assets, statutory requirements and demographic data for participants. for additional information, see note 9 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
recent accounting standards revenue from contracts with customers on january 1, 2018, we will adopt asu no. 2014-09, "revenue from contracts with customers (topic 606)" using the full retrospective method. while the adoption will not have a significant impact on earnings, the classification of certain revenues that are currently classified in other revenue will be reclassified to passenger revenue. these include baggage fees, administrative charges and other travel-related fees, all of which will be deemed part of the single performance obligation of providing passenger transportation. these revenues, which are approximately $2 billion annually, will be reclassified from the current presentation in other revenue to passenger revenue.
in addition, the adoption of the new standard increases the rate used to account for frequent flyer miles. we currently analyze our standalone sales of mileage credits to other airlines and customers to establish the accounting value for frequent flyer miles. considering the guidance in the new standard, we will change our valuation of a mileage credit to an analysis of the award redemption value. the new valuation considers the value a passenger receives by redeeming miles rather than paying cash for an award ticket. this change increases our frequent flyer liability by approximately $2 billion. the mileage deferral and redemption rates are approximately the same; therefore, assuming stable volume, there would not be a significant change in revenue recognized from the program for a given period.
the adoption of the new standard will also reduce our air traffic liability by approximately $500 million. this change primarily results from estimating the tickets that will expire unused and recognizing revenue at the scheduled flight date rather than when the unused tickets expire.
retirement benefits in 2017, the fasb issued asu no. 2017-07, "compensation-retirement benefits (topic 715)." this standard requires an entity to report the service cost component in the same line item as other compensation costs. the other components of net (benefit) cost will be required to be presented in the income statement separately from the service cost component and outside a subtotal of income from operations. in 2017, we recorded $50 million of non-service costs that will be reclassified to non-operating expense upon adoption. this standard is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december 15, 2017. we will adopt the standard effective january 1, 2018.

supplemental information we sometimes use information ("non-gaap financial measures") that is derived from the consolidated financial statements but that is not presented in accordance with gaap. under the u.s. securities and exchange commission rules, non-gaap financial measures may be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with gaap but should not be considered a substitute for or superior to gaap results.
the following table shows a reconciliation of pre-tax income (a gaap measure) to pre-tax income, adjusted for special items (a non-gaap financial measure). we adjust pre-tax income for the following items to determine pre-tax income, adjusted for special items, for the reasons described below:
•   mtm adjustments and settlements. mtm adjustments are defined as fair value changes recorded in periods other than the settlement period. such fair value changes are not necessarily indicative of the actual settlement value of the underlying hedge in the contract settlement period. settlements represent cash received or paid on hedge contracts settled during the period. these items adjust fuel expense to show the economic impact of hedging, including cash received or paid on hedge contracts during the period. adjusting for these items allows investors to better understand and analyze our core operational performance in the periods shown.
•   investment mtm adjustments. we record our proportionate share of earnings from our equity investments in virgin atlantic and aeroméxico in non-operating expense. we adjust for virgin atlantic's and aeroméxico's mtm adjustments to allow investors to better understand and analyze our core financial performance in the periods shown.

the following table shows a reconciliation of casm (a gaap measure) to casm-ex, including profit sharing (a non-gaap financial measure). we adjust casm for the following items to determine casm-ex, including profit sharing for the reasons described below:
•   aircraft fuel and related taxes. the volatility in fuel prices impacts the comparability of year-over-year financial performance. the adjustment for aircraft fuel and related taxes (including our regional carriers) allows investors to better understand and analyze our non-fuel costs and year-over-year financial performance.
•   other expenses. other expenses include aircraft maintenance and staffing services we provide to third parties, our vacation wholesale operations and refinery cost of sales to third parties. because these businesses are not related to the generation of a seat mile, we adjust for the costs related to these sales to provide a more meaningful comparison of the costs of our airline operations to the rest of the airline industry.

item 1a. risk factors

as a large company operating in a complex industry, we encounter a variety of risks and uncertainties that could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, results of operations, financial condition or the trading price of our securities. you should carefully consider each of the risks and uncertainties discussed below, together with other information contained in this annual report on form 10-k, including management's discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition. these risks and uncertainties are not the only ones we face. additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect us. the following risk factors have been organized by category for ease of use; however many of the risks may have impacts in more than one category. these categories, therefore, should be viewed as a starting point for understanding the significant risks facing us and not as a limitation on the potential impact of the matters discussed. risk factors are not necessarily listed in order of importance.
strategic and operational risks

future performance of our business will depend on our ability to execute our strategic and operational initiatives effectively.
the future performance of our business will depend in large part on our ability to effectively implement and execute our strategic and operational initiatives including: (1) driving value creation in our targeted areas of business growth; (2) pursuing additional opportunities to expand our capabilities through solutions, segments, distribution channels and geographies; and (3) creating additional value through capital deployment. successfully executing on these initiatives depends on a number of factors, including our ability to:

differentiate our products and services from those of our competitors;

develop and introduce new and innovative products or programs, particularly in response to government regulation and the increased focus on consumer-directed products;

grow our commercial product portfolio, including managing the uncertainties associated with the mix and volume of business on public health insurance exchanges;

identify and introduce the proper mix or integration of products that will be accepted by the marketplace;

attract and retain sufficient numbers of qualified employees;

attract, develop and maintain collaborative relationships with a sufficient number of qualified partners, including physicians and other health care providers in an environment of growing shortages of primary care professionals and consolidation within the provider industry;

attract new and maintain existing customer relationships;

transition health care providers from volume-based fee-for-service arrangements to a value-based system;

improve medical cost competitiveness in targeted markets;

manage our medical and administrative costs effectively;

identify and enter into strategic relationships;

manage our balance sheet exposures effectively, including our pension funding obligations; and

manage our global health care operating expense ratio effectively.
if these initiatives fail or are not executed on effectively, our consolidated financial position and results of operations could be negatively affected. for example, efforts to reduce operating expenses while maintaining the necessary resources and talent pool are important and, if not managed effectively, could have long-term effects on our business by negatively impacting our ability to drive improvements in the quality of our products and services. for our strategic initiatives to succeed, we must effectively integrate our operations, including our acquired businesses, actively work to ensure consistency throughout the organization, and promote a global mind-set along with a focus on individual customers. if we fail to do so, our business may be unable to grow as planned, or the result of expansion may be unsatisfactory. in addition, the current competitive, economic and regulatory environment requires our organization to adapt rapidly and nimbly to new opportunities and challenges. we will be unable to do so if we do not make important decisions quickly, define our appetite for risk specifically, implement new governance, managerial and organizational processes smoothly and communicate roles and responsibilities clearly.
we face price competition and other pressures that could result in premiums that are insufficient to cover the cost of the health care services delivered to our customers.
while health plans compete on the basis of many service and quality-related factors, we expect that price will continue to be a significant basis of competition. our client and customer contracts are subject to negotiation as clients and customers seek to contain their costs, including by reducing benefits offered or elected. increasingly, our clients seek to negotiate performance guarantees that require us to pay penalties if the guaranteed performance standard is not met. as brokers and benefit consultants seek to enhance their revenue streams, they look to take on services that we typically provide. alternatively, our clients and customers may purchase different types of products that are less profitable, or move to a competitor to obtain more favorable pricing. each of these events would likely negatively impact our financial results.

back to contents part i item 1a. risk factors insufficient increases in reimbursement rates for government-sponsored programs in which we participate. any limitation on our ability to maintain or increase our premium or reimbursement levels, or a significant loss of customers resulting from our need to increase or maintain premium or reimbursement levels, could adversely affect our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.
in addition, factors such as business consolidations and strategic alliances will likely continue to create pressure to contain or otherwise restrict price increases for products and services, despite increasing medical costs. continuing consolidation among physicians, hospitals and other health care providers, the emergence of accountable care organizations, vertical integration of health care providers and other entities, changes in the organizational structures chosen by physicians, hospitals and health care providers, new market entrants, including those not traditionally in the health care industry, and the ability of larger employers to contract directly with providers may impact how we compete and the way we price our products. technological advancements, such as those that allow customers and providers to access medical information remotely and telemedicine, may also affect how we compete and price our products. our product margins and growth depend, in part, on our ability to compete effectively in our markets, set prices appropriately in highly competitive markets to keep or increase our market share, increase customers as planned, and avoid losing accounts with favorable medical cost experience while retaining or increasing our customer base in accounts with unfavorable medical cost experience.
premiums in the health care business are generally set for one-year periods and are priced well in advance of the date on which the contract commences. our revenue on medicare policies is based on bids submitted mid-year in the year before the contract year. although we base the premiums we charge and our medicare bids on our estimate of future health care costs over the contract period, actual costs may exceed what we estimate and charge in premiums due to factors such as medical cost inflation, higher than expected utilization of medical services, new or costly drugs, treatments and technology and customer mix. our health care costs also are affected by external events that we cannot forecast or project and over which we have little or no control, such as influenza-related health care costs, epidemics, pandemics, terrorist attacks or other man-made disasters, natural disasters or other events that materially increase utilization of medical and/or other covered services, as well as changes in customers' health care utilization patterns and provider billing practices. relatively small differences between predicted and actual medical costs or utilization rates as a percentage of revenue can result in significant changes in our financial results. our profitability depends, in part, on our ability to accurately predict, price for and effectively manage future health care costs through disciplined underwriting, provider contracting, utilization management and product design.
the reserves we hold for expected medical claims are based on estimates that involve an extensive degree of judgment and are inherently variable. if actual claims exceed our estimates, our operating results could be materially adversely affected, and our ability to take timely corrective actions to contain future costs may be limited.
we maintain and record medical claims reserves on our balance sheet for estimated future payments. our estimates of health care costs payable are based on a number of factors, including historical claim experience, but this estimation process requires extensive judgment. considerable variability is inherent in such estimates, and the accuracy of the estimates is highly sensitive to changes in medical claims submission and processing patterns and/or procedures, changes in customer base and product mix, changes in the utilization of medical and/or other covered services, changes in medical cost trends, changes in our medical management practices and the introduction of new benefits and products. furthermore, if we are not able to accurately and promptly anticipate and detect medical cost trends, our ability to take timely corrective actions to limit future costs and reflect our current benefit cost experience in our pricing process may be limited. in addition, while we continually review estimates of future payments relating to medical claims costs for services incurred in the current and prior periods and make adjustments to our reserves, the actual health care costs may exceed the reserves we have recorded.
if we fail to develop and maintain satisfactory relationships with physicians, hospitals and other health care providers, our business and results of operations may be adversely affected.
we directly and indirectly contract with physicians, hospitals and other health care professionals and facilities to provide health care services to our customers. our results of operations are substantially dependent on our ability to contract for these services at competitive prices. in any particular market, physicians, hospitals and health care providers may enter into exclusive arrangements with competitors or simply refuse to contract with us, demand higher payments or take other actions that could result in higher medical costs or less desirable products for our customers. in some markets, certain providers, particularly hospitals, physician/hospital organizations and multi-specialty physician groups, may have significant or controlling market positions that could result in a diminished bargaining position for us. if providers refuse to contract with us, use their market position to negotiate more favorable contracts or place us at a competitive disadvantage, our ability to market products or to be profitable in those areas could be materially and adversely affected. establishing collaborative arrangements with physician groups, specialist groups, independent practice associations, hospitals and health care delivery systems is key to our strategic focus to transition from volume-based fee-for-service arrangements to a value-based health care system. if such collaborative arrangements do not result in the lower medical costs that we project or if we fail to attract health care providers to such arrangements, or are less successful at implementing such arrangements than our competitors, our attractiveness to customers may be reduced and our ability to profitably grow our business may be adversely affected.
our ability to develop and maintain satisfactory relationships with health care providers also may be negatively impacted by other factors not associated with us, such as changes in medicare and/or medicaid reimbursement levels, increasing pressure on revenue and other pressures on health care providers and increasing consolidation activity among hospitals, physician groups and health care providers. for example, ongoing reductions by cms and state governments in amounts payable to providers, particularly hospitals, for services provided to medicare and medicaid enrollees may exacerbate the cost shift to private payors, thereby adversely impacting our ability to maintain or develop new cost-effective health care provider contracts or result in a loss of revenues or customers.
continuing consolidation among physicians, hospitals and other health care providers, the emergence of accountable care organizations, vertical integration of health care providers and other entities, changes in the organizational structures chosen by physicians, hospitals and health care providers and new market entrants, including those not traditionally in the health care industry, may affect the way providers interact with us and may change the competitive landscape in which we operate. in some instances, these organizations may compete directly

back to contents part i item 1a. risk factors with us, potentially affecting the way that we price our products and services or cause us to incur increased costs if we change our operations to be more competitive.
out-of-network providers are not limited by any agreement with us in the amounts they bill. while benefit plans place limits on the amount of charges that will be considered for reimbursement, out-of-network providers have become increasingly sophisticated and aggressive and such limitations can be difficult to enforce. as a result, the outcome of disputes where we do not have a provider contract may cause us to pay higher medical or other benefit costs than we projected.
as a global company, we face political, legal, operational, regulatory, economic and other risks that present challenges and could negatively affect our multinational operations and/or our long-term growth.
as a global company, our business is increasingly exposed to risks inherent in foreign operations. these risks can vary substantially by market, and include political, legal, operational, regulatory, economic and other risks, including government intervention that we do not face in our u.s. operations. the global nature of our business and operations may present challenges including, but not limited to, those arising from:

varying regional and geopolitical business conditions and demands;

regulation that may discriminate against u.s. companies, favor nationalization or expropriate assets;

price controls or other pricing issues and exchange controls or other restrictions that prevent us from transferring funds from these operations out of the countries in which we operate or converting local currencies that our foreign operations hold into u.s. dollars or other currencies;

foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations that may have an impact on the future costs or on future sales and cash flows from our international operations, and any countermeasures that we may implement may not be effective in reducing the effect of volatile currencies and other risks of our international operations;

tax positions and applicable regulations that may be subject to interpretation or uncertainty to a greater extent than in the united states;

our reliance on local sales forces for some operations in countries that may have labor problems and/or less flexible employee relationships that can be difficult and expensive to terminate, where laws and regulations regarding employment status may be less clear, or where changes in local regulation or law may disrupt business operations;

effectively managing our partner relationships in countries outside of the united states;

managing more geographically diverse operations and projects;

operating in new foreign markets that may require considerable management time before operations generate any significant revenues and earnings;

providing data protection on a global basis and sufficient levels of technical support in different locations;

the global trend for companies to enact local data residency requirements;

political conditions, including the june 2016 referendum in the united kingdom to leave the european union and tensions in the korean peninsula;

acts of war, terrorism, natural disasters or pandemics in locations where we operate; and

general economic and political conditions.
these factors may increase in significance as we continue to expand globally, and any one of these challenges could negatively affect our operations or long-term growth. for example, due to the concentration of our international business in south korea, the global supplemental benefits segment is exposed to potential losses resulting from economic and regulatory changes in that country and the geopolitical climate in the korean peninsula, as well as foreign currency movements affecting the south korean currency, that could have a significant impact on the segment's results and our consolidated financial results.
international operations also require us to devote significant resources to implement controls and systems in new markets to comply with, and to ensure that our vendors and partners comply with, u.s. and foreign laws prohibiting bribery, corruption and money laundering, in addition to other regulations regarding, among other things, our products, direct-to-consumer communications, customer privacy, data protection and data residency. violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines, criminal sanctions against us, our officers or employees, restrictions or outright prohibitions on the conduct of our business and significant reputational harm. we must regularly reassess the size, capability and location of our global infrastructure and make appropriate changes, and must have effective change management processes and internal controls in place to address changes in our business and operations. our success depends, in part, on our ability to anticipate these risks and manage these challenges. our failure to comply with laws and regulations governing our conduct outside the united states or to establish constructive relations with non-u.s. regulators could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and long-term growth.
we are dependent on the success of our relationships with third parties for various services and functions, including, but not limited to, certain pharmacy benefit management services.

back to contents part i item 1a. risk factors over the actions of third parties. for example, noncompliance with any privacy or security laws and regulations or any security breach involving one of our third-party vendors or a dispute between us and a third party vendor related to our arrangement could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and reputation. in addition, with respect to services or functions outsourced to third parties in foreign jurisdictions, we also are exposed to risks inherent in conducting business outside of the united states.
outsourcing also may require us to change our existing operations, adopt new processes for managing these service providers and/or redistribute responsibilities to realize the potential productivity and operational efficiencies. if there are delays or difficulties in changing business processes or our third party vendors do not perform as expected, we may not realize, or not realize on a timely basis, the anticipated economic and other benefits of these relationships. this could result in substantial costs or regulatory compliance issues, divert management's attention from other strategic activities, negatively affect employee morale or create other operational or financial problems for us. terminating or transitioning in whole or in part arrangements with key vendors could result in additional costs or penalties, risks of operational delays or potential errors and control issues during the termination or transition phase. we may not be able to find an alternative vendor in a timely manner or on acceptable terms. if there is an interruption in business or loss of access to data resulting from a termination or transition in services, we may not be able to meet the demands of our customers and, in turn, our business and results of operations could be adversely impacted.
acquisitions, joint ventures and other transactions involve risks and we may not realize the expected benefits because of integration difficulties, underperformance relative to our expectations and other challenges.
as part of our growth strategy, we regularly consider and enter into strategic transactions, including mergers, acquisitions, joint ventures, licensing arrangements and other relationships (collectively referred to as "transactions"), with the expectation that these transactions will result in various benefits. our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of these transactions is subject to numerous uncertainties and risks, including our ability to integrate operations, resources and systems, including data security systems, in an efficient and effective manner. we could also face challenges in implementing business plans; changes in laws and regulations or conditions imposed by regulations applicable to the business; retaining key employees; and general competitive factors in the marketplace. these events could result in increased costs, decreases in expected revenues, earnings or cash flow, and goodwill or other intangible asset impairment charges. further, we may finance transactions by issuing common stock for some or all of the purchase price that could dilute the ownership interests of our shareholders, or by incurring additional debt that could impact our ability to access capital in the future.
in addition, effective internal controls are necessary to provide reliable and accurate financial reports and to mitigate the risk of fraud. the integration of businesses is likely to cause increasing complexity in our systems and internal controls and make them more difficult to manage. any difficulties in assimilating businesses into our control system could cause us to fail to meet our financial reporting obligations. ineffective internal controls also could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information that could negatively impact the trading price of our stock and our access to capital.
our business depends on our ability to effectively invest in, implement improvements to and properly maintain the uninterrupted operation and data integrity of our information technology and other business systems.
our business is highly dependent on maintaining effective information systems as well as the integrity and timeliness of the data we use to serve our customers and health care professionals and to operate our business. if our data were found to be inaccurate or unreliable due to fraud or other error, or if we, or any of the third-party service providers we engage, were to fail to maintain information systems and data integrity effectively, we could experience operational disruptions that may impact our clients, customers and health care professionals and hinder our ability to establish appropriate pricing for products and services, retain and attract clients and customers, establish reserves and report financial results timely and accurately and maintain regulatory compliance, among other things.
our information technology strategy and execution are critical to our continued success. increasing regulatory and legislative changes will place additional demands on our information technology infrastructure that could have a direct impact on resources available for other projects tied to our strategic initiatives. in addition, recent trends toward greater consumer engagement in health care require new and enhanced technologies, including more sophisticated applications for mobile devices. we must continue to invest in long-term solutions that will enable us to anticipate customer needs and expectations, enhance the customer experience, act as a differentiator in the market and protect against cybersecurity risks and threats. our success is dependent, in large part, on maintaining the effectiveness of existing technology systems and continuing to deliver and enhance technology systems that support our business processes in a cost-efficient and resource-efficient manner. connectivity among technologies is becoming increasingly important. the failure of our health care technologies to operate seamlessly with other products could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. we must also develop new systems to meet current market standards and keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology, evolving industry and regulatory standards and customer needs. failure to do so may present compliance challenges and impede our ability to deliver services in a competitive manner. further, because system development projects are long-term in nature, they may be more costly than expected to complete and may not deliver the expected benefits upon completion.
in addition, our business is highly dependent upon our ability to perform, in an efficient and uninterrupted fashion, necessary business functions, such as claims processing and payment, internet support and customer call centers, and processing new and renewal business. unavailability, cyber-attack or other failure of one or more of our information technology or other systems could cause slower response times, resulting in claims not being processed as quickly as clients or customers desire, decreased levels of client or customer service and satisfaction, and harm to our reputation. because our information technology and other systems interface with and depend on third-party systems, we could experience service denials if demand for such service exceeds capacity or a third-party system fails or experiences an interruption. if sustained or repeated, such business interruptions, systems failures or service denials could have material adverse effects on our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.

back to contents part i item 1a. risk factors as a large health services company, we are subject to cyber-attacks or other privacy or data security incidents. if we are unable to prevent or contain the effects of any such attacks, we may suffer exposure to substantial liability, reputational harm, loss of revenue or other damages.
our business depends on our clients' and customers' willingness to entrust us with their health-related and other sensitive personal information. computer systems may be vulnerable to physical break-ins, computer viruses or malware, programming errors, attacks by third parties or similar disruptive problems. we have been, and will likely continue to be, the target of computer viruses or other malicious codes, unauthorized access, cyber-attacks or other computer-related penetrations. there have been large scale cyber-attacks within the health care industry. as we increase the amount of personal information that we store and share digitally, our exposure to data security and related cybersecurity risks increases, including the risk of undetected attacks, damage, loss or unauthorized access or misappropriation of proprietary or personal information, and the cost of attempting to protect against these risks also increases. we have implemented security technologies, processes and procedures to protect consumer identity and provide employee awareness training around phishing, malware and other cyber risks; however, there are no assurances that such measures will be effective against all types of breaches. the techniques used change frequently or are often not recognized until after they have been launched, because cyber-attacks can originate from a wide variety of sources including third parties such as external service providers. those parties may also attempt to fraudulently induce employees, customers or other users of our systems to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to our data or that of our customers. in addition, while we have certain standards for all vendors that provide us services, our vendors, and in turn, their own service providers, may become subject to the same type of security breaches. finally, our offices may be vulnerable to security incidents or security attacks, acts of vandalism or theft, misplaced or lost data, human error or similar events that could negatively affect our systems and our customers' and clients' data.
the costs to eliminate or address security threats and vulnerabilities before or after a cyber-incident could be significant. our remediation efforts may not be successful and could result in interruptions, delays, or cessation of service and loss of existing or potential customers.
in addition, breaches of our security measures and the unauthorized dissemination of sensitive personal information or proprietary information or confidential information about us, our customers or other third-parties could expose our customers' private information and our customers to the risk of financial or medical identity theft. unauthorized dissemination of confidential and proprietary information about our business and strategy also could negatively affect the achievement of our strategic initiatives. such events would also negatively affect our ability to compete, others' trust in us, our reputation, customer base and revenues and expose us to mandatory disclosure (including to the media), litigation and other enforcement proceedings, material fines, penalties and/or remediation costs, and compensatory, special, punitive and statutory damages, consent orders and other adverse actions, any of which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.
our pharmacy benefit management business and related operations are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that are in addition to those we face in our health care business.
notwithstanding our arrangement with a third-party vendor for certain pharmacy benefit management services, we remain responsible to regulators and our clients and customers for the delivery of those pharmacy benefit management services that we contract to provide. our pharmacy benefit management business is subject to federal and state regulation, including without limitation, federal and state anti-kickback laws, consumer protection laws, erisa, hipaa and laws related to the operation of internet and mail-service pharmacies, as well as the laws and regulations of the foreign countries in which we conduct business. in addition, certain of our subsidiaries are pharmacies subject to state licensing and u.s. drug enforcement agency registration requirements and state and federal laws concerning labeling, packaging, advertising, handling and adulteration of prescription drugs and dispensing of controlled substances. noncompliance with applicable regulations by us or our third-party vendors could have material adverse effects on our business, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and reputation.
our pharmacy benefit management business also would be adversely affected by an inability to contract on favorable terms with pharmaceutical manufacturers and we could suffer exposure to liabilities and reputational harm in connection with purported errors by mail order or retail pharmacy businesses.
in operating onsite clinics and other types of medical facilities, we may be subject to additional liability that could result in significant time and expense.
in addition to contracting with physicians and other health care providers for services, we employ physicians and other health care professionals at onsite low acuity and primary care clinics that we operate for our customers, as well as certain clinics for our employees. in addition, our government business operates livingwell health centers and we own and operate multispecialty health care centers, low acuity clinics and other types of centers in the phoenix, arizona metropolitan area that employ physicians and other health care professionals. as a direct employer of health care professionals and as an owner or operator of medical facilities, we are subject to liability for negligent acts, omissions, or injuries occurring at one of these clinics or caused by one of our employees. even if any claims brought against us are unsuccessful or without merit, we still have to defend against such claims. the defense of any actions may result in significant expenses that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and reputation.
legal and compliance risks

our business is subject to substantial government regulation, as well as new laws or regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.

back to contents part i item 1a. risk factors jurisdictions and the rules and regulations of various governing bodies, such as those related to financial and other disclosures, corporate governance, privacy, data protection, labor and employment, consumer protection, tax and anti-corruption.
we must identify, assess and respond to new trends in the legislative and regulatory environment, as well as comply with the various existing regulations applicable to our business. existing or future laws, rules, regulatory interpretations or judgments could force us to change how we conduct our business, affect the products we offer, restrict revenue and enrollment growth, increase our costs, including operating, health care technology and administrative costs, and require enhancements to our compliance infrastructure and internal controls environment. existing or future laws and rules also could require us to take other actions such as changing our business practices, thereby increasing our liability in federal and state courts for coverage determinations, contract interpretation and other actions.
several bills were introduced in congress in 2017 to repeal and replace the aca, though none have passed the house and senate. discussions on the aca continue in congress. throughout 2017, president trump took several steps to limit the utility of the aca and continues to advocate for its repeal and replacement. the individual mandate was repealed effective january 1, 2019 as part of the u.s. tax reform legislation that was signed into law in december 2017. we are unable to predict how these events will ultimately be resolved and what the potential impact may be on the aca, and in turn, on our business including, but not limited to, our products, services, processes and technology and on our relationships with current and future customers, producers, vendors and health care providers. legal challenges regarding aspects of the aca, such as litigation regarding the payment of risk corridor receivables and cost sharing reduction subsidies, have contributed to this uncertainty. in addition, state legislatures have and will continue to focus on health care issues, particularly in light of the various aca amendments proposed by congress and the trump administration executive orders.
further, failure to effectively implement or adjust our strategic and operational initiatives, such as by reducing operating costs, adjusting premium pricing or benefit design or transforming our business model in response to regulatory changes may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows, including, but not limited to, our ability to maintain the value of our goodwill and other intangible assets.
our insurance and hmo subsidiaries must be licensed by and are subject to the regulations of the jurisdictions in which they conduct business. for example, hmos and insurance companies are regulated under specific state laws and regulations and indirectly affected by other health care-related laws and regulations. state regulations mandate minimum capital or restricted cash reserve requirements. in addition, state guaranty fund laws and related regulations subject us to assessments for certain obligations to policyholders and claimants of impaired or insolvent insurance companies. some states have similar laws relating to hmos and other payors, such as consumer operated and oriented plans (co-ops) established under the aca. any such assessment could expose us to the risk of paying a portion of an impaired or insolvent insurance company's claims through state guaranty association assessments. we also participate in the private exchange marketplace. whether and the extent to which states may issue regulations that apply to private exchanges remains uncertain.
in addition to the regulations discussed above, we are required to obtain and maintain insurance and other regulatory approvals to market many of our products, increase prices for certain regulated products and consummate some of our acquisitions and dispositions. delays in obtaining or failure to obtain or maintain these approvals could reduce our revenue or increase our costs.
the health care industry is also regularly subject to negative media attention, including as a result of the political environment and the ongoing debate concerning the aca. such publicity may adversely affect our stock price and reputation in certain markets.
for more information on regulation, see "business  regulation" in part i, item 1 of this form 10-k.
there are various risks associated with participating in government-sponsored programs, such as medicare, including dependence upon government funding, compliance with government contracts and increased regulatory oversight.
through our government business, we contract with cms and various state governmental agencies to provide managed health care services including medicare advantage plans and medicare-approved prescription drug plans. revenues from medicare programs are dependent, in whole or in part, upon annual funding from the federal government through cms and/or applicable state or local governments. funding for these programs is dependent on many factors outside our control including general economic conditions, continuing government efforts to contain health care costs and budgetary constraints at the federal or applicable state or local level and general political issues and priorities. these entities generally have the right to not renew or cancel their contracts with us on short notice without cause or if funds are not available. unanticipated changes in funding, such as the application of sequestration by the federal or state governments, could substantially reduce our revenues and profitability.
the medicare program has been the subject of regulatory reform initiatives, including the aca. the premium rates paid to medicare advantage plans and medicare part d plans are established by contract, although the rates differ depending on a combination of factors, many of which are outside our control. the aca ties a portion of each medicare advantage plan's and medicare part d plan's reimbursement to the plan's "star rating" by cms, with those plans receiving a rating of four or more stars eligible for quality-based bonus payments. the star rating system considers various measures adopted by cms, including, for example, quality of care, preventative services, chronic illness management, coverage determination appeals and customer satisfaction. the star rating system is subject to change annually by cms, which may make it more difficult to achieve four stars or greater. our medicare advantage plans' and medicare part d plans' operating results, premium revenue and benefit offerings are likely to continue to be significantly determined by their star ratings. if we fail to meet our expectations regarding star ratings, are unsuccessful in maintaining or improving our star ratings, fail to meet or exceed our competitors' ratings, or if quality-bonus payments are eliminated, our financial performance may be adversely affected. see part ii, item 7  management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of information  health care industry developments and other matters affecting our global health care segment for additional information on our star ratings.
contracts with cms and the various state governmental agencies contain certain provisions regarding data submission, provider network maintenance, provider directories, quality measures, claims payment, continuity of care, call center performance and other requirements. if we fail to comply with these requirements, we may be subject to administrative actions, fines or other penalties that could impact our profitability.

back to contents part i item 1a. risk factors the aca established health insurance exchanges for individuals and small employers. insurers participating on the health insurance exchanges are required to offer a minimum level of benefits and comply with requirements with respect to premium rates and coverage limitations. our participation in these exchanges involves uncertainties associated with mix and volume of business and could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. the executive order signed by president trump in october 2017 that halted payment of the cost sharing reduction subsidies has created additional uncertainty regarding the future of public health insurance exchanges.
in addition, any failure to comply with various state and federal health care laws and regulations, including those directed at preventing fraud and abuse in government funded programs, could result in investigations or litigation, such as actions under the federal false claims act and similar whistleblower statutes under state laws. this could subject us to fines, penalties or other enforcement actions, restrictions on our ability to market or enroll new customers, limits on expansion, restrictions or exclusions from programs or other agreements with federal or state governmental agencies that could adversely impact our business, cash flows, financial condition, results of operations and reputation.
in addition, our medicare advantage and medicare part d businesses face a number of other risks including potential uncollectible receivables resulting from processing and/or verifying enrollment, inadequate underwriting assumptions, inability to receive and process correct information or increased medical or pharmaceutical costs. actual results may be materially different than our assumptions and estimates regarding these complex and wide-ranging programs that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
we face risks related to litigation, regulatory audits and investigations.
we are routinely involved in numerous claims, lawsuits, regulatory audits, investigations and other legal matters arising, for the most part, in the ordinary course of business, including that of administering and insuring employee benefit programs. these legal matters could include benefit claims, breach of contract actions, tort claims, claims arising from consumer protection laws, claims disputes under federal or state laws and disputes regarding reinsurance arrangements, employment and employment discrimination-related suits, antitrust claims, employee benefit claims, wage and hour claims, tax, privacy, intellectual property and whistle blower claims, shareholder suits and other securities law claims and real estate disputes. in addition, we have incurred and likely will continue to incur liability for practices and claims related to our health care business, such as marketing misconduct, failure to timely or appropriately pay for or provide health care, provider network structure, poor outcomes for care delivered or arranged, provider disputes including disputes over compensation or contractual provisions, and claims related to our administration of self-funded business. there are currently, and may be in the future, attempts to bring class action lawsuits against the company and the industry; individual plaintiffs also may bring multiple claims regarding the same subject matter against us and other companies in our industry.
with respect to our global operations, contractual rights, tax positions, laws and regulations may be subject to interpretation or uncertainty to a greater degree than in the united states, and therefore subject us to disputes by customers, governmental authorities or others. foreign laws and rules and regulatory audit and investigative practices may differ from or be more stringent than, similar requirements in the united states.
court decisions and legislative activity may increase our exposure for any of these types of claims. in some cases, substantial non-economic or punitive damages may be sought. we seek to procure insurance coverage to cover some of these potential liabilities. however, certain potential liabilities may not be covered by insurance, insurers may dispute coverage or the amount of insurance may be insufficient to cover the entire damages awarded. in addition, certain types of damages, such as punitive damages, may not be covered by insurance, and insurance coverage for all or certain forms of liability may become unavailable or prohibitively expensive in the future. it is possible that the resolution of current or future legal matters and claims could result in changes to our industry and business practices, losses material to our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity or damage to our reputation.
we are frequently the subject of regulatory market conduct and other reviews, audits and investigations by state insurance and health and welfare departments, attorneys general, cms and the oig and comparable authorities in foreign jurisdictions. with respect to our medicare advantage and medicare part d businesses, cms and oig perform audits to determine a health plan's compliance with federal regulations and contractual obligations, including compliance with proper coding practices and fraud and abuse enforcement practices through audits designed to detect and correct improper payments. the department of justice is conducting an industry review of the risk adjustment data submission practices and business processes, including review of medical charts, of medicare advantage organizations under medicare parts c and d. there also continues to be heightened review by federal and state regulators of business and reporting practices within the health care, disability and life insurance industry, including with respect to claims payment and related escheat practices, and increased scrutiny by other state and federal governmental agencies (such as state attorneys general) empowered to bring criminal actions in circumstances that could have previously given rise only to civil or administrative proceedings. these regulatory audits or reviews or actions by other governmental agencies could result in changes to our business practices, retroactive adjustments to certain premiums, significant fines, penalties, civil liabilities, criminal liabilities or other sanctions, including restrictions on our ability to market certain products or engage in business-related activities, that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation, financial condition and liquidity. in addition, disclosure of an adverse investigation or audit or the imposition of fines or other sanctions could negatively affect our reputation in certain markets and make it more difficult for us to sell our products and services.
a description of material pending legal actions and other legal and regulatory matters is included in note 21 to our consolidated financial statements included in this form 10-k. the outcome of litigation and other legal or regulatory matters is always uncertain.
if we fail to comply with applicable privacy, security and data laws, regulations and standards, our business and reputation could be materially and adversely affected.
the collection, maintenance, protection, use, transmission, disclosure and disposal of sensitive personal information are regulated at the federal, state, international and industry levels and requirements are imposed on us by contracts with clients. in some cases, such laws, rules, regulations and contractual requirements also apply to our vendors and require us to obtain written assurances of their compliance with such requirements or may hold us liable for any violations by our vendors. international laws, rules and regulations governing the use and disclosure of such information are generally more stringent than in the united states, and they vary across jurisdictions. we also are subject to various other consumer protection laws that regulate our communications with customers.

back to contents part i item 1a. risk factors these laws, rules, and contractual requirements are subject to change. compliance with new privacy, security and data laws, regulations and requirements may result in increased operating costs, and may constrain or require us to alter our business model or operations. for example, the hitech amendments to hipaa may further restrict our ability to collect, disclose and use sensitive personal information and may impose additional compliance requirements on our business.
hipaa requires covered entities to comply with the hipaa privacy, security and breach rules. in addition, business associates must comply with the hipaa security and breach requirements. while we provide for appropriate protections through our contracts with our third-party service providers and in certain cases assess their security controls, we have limited oversight or control over their actions and practices. several of our businesses act as business associates to their covered entity customers and, as a result, collect, use, disclose and maintain sensitive personal information in order to provide services to these customers. hhs has continued its audit program to assess hipaa compliance efforts by covered entities and has expanded it to include business associates. in addition, hhs has increased its enforcement efforts. these efforts result in enforcement actions that are the result of investigations brought on by the notification to hhs of a breach. an audit resulting in findings or allegations of noncompliance or the implementation of an enforcement action could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, cash flows and reputation.
effective prevention, detection and control systems are critical to maintain regulatory compliance and prevent fraud and failure of these systems could adversely affect us.
federal and state governments have made investigating and prosecuting health care and other insurance fraud and abuse a priority. fraud and abuse prohibitions encompass a wide range of activities including kickbacks for referral of customers, billing for unnecessary medical services, improper marketing and violations of patient privacy rights. the regulations and contractual requirements applicable to us are complex and subject to change. in addition, ongoing vigorous law enforcement, a highly technical regulatory scheme and the dodd-frank act legislation and related regulations enhance regulators' enforcement powers and whistleblower incentives and protections. our compliance efforts in this area will continue to require significant resources. failure of our prevention, detection or control systems related to regulatory compliance or the failure of employees to comply with our internal policies including data systems security or unethical conduct by managers and employees, could adversely affect our reputation and also expose us to litigation and other proceedings, fines and penalties.
in addition, provider or customer fraud that is not prevented or detected could impact our medical costs or those of our self-insured clients. further, during an economic downturn, we may experience increased fraudulent claims volume that may lead to additional costs due to an increase in disputed claims and litigation.
economic risks

significant stock market or interest rate declines could result in additional unfunded pension obligations resulting in the need for additional plan funding by us and increased pension expenses.
we currently have unfunded obligations in our frozen pension plans. a significant decline in the value of the plans' equity and fixed income investments or unfavorable changes in applicable laws or regulations could materially increase our expenses and change the timing and amount of required plan funding. this could reduce the cash available to us, including our subsidiaries. we also are exposed to interest rate and equity risk associated with our pension and other post-retirement obligations. sustained declines in interest rates could have an adverse impact on the funded status of our pension plans and our reinvestment yield on new investments. see note 15 to our consolidated financial statements for more information on our obligations under the pension plan.
significant changes in market interest rates affect the value of our financial instruments that promise a fixed return or benefit and the value of particular assets and liabilities.
as an insurer, we have substantial investment assets that support insurance and contractholder deposit liabilities. generally low levels of interest rates on investments, such as those experienced in u.s. and foreign financial markets during recent years, have negatively impacted our level of investment income earned in recent periods.
a substantial portion of our investment assets are in fixed interest-yielding debt securities of varying maturities, fixed redeemable preferred securities and commercial mortgage loans. the value of these investment assets can fluctuate significantly with changes in market conditions. a rise in interest rates would likely reduce the value of our investment portfolio and increase interest expense if we were to access our available lines of credit.
a downgrade in the financial strength ratings of our insurance subsidiaries could adversely affect new sales and retention of current business, and a downgrade in our debt ratings would increase the cost of borrowed funds and could negatively affect our ability to access capital.
financial strength, claims paying ability and debt ratings by recognized rating organizations are each important factors in establishing the competitive position of insurance and health benefits companies. ratings information by nationally recognized ratings agencies is broadly disseminated and generally used throughout the industry. we believe that the claims paying ability and financial strength ratings of our principal insurance subsidiaries are important factors in marketing our products to certain customers. our debt ratings impact both the cost and availability of future borrowings and, accordingly, our cost of capital. each of the rating agencies reviews ratings periodically and there can be no assurance that current ratings will be maintained in the future. a downgrade of these ratings in the future could make it more difficult to either market our products successfully or raise capital to support business growth within our insurance subsidiaries.

back to contents part i item 1a. risk factors global market, economic and geopolitical conditions may cause fluctuations in equity market prices, interest rates and credit spreads that could impact our ability to raise or deploy capital and affect our overall liquidity.
if the equity and credit markets experience extreme volatility and disruption, there could be downward pressure on stock prices and access to capital for certain issuers without regard to those issuers' underlying financial strength. extreme disruption in the credit markets could adversely impact our availability and cost of capital in the future.
as of december 31, 2017, our outstanding long-term debt totaled $5.2 billion. in the event of adverse economic and industry conditions, we may be required to dedicate a greater percentage of our cash flow from operations to the payment of principal and interest on our debt, thereby reducing the funds we have available for other purposes, such as investments and other expenditures in ongoing businesses, acquisitions, dividends and stock repurchases. in these circumstances, our ability to execute our strategy may be limited, our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in business and market conditions may be reduced, or our access to capital markets may be limited such that additional capital may not be available or may be available only on unfavorable terms.
unfavorable developments in economic conditions may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
many factors, including geopolitical issues, future economic downturns, availability and cost of credit and other capital and consumer spending can negatively impact the u.s. and global economies. our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected by the impact of unfavorable economic conditions on our customers (both employers and individuals), health care providers and third-party vendors. for example:

employers may take action to reduce their operating costs by modifying, delaying or canceling plans to purchase our products or making changes in the mix of products purchased that are unfavorable to us.

higher unemployment rates and workforce reductions could result in lower enrollment in our employer-based plans (including an increase in the number of employees who opt out of employer-based plans) or our individual plans.

because of unfavorable economic conditions or the aca, employers may stop offering health care coverage to employees or elect to offer this coverage on a voluntary, employee-funded basis as a means to reduce their operating costs.

our historical disability claim experience and industry data indicate that submitted disability claims rise under adverse economic conditions.

if customers are not successful in generating sufficient funds or are precluded from securing financing, they may not be able to pay, or may delay payment of, accounts receivable that are owed to us.

our customers or potential customers may force us to compete more vigorously on factors such as price and service to retain or obtain their business.

a prolonged unfavorable economic environment could adversely impact the financial position of hospitals and other health care providers, potentially increasing our medical costs as these providers attempt to maintain revenue levels in their efforts to adjust to their own economic challenges.

our third-party vendors could significantly and quickly increase their prices or reduce their output to reduce their operating costs. our business depends on our ability to perform necessary business functions in an efficient and uninterrupted fashion.
these factors could lead to a decrease in our customer base, revenues or margins and/or an increase in our operating costs.
in addition, during a prolonged unfavorable economic environment, state and federal budgets could be materially and adversely affected, resulting in reduced or delayed reimbursements or payments in state and federal government programs such as medicare and social security. these state and federal budgetary pressures also could cause the government to impose new or a higher level of taxes or assessments on us, such as premium taxes on insurance companies and hmos and surcharges or fees on select fee-for-service and capitated medical claims. although we could attempt to mitigate or cover our exposure from such increased costs through, among other things, increases in premiums, there can be no assurance that we will be able to mitigate or cover all of such costs, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
we are subject to the credit risk of our reinsurers.
we enter into reinsurance arrangements with other insurance companies, primarily to limit losses from large exposures or to permit recovery of a portion of direct losses. we also may enter into reinsurance arrangements in connection with acquisition or divestiture transactions when the underwriting company is not being acquired or sold.
under all reinsurance arrangements, reinsurers assume insured losses, subject to certain limitations or exceptions that may include a loss limit. these arrangements also subject us to various obligations, representations and warranties with the reinsurers. reinsurance does not relieve us of liability as the originating insurer. we remain liable to the underlying policyholders if a reinsurer defaults on obligations under the reinsurance arrangement. although we regularly evaluate the financial condition of reinsurers to minimize exposure to significant losses from reinsurer insolvencies, reinsurers may become financially unsound. if a reinsurer fails to meet its obligations under the reinsurance contract or if the liabilities exceed any applicable loss limit, we will be forced to cover the claims on the reinsured policies.
the collectability of amounts due from reinsurers is subject to uncertainty arising from a number of factors, including whether the insured losses meet the qualifying conditions of the reinsurance contract, whether reinsurers or their affiliates have the financial capacity and willingness to make payments under the terms of the reinsurance contract, and the magnitude and type of collateral supporting our reinsurance recoverable, such as holding sufficient qualifying assets in trusts or letters of credit issued. although a portion of our reinsurance exposures are secured, the inability to collect a material recovery from a reinsurer could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.

management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ("md&a") is intended to provide information to assist you in better understanding and evaluating our financial condition and results of operations. we encourage you to read this md&a in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k ("form 10-k") and the "risk factors" contained in part i, item 1a of this form 10-k.
unless otherwise indicated, financial information in the md&a is presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america ("gaap"). see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the company's significant accounting policies. in some of our financial tables in this md&a, we present either percentage changes or "n/m" when those changes are so large as to become not meaningful. changes in percentages are expressed in basis points ("bps").
in this md&a, our consolidated measures "operating revenues" and "adjusted income from operations" are not determined in accordance with gaap and should not be viewed as substitutes for the most directly comparable gaap measures "total revenues" and "shareholders' net income."
we define operating revenues as total revenues excluding realized investment results. we exclude realized investment results from this measure because our portfolio managers may sell investments based on factors largely unrelated to the underlying business purposes of each segment. as a result, gains or losses created in this process may not be indicative of past or future underlying performance of our businesses.
we use adjusted income from operations as our principal financial measure of operating performance because management believes it best reflects the underlying results of our business operations and permits analysis of trends in underlying revenue, expenses and profitability. we define adjusted income from operations as shareholders' net income excluding after-tax realized investment gains and losses, net amortization of other acquired intangible assets and special items. income or expense amounts are excluded from adjusted income from operations for the following reasons:

realized investment results are excluded because, as noted above, our portfolio managers may sell investments based on factors largely unrelated to the underlying business purposes of each segment.

net amortization of other intangible assets is excluded because it relates to costs incurred for acquisitions and, as a result, it does not relate to the core performance of the company's business operations. in 2015, the amortization amount was net of a bargain purchase gain on an acquisition.

special items are excluded because management believes they are not representative of the underlying results of operations. see note 22 to our consolidated financial statements for descriptions of special items.

back to contents part ii item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations
2017 versus 2016  increase due to higher adjusted income from operations across our reporting segments. debt extinguishment costs and charges resulting from u.s. tax reform, both reported as special items in
2017, partially offset these increases.
2016 versus 2015  decrease due to lower adjusted income from operations, primarily in the group disability and life segment. increased special item charges in 2016 (primarily higher transaction costs and the 2016 risk corridor allowance) also contributed to the decline.
2017 versus 2016  increase driven by higher earnings in each of our ongoing reportable segments. these increases were primarily a result of customer growth in global health care and global supplemental benefits and increased specialty contributions in global health care. improved claim experience in group disability and life also contributed to the increase.
2016 versus 2015  decrease was a result of significantly lower earnings in group disability and life reflecting unfavorable claim experience. costs related to the government segment's response to the centers for medicare and medicaid services ("cms") audit also contributed to the decline. increased earnings contributions in global supplemental benefits and the commercial segment partially offset those unfavorable impacts.

2017 versus 2016 and 2016 versus 2015  increases in both 2017 and 2016 reflected growth in targeted markets for our commercial segment. in 2017, these favorable effects were partially offset by expected disenrollment in the government segment.

key developments

u.s. tax reform legislation major u.s. tax reform legislation was signed into law on december 22, 2017. the legislation is highlighted by a reduction in the corporate income tax rate from the current 35% to 21% effective january 1, 2018. as further described on page 39 of this form 10-k, we expect a significant decline in our effective tax rate beginning in 2018 as a result of the rate reduction. the remaining provisions of the law, most of which take effect on january 1, 2018, are not expected to have a material impact on the company's results of operations beginning in 2018.
we recorded additional tax expense of $232 million in 2017 resulting from this legislation, comprised of $144 million due to the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities to reflect the reduction in the corporate tax rate and $88 million due to the assessment of u.s. taxes related to the company's accumulated unremitted foreign earnings. the legislation provides an election to pay these taxes over eight years and we expect to adopt this election. both the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and the taxes on accumulated unremitted foreign earnings are considered provisional as certain adjustments used to calculate the tax at year-end were based on estimates.

back to contents part ii item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations also as a result of tax reform, the company recorded a reduction in operating expenses of $56 million ($36 million after-tax) reflecting a decrease in a liability to reimburse a reinsurer for taxes related to a block of business sold through reinsurance. an offsetting tax effect is included in the $144 million charge discussed above, resulting in no after-tax effect for this item.
see note 20 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information.
termination of proposed merger with anthem, inc.
on may 12, 2017, we announced that the merger agreement between cigna and anthem, inc. had been terminated.


revenues.  the components of revenue changes are discussed further below:
premiums. the increase in 2017 compared with 2016 was primarily due to customer growth in the commercial segment and in global supplemental benefits. expected decreases in government segment premiums due to medicare disenrollment partially offset these increases. in 2016, premiums increased compared with 2015, reflecting customer growth in global health care, global supplemental benefits as well as group disability and life. rate actions in our commercial health care businesses consistent with medical cost trend also contributed to these increases.
fees and other revenues. the increases in both 2017 and 2016
compared with each prior year primarily reflected growth from specialty products offered through our global health care segment and an increased customer base for our administrative services only business.
net investment income increased in 2017 compared with 2016
driven by growth in average invested assets partially offset by lower yields. in 2016, net investment income decreased slightly compared with 2015, as lower investment yields in the protracted low interest rate environment were partially offset by higher average invested assets. unfavorable foreign currency effects also contributed to the declines in 2016.
mail order pharmacy revenues were flat in 2017 compared with
2016, reflecting increased commercial customers, specialty medication prices and utilization (e.g., certain injectables) offset by lower oral medication volumes and medicare customers. in 2016, mail order pharmacy revenues increased compared with 2015, driven by greater volume, primarily for specialty medications due to our higher customer base and increased utilization. in each period, changes in mail order pharmacy costs were driven by the same factors as mail order pharmacy revenues.
realized investment results increased in 2017 compared with
2016 primarily due to higher gains on sales of alternative and real estate investments as well as lower impairment losses. realized investment results increased in 2016 compared with 2015 due to significantly lower impairment losses.

global health care medical costs.  the increases in 2017 and 2016 compared with each prior year resulted primarily from customer growth in our commercial health care businesses and medical cost trend. in 2017, the impact of medicare disenrollment partially offset these effects.

other benefit expenses  declined slightly in 2017 compared with 2016 as improvements in our disability and life claims experience were largely offset by customer growth in global supplemental benefits. the increase in 2016 compared with 2015 was driven by unfavorable disability and life claim experience due primarily to changes in the disability claims management process in 2016 and elevated life claims during the second quarter of 2016. business growth in our group disability and life and global supplemental benefits segments also contributed to the 2016 increase.

other operating expenses.  in 2017, the increase in other operating expenses compared with 2016 reflected debt extinguishment costs, a long-term care guaranty fund assessment and higher volume-based expenses reflecting business growth. these increases were offset by the moratorium on the health insurance industry tax in 2017 and a reduction in costs related to our cms audit response. the increase in 2016 compared with 2015 was due to costs associated with our cms audit response, business growth, strategic investment across our segments and special item charges including transaction-related costs and a risk corridor allowance described in note 22 to our consolidated financial statements.

amortization of other acquired intangible assets, net.  the decrease in 2017 compared with 2016 was driven by the expected continuing decline in amortization from our 2012 acquisition of healthspring, inc. the increase in 2016 compared with 2015 was driven by the absence of the $23 million bargain purchase gain recorded in 2015 for an acquisition. this factor was partially offset by the decline in our healthspring, inc. amortization.

the consolidated effective tax rate  was flat in 2017 compared with 2016. the unfavorable impact of additional tax expense associated with the recently enacted u.s. tax reform legislation was offset by the favorable effects of a moratorium on the health insurance industry tax in 2017 and an incremental tax benefit associated with previously non-deductible transaction-related costs. see note 20 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information. the increase in our effective tax rate in 2016 compared with 2015 was largely driven by an increase in non-tax deductible transaction-related costs reported in 2016, partially offset by the tax benefits on stock compensation recognized in net income as a result of our early adoption of accounting standard update ("asu") 2016-09.
we expect our effective tax rate in 2018 to decrease significantly from 2017 as a result of enactment of the u.s. tax reform legislation. this favorable effect will be partially offset by the resumption of the health insurance industry tax.

part ii item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations health care industry developments and other matters affecting our global health care segment

the "regulation" section of this form 10-k provides a detailed description of the patient protection and affordable care act (the "aca") provisions and other legislative initiatives that impact our health care business, including regulations issued by cms and the departments of the treasury and health and human services ("hhs"). in october 2017, president trump issued an executive order that could result in a variety of changes to the individual and group health insurance markets when implemented. at this time, we are unable to determine the effect, if any, of these changes on our business or results of operations. in addition, the president ordered the immediate cessation of cost sharing reduction subsidy payments to insurers. discussions on the aca continue in the u.s. congress. the table presented below provides an update of the impact of these items and other matters affecting our global health care segment as of december 31, 2017.
item                                    description medicare advantage ("ma")               cms sanctions: on june 16, 2017, the company received notification from cms that the marketing and enrollment sanctions imposed by cms on january 21, 2016 had been lifted.
cigna has resumed marketing of its medicare advantage-prescription drug and medicare part d plans and began enrolling beneficiaries with effective dates beginning july 1, 2017.
for the year ended december 31, 2017, medicare enrollment and consolidated revenues were materially impacted due to our inability to participate in 2017 annual enrollment. however, 2017 shareholders' net income was not materially affected because the margin impact of the revenue loss was offset by lower operating expenses due to reduced remediation costs and other operational efficiencies that improved 2017 results. the impact of disenrollment was not material to 2016 consolidated revenues or earnings.
medicare star quality ratings ("star ratings"): medicare advantage plans must have a star rating of four stars or higher to qualify for bonus payments. we expect that approximately 60% of our medicare advantage customers will be in a four star or greater plan for bonus payments to be received in 2018. in october 2017, cms announced star ratings for plans for the 2019 payment year. we expect that approximately 40% of our medicare advantage customers will be in a four star or greater plan for bonus payments to be received in 2019. management continues to evaluate various actions to improve the company's star ratings.
2018 and 2019 ma rates: final ma reimbursement rates for 2018 were published by cms in april 2017.
preliminary ma reimbursement rates for 2019 were published by cms in february 2018. we expect these changes in rates to have an immaterial impact on our consolidated results of operations in 2018 and 2019.
aca taxes and fees                      health insurance industry tax: federal legislation imposed a moratorium on the health insurance industry tax for 2017 and 2019. the industry tax is being assessed in 2018 and, under
 industry tax                          current law, will return again in 2020 and beyond. for 2017, our premium rates reflected the moratorium and we would expect our target pricing actions to reflect the moratorium in 2019. the amount of the tax was approximately $310 million in both 2016 and 2015 ($170 million for commercial and $140 million for government in each year).
the industry tax for cigna in 2018 is expected to approximate $390 million ($260 million for commercial and $130 million for government). for our commercial business, the fee is reflected in our 2018 premium rates, and is expected to result in an immaterial effect on shareholders' net income. for our medicare business, we anticipate that the earnings impact of the tax will be more significant than in our commercial business. however, we expect to offset its earnings impact in 2018 with benefit and pricing changes as well as growth. because this tax is not deductible for federal income tax purposes, it will negatively impact our effective tax rate in 2018.
 reinsurance fee                       reinsurance fee: this fee was applicable only from 2014 through 2016. for our insured business, the amount of the fee was approximately $45 million in 2016 and $70 million in 2015.
public health exchanges                 market participation: for 2017, we offered individual coverage on seven public health insurance exchanges in the following states: colorado, illinois, maryland, missouri, north carolina, tennessee and virginia. for 2018, we are offering individual coverage on the same exchanges with the exception of maryland.
cost sharing reduction subsidies: the aca provides for cost sharing reductions that lower the amount that qualifying customers pay for deductibles, copayments and coinsurance. the federal government has provided funding for the cost sharing reduction subsidies to the qualifying customer's insurer. in october 2017, the trump administration stopped payment of these subsidies to insurers. the attorneys general of 18 states and the district of columbia have sued the trump administration, seeking to require the administration to continue paying these subsidies. while the litigation is at a preliminary stage, on october 25, 2017, the court denied the request of the attorneys general for an injunction, allowing the government to cease providing the cost sharing reduction payments to insurers during the pendency of the matter. we will continue to monitor developments as the case proceeds. the impact of suspending cost sharing reduction subsidies was not material to 2017 consolidated earnings. our pricing actions for the 2018 plan year have anticipated that the government would no longer pay for these subsidies, and we expect the impact on our future results of operations to be immaterial.
individual mandate repeal: the u.s. tax reform legislation also repealed the penalty charged to individuals without health insurance (known as the "individual mandate") effective january 1, 2019. while the impact on future premium rates and enrollment in the individual market is uncertain, we expect this repeal to have an immaterial impact on our future results of operations.

(1)
risk adjustment and risk corridor receivables, net of allowances, are reported in premiums, accounts and notes receivable in the consolidated balance sheets. risk adjustment receivables totaled $69 million as of december 31, 2017 and $52 million as of december 31, 2016.
(2)
risk adjustment payables are reported in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. risk adjustment payables totaled $250 million as of december 31, 2017 and $51 million as of december 31, 2016.
(3)
reinsurance receivables are reported in reinsurance recoverables.
in 2016, we recorded an allowance for the balance of our risk corridor receivable based on court decisions and the large risk corridor program deficit. as of december 31, 2017, we continued to hold an allowance for the balance of our risk corridor receivable of $109 million based on the current status of court decisions. however, we continue to believe that the government has a binding obligation to satisfy the risk corridor receivable.
liquidity and capital resources


short-term investments               $199            $691            $381
cash and cash equivalents          $2,972          $3,185          $1,968
short-term debt                      $240            $276            $149
long-term debt                     $5,199          $4,756          $5,020
shareholders' equity              $13,735         $13,723         $12,035
liquidity

we maintain liquidity at two levels: the subsidiary level and the parent company level.
liquidity requirements at the subsidiary level generally consist of:
 medical costs and benefit payments to policyholders;  expense requirements, primarily for employee compensation and benefits, information technology and facilities costs; and  income taxes.
our subsidiaries normally meet their operating requirements by:
 maintaining appropriate levels of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments;  using cash flows from operating activities;
 matching investment durations to those estimated for the related insurance and contractholder liabilities;  selling investments; and  borrowing from affiliates, subject to applicable regulatory limits.
liquidity requirements at the parent company level generally consist of:
 debt service and dividend payments to shareholders;  pension plan funding; and  repurchases of common stock.
the parent company normally meets its liquidity requirements by:
 maintaining appropriate levels of cash and various types of marketable investments;  collecting dividends from its subsidiaries;
 using proceeds from issuance of debt and equity securities; and  borrowing from its subsidiaries, subject to applicable regulatory limits.
cash flows for the years ended december 31, were as follows:

net cash provided by operating activities (1)(2)       $4,086            $4,026            $2,933
net cash (used in) investing activities (2)            $(1,703)          $(2,574)          $(1,736)
net cash (used in) financing activities (1)            $(2,651)          $(225)            $(609)
(1)
as required in adopting asu 2016-09 in 2016, we retrospectively reclassified $79 million of cash payments from operating to financing activities in 2015. these payments were related to employee tax obligations associated with stock compensation. the comparable amounts reported in financing activities were $61 million in 2017 and $72 million in 2016.
(2)
as required in adopting asu 2016-15 in 2016, the company retrospectively reclassified cash distributions from partnership earnings of $137 million from investing to operating activities in 2015. the comparable amounts reported in operating activities were $161 million in 2017 and $144 million in 2016.

part ii item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations operating activities cash flows from operating activities consist of cash receipts and disbursements for premiums and fees, mail order pharmacy, other revenues, investment income, taxes, benefits and expenses. because certain income and expense transactions do not generate cash, and because cash transactions related to revenues and expenses may occur in periods different from when those revenues and expenses are recognized in shareholders' net income, cash flows from operating activities can be significantly different from shareholders' net income.
cash flows from operating activities increased slightly in 2017 compared with 2016 primarily driven by higher net income, partially offset by lower receipts from medicare part d and medicare advantage programs and a voluntary pension contribution of $150 million in 2017.
cash flows from operating activities increased in 2016 compared with 2015 due to higher receipts from medicare part d and medicare advantage programs.
investing activities cash flows from investing activities generally consist of net investment purchases or sales and net purchases of property and equipment including capitalized software, as well as cash used to acquire businesses.
cash used in investing activities decreased in 2017 compared with 2016, primarily due to lower net investment purchases. in 2017, more cash was deployed to share repurchase than investment purchases in accordance with our capital management strategy discussed in the below "capital resources" section of this md&a.
cash used in investing activities increased in 2016 compared with 2015, due to higher purchases of fixed maturity investments.
financing activities cash flows from financing activities are generally comprised of issuances and re-payment of debt at the parent company level, proceeds on the issuance of common stock resulting from stock option exercises, and stock repurchases. in addition, the subsidiaries report deposits to and withdrawals from investment contract liabilities (including universal life insurance liabilities) because such liabilities are considered financing activities with policyholders.
cash used in financing activities increased in 2017 compared with 2016, primarily due to higher share repurchases. the 2017 proceeds from the company's $1.6 billion debt issuance were largely offset by $1.3 billion paid to extinguish $1.0 billion of debt, as well as repaying maturing debt in the first quarter of 2017.
cash used in financing activities decreased in 2016 compared with 2015, primarily due to lower share repurchases offset by lower proceeds from employees' exercise of stock options.
share repurchase we maintain a share repurchase program, authorized by our board of directors. under this program, we may repurchase shares from time to time, depending on market conditions and alternate uses of capital. the timing and actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including price, general business and market conditions, and alternate uses of capital. the share repurchase program may be effected through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions in compliance with rule 10b-18 under the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended, including through rule 10b5-1 trading plans. the program may be suspended or discontinued at any time.
in 2017, we repurchased 15.7 million shares for $2.8 billion. from january 1, 2018 through january 31, 2018 we repurchased 1.2 million shares for approximately $260 million. we repurchased 0.8 million shares for $110 million in 2016 and 5.5 million shares for $683 million in 2015.
interest expense

interest expense on long-term debt, short-term debt and capital leases was as follows:

interest expense       $243          $251          $252
interest expense reported above excluded losses on the early extinguishment of debt.
the weighted average interest rate for outstanding short-term debt (primarily commercial paper) was 1.63% as of december 31, 2017. there was no commercial paper outstanding as of december 31, 2016.
capital resources

our capital resources (primarily retained earnings and proceeds from the issuance of debt and equity securities) provide protection for policyholders, furnish the financial strength to underwrite insurance risks and facilitate continued business growth.
management, guided by regulatory requirements and rating agency capital guidelines, determines the amount of capital resources that we maintain. management allocates resources to new long-term business commitments when returns, considering the risks, look promising and when the resources available to support existing business are adequate.

back to contents part ii item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations we prioritize our use of capital resources to:

provide the capital necessary to support growth and maintain or improve the financial strength ratings of subsidiaries and to fund pension obligations;

consider acquisitions that are strategically and economically advantageous; and

return capital to investors through share repurchase.
the availability of capital resources will be impacted by equity and credit market conditions. extreme volatility in credit or equity market conditions may reduce our ability to issue debt or equity securities.
liquidity and capital resources outlook

at december 31, 2017, there was approximately $1.2 billion in cash and marketable investments available at the parent company level. in 2018, the parent company's combined cash obligations are expected to approximate $480 million for repayment of debt, interest and dividends. we expect to have sufficient liquidity to meet the obligations discussed above, based on the parent company's current cash position and current projections for subsidiary dividends. in addition, we actively monitor our debt obligations and engage in issuance or redemption activities as needed in accordance with our capital management strategy.
our cash projections may not be realized and the demand for funds could exceed available cash if our ongoing businesses experience unexpected shortfalls in earnings, or we experience material adverse effects from one or more risks or uncertainties described more fully in the risk factors section of this form 10-k. in those cases, we expect to have the flexibility to satisfy liquidity needs through a variety of measures, including intercompany borrowings. the parent company may borrow up to $1.1 billion from its insurance subsidiaries without additional state approval. we have additional liquidity available through short-term commercial paper borrowings and a committed $1.5 billion revolving credit facility. the revolving credit and letter of credit agreement is subject to the maximum debt leverage covenant. as of december 31, 2017, we have $9.3 billion of maximum borrowing capacity in the debt leverage covenant, in addition to the $5.4 billion of debt outstanding. see note 5 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the credit facility.
though we believe we have adequate sources of liquidity, significant disruption or volatility in the capital and credit markets could affect our ability to access those markets for additional borrowings or increase costs associated with borrowing funds.
the state of illinois continues to experience financial difficulties; however, some of their immediate cash flow constraints were alleviated by a bond offering issued during the fourth quarter of 2017. as a result, we have collected most of the receivables due as of december 31, 2017. the remaining amount due to us from the state of illinois under our commercial and medicaid contracts as of december 31, 2017 was immaterial. as of december 31, 2017, all of our contracts with the state of illinois had been terminated.
we continue to maintain a capital management strategy to retain overseas a significant portion of the earnings from our foreign operations. these undistributed earnings are deployed outside of the united states predominantly in support of the liquidity and regulatory capital requirements of our foreign operations as well as to support growth initiatives overseas. as a result of the u.s. tax reform legislation enacted in december 2017, we recorded additional u.s. taxes of $88 million related to these undistributed earnings. the legislation provides an election to pay these taxes over eight years. we expect to adopt that election.
unfunded pension plan liability.   as of december 31, 2017, our unfunded pension liability was $688 million, reflecting a decrease of $223 million from december 31, 2016. the decrease in the unfunded liability reflected strong investment asset returns and a contribution of $150 million in 2017, partially offset by the impact of a decrease in discount rates of approximately 45 basis points. no contributions are required in 2018 under the pension protection act of 2006. see note 15 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our pension plans.
guarantees and contractual obligations

we are contingently liable for various contractual obligations entered into in the ordinary course of business. see the "liquidity and capital resources" section of this md&a beginning on page 41 for additional background on how we manage our liquidity requirements related to these obligations. the maturities of our primary contractual cash obligations, as of december 31, 2017, are estimated to be as follows:

on-balance sheet insurance liabilities contractholder deposit funds                   $6,797             $706              $907              $739              $4,445

back to contents part ii item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations on balance sheet:


insurance liabilities.  excluded from the table above are $5 billion of insurance liabilities associated with the sold retirement benefits and individual life insurance and annuity businesses, as well as the reinsured workers' compensation, personal accident and supplemental benefits businesses ($3 billion in contractholder deposit funds; $2 billion in future policy benefits) as their related net cash flows are not expected to impact our cash flows. excluding these amounts, the sum of the obligations presented above exceeds the corresponding insurance and contractholder liabilities of $21 billion recorded on the balance sheet because some of the recorded insurance liabilities reflect discounting for interest and the recorded contractholder liabilities exclude future interest crediting, charges and fees. the timing and amount of actual future cash flows may differ from those presented above as actual results differ from those assumed.
contractholder deposit funds: see note 2(f) to our consolidated financial statements for our accounting policy for this liability. expected future cash flows presented above also include estimated future interest crediting on current fund balances based on current investment yields less the estimated cost of insurance charges and mortality and administrative fees for universal life policies.
future policy benefits, global health care medical costs payable and unpaid claims and claim expenses: see notes 2(g), 7 and 8 to our consolidated financial statements for our accounting policies for these liabilities. expected future cash flows for these liabilities presented in the table above are undiscounted. the expected future cash flows for guaranteed minimum death benefit ("gmdb," reported in future policy benefits) do not consider any of the related reinsurance arrangements.

short-term debt represents current maturities of long-term debt and related interest payments, and current obligations under capital leases.

long-term debt includes scheduled interest payments. capital leases are included in long-term debt and primarily represent obligations for information technology network storage, servers and equipment.

other long-term liabilities include estimated payments for guaranteed minimum income benefit ("gmib") contracts (without considering any related reinsurance arrangements), pension and other postretirement and postemployment benefit obligations, supplemental and deferred compensation plans, interest rate and foreign currency swap contracts, and reinsurance liabilities. these items are presented in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. estimated payments of $68 million for deferred compensation, non-qualified and international pension plans and other postretirement and postemployment benefit plans are expected to be paid in less than one year and are included in the table above. we do not expect to make any additional contributions to the qualified domestic pension plans during 2018. we expect to make payments subsequent to 2018 for these obligations; however, subsequent payments have been excluded from the table as their timing is based on plan assumptions that may materially differ from actual activities. see note 15 to our consolidated financial statements for further information on pension and other postretirement benefit obligations.
off-balance sheet:

purchase obligations.   as of december 31, 2017, purchase obligations consisted of estimated payments required under contractual arrangements for future services and investment commitments as follows:

fixed maturities                                               $118
commercial mortgage loans                                      21
limited liability entities (other long-term investments)             1,178
total investment commitments                                         1,317
future service commitments                                             489
total purchase obligations                                     $1,806
see note 11 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information.
our estimated future service commitments primarily represent contracts for certain outsourced business processes and information technology maintenance and support. we generally have the ability to terminate these agreements, but do not anticipate doing so at this time. purchase obligations exclude contracts that are cancelable without penalty and those that do not contractually require minimum levels of goods or services to be purchased.
operating leases.   for additional information, see note 18 to our consolidated financial statements.
guarantees

we are contingently liable for various financial and other guarantees provided in the ordinary course of business. see note 21 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on guarantees.
critical accounting estimates

the preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if:

it requires assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made; and

changes in the estimate or different estimates that could have been selected could have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition.
management has discussed the development and selection of its critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed the disclosures presented below.
in addition to the estimates presented in the following table, there are other accounting estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements, including estimates of liabilities for future policy benefits, as well as estimates with respect to postemployment and postretirement benefits other than pensions, certain compensation accruals, and income taxes.

part ii item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management believes the current assumptions used to estimate amounts reflected in our consolidated financial statements are appropriate. however, if actual experience differs from the assumptions used in estimating amounts reflected in our consolidated financial statements, the resulting changes could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and, in certain situations, could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and financial condition. the table below presents the adverse impacts of certain possible changes in assumptions. the effect of assumption changes in the opposite direction would be a positive impact to our consolidated results of operations, liquidity or financial condition, except for the assessments of impairment for goodwill and fixed maturities carried at a fair value below cost. the tax rate used to calculate the after-tax impact of assumption changes is based on the new corporate income tax rate discussed in the "key developments" section of this md&a.

significant assumptions and estimates used in determining fair value include the discount rate and future cash flows. a range of discount rates is used, corresponding with the reporting unit's weighted average cost of capital, consistent with that                                                                                                                                                                                future changes in the funding for our medicare programs by the federal government could materially reduce revenues and profitability in our government reporting unit and used for investment decisions considering the specific and detailed operating plans and strategies within the reporting unit. projections of future cash flows are consistent with our annual planning process for revenues, claims, operating expenses,                                                                                                                                                                               have a significant impact on its fair value.

in our government operating segment we contract with cms and various state governmental agencies to provide managed health care services, including medicare advantage plans and medicare-approved prescription drug plans. estimated future cash flows for this reporting unit's business incorporate the potential effects of medicare advantage reimbursement rates for 2018 and beyond as discussed in the "executive overview" section of this md&amp;a. revenues from the medicare programs are dependent, in whole or in part, upon annual funding from the federal government through cms. funding for these programs is dependent on many factors including general economic conditions, continuing government efforts to contain health care costs and budgetary constraints at the federal level and general political issues and priorities.

$90 million and decrease net income by approximately $70 million after-tax.
valuation of fixed maturity investments most fixed maturities are classified as available for sale and are carried at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) within shareholders' equity. fair value is defined as the price at which an asset could be exchanged in an orderly transaction between market participants at the balance sheet date. determining fair value for a financial instrument requires management judgment. the degree of judgment involved generally correlates to the level of pricing readily observable in       typically, the most significant input in the measurement of fair value is the market interest rate used to discount the estimated future cash flows of the instrument. such market rates are derived by calculating the appropriate spreads over the markets. financial instruments with quoted prices in active markets or with market observable inputs to determine fair value, such as public securities, generally require less judgment. conversely, private placements including more complex                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          comparable u.s. treasury securities, based on the credit quality, industry and structure of the asset. if the interest rates used to calculate fair value increased by 100
securities that are traded infrequently are typically measured using pricing models that require more judgment as to the inputs and assumptions used to estimate fair value. there may be a number of alternative inputs to select based on an                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               basis points, the fair value of the total fixed maturity portfolio of $23 billion would decrease by approximately $1.5 billion, resulting in an after-tax decrease to shareholders' equity of approximately $0.9 billion.
understanding of the issuer, the structure of the security and overall market conditions. in addition, these factors are inherently variable in nature as they change frequently in response to market conditions. approximately two-thirds of our fixed maturities are public securities, and one-third are private placement securities. see notes 10 and 11(a) to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our fair value measurements, the procedures performed by management to determine that the amounts represent appropriate estimates and our accounting policy regarding unrealized appreciation on fixed maturities.

assessment of "other-than-temporary" impairments on fixed maturities certain fixed maturities with a fair value below amortized cost are carried at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income. for these investments, we have determined that the decline in fair value below                                                                                                                                                                                 if we subsequently determine that the excess of amortized cost over fair value is other-than-temporary for any or all of these fixed maturities, the amount recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income would be reclassified to shareholders' net its amortized cost is temporary. to make this determination, we evaluated the expected recovery in value and our intent to sell or the likelihood of a required sale of the fixed maturity prior to an expected recovery. in making this evaluation, we                                                                                                                                                                                 income as an impairment loss.
considered a number of general and specific factors including the regulatory, economic and market environments, length of time and severity of the decline, and the financial health and specific near term prospects of the issuer. the after-tax amounts as of december 31 in accumulated other comprehensive income for fixed maturities in an unrealized loss position were as follows (in millions):  2017  ($80)  2016 

segment reporting

the following section of this md&a discusses the results of each of our reporting segments. in these segment discussions, we present "operating revenues," defined as total revenues excluding realized investment results and "adjusted income from operations," defined as shareholders' net income excluding after-tax realized investment results, net amortization of other acquired intangible assets and special items. ratios presented in this segment discussion exclude the same items as adjusted income from operations. see note 22 to our consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of these metrics.
in these segment discussions, we also present "adjusted margin," defined as adjusted income from operations divided by operating revenues.
see the md&a executive overview beginning on page 35 for summarized financial results of each of our reporting segments.
global health care segment

as described in the segment reporting introduction above, the performance of the global health care segment is measured using adjusted income from operations. the key factors affecting adjusted income from operations for this segment are:

customer growth;

sales of specialty products;

medical costs as a percentage of premiums (medical care ratio or "mcr") for our commercial and government businesses; and

operating expense as a percentage of operating revenues (operating expense ratio).

2017 versus 2016

operating revenues.   the increase was primarily due to customer growth in our commercial risk business, partially offset by lower customer enrollment in our government segment.
adjusted income from operations increased, reflecting higher earnings in both our commercial and government operating segments. the increase in the commercial segment reflects customer growth including increased contributions from our specialty products and favorable claim experience in our u.s. individual business. the government segment's earnings growth reflects lower operating expenses related to the moratorium on the health insurance industry tax in 2017 and our 2016 cms audit response, partially offset by lower customer enrollment. adjusted income from operations included favorable after-tax prior year reserve development of $112 million for 2017; prior year reserve development in 2016 was not material.
medical care ratios.   the commercial medical care ratio increased, reflecting the 2017 moratorium on the health insurance industry tax, offset by improved performance in our u.s. individual business and favorable prior year reserve development.
the government medical care ratio decreased slightly, reflecting increased premium rates and favorable prior year reserve development, partially offset by higher medical costs.
operating expense ratio.   the decrease was primarily due to the moratorium on the health insurance industry tax in 2017 and lower costs related to our 2016 cms audit response.
2016 versus 2015

operating revenues.   the increase in operating revenues was due to growth in our commercial segment primarily from increased specialty revenues and growth in medicare advantage customer volumes. higher premium rates for most products (primarily to recover underlying medical cost trend) also contributed to the increase. these increases were partially offset by lower customer volumes in our medicare part d and u.s. individual businesses.
adjusted income from operations was flat, reflecting earnings growth in our commercial segment, primarily due to increased contributions from specialty products partially offset by lower margins in our u.s. individual business. this increase was offset by lower earnings in our government segment primarily driven by costs related to our cms audit response.
medical care ratios.   the commercial medical care ratio increased, reflecting a less favorable medical care ratio in our stop loss business, lower premium due to the anticipated reduction of the aca mandated fees in 2017 and less favorable prior year reserve development.
the government medical care ratio increased slightly, reflecting higher medical costs in our medicaid business and less favorable prior year development, mostly offset by improvements in the medicare part d business.
operating expense ratio.   the operating expense ratio increased slightly, reflecting costs related to our cms audit response. excluding those costs, the operating expense ratio decreased, reflecting higher revenue and operating efficiencies, partially offset by business initiative investments.
other items affecting health care results global health care medical costs payable medical costs payable was higher as of december 31, 2017 compared with 2016, primarily due to customer growth in our commercial risk businesses and medical cost trend across all businesses. medical costs payable was higher as of december 31, 2016 compared with 2015, primarily due to medical cost trend across all businesses and customer growth in our commercial group business. see note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information.

part ii item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations medical customers a medical customer is defined as a person meeting any one of the following criteria:

is covered under a medical insurance policy, managed care arrangement or service agreement issued by us;

has access to our provider network for covered services under their medical plan; or

has medical claims that are administered by us.
our medical customer base increased as of december 31, 2017 compared with 2016, reflecting growth across our commercial market segments, partially offset by declines in our medicare advantage business. our medical customer base increased as of december 31, 2016 compared with 2015, primarily driven by growth in our middle market, select and international market segments.
global supplemental benefits segment

as described in the segment reporting introduction on page 47, the performance of the global supplemental benefits segment is measured using adjusted income from operations. the key factors affecting adjusted income from operations for this segment are:

premium growth, including new business and customer retention;

benefit expenses as a percentage of premiums (loss ratio);

operating expense and acquisition expense as a percentage of operating revenues (expense ratio and acquisition cost ratio); and

the impact of foreign currency movements.
throughout this discussion and the table presented below, prior period currency adjusted income from operations and operating revenues are calculated by applying the current period's exchange rates to reported results in the prior period. a strengthening u.s. dollar against foreign currencies decreases these measures, while a weakening u.s. dollar produces the opposite effect.

2017 versus 2016

operating revenues increased primarily due to business growth, particularly in the united states and south korea, and the favorable impact of foreign currency movements, primarily in the south korean won.
adjusted income from operations increased, reflecting business growth, primarily in south korea and china, and lower acquisition cost ratios.
the segment's loss ratio decreased, primarily due to favorable claims experience, largely offset by a shift in business mix to products with higher loss ratios.
the acquisition cost ratio decreased due to lower spending in certain markets and a shift toward higher premium markets with lower acquisition costs, primarily in south korea and the united states.
the decrease in the expense ratio (excluding acquisition costs) was primarily driven by strong expense management.
2016 versus 2015

operating revenues were higher primarily due to new sales, particularly in south korea and the united states, reflecting both customer growth and sales of higher premium products. these higher premiums were partially offset by lower persistency in the u.k. and the unfavorable impact of foreign currency movements, primarily in south korea and the u.k.

back to contents part ii item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations adjusted income from operations increased primarily due to business growth, largely in south korea, and lower acquisition and operating cost ratios. these factors were partially offset by higher income taxes and the unfavorable impact of foreign currency movements, primarily in south korea.
the segment's loss ratio was flat, reflecting favorable claims in south korea, largely offset by a shift in business mix to products with higher loss ratios.
the  acquisition cost ratio decreased due to a shift toward higher premium products with lower acquisition costs primarily in south korea and the united states.
the decrease in the expense ratio (excluding acquisition costs) was primarily driven by operating efficiencies.
other items affecting global supplemental benefits results south korea is the single largest geographic market for our global supplemental benefits segment. south korea generated 51% of the segment's operating revenues and 89% of the segment's adjusted income from operations in 2017. in 2017, our global supplemental benefits segment operations in south korea represented 5% of our consolidated operating revenues and 12% of consolidated adjusted income from operations.
as a global company, our business is exposed to risks inherent in foreign operations. we continue to monitor and evaluate the impacts of tensions in the korean peninsula.
significant movements in foreign currency exchange rates could materially affect the reported results of the global supplemental benefits segment.
group disability and life segment

as described in the segment reporting introduction on page 47, the performance of the group disability and life segment is measured using adjusted income from operations. the key factors affecting adjusted income from operations for this segment are:

premium growth, including new business and customer retention;

net investment income;

benefit expenses as a percentage of premiums (loss ratio); and

operating expense as a percentage of operating revenues excluding net investment income (expense ratio).

disability:   we implemented modifications to our disability claims management process in the first quarter of 2016 to drive improved quality and consistency. these modifications extended the claims processing cycle and lowered the disability claim resolution rate. as our modified disability claims management process continued to mature during the latter half of 2016, our claim resolution rate significantly improved and operational margins normalized over the course of 2017.
life:   we experienced a period of elevated life claims in the second quarter of 2016, driven by substantially higher new claim incidence and sizes, both of which have normalized in subsequent periods.
2017 versus 2016

operating revenues were relatively flat in 2017 compared with 2016 with higher investment income driven by higher asset levels offset by cancelations in non-core products.

back to contents part ii item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations adjusted income from operations increased in 2017 compared with 2016 reflecting lower disability new claim incidence and a higher resolution rate as modifications to the disability claims management process discussed above continued to mature. in addition, life claims have returned to normal levels after a period of significantly elevated claims and a $17 million after-tax unfavorable reserve review, both in the second quarter of 2016.
the loss ratio decreased in 2017 compared with 2016 due to improvement in the disability claim resolution rate as noted above, lower disability new claim incidence and significantly improved life claims experience.
operating expense ratio.   the 2017 operating expense ratio increased compared with 2016 due to higher overhead costs.
2016 versus 2015

operating revenues.   premiums and fees increased in 2016 compared with 2015 due to new business growth from disability and life sales. net investment income also increased primarily due to higher average assets partially offset by lower yields.
adjusted income from operations.   results decreased in 2016 compared with 2015 due primarily to unfavorable disability and life claims experience as well as the absence of favorable reserve reviews and a higher operating expense ratio. results in 2016 included the unfavorable impact of reserve reviews of $18 million after-tax compared with a favorable impact of $55 million after-tax in 2015.
the loss ratio increased in 2016 compared with 2015 due to lower claim resolutions in disability, higher life claim incidence and sizes in the second quarter of 2016, and the unfavorable impact of reserve reviews as discussed above.
operating expense ratio.   the operating expense ratio increased in 2016 compared with 2015 primarily reflecting higher disability claim management costs.
other operations

as described in the segment reporting introduction on page 47, the performance of the other operations segment is measured using adjusted income from operations. cigna's corporate-owned life insurance ("coli") business contributes the majority of earnings in other operations. cigna's other operations segment also includes the results from the run-off reinsurance and settlement annuity businesses, as well as the remaining deferred gains recognized from the sale of the individual life insurance and annuity and retirement benefits businesses.

part ii item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations corporate's adjusted loss from operations was lower in 2017 compared with 2016, primarily due to higher excess tax benefits on stock compensation driven by increased option exercise activity in 2017. higher net investment income also contributed to the lower loss, partially offset by higher operating expenses. corporate's adjusted loss from operations decreased in 2016 compared with 2015, primarily due to recognizing excess tax benefits on stock compensation in net income beginning in 2016 as a result of our early adoption of asu 2016-09.

the fixed maturity portfolio increased $2.2 billion during the 12 months ended december 31, 2017, primarily reflecting an increase in investable funds. as of december 31, 2017, $20.5 billion, or 89%, of the fixed maturities in our investment portfolio were investment grade (baa and above, or equivalent), and the remaining $2.6 billion were below investment grade. the majority of the bonds that are below investment grade are rated at the higher end of the non-investment grade spectrum. these quality characteristics have not materially changed from the prior year and are consistent with our investment strategy.
state and local government.   our investment in state and local government securities, with an average quality rating of aa2, was diversified by issuer and geography with no single exposure greater than $35 million as of december 31, 2017. we assess each issuer's credit quality based on a fundamental analysis of underlying financial information and do not rely solely on statistical rating organizations or monoline insurer guarantees.
foreign government.   we invested in high quality foreign government obligations with an average quality rating of aa3 as of december 31, 2017. these investments were concentrated in asia, primarily south korea, consistent with the geographic locations of our international business operations. foreign government obligations also included $243 million of investments in european sovereign debt, none of which are in countries with significant political or economic concerns such as portugal, italy, ireland, greece, spain and turkey.
corporate.   as of december 31, 2017, corporate fixed maturities included the following:

private placement investments were $6 billion. these investments are generally less marketable than publicly-traded bonds; however yields on these investments tend to be higher than yields on publicly-traded bonds with comparable credit risk. we perform a credit analysis of each issuer, diversify investments by industry and issuer and require financial and other covenants that allow us to monitor issuers for deteriorating financial strength and pursue remedial actions, if warranted.

investments in companies that are domiciled or have significant business interests in italy, ireland, spain and turkey were $400 million. these investments have an average quality rating of baa2 and are diversified by industry sector, including less than 2% invested in financial institutions.

investments in the energy and natural gas sector were $1.8 billion with gross unrealized losses of $9 million. these investments have an average quality rating of baa2 and are diversified by issuer with no single exposure greater than $65 million.

retail sector fixed maturity investments were approximately $460 million with gross unrealized losses of $3 million. these investments had an average quality rating of baa2 and were diversified across approximately 40 issuers with no exposure exceeding $50 million.

back to contents part ii item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in addition to amounts classified in fixed maturities on our consolidated balance sheets, we operate an insurance joint venture in china in which we have a 50% ownership interest. we account for this joint venture on the equity basis of accounting and report it in other assets, including other intangibles. this entity had an investment portfolio of approximately $4.9 billion supporting this business that is primarily invested in local chinese corporate and government fixed maturities. there were no investments with a material unrealized loss as of december 31, 2017.
equity securities

as of december 31, 2017, approximately $400 million in equity securities were invested in an exchange traded fund ("etf") as part of a program to invest available cash in high quality and liquid assets. the underlying assets of the etf are primarily u.s. investment grade corporate bonds and there was a gross unrealized gain of $10 million as of december 31, 2017 due to a decrease in market yields since purchase.
commercial mortgage loans

our commercial mortgage loans are fixed rate loans, diversified by property type, location and borrower. loans are secured by high quality commercial properties and are generally made at less than 70% of the property's value at origination of the loan. property value, debt service coverage, quality, building tenancy and stability of cash flows are all important financial underwriting considerations. we hold no direct residential mortgage loans and do not originate or service securitized mortgage loans.
we completed the annual in-depth review of our commercial mortgage loan portfolio during the second quarter of 2017. the results of the 2017 review were in line with the prior year and confirmed the strength of the overall portfolio. for further discussion of the results of this review and changes in key loan metrics, see note 11 to our consolidated financial statements.
commercial real estate capital markets remain very active for well-leased, quality commercial real estate located in strong institutional investment markets. the vast majority of properties securing the mortgages in our mortgage loan portfolio possess these characteristics. as of december 31, 2017, we had $135 million of commercial mortgage loans in the retail sector for various shopping centers in the united states. the loan-to-value ratio for these loans was 49%, and the debt service coverage ratio was 2.15. all of these loans are current.
as of december 31, 2017, the $1.8 billion commercial mortgage loan portfolio consisted of approximately 60 loans that are all in good standing. given the quality and diversity of the underlying real estate, positive debt service coverage and significant borrower cash investment generally ranging between 30 and 40%, we remain confident that borrowers will continue to perform as expected under their contract terms.
other long-term investments

other long-term investments of $1.5 billion included investments in securities limited partnerships and real estate limited partnerships as well as direct investments in real estate joint ventures. the funds typically invest in mezzanine debt or equity of privately held companies (securities partnerships) and equity real estate. given our subordinate position in the capital structure of these underlying entities, we assume a higher level of risk for higher expected returns. to mitigate risk, these investments are diversified across approximately 125 separate partnerships, and approximately 60 general partners who manage one or more of these partnerships. also, the funds' underlying investments are diversified by industry sector or property type, and geographic region. no single partnership investment exceeded 4% of our securities and real estate partnership portfolio.
problem and potential problem investments

"problem" bonds and commercial mortgage loans are either delinquent by 60 days or more or have been restructured as to terms, including concessions by us for modification of interest rate, principal payment or maturity date. "potential problem" bonds and commercial mortgage loans are considered current (no payment is more than 59 days past due), but management believes they have certain characteristics that increase the likelihood that they may become problems. the characteristics management considers include, but are not limited to, the following:

request from the borrower for restructuring;

principal or interest payments past due by more than 30 but fewer than 60 days;

downgrade in credit rating;

collateral losses on asset-backed securities; and

for commercial mortgages, deterioration of debt service coverage below 1.0 or value declines resulting in estimated loan-to-value ratios increasing to 100% or more.
we recognize interest income on problem bonds and commercial mortgage loans only when payment is actually received because of the risk profile of the underlying investment. the amount that would have been reflected in net income if interest on non-accrual investments had been recognized in accordance with their original terms was not significant for 2017 or 2016.

problem and potential problem investments decreased by $42 million since december 31, 2016 primarily due to payoffs and paydowns of problem bonds and mortgage loans.
investment outlook

although financial markets in the united states remained stable during 2017, we continue to closely monitor global macroeconomic trends and their potential impact to our investment portfolio. certain sectors, such as retail, energy and natural gas have experienced stress and volatility and we expect that to continue. see the fixed maturities and commercial mortgage loan sections of this md&a for further information on our investments in these sectors. future realized and unrealized investment results will be driven largely by market conditions that exist when a transaction occurs or at the reporting date. these future conditions are not reasonably predictable; however, we believe that the vast majority of our investments will continue to perform under their contractual terms. based on our strategy to match the duration of invested assets to the duration of insurance and contractholder liabilities, we expect to hold a significant portion of these assets for the long term. although future impairment losses resulting from interest rate movements and credit deterioration due to both investment-specific and the global economic uncertainties discussed above remain possible, we do not expect these losses to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or liquidity.
market risk

financial instruments

our assets and liabilities include financial instruments subject to the risk of potential losses from adverse changes in market rates and prices. consistent with disclosure requirements, the following items have been excluded from this consideration of market risk for financial instruments:

changes in the fair values of insurance-related assets and liabilities because their primary risks are insurance rather than market risk;

changes in the fair values of investments recorded using the equity method of accounting and liabilities for pension and other postretirement and postemployment benefit plans (and related assets); and

changes in the fair values of other significant assets and liabilities such as goodwill, deferred policy acquisition costs, taxes, and various accrued liabilities. because they are not financial instruments, their primary risks are other than market risk.
excluding these items, our primary market risk exposures from financial instruments are:

interest-rate risk on fixed-rate, medium-term instruments. changes in market interest rates affect the value of instruments that promise a fixed return.

foreign currency exchange rate risk of the u.s. dollar primarily to the south korean won, euro, taiwan dollar, chinese yuan renminbi, and british pound. an unfavorable change in exchange rates reduces the carrying value of net assets denominated in foreign currencies.
our management of market risks

we predominantly rely on three techniques to manage our exposure to market risk:

investment/liability matching.  we generally select investment assets with characteristics (such as duration, yield, currency and liquidity) that correspond to the underlying characteristics of our related insurance and contractholder liabilities so that we can match the investments to our obligations. shorter-term investments generally support shorter-term life and health liabilities. medium-term, fixed-rate investments support interest-sensitive and health liabilities. longer-term investments generally support products with longer pay out periods such as annuities and long-term disability liabilities.

use of local currencies for foreign operations.  we generally conduct our international business through foreign operating entities that maintain assets and liabilities in local currencies. while this technique does not reduce foreign currency exposure on our net assets, it substantially limits exchange rate risk to those net assets.

use of derivatives.  we use derivative financial instruments to minimize certain market risks.
see note 12 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information about derivative financial instruments.

back to contents part ii item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations effect of market fluctuations

the examples that follow illustrate the adverse effect of hypothetical changes in market rates or prices on the fair value of certain financial instruments including:

a hypothetical increase in market interest rates, primarily for fixed maturities and commercial mortgage loans, partially offset by liabilities for long-term, largely fixed-rate debt; and

a hypothetical strengthening of the u.s. dollar to foreign currencies, primarily for financial instruments held by foreign subsidiaries denominated in a foreign currency.
the effects of hypothetical changes in market rates or prices on the fair values of certain of our financial instruments, subject to the exclusions noted above (particularly insurance liabilities), would have been as follows as of december 31:
loss in fair value market scenario for certain non-insurance financial instruments (in billions)       2017               2016
100 basis point increase in interest rates                                          $1.2               $1.0
10% strengthening in u.s. dollar to foreign currencies                              $0.5               $0.4
the effect of a hypothetical increase in interest rates was determined by estimating the present value of future cash flows using various models, primarily duration modeling. the impact of a hypothetical increase to interest rates at december 31, 2017 was greater than that at december 31, 2016 reflecting increased purchases of fixed maturities partially offset by additional issuances of long-term debt.
the effect of a hypothetical strengthening of the u.s. dollar relative to the foreign currencies of certain financial instruments held by us was estimated to be 10% of the u.s. dollar equivalent fair value. our foreign operations hold investment assets, such as fixed maturities, cash, and cash equivalents, that are generally invested in the currency of the related liabilities. the effect of a hypothetical 10% strengthening in the u.s. dollar to foreign currencies at december 31, 2017 was greater than that effect at december 31, 2016 due to increased amounts of investments that are primarily denominated in the south korean won.

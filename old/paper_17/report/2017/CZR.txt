item 1a.   risk factors.

risk factors relating to our operations our business is sensitive to reductions in discretionary consumer spending as a result of downturns in the economy and other factors outside our control consumer demand for casino hotel and racetrack properties such as ours is particularly sensitive to downturns in the economy and the associated impact on discretionary spending on leisure activities. changes in discretionary consumer spending or consumer preferences brought about by factors such as perceived or actual general economic conditions, effects of declines in consumer confidence in the economy, the impact of high energy and food costs, the increased cost of travel, the potential for continued bank failures, decreased disposable consumer income and wealth, or fears of war and future acts of terrorism could further reduce customer demand for the amenities that we offer. in addition, increases in gasoline prices, including increases prompted by global political and economic instabilities, can adversely affect our operations because most of our patrons travel to our properties by car or on airlines that may pass on increases in fuel costs to passengers in the form of higher ticket prices. further, security concerns, terrorist attacks and other geopolitical events can have a material adverse effect on leisure and business travel, discretionary spending and other areas of economic behavior that directly impact the gaming and entertainment industries in general and our business in particular. economic downturns, geopolitical events and other related factors which impact discretionary consumer spending and other economic events that are beyond our control have had direct effects on our business and the tourism industry in the past and could adversely affect us in the future.
we face substantial competition in the hotel and casino industry and expect that such competition will continue the gaming industry is characterized by an increasingly high degree of competition among a large number of participants, including land-based casinos, dockside casinos, riverboat casinos, casinos located on racing tracks and casinos located on native american reservations and other forms of legalized gaming such as video gaming terminals (vgts) at bars, restaurants and truck stops. we also compete, to a lesser extent, with other forms of legalized gaming and entertainment such as online computer gambling, bingo, pull tab games, card parlors, sports books, fantasy sports websites, "cruise-to-nowhere" operations, pari-mutuel or telephonic betting on horse racing and dog racing, state-sponsored lotteries, jai-alai, and, in the future, may compete with gaming at other venues. in addition, we compete more generally with other forms of entertainment for the discretionary spending of our customers.
10
gaming competition is intense in most of the markets in which we operate. states that already have legalized casino gaming may further expand gaming, and other states that have not yet legalized gaming may do so in the future. legalized casino gaming in these states and on native american reservations in or near our markets or changes to gaming laws in states in which we have operations and in states near our operations could increase competition and could adversely affect our operations. there has been significant competition in our markets as a result of the expansion of facilities by existing market participants, the entrance of new gaming participants into a market or legislative changes in prior years and expanded gaming is under consideration in certain of our markets. for example, gaming facilities in ohio that commenced operations in recent years present significant competition for mountaineer, presque isle downs, nemacolin and scioto downs. in addition, the governor of pennsylvania signed legislation in october 2017 expanding gaming to allow for up to ten additional casino locations, video gaming terminals (vgts) at truck stops, interactive gaming (igaming), gaming at airports and potentially sports wagering. further, there are two bills pending before the missouri general assembly for the expansion of gaming by allowing class b gaming licensees and daily fantasy sports licensees to conduct sports wagering and the operation of vlts at various bars, restaurants, veterans and fraternal organizations and convenience stores throughout the state. any such expansion of legalized gaming could adversely impact our properties.
casino gaming is currently prohibited in several jurisdictions from which the shreveport/bossier city and lake charles markets draw customers, primarily texas. the texas legislature has from time to time considered proposals to legalize gaming, and there can be no assurance that casino gaming will not be approved in texas in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on eldorado shreveport and isle lake charles. additionally, since visitors from california comprise a significant portion of our customer base in reno, we also compete with native american gaming operations in california. native american tribes are allowed to operate slot machines, lottery games and banking and percentage games on native american lands. although many existing native american gaming facilities in northern california are modest compared to the nevada properties, a number of native american tribes have established large-scale gaming facilities in california. additionally, from time to time the state of florida has entered into or amended gaming compacts with native american casinos or enacted, amended or discussed possible changes in gaming laws which could have positive or negative impacts on our pompano operations. in addition, various forms of internet gaming have been approved in nevada, new jersey, delaware, and pennsylvania, and legislation permitting internet gaming has been proposed by the federal government and other states. the expansion of internet gaming in nevada and other jurisdictions could result in significant additional competition.
increased competition may require us to make substantial capital expenditures to maintain and enhance the competitive positions of our properties to increase the attractiveness and add to the appeal of our facilities. because we are highly leveraged, after satisfying our obligations under our outstanding indebtedness, there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient funds to undertake these expenditures or that we will be able to obtain sufficient financing to fund such expenditures. if we are unable to make such expenditures, our competitive position could be negatively affected.
our operations in certain jurisdictions depend on agreements with third parties our operations in several jurisdictions depend on agreements with third parties. if we are unable to renew these agreements on satisfactory terms as they expire, our business may be disrupted and, in the event of disruptions in multiple jurisdictions, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. for example, iowa law requires that each gambling venue in iowa must have a licensed "qualified sponsoring organization," or qso, which is a tax-exempt non-profit organization. the qso must donate the profits it receives from casino operations to educational, civic, public, charitable, patriotic or religious uses. each of our three iowa properties has an agreement with a local qso. we have the right to renew our agreements for bettendorf and waterloo when they expire in 2025 and 2021, respectively.
the federal interstate horse racing act and the state racing laws in certain jurisdictions where we have racetracks require that, in order to simulcast races, we have written agreements with the horse owners and trainers at those racetracks or that we share proceeds of slot machines at the applicable racetrack. if we fail to maintain operative agreements with the horsemen at our racetracks, we will not be permitted to conduct live racing and export and import simulcasting, and may not be permitted to continue our gaming operations, at the applicable racetrack at those facilities, which could have material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
we have a management agreement with nemacolin woodlands resort, the owner of the gaming license issued by the pennsylvania gaming control board allowing operation of a casino at the resort. under the terms of this agreement, we constructed and currently operate a casino at the resort. our management agreement is subject to a buy-out provision on or after december 31, 2021, as well as other terms and conditions which could result in termination of the management agreement. the base term of the agreement is ten years, with four, five-year renewal options. additionally, each party to the management agreement has certain termination rights. if the management agreement is terminated, we will no longer have the right to manage our casino at nemacolin woodlands resort.
11
we are subject to extensive state and local regulation and licensing, and gaming authorities have significant control over our operations, which could have an adverse effect on our business licensing requirements.  the ownership and operation of casino gaming, riverboat and horseracing facilities are subject to extensive federal, state, and local regulation, and regulatory authorities at the federal, state, and local levels have broad powers with respect to the licensing of gaming businesses and may revoke, suspend, condition or limit our gaming or other licenses, impose substantial fines, and take other actions, each of which poses a significant risk to our business, financial condition, and results of operations. we currently hold all state and local licenses and related approvals necessary to conduct our present gaming operations, but we must periodically apply to renew many of our licenses and registrations. we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain such renewals. any failure to maintain or renew our existing licenses, registrations, permits or approvals would have a material adverse effect on us. furthermore, if additional laws or regulations are adopted or existing laws or regulations are amended, these regulations could impose additional restrictions or costs that could have a significant adverse effect on us.
gaming authorities with jurisdiction over our operations may, in their discretion, require the holder of any securities issued by us to file applications, be investigated, and be found suitable to own our securities if they have reason to believe that the security ownership would be inconsistent with the declared policies of their respective jurisdictions. further, the costs of any investigation conducted by any of the gaming authorities under these circumstances must be paid by the applicant, and refusal or failure to pay these charges may constitute grounds for a finding that the applicant is unsuitable to own the securities. if any of the gaming authorities determines that a person is unsuitable to own our securities, then, under the applicable gaming or horse racing laws and regulations, we can be sanctioned, including the loss of approvals that are required for us to continue our gaming operations in the relevant jurisdictions, if such unsuitable person does not timely sell our securities.
our officers, directors, and key employees are also subject to a variety of regulatory requirements and various licensing and related approval procedures in the various jurisdictions in which we operate gaming facilities. if any of the applicable gaming authorities were to find an officer, director or key employee of ours unsuitable for licensing or unsuitable to continue having a relationship with us, we would have to sever all relationships with that person. furthermore, the gaming authorities may require us to terminate the employment of any person who refuses to file appropriate applications. either result could materially adversely affect our gaming operations.
applicable gaming laws and regulations restrict our ability to issue securities, incur debt and undertake other financing activities. such transactions would generally require approval of applicable gaming authorities, and our financing counterparties, including lenders, might be subject to various licensing and related approval procedures in the various jurisdictions in which we operate gaming facilities. if state regulatory authorities were to find any person unsuitable with regard to his, her or its relationship to us or any of our subsidiaries, we would be required to sever our relationships with that person, which could materially adversely affect our business.
compliance with other laws.  we are also subject to a variety of other federal, state and local laws, rules, regulations and ordinances that apply to non-gaming businesses, including zoning, environmental, construction and land-use laws and regulations governing smoking and the serving of alcoholic beverages. legislation in various forms to ban indoor tobacco smoking has been enacted or introduced in many states and local jurisdictions, including several of the jurisdictions in which we operate. if additional restrictions on smoking are enacted in our jurisdictions, we could experience a significant decrease in gaming revenue and, particularly if such restrictions are not applicable to all competitive facilities in that gaming market, our business could be materially adversely affected. under various federal, state and local laws and regulations, an owner or operator of real property may be held liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances or wastes located on its property, regardless of whether or not the present owner or operator knows of, or is responsible for, the presence of such substances or wastes. we have not identified any issues associated with our properties that could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on us or the results of our operations. however, several of our properties are located in industrial areas or were used for industrial purposes for many years. as a consequence, it is possible that historical or neighboring activities have affected one or more of our properties and that, as a result, environmental issues could arise in the future, the precise nature of which we cannot now predict. the coverage and attendant compliance costs associated with these laws, regulations and ordinances may result in future additional costs.
12
regulations adopted by fincen require us to report currency transactions in excess of $10,000 occurring within a gaming day, including identification of the patron by name and social security number. u.s. treasury department regulations also require us to report certain suspicious activity, including any transaction that exceeds $5,000, if we know, suspect or have reason to believe that the transaction involves funds from illegal activity or is designed to evade federal regulations or reporting requirements. substantial penalties can be imposed if we fail to comply with these regulations. fincen has recently increased its focus on gaming companies.
we are required to report certain customer's gambling winnings via form w-2g to comply with current internal revenue service regulations. should these regulations change, we would expect to incur additional costs to comply with the revised reporting requirements.
taxation and fees. in addition, gaming companies are generally subject to significant revenue-based taxes and fees in addition to normal federal, state, and local income taxes, and such taxes and fees are subject to increase at any time. we pay substantial taxes and fees with respect to our operations. from time to time, federal, state, and local legislators and officials have proposed changes in tax laws, or in the administration of such laws, affecting the gaming industry. in addition, worsening economic conditions could intensify the efforts of state and local governments to raise revenues through increases in gaming taxes and/or property taxes. it is not possible to determine with certainty the likelihood of changes in tax laws or in the administration of such laws. such changes, if adopted, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. the large number of state and local governments with significant current or projected budget deficits makes it more likely that those governments that currently permit gaming will seek to fund such deficits with new or increased gaming taxes and/or property taxes, and worsening economic conditions could intensify those efforts. any material increase, or the adoption of additional taxes or fees, could have a material adverse effect on our future financial results.
income taxes. we are subject to tax in multiple u.s. tax jurisdictions. significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets or liabilities and in evaluating our tax positions. while we believe our tax positions are consistent with the tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we conduct our business, it is possible that these positions may be overturned by jurisdictional tax authorities, which may have a significant impact on our provision for income taxes.
tax laws are dynamic and subject to change as new laws are passed and new interpretations of the law are issued or applied. the u.s. recently enacted significant tax reform, and certain provisions of the new law may adversely affect us. in addition, governmental tax authorities are increasingly scrutinizing the tax positions of companies. if u.s. or state tax authorities change applicable tax laws, our overall taxes could increase, and our business, financial condition or results of operations may be adversely impacted.
we rely on our key personnel and we may face difficulties in attracting and retaining qualified employees for our casinos and race tracks our future success will depend upon, among other things, our ability to keep our senior executives and highly qualified employees. we compete with other potential employers for employees, and we may not succeed in hiring or retaining the executives and other employees that we need. a sudden loss of or inability to replace key employees could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operation.
in addition, the operation of our business requires qualified executives, managers and skilled employees with gaming and horse racing industry experience and qualifications who are able to obtain the requisite licenses and approval from the applicable gaming authorities. while not currently the case, there has from time to time been a shortage of skilled labor in our markets. in addition to limitations that may otherwise exist in the supply of skilled labor, the continued expansion of gaming near our facilities, including the expansion of native american gaming, may make it more difficult for us to attract qualified individuals. while we believe that we will continue to be able to attract and retain qualified employees, shortages of skilled labor will make it increasingly difficult and expensive to attract and retain the services of a satisfactory number of qualified employees, and we may incur higher costs than expected as a result.
13
work stoppages, organizing drives and other labor problems could negatively impact our future profits as of december 31, 2017, we had 11 collective bargaining agreements covering approximately 970 employees. a lengthy strike or other work stoppages at any of our casino properties could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. given the large number of employees, labor unions are making a concerted effort to recruit more employees in the gaming industry, including at some of our properties. as a result, we cannot provide any assurance that we will not experience additional and more successful union organization activity in the future.
some of our casinos are located on leased property. if we default on one or more leases, the applicable lessors could terminate the affected leases and we could lose possession of the affected casino we lease certain parcels of land on which several of our properties are located. as a ground lessee, we have the right to use the leased land; however, we do not hold fee ownership in the underlying land. accordingly, with respect to the leased land, we will have no interest in the land or improvements thereon at the expiration of the ground leases. moreover, since we do not completely control the land underlying the property, a landowner could take certain actions to disrupt our rights in the land leased under the long-term leases which are beyond our control. if the entity owning any leased land chose to disrupt our use either permanently or for a significant period of time, then the value of our assets could be impaired and our business and operations could be adversely affected. if we were to default on any one or more of these leases, the applicable lessors could terminate the affected leases and we could lose possession of the affected land and any improvements on the land, including the hotels and casinos. this would have a significant adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations as we would then be unable to operate all or portions of the affected facilities and may result in the default under our new credit facility.
because we own real property, we will be subject to extensive environmental regulation, which creates uncertainty regarding future environmental expenditures and liabilities we are subject to various federal, state and local environmental, health and safety laws and regulations that govern activities that may have adverse environmental effects, such as discharges to air and water, as well as the use, storage, discharge, emission and disposal of solid, animal and hazardous wastes and exposure to hazardous materials. these laws and regulations are complex and frequently subject to change. in addition, our horseracing facilities are subject to laws and regulations that address the impacts of manure and wastewater generated by concentrated animal feeding operations ("cafo") on water quality, including, but not limited to, storm water discharges. cafo regulations include permit requirements and water quality discharge standards. enforcement of cafo regulations has been receiving increased governmental attention. compliance with these and other environmental laws can, in some circumstances, require significant capital expenditures. we have from time to time been responsible for investigating and remediating, or contributing to remediation costs related to, contamination located at or near certain of our facilities, including contamination related to underground storage tanks and groundwater contamination arising from prior uses of land on which certain of our facilities are located. in addition, we have been, and may in the future be, required to manage, abate, remove or contain manure and wastewater generated by concentrated animal feeding operations due to our racetrack operations, mold, lead, asbestos‐containing materials or other hazardous conditions found in or on our properties. moreover, violations can result in significant fines or penalties and, in some instances, interruption or cessation of operations.
we are also subject to laws and regulations that create liability and cleanup responsibility for releases of regulated materials into the environment. certain of these laws and regulations impose strict, and under certain circumstances joint and several, liability on a current or previous owner or operator of property for the costs of remediating regulated materials on or emanating from its property. the costs of investigation, remediation or removal of those substances may be substantial.
14
an earthquake, hurricane, flood, other natural disaster or act of terrorism could adversely affect our business the operations of our facilities are subject to disruption or reduced patronage as a result of severe weather conditions, natural disasters and other casualty events. the reno area has been, and may in the future be, subject to earthquakes and other natural disasters and eldorado shreveport is located in a designated flood zone. because many of our gaming operations are located on or adjacent to bodies of water, these facilities are subject to risks in addition to those associated with other casinos, including loss of service due to casualty, forces of nature, mechanical failure, extended or extraordinary maintenance, flood, hurricane or other severe weather conditions and other disasters. for example, flooding along the mississippi river can impact five or more of our properties and result in them being closed for differing periods of time. our properties in florida and louisiana are particularly vulnerable to hurricanes, wind and storm surge. our pompano property was closed for four days in 2017 because of storms. in addition, severe weather such as high winds and blizzards occasionally limits access to our land-based facilities in colorado and reno. inadequate insurance or lack of available insurance for these and other certain types or levels of risk could expose us to significant losses in the event that a catastrophe occurred for which we are underinsured. in addition to the damage caused to our properties by a casualty loss, we may suffer business disruption as a result of the casualty event or be subject to claims by third parties that may be injured or harmed. while we carry general liability insurance and business interruption insurance, there can be no assurance that insurance will be available or adequate to cover all loss and damage to which our business or our assets might be subjected. in addition, certain casualty events, such as labor strikes, nuclear events, loss of income due to terrorism, deterioration or corrosion, insect or animal damage and pollution, may not be covered under our policies. any losses we incur that are not adequately covered by insurance may decrease our future operating income, require us to fund replacements or repairs for destroyed property and reduce the funds available for payments of our obligations. further, we renew our insurance policies on an annual basis. the cost of coverage may become so high that we may need to further reduce our policy limits or agree to certain exclusions from coverage. among other factors, it is possible that regional political tensions, homeland security concerns, other catastrophic events or any change in government legislation governing insurance coverage for acts of terrorism could materially adversely affect available insurance coverage and result in increased premiums on available coverage (which may cause us to elect to reduce our policy limits), additional exclusions from coverage or higher deductibles. among other potential future adverse changes, in the future we may elect to not, or may not be able to, obtain any coverage for losses due to acts of terrorism.
we are subject to risks relating to mechanical failure, forces of nature, casualty, extraordinary maintenance and other causes all of our facilities will generally be subject to the risk that operations could be halted for a temporary or extended period of time, as the result of casualty, forces of nature, mechanical failure, or extended or extraordinary maintenance, among other causes. in addition, our gaming operations could be damaged or halted due to extreme weather conditions. these risks are particularly pronounced at our riverboat and dockside facilities because of their locations on and adjacent to water.
we are or may become involved in legal proceedings that, if adversely adjudicated or settled, could impact our business and financial condition from time to time, we are named in lawsuits or other legal proceedings relating to our respective businesses. in particular, the nature of our business subjects us to the risk of lawsuits filed by customers, past and present employees, competitors, business partners and others in the ordinary course of business. as with all legal proceedings, no assurances can be given as to the outcome of these matters. moreover, legal proceedings can be expensive and time consuming, and we may not be successful in defending or prosecuting these lawsuits, which could result in settlements or damages that could significantly impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.
15
our information technology and other systems are subject to cyber security risk including misappropriation of customer information or other breaches of information security we collect information relating to our guests and employees for various business purposes, including marketing and promotional purposes. the collection and use of personal data are governed by privacy laws and regulations enacted in the united states. we rely on information technology and other systems to maintain and transmit this personal and financial information, credit card settlements, credit card funds transmissions, mailing lists and reservations information. our information and processes are subject to the ever-changing threat of compromised security, in the form of a risk of potential breach, system failure, computer virus, or unauthorized or fraudulent use by customers, company employees, or employees of third party vendors. the steps we take to deter and mitigate these risks may not be successful, and any resulting compromise or loss of data or systems could adversely impact, operations or regulatory compliance and could result in remedial expenses, fines, litigation, and loss of reputation, potentially impacting our financial results.
in addition, third party service providers and other business partners process and maintain proprietary business information and data related to our guests, suppliers and other business partners. our information technology and other systems that maintain and transmit this information, or those of service providers or business partners, may also be compromised by a malicious third party penetration of our network security or that of a third party service provider or business partner, or impacted by intentional or unintentional actions or inactions by our employees or those of a third party service provider or business partner. as a result, our business information, guest, supplier, and other business partner data may be lost, disclosed, accessed or taken without their consent.
any such loss, disclosure or misappropriation of, or access to, guests' or business partners' information or other breach of our information security can result in legal claims or legal proceedings, including regulatory investigations and actions, may have a serious impact on our reputation and may adversely affect our businesses, operating results and financial condition. furthermore, the loss, disclosure or misappropriation of our business information may adversely affect our reputation, businesses, operating results and financial condition.
our operations have historically been subject to seasonal variations and quarterly fluctuations in operating results, and we can expect to experience such variations and fluctuations in the future historically, our operations have typically been subject to seasonal variations. our strongest operating results for our reno properties have generally occurred in the second and third quarters and the weakest results have generally occurred during the period from november through february when weather conditions adversely affected operating results. winter conditions can frequently adversely affect transportation routes to reno, where a significant of our visitors arrive by ground transportation, and certain of our other properties and cause cancellations of live horse racing. for example, the reno-tahoe area experienced exceptionally high levels of snowfall in the first quarter of 2017, with certain resorts in the tahoe area reporting over 50 feet of snowfall during such time, which adversely affected visitation to our reno properties and adversely affected our results of operations for the first quarter. as a result, unfavorable seasonal conditions could have a material adverse effect on our operations.
the concentration and evolution of the slot machine manufacturing industry could impose additional costs on us there are a limited number of slot machine manufacturers servicing the gaming industry and a large majority of our revenues are derived from slot machines at our casinos. it is important, for competitive reasons, that we offer the most popular and up-to-date slot machine games with the latest technology to customers.
in recent years, slot machine manufacturers have frequently refused to sell slot machines featuring the most popular games, instead requiring participating lease arrangements. generally, a participating lease is substantially more expensive over the long-term than the cost to purchase a new slot machine.
for competitive reasons, we may be forced to acquire new slot machines, slot machine systems or gaming and hotel technology and equipment, or enter into participating lease arrangements, that are more expensive than our costs associated with the continued operation of our existing slot machines, equipment and software. if the newer slot machines, equipment or software do not result in sufficient incremental revenues to offset the increased investment, or if we are unable to successfully implement new software or technology, it could adversely affect our operations and profitability.
16
we face risks associated with growth and acquisitions as part of our business strategy, we regularly evaluate opportunities for growth through development of gaming operations in existing or new markets, through acquiring other gaming entertainment facilities or through redeveloping our existing gaming facilities. in the future, we may also pursue expansion opportunities, including joint ventures, in jurisdictions where casino gaming is not currently permitted in order to be prepared to develop projects upon approval of casino gaming.
although we only intend to engage in acquisitions that, if consummated, will be accretive to us and our stockholders, we cannot be sure that we will be able to identify attractive acquisition opportunities or that we will experience the return on investment that we expect. in addition, acquisitions require significant management attention and resources to integrate new properties, businesses and operations. potential difficulties we may encounter as part of the integration process include:
•   the inability to successfully incorporate acquired assets in a manner that permits us to achieve the full revenue and other benefits anticipated to result from the acquired operations;

•   complexities associated with managing the combined business, including difficulties addressing possible differences in cultures and management philosophies and the challenge of integrating complex systems, technology, networks and other assets of each of the companies in a seamless manner that minimizes any adverse impact on customers, suppliers, employees and other constituencies; and

•   potential unknown liabilities and unforeseen increased expenses associated with acquired properties.

in addition, it is possible that the integration process could result in:
•   diversion of the attention of our management;

•   the disruption of, or the loss of momentum in, our ongoing businesses; and

•   inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies,

any of which could adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with customers, suppliers, employees and other constituencies or our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits, or could reduce our earnings or otherwise adversely affect our business and financial results.
there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify, acquire, develop or profitably manage additional companies or operations or successfully integrate such companies or operations, into our existing operations without substantial costs, delays or other problems. additionally, there can be no assurance that we will receive gaming or other necessary licenses or approvals for new projects that we may pursue or that gaming will be approved in jurisdictions where it is not currently approved.
we may experience construction delays or cost overruns during our expansion or development projects that could adversely affect our operations from time to time, we may commence construction projects on new properties or at our current properties. we also evaluate other expansion opportunities as they become available and may in the future engage in additional construction projects. the anticipated costs and construction periods for construction projects are based upon budgets, conceptual design documents and construction schedule estimates prepared by us in consultation with our architects. construction projects entail significant risks, which can substantially increase costs or delay completion of a project. such risks include shortages of materials or skilled labor, unforeseen engineering, environmental or geological problems, work stoppages, weather interference and unanticipated cost increases. most of these factors are beyond our control. in addition, difficulties or delays in obtaining any of the requisite licenses, permits or authorizations from regulatory authorities can increase the cost or delay the completion of an expansion or development. significant budget overruns or delays with respect to expansion and development projects could adversely affect our results of operations.
17
our planned capital expenditures may not result in our expected improvements in our business we regularly expend capital to construct, maintain and renovate our properties to remain competitive, maintain the value and brand standards of our properties and comply with applicable laws and regulations. our ability to realize the expected returns on our capital investments is dependent on a number of factors, including, general economic conditions; changes to construction plans and specifications; delays in obtaining or inability to obtain necessary permits, licenses and approvals; disputes with contractors; disruptions to our business caused by construction; and other unanticipated circumstances or cost increases.
while we believe that the overall budgets for our planned capital expenditures are reasonable, these costs are estimates and the actual costs may be higher than expected. in addition, we can provide no assurance that these investments will be sufficient or that we will realize our expected returns on our capital investments, or any returns at all. a failure to realize our expected returns on capital investments could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
we may incur impairments to goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets, or long-lived assets, which could negatively affect our operating results as of december 31, 2017, we had $1.7 billion of goodwill and other intangible assets. we perform annual impairment testing for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets as of october 1, or on an interim basis if indicators of impairment exist. for properties with goodwill and/or other intangible assets with indefinite lives, these tests could require the comparison of the implied fair value of each reporting unit to carrying value. during the fourth quarter of 2017, we recorded an impairment charge totaling $38.0 million to reduce the carrying value of goodwill and/or trade names related to our lake charles, lula and vicksburg reporting units.
we must make various assumptions and estimates in performing our impairment testing. the implied fair value includes estimates of future cash flows that are based on reasonable and supportable assumptions which represent our best estimates of the cash flows expected to result from the use of the assets including their eventual disposition and by a market approach based upon valuation multiples for similar companies. changes in estimates, increases in our cost of capital, reductions in transaction multiples, operating and capital expenditure assumptions or application of alternative assumptions and definitions, could produce significantly different results.
we also evaluate long-lived assets for impairment if indicators of impairment exist. in assessing the recoverability of the carrying value of such property, equipment and other long-lived assets, we make assumptions regarding future cash flows and residual values.
future cash flow estimates are, by their nature, subjective and actual results may differ materially from our estimates. if our ongoing estimates of future cash flows are not met, we may have to record additional impairment charges in future accounting periods. our estimates of cash flows are based on the current regulatory, social and economic climates, recent operating information and budgets, and current operating plans of the various properties where we conduct operations. these estimates could be negatively impacted by changes in federal, state or local regulations, economic downturns, internal operating decisions, or other events affecting various forms of travel and access to our properties.
risks related to our capital structure and equity ownership we have significant indebtedness as of december 31, 2017, we and our restricted subsidiaries had $2.2 billion of total indebtedness outstanding consisting of $956.8 million outstanding under our term loan facility (the "new term loan facility" or "new term loan"), $875.0 million in aggregate principal amount of outstanding 6.0% senior notes due 2025 (the "6% senior notes") and $375.0 million in aggregate principal amount of outstanding 7.0% senior notes due 2023 (the "7% senior notes"). as of december 31, 2017, we had no borrowings outstanding under our $300.0 million revolving credit facility (the "new revolving credit facility" and, together with the new term loan, the "new credit facility"). this indebtedness may have important negative consequences for us, including:
•   limiting our ability to satisfy our obligations;

•   increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;

18
•   limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our businesses and the markets in which we operate;

•   placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to competitors that have less debt;

•   increasing our vulnerability to, and limiting our ability to react to, changing market conditions, changes in our industry and economic downturns;

•   limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund working capital requirements, capital expenditures, debt service, acquisitions, general corporate or other obligations;

•   subjecting us to a number of restrictive covenants that, among other things, limit our ability to pay dividends and distributions, make acquisitions and dispositions, borrow additional funds, and make capital expenditures and other investments;

•   restricting our and our wholly-owned subsidiaries ability to make dividend payments and other payments;

•   limiting our ability to use operating cash flow in other areas of our business because we must dedicate a significant portion of these funds to make principal and/or interest payments on our outstanding debt;

•   exposing us to interest rate risk due to the variable interest rate on borrowings under our new credit facility;

•   causing our failure to comply with the financial and restrictive covenants contained in our current or future indebtedness, which could cause a default under such indebtedness and which, if not cured or waived, could have a material adverse effect on us; and

•   affecting our ability to renew gaming and other licenses necessary to conduct our business.

despite our current indebtedness levels, we and our subsidiaries may still incur significant additional indebtedness. incurring more indebtedness could increase the risks associated with our substantial indebtedness we and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness, including additional secured indebtedness, in the future. as of december 31, 2017, we had $291.6 million of borrowing capacity, after consideration of $8.4 million in outstanding letters of credit, under our new credit facility. our existing debt agreements currently permit, and we expect that agreements governing debt that we incur in the future will permit, us to incur certain other additional secured and unsecured debt. further, we may incur other liabilities that do not constitute indebtedness. the risks that we face based on our outstanding indebtedness may intensify if we incur additional indebtedness in the future.
we may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness, which may not be successful our ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt obligations depends on our financial condition and operating performance, which is subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business, legislative, regulatory and other factors beyond our control. we cannot assure you that we will maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness.
if our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures, or to sell assets, seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. these alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. if our operating results and available cash are insufficient to meet our debt service obligations, we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt service and other obligations. we may not be able to consummate those dispositions or to obtain the proceeds that we could realize from them, and these proceeds may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due. additionally, the agreements governing our existing debt limit the use of the proceeds from any disposition; as a result, we may not be allowed, under these documents, to use proceeds from such dispositions to satisfy all current debt service obligations.
19
the agreements governing our debt impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and our subsidiaries, which may prevent us from capitalizing on business opportunities the agreements governing our existing debt impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us. these restrictions limit our ability, among other things, to:
•   incur additional debt;

•   create liens or other encumbrances;

•   pay dividends or make other restricted payments;

•   agree to payment restrictions affecting our restricted subsidiaries;

•   prepay subordinated indebtedness;

•   make investments, loans or other guarantees;

•   sell or otherwise dispose of a portion of our assets; or

•   make acquisitions or merge or consolidate with another entity.

in addition, the credit agreement governing the new credit facility contains certain financial covenants, including minimum interest coverage ratio and maximum total leverage ratio covenants.
as a result of these covenants and restrictions, we are limited in how we conduct our business and we may be unable to raise additional debt or equity financing to compete effectively or to take advantage of new business opportunities. the restrictions caused by such covenants could also place us at a competitive disadvantage to less leveraged competitors.
a failure to comply with the covenants contained in the agreements governing our existing or future indebtedness could result in an event of default, which, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of the indebtedness and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. if our indebtedness were to be accelerated, there can be no assurance that our assets would be sufficient to repay such indebtedness in full. moreover, in the event that such indebtedness is accelerated, there can be no assurance that we will be able to refinance it on acceptable terms, or at all.
the market price of our common stock could fluctuate significantly the u.s. securities markets in general have experienced significant price fluctuations in recent years. the market price of our common stock may be volatile and subject to wide fluctuations. in addition, the trading volume of our common stock may fluctuate and cause significant price variations to occur. some of the factors that could cause fluctuations in, or have a material adverse effect on, the stock price or trading volume of our common stock include:
•   general market and economic conditions, including market conditions in the hotel and casino industries;

•   actual or expected variations in operating results;

•   differences between actual operating results and those expected by investors and analysts;

•   changes in recommendations by securities analysts;

•   operations and stock performance of competitors;

•   accounting charges, including charges relating to the impairment of goodwill;

•   significant acquisitions or strategic alliances by us or by competitors;

•   sales of our common stock or other securities in the future, including sales by our directors and officers or significant investors;

•   recruitment or departure of key personnel;

•   conditions and trends in the gaming and entertainment industries;

•   changes in the estimate of the future size and growth of our markets; and

•   changes in reserves for professional liability claims.

20
we cannot assure you that the stock price of our common stock will not fluctuate or decline significantly in the future. in addition, the stock market in general can experience considerable price and volume fluctuations that may be unrelated to our performance. if the market price of our common stock fluctuates significantly, we may become the subject of securities class action litigation which may result in substantial costs and a diversion of management's attention and resources.
we have not historically paid dividends and may not pay dividends in the future we do not currently expect to pay dividends on its common stock. any determination to pay dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon among other factors, our earnings, cash requirements, financial condition, requirements to comply with the covenants under its debt instruments, legal considerations, and other factors that our board of directors deems relevant. in addition, the agreements governing our indebtedness restrict its ability to pay dividends. if we do not pay dividends, then the return on an investment in its common stock will depend entirely upon any future appreciation in its stock price. there is no guarantee that our common stock will appreciate in value or maintain its value.

reportable segments the executive decision maker of our company reviews operating results, assesses performance and makes decisions on a "significant market" basis. our management views each of its properties as an operating segment. operating segments are aggregated based on their similar economic characteristics, types of customers, types of services and products provided, the regulatory environments in which they operate, and their management and reporting structure. prior to our acquisition of isle, our principal operating activities occurred in three geographic regions: nevada, louisiana and parts of the eastern united states. we aggregated our operations into three reportable segments based on the similar characteristics of the operating segments within the regions in which they operated as follows:

28
the presentation of information herein for periods prior to and after our acquisition of the reno properties are not fully comparable because the results of operations for circus reno are not included for periods prior to our acquisition of the reno properties and the results of operations of the silver legacy joint venture were not consolidated prior to our acquisition of the reno properties.
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ("md&a") is intended to provide information to assist in better understanding and evaluating our financial condition and results of operations. our historical operating results may not be indicative of our future results of operations because of these factors and the changing competitive landscape in each of our markets, as well as by factors discussed elsewhere herein. we recommend that you read this md&a in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and the notes to those statements included in this annual report on form 10-k.
key performance metrics our primary source of revenue is generated by our gaming operations, but we use our hotels, restaurants, bars, entertainment, retail shops, racing and other services to attract customers to our properties. our operating results are highly dependent on the volume of customers visiting and staying at our properties. key performance metrics include volume indicators such as table games drop and slot handle, which refer to amounts wagered by our customers. the amount of volume we retain, which is not fully controllable by us, is recognized as casino revenues and is referred to as our win or hold. in addition, hotel occupancy and price per room designated by average daily rate ("adr") are key indicators for our hotel business. our calculation of adr consists of the average price of occupied rooms per day including the impact of resort fees and complimentary rooms. complimentary room rates are determined based on an analysis of retail or cash rates for each customer segment and each type of room product to estimate complimentary rates which are consistent with retail rates. complimentary rates are reviewed at least annually and on an interim basis if there are significant changes in market conditions. complimentary rooms are treated as occupied rooms in our calculation of hotel occupancy.
significant factors impacting financial results the following summary highlights the significant factors impacting our financial results during the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015.
•   isle acquisition - our results of continuing operations for the year ended december 31, 2017 include incremental revenues and expenses for eight months (may 2017 through december 2017) attributable to the thirteen properties we acquired in our acquisition of isle.

transaction expenses related to our acquisition of isle for legal, accounting, financial advisory services, severance, stock awards and other costs totaled $92.8 million and $8.6 million for the years ending december 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
•   lake charles terminated sale - on august 22, 2016, isle entered into an agreement to sell its casino and hotel property in lake charles, louisiana, for $134.5 million, subject to a customary purchase price adjustment, to an affiliate of laguna development corporation, a pueblo of laguna-owned business based in albuquerque, new mexico. on november 21, 2017, we terminated the agreement. the closing of the transaction was subject to certain closing conditions, including obtaining certain gaming approvals, and was to occur on or before the termination date, which had been extended by the parties to november 20, 2017. the buyer did not obtain the required gaming approvals prior to the termination date, and pursuant to the terms of the agreement, we retained the $20.0 million deposit. the $20.0 million forfeited deposit was recorded as income on the accompanying statements of income as "proceeds from terminated sale."

in previous periods, the operations of lake charles have been classified as discontinued operations and as an asset held for sale. as a result of the termination of the sale, lake charles is no longer classified as an asset held for sale and accounted for as discontinued operations, and is included in our results of operations for the eight-month period from the date we acquired isle through december 31, 2017.
•   income taxes - on december 22, 2017, the u.s. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act (the "tax act"). the tax act makes broad and complex changes to the u.s. tax code, including, but not limited to, reducing the u.s. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%. in connection with our initial analysis of the impact of the tax act, for certain of our net deferred tax liabilities, we have recorded a decrease of $112.4 million, net of the related change in valuation allowance, with a corresponding net adjustment to deferred income tax benefit for the year ending december 31, 2017 as a result of the corporate rate reduction resulting in a positive impact on net income.

29
•   debt refinancing - in connection with our acquisition of isle, we completed a new debt financing transaction. the proceeds of the new borrowings were used to pay the cash portion of the consideration payable in the acquisition of isle, refinance all of isle's existing credit facilities, redeem or otherwise repurchase all of isle's senior and senior subordinated notes, refinance our existing credit facility and pay transaction fees and expenses. in addition, we recognized a loss totaling $27.3 million for the year ended december 31, 2017 as a result of the debt refinancing transaction (see "liquidity and capital resources" for more information related to the debt refinancing).

on september 13, 2017, we issued an additional $500 million in aggregate principal amount of 6% senior notes at an issue price equal to 105.5% of the principal amount. we used the proceeds of the offering to repay all of the outstanding borrowings under the new revolving credit facility totaling $78.0 million and used the remainder to repay outstanding borrowings totaling $444.5 million under the new term loan plus related accrued interest. we recognized a loss of $11.1 million as a result of the issuance of additional debt and retirement of existing debt.
•   impairment charges - during the fourth quarter of 2017, we conducted annual impairment tests of our intangible assets. based on less than expected operating performance and projected future operating results, it was determined that the value of goodwill and/or trade names associated with our lake charles, vicksburg and lula reporting units were impaired resulting in impairment charges totaling $38.0 million recorded in the current year.

•   severe weather - during the third quarter of 2017, hurricanes harvey and irma negatively impacted our south region, specifically our pompano, lake charles and eldorado shreveport properties, and made travel to those properties impossible or difficult. while pompano did not sustain any major physical damage, we incurred incremental expenses as a result of the storms and were forced to close the casino for four days and experienced disruption to our business for a longer period of time.

our west segment's operations are subject to seasonal variation, with our lowest business volume generally occurring during the winter months. the northern nevada region experienced record snowfall and severe weather conditions, including major snow storms during eleven of the fourteen weekends in the 2017 first quarter, making travel to reno from northern california, our main feeder market, difficult or impossible due to road closures. as a result, there was a significant adverse effect on business levels, especially hotel occupancy and gaming volume, during the first quarter of 2017, and our operating performance for the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to 2016.
•   execution of cost savings program - we continue to identify areas to improve property level and consolidated margins through operating and cost efficiencies and exercising financial discipline throughout the company without impacting the guest experience. in addition to cost savings relating to duplicative executive compensation, legal and accounting fees and other corporate expenses that have been eliminated as a result of our acquisitions, we have achieved savings in marketing, food and beverage costs, selling, general and administrative expenses, and other operating departments as a result of operating efficiencies and purchasing power of the combined eldorado organization.

•   property enhancement capital expenditures - property enhancement initiatives continued throughout 2016 and into 2017. in 2015 and 2016, major projects included the opening of brew brothers at presque isle downs and scioto downs along with a second smoking patio at scioto downs.

our master capital plan initiated in 2016 at eldorado reno, silver legacy and circus reno (the "tri-properties") continued throughout 2017. as of december 31, 2017, we have completed upgrades to nearly 1,000 hotel rooms and suites, updated food and beverage operations across the facilities with eight new or redesigned restaurants, cafes or bars, renovated the carnival midway, created new public spaces in all three properties and opened a new poker room and sports book.
a 118-room hampton inn hotel at scioto downs developed by a third party opened in march 2017 and since opening has driven visitation and spend at the property.
with the completion of our acquisition of isle, we continue to evaluate capital improvement plans across the newly acquired properties and plan upgrades to more than 1,200 hotel rooms and add a spa at our black hawk properties and brew brothers branded outlets at certain midwest properties in 2018.
•   circus reno/silver legacy purchase - in conjunction with the acquisition of the reno properties in november 2015, we paid $80.2 million in cash, comprised of the $72.5 million purchase price plus $7.7 million in estimated working capital adjustments and the assumption of the amounts outstanding under silver legacy's senior secured term loan facility. an additional $0.5 million was subsequently paid representing the final working capital adjustment. we funded the purchase price for our acquisition of the reno properties and repaid the borrowings outstanding under the silver legacy credit facility using a portion of the proceeds from the sale of our 7% senior notes, borrowings under our revolving credit facility and cash on hand. we recorded a $35.6 million gain related to the valuation of our pre-acquisition investment in the silver legacy joint venture and incurred acquisition costs totaling $2.5 million in 2015. we incurred an additional $0.6 million in acquisition charges in 2016. in 2015, we also expensed fees totaling $0.6 million related to our equity offering initially intended to fund our

30
acquisition of the reno properties. these fees were expensed as a result of our election to fund the final component of our acquisition of the reno properties with existing revolver capacity in lieu of an equity offering.

•   new regulation - effective january 1, 2016, the ohio lottery commission enacted new regulation which resulted in the establishment of a $1.0 million progressive slot liability and a corresponding decrease in net slot win for the year ended december 31, 2016. the changes are non-cash and related to jackpots established in prior years. the net non-cash impact to scioto down's gaming revenues and operating income was $1.0 million and $0.6 million for the year ended december 31, 2016, respectively.

operating results.  isle contributed $599.6 million of net revenues from the date we acquired isle through december 31, 2017 consisting primarily of gaming revenues. including the incremental isle net operating revenues, net revenues increased 65.0% for the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to 2016. excluding incremental isle net revenues, net revenues declined 2.1% for the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to decreased revenues associated with severe weather during the first and third quarters of 2017.
net revenues increased 24.1% in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to incremental revenues attributable to the acquisition of the reno properties. these increases in net revenues were partially offset by decreases in net revenues in the south and east segments, which were mainly driven by declines at mountaineer, in 2016 compared to 2015 due to lower casino revenues, attributable to a competitive opening in one of our feeder markets.
operating income increased 6.5% for the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to 2016. this increase was primarily due to $82.3 million of incremental operating income contributed by isle for the period from the date we acquired isle through december 31, 2017 and a $20.0 million deposit recorded as operating income in conjunction with the termination of the sale our lake charles property. these increases were partially offset by the $83.6 million increase in transaction expenses associated with our acquisition of isle and the $38.0 million impairment charge recorded in 2017 to reduce the carrying value of goodwill and/or trade names related to our lake charles, lula and vicksburg reporting units.
operating income increased 22.9% in 2016 compared to 2015 due to higher net revenues combined with improved operating margins associated with company-wide cost savings initiatives and property enhancement capital expenditures. these increases in operating income were partially offset by incremental depreciation expense resulting from the acquisition of the reno properties along with higher acquisition costs associated with our acquisition of isle which was announced in september of 2016.
net income increased 198.1% in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to the $112.4 million net adjustment to our deferred income tax benefit for the year ending december 31, 2017 as a result of the aforementioned corporate tax rate reduction due to the tax act, combined with the other factors impacting operating income. this increase was partially offset by higher interest expense resulting from the issuance of new debt and the loss on the early retirement of debt recorded in 2017.
net income decreased 78.3% in 2016 compared to 2015 despite the increase in operating income. this decline was primarily driven by a $35.6 million gain related to the valuation of the silver legacy joint venture in conjunction with the acquisition of the reno properties combined with a $69.6 million benefit for income taxes recorded in 2015. additionally, net income in 2016 was impacted by transaction expenses totaling $9.2 million, primarily related to our acquisition of isle, a $0.8 million loss on the sale and disposal of a building and equipment related to the closure of a detached fitness center facility at mountaineer and incremental depreciation associated with assets purchased in the acquisition of the reno properties. these declines in net income were partially offset by a $10.6 million decrease in interest expense in 2016 resulting from our refinancing in july 2015 and significant debt reductions throughout 2016.

gaming revenues and pari-mutuel commissions.  isle contributed $558.2 million of gaming revenues and pari-mutuel commissions for the period from the date we acquired isle through december 31, 2017 resulting in an increase of 77.1% for the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to 2016.
33
excluding incremental isle gaming revenues and pari-mutuel commissions of $558.2 million, gaming revenues declined 2.5% for the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to a decrease in gaming revenues across all segments. the decline in the west segment was mainly attributable to decreases in visitor traffic due to severe weather the northern nevada region experienced throughout the first quarter of 2017 that resulted in limited access from our main feeder markets combined with the absence of a major bowling tournament in the reno market. additionally, reductions in gaming volume driven by decreased high-end play, the continued weakness in the energy sector and historically lower table games hold percentage impacted the shreveport market and severe weather in the third quarter of 2017 negatively impacted the south segment in 2017. efforts to eliminate unprofitable gaming play via reductions in marketing promotions and incentives across the properties also contributed to the declines in casino volume and positively impacted margins across all segments.
non-gaming revenues.  isle contributed $91.7 million of non-gaming revenues for the period from the date we acquired isle through december 31, 2017 resulting in an increase of 29.2% over 2016.
excluding incremental isle non-gaming revenues of $91.7 million, non-gaming revenues decreased 3.3% for the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to 2016. the west segment declined for the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to 2016 principally due to lower hotel, food and beverage revenues resulting from reduced customer traffic due to fewer convention room nights, severe weather in the northern nevada region throughout the first quarter of 2017 and the absence of a major bowling tournament during 2017. the south segment decrease in non-gaming revenues for the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily due to decreased food and beverage revenues associated with revisions to marketing strategies resulting in fewer complimentary food offers and severe weather negatively impacting visitation in 2017. non-gaming revenues in the east segment decreased for the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to decreased food and beverage revenues resulting from reductions in complimentary food offers and the consolidation of restaurants in an effort to maximize capacity utilization.
promotional allowances.  promotional allowances, expressed as a percentage of gaming revenues and pari-mutuel commissions, decreased to 10.7% for the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to 12.9% in 2016. this decline was primarily due to strategic revisions to promotional offers across all segments combined with the incremental revenues contributed by the isle properties, which historically have lower promotional allowances as a percentage of gaming revenues.
gaming expenses and pari-mutuel commissions.  isle contributed $269.5 million of gaming expenses and pari-mutuel commissions for the period from the date we acquired isle through december 31, 2017 resulting in an increase of 62.9% over 2016.
excluding incremental isle gaming expenses and pari-mutuel commissions, gaming expenses and pari-mutuel commissions decreased 4.1% for the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to decreases in gaming volume combined with savings initiatives targeted at reducing variable expenses along with continued synergies related to the integration of the reno properties in the west segment. additionally, successful efforts to control costs and maximize departmental profit across all segments also drove the decline in expenses during the current period.
non-gaming expenses. isle contributed $30.1 million of non-gaming expenses for the period from the date we acquired isle through december 31, 2017 resulting in an increase of 11.1% over 2016.
excluding incremental isle non-gaming expenses, non-gaming expenses decreased 11.8% for the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to 2016 in conjunction with non-gaming revenue declines and successful efforts to control costs and maximize profit across all segments.
marketing and promotions expenses.  isle contributed $35.8 million of marketing and promotions expense for the period from the date we acquired isle through december 31, 2017 resulting in an increase of 103.3% over 2016.
excluding incremental isle marketing and promotions expenses, consolidated marketing and promotions expense increased 15.1% for the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to 2016. this increase was primarily attributable to marketing promotional costs associated with casino initiatives that are charged to this category to provide consistency among properties following our acquisition of isle.
general and administrative expenses.  isle contributed $113.6 million of general and administrative expense for the period from the date we acquired isle through december 31, 2017 resulting in an increase of 85.2% over 2016.
excluding incremental isle general and administrative expenses, consolidated general and administrative expenses decreased 1.4% for the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to 2016. savings associated with lower property and general liability insurance costs were partially offset by higher expenses associated with information systems maintenance contracts and professional services. these incremental costs resulted from information technology infrastructure projects targeted at consolidating systems for future savings and efficiencies.
34
corporate expenses.  for the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to 2016, corporate expenses increased due to payroll and other expenses associated with additional corporate expenses driven by growth related to the isle acquisition. also, the increase was the result of higher stock compensation expense for the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to 2016 due to the three-year vesting schedule associated with our long-term incentive plan established in 2015 resulting in three years of grants and related expense in 2017 versus two years of grants and related expense in 2016.
impairment charges. during the fourth quarter of 2017, we conducted annual impairment tests of our intangible assets. based on less than expected operating performance and projected future operating results, it was determined that the value of goodwill and/or trade names associated with our lake charles, vicksburg and lula reporting units were impaired resulting in impairment charges totaling $38.0 million ($34.9 million related to goodwill and $3.1 million related to trade names) recorded in the current year.
depreciation and amortization expense.  isle contributed $47.1 million of depreciation expense for the period from the date we acquired isle through december 31, 2017 resulting in an increase of 66.9% over 2016.
excluding incremental isle depreciation and amortization expense, depreciation and amortization expense decreased 7.3% for the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to 2016 mainly due to lower depreciation in all segments due to assets becoming fully depreciated.
benefit (provision) for income taxes.  as further explained below in "critical accounting policies - income taxes," on december 22, 2017, the u.s. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act. the tax act makes broad and complex changes to the u.s. tax code, including, but not limited to, reducing the u.s. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%. in connection with our initial analysis of the impact of the tax act, for certain of our net deferred tax liabilities, we have recorded a decrease of $112.4 million, net of the related change in valuation allowance, with a corresponding net adjustment to deferred income tax benefit for the year ending december 31, 2017 as a result of the corporate rate reduction.

gaming revenues and pari-mutuel commissions.  west gaming revenues increased 132.4% in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to incremental gaming revenues attributable to the acquisition of the reno properties combined with improvements in gaming revenues at eldorado reno. gaming revenues in the south segment decreased 3.4% in 2016 compared to 2015 due to declines in casino volume primarily due to decreased high limit play and the continued weakness in the energy sector negatively impacting the shreveport market. gaming revenues and pari-mutuel commissions in the east segment declined 3.8% in 2016 compared to 2015 mainly due to lower gaming revenues at mountaineer associated with the smoking ban that has negatively impacted the property's operations. this decrease was partially offset by continued improvements in gaming revenues at scioto downs in 2016 compared to 2015, despite the $1.0 million impact of the progressive liability change related to prior years during the first quarter of 2016.

non-gaming revenues.  non-gaming revenues increased 168.0% in 2016 compared to 2015 due to incremental non-gaming revenues consisting of food, beverage, hotel, entertainment, retail and other revenues in the west segment primarily as a result of the acquisition of the reno properties combined with an increase in non-gaming revenues at eldorado reno. the south segment's non-gaming revenues increased 1.8% in 2016 compared to 2015 mainly due to higher food and beverage revenues due to selective menu price increases and higher beverage complimentaries. the east segment posted a decrease in non-gaming revenues primarily due to the declines resulting from strategic changes in promotional offers along with additional volume declines at mountaineer associated with the smoking ban impact. these decreases were partially offset by incremental non-gaming revenues at scioto downs in 2016 compared to 2015 attributable to the opening of the brew brothers in october 2015.
promotional allowances.  promotional allowances, expressed as a percentage of gaming revenues and pari-mutuel commissions, increased to 12.9% in 2016 compared to 10.4% in 2015. in 2016, west promotional allowances, as a percentage of gaming revenues remained relatively flat to 2015 at 26.0%. south promotional allowances, as a percentage of gaming revenues, increased to 22.7% in 2016 from 21.0% in 2015 in conjunction with higher beverage complimentaries. the east segment's promotional allowances in 2016 declined to 4.4% as a percentage of the segment's gaming revenues and pari-mutuel commissions compared to 4.6% in 2015. reductions in promotional allowances, as a percentage of gaming revenues and pari-mutuel commissions in the east segment, were due to continued strategic revisions to promotional offers in an effort to increase margins and maximize profitability.
gaming expenses and pari-mutuel commissions.  west gaming expenses increased 140.1% in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to incremental gaming expenses as a result of the acquisition of the reno properties along with an increase in gaming expenses at eldorado reno in conjunction with increased gaming revenues. south gaming expenses decreased 4.8% in 2016 compared to 2015 as a result of lower gaming revenues combined with efforts to reduce variable operating costs. the east segment's gaming expenses and pari-mutuel commissions declined 3.8% in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due lower gaming expenses commensurate with decreased gaming revenues.
non-gaming expenses. west non-gaming expenses increased 144.2% in 2016 compared to 2015. this growth was driven by higher west non-gaming expenses due to incremental expenses associated with the acquisition of the reno properties. non-gaming expenses in the south segment declined 9.8% mainly due to successful efforts to control costs while the east segment's non-gaming expenses increased 2.9% in 2016 compared to 2015 as a result of incremental volume generated by the addition of the brew brothers at scioto downs in october 2015.
marketing and promotions expenses.  consolidated marketing and promotions expense increased 30.0% in 2016 compared to 2015. this increase was primarily attributable to incremental expenses in the west segment associated with the acquisition of the reno properties along with higher expenses associated with a shift in promotional spend in the east segment. these increases in the east segment were offset by a decline in the south segment due to efforts to reduce advertising and promotional costs to maximize profitability.
general and administrative expenses.  total general and administrative expenses increased 34.4% in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to incremental expenses in the west segment resulting from the operation of the properties purchased in the acquisition of the reno properties offset by declines in the south and east segments due to continued efforts to decrease variable expenses via cost savings initiatives.
corporate expenses.  corporate expenses totaled $19.9 million in 2016 compared to $16.5 million in 2015. this increase was partially due to higher payroll related expenditures at the corporate level subsequent to the acquisition of the reno properties in addition to an executive team restructuring that took place during the first quarter of 2016. this restructuring resulted in the reallocation of property executive management to corporate in order to more fully utilize their skills across defined regions. this increase was partially offset by declines in general and administrative costs at the property level in 2016 compared to 2015. additionally, $1.5 million of severance costs were recorded in 2016 along with $0.8 million of additional stock-based compensation expense as a result of severance related restricted stock units becoming fully vested in 2016. also, stock compensation expense was higher for in 2016 compared to 2015 due to our three year vesting schedule associated with our long-term incentive plan established in 2015 resulting in two years of grants expensed in 2016 versus one year of grants expensed in 2015.
depreciation and amortization expense.  total depreciation and amortization expense increased 11.5% in 2016 compared to 2015 mainly due to additional depreciation expense associated with acquired assets in conjunction with the acquisition of the reno properties. the west, south and east segments contributed $20.2 million, $7.9 million and $34.9 million, respectively, of depreciation and amortization expense in 2016 compared to $9.5 million, $7.6 million and $39.3 million in 2015, respectively.

supplemental unaudited presentation of consolidated adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("ebitda") for the years ended december 31, 2017 and 2016
adjusted ebitda (defined below), a non-gaap financial measure, has been presented as a supplemental disclosure because it is a widely used measure of performance and basis for valuation of companies in our industry and we believe that this non-gaap supplemental information will be helpful in understanding the company's ongoing operating results. adjusted ebitda represents operating income (loss) before depreciation and amortization, stock based compensation, transaction expenses, s-1 expenses, severance expense, income related to the termination of the lake charles sale, costs associated with the terminated lake charles sale, impairment charges, equity in income of unconsolidated affiliates, (gain) loss on the sale or disposal of property and equipment, and other regulatory gaming assessments, including the impact of the change in regulatory reporting requirements, to the extent that such items existed in the periods presented. adjusted ebitda is not a measure of performance or liquidity calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states ("us gaap"), is unaudited and should not be considered an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net income (loss) as an indicator of our operating performance. uses of cash flows that are not reflected in adjusted ebitda include capital expenditures, interest payments, income taxes, debt principal repayments and certain regulatory gaming assessments, which can be significant. as a result, adjusted ebitda should not be considered as a measure of our liquidity. other companies that provide ebitda information may calculate ebitda differently than we do. the definition of adjusted ebitda may not be the same as the definitions used in any of our debt agreements.

(1)   figures for isle are the four months ended april 30, 2017, the day before the we acquired isle on may 1, 2017. we report our financial results on a calendar fiscal year. prior to our acquisition of isle, isle's fiscal year typically ended on the last sunday in april. isle's fiscal 2017 and 2016 were 52-week years, which commenced on april 25, 2016 and april 27, 2015, respectively. such figures were prepared by us to reflect isle's unaudited consolidated historical net revenues and adjusted ebitda for periods corresponding to our fiscal quarterly calendar. such figures are based on the unaudited internal financial statements and have not been reviewed by our auditors and do not conform to gaap.

(2)   total figures for 2016 and 2017 include combined results of operations for isle and us for periods preceding the date that we acquired isle. such presentation does not conform with gaap or the securities and exchange commission rules for pro forma presentation; however, we believe that the additional financial information will be helpful to investors in comparing current results with results of prior periods. this is non-gaap data and should not be considered a substitute for data prepared in accordance with gaap, but should be viewed in addition to the results of operations reported by us.

(3)   figures are for isle for the year ended december 31, 2016. such figures were prepared by us to reflect isle's unaudited consolidated historical net revenues, operating income and adjusted ebitda for periods corresponding to our fiscal quarterly calendar. such figures are based on the unaudited internal financial statements and have not been reviewed by our auditors and do not conform to gaap.

liquidity and capital resources we are a holding company and our only significant assets are ownership interests in our subsidiaries. our ability to fund our obligations depends on the cash flow of our subsidiaries and the ability of our subsidiaries to distribute or otherwise make funds available to us.
our primary sources of liquidity and capital resources have been existing cash, cash flow from operations, borrowings under our revolving credit facility and proceeds from the issuance of debt securities. we closed on our acquisition of isle on may 1, 2017 and paid $552.0 million in cash consideration on our acquisition of isle, refinanced the outstanding isle indebtedness and paid acquisition expenses.
our cash requirements can fluctuate significantly depending on our decisions with respect to business acquisitions or dispositions and strategic capital investments to maintain the quality of our properties. we expect that our primary capital requirements going forward will relate to the operation and maintenance of our properties and servicing our outstanding indebtedness. in 2018, we plan to spend $150.0 million on capital expenditures and $115.4 million to pay cash interest on our outstanding indebtedness. we expect that cash generated from operations will be sufficient to fund our operations and capital requirements, and service our outstanding indebtedness for the next twelve months.
at december 31, 2017, we had consolidated cash and cash equivalents of $134.6 million. at december 31, 2016, we had consolidated cash and cash equivalents of $61.0 million. this increase in cash was primarily related to cash acquired in our acquisition of isle.
operating cash flow.  in 2017, cash flows provided by operating activities totaled $130.2 million compared to $97.6 million in 2016. the increase in operating cash was primarily due to incremental operating cash generated by the acquired isle properties offset by transaction expenses associated with our acquisition of isle combined with changes in the balance sheet accounts in the normal course of business.
in 2016, we generated cash flows from operating activities of $97.6 million as compared to $56.7 million in 2015. the increase in operating cash was primarily associated with improvements in operations along with incremental cash flow associated with the acquisition of the reno properties, the refinancing of our debt resulting in lower interest expense and various changes in the balance sheet accounts in the normal course of business.
40
investing cash flow and capital expenditures.  net cash flows used in investing activities totaled $1.4 billion in 2017 compared to $41.1 million in 2016. net cash flows used in investing activities in 2017 were primarily due to cash paid to acquire isle in addition to $83.5 million in capital expenditures for various property enhancement and maintenance projects and equipment purchases partially offset by $0.4 million in reimbursements from west virginia.
net cash flows used in investing activities totaled $41.1 million in 2016 and primarily consisted of $47.4 million in capital expenditures for various property enhancement and maintenance projects and equipment purchases partially offset by west virginia's reimbursement of capital expenditures totaling $4.2 million.
financing cash flow.  net cash used for financing activities in 2017 totaled $1.4 billion and consisted mainly of the issuance of debt associated with our acquisition of isle, the refinancing of our term loan and revolving credit facility in may 2017 and the issuance of additional 6% senior notes in september 2017. this increase was partially offset by net payments made on our credit facilities throughout 2017 and taxes paid related to net share settlements of equity awards associated with the isle transaction.
net cash used for financing activities in 2016 totaled $73.7 million and consisted primarily of net payments totaling $64.5 million on the revolving credit facility and $4.3 million payments under the term loan in 2016. additionally, $4.3 million was paid in 2016 for debt issuance costs comprised of $3.6 million related to our acquisition of isle and $0.7 million related to the acquisition of the reno properties.

business combinations we applied the provisions of accounting standards codification ("asc") topic 805, "business combinations," in the accounting for the merger with mtr, acquisition of the reno properties and our acquisition of isle. it required us to recognize the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at their acquisition date fair values. goodwill as of their respective acquisition dates were measured as the excess of consideration transferred over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed.
accounting for business combinations required our management to make significant estimates and assumptions, including our estimate of intangible assets, such as gaming licenses, trade names and loyalty programs. although we believe the assumptions and estimates made have been reasonable and appropriate, they are inherently uncertain. for our gaming license valuation, our properties estimated future cash flows were the primary assumption in the respective intangible valuations. cash flow estimates included assumptions regarding factors such as recent and budgeted operating performance, net win per unit (revenue), patron visits and growth percentages. the growth percentages were developed considering general macroeconomic conditions as well as competitive impacts from current and anticipated competition through a review of customer market data, operating margins, and current regulatory, social and economic climates. the most significant of the assumptions used in the valuations included: (1) revenue growth/decline percentages; (2) discount rates; (3) effective income tax rates; (4) future terminal values and (5) capital expenditure assumptions. these assumptions were developed for each of our properties based on historical trends in the current competitive markets in which they operate, and projections of future performance and competition. the primary assumptions with respect to our trade names and loyalty program intangibles primary assumptions were selecting the appropriate royalty rates and cost estimates for replacement cost analyses.
in addition, uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances assumed in connection with a business combination are initially estimated as of the business combination date. we reevaluated these items quarterly based upon facts and circumstances that existed as of the business combination date with any adjustments to our preliminary estimates being recorded to goodwill if identified within the measurement period. subsequent to the measurement period or our final determination of the tax allowance's or contingency's estimated value, whichever comes first, changes to these uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances will affect our provision for income taxes in our consolidated statements of income and could have material impact on our results of operations and financial position.
revenue recognition gaming revenues consist of the net win from gaming activities, which is the difference between amounts wagered and amounts paid to winning patrons, and is recognized at the time wagers are made net of winning payouts to patrons. base and progressive jackpots are accrued and charged to revenue at the time the obligation to pay the jackpot is established. pari‐mutuel commissions consist of commissions earned from thoroughbred and harness racing, and importing of simulcast signals from other race tracks. pari‐mutuel commissions are recognized at the time wagers are made. such commissions are a designated portion of the wagering handle as determined by state racing commissions, and are shown net of the taxes assessed by state and local agencies, as well as purses and other contractual amounts paid to horsemen associations. we recognize revenues from fees earned through the exporting of simulcast signals to other race tracks at the time wagers are made. such fees are based upon a predetermined percentage of handle as contracted with the other race tracks. revenues from food and beverage are recognized at the time of sale and revenues from lodging are recognized on the date of stay. other revenues are recorded at the time services are rendered or merchandise sold. we offer certain promotional allowances to our customers, including complimentary lodging, food and beverage, and promotional credits for free play on slot machines. the retail value of these promotional items is shown as a reduction in total revenues on our consolidated statements of income.
for information with respect to our adoption of asu no. 2014-09, "revenue from contracts with customers," (topic 606) effective january 1, 2018, see "note 2, summary of significant accounting policies - recently issued accounting pronouncements", in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
income taxes we and our subsidiaries file us federal income tax returns and various state and local income tax returns. we do not have tax sharing agreements with the other members within the consolidated eri group. with few exceptions, we are no longer subject to us federal or state and local tax examinations by tax authorities for years before 2012.
we were notified by the internal revenue service in october of 2016 that its federal tax return for the year ended december 31, 2014 had been selected for examination. in september 2017, the internal revenue service informed us that they completed the examination of the tax return and made no changes. however, we may be subject to tax audits in the future and the outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty. if any issues addressed in our tax audits are resolved in a manner not consistent with our expectations, we would be required to adjust our provision for income taxes in the period such resolution occurs. while we believe our reported results are materially accurate, any significant adjustments could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial position.

on december 22, 2017, the u.s. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act. the tax act makes broad and complex changes to the u.s. tax code, including, but not limited to, (1) reducing the u.s. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%; (2) eliminating the corporate alternative minimum tax (amt) and changing how existing amt credits can be realized; (3) creating a new limitation on deductible interest expense; (4) changing rules related to uses and limitations of net operating loss carryforwards created in tax years beginning after december 31, 2017; (5) bonus depreciation that will allow for full expensing of qualified property; and (6) limitations on the deductibility of certain executive compensation.
the sec staff issued staff accounting bulletin ("sab") 118, which provides guidance on accounting for the tax effects of the tax act. sab 118 provides a measurement period that should not extend beyond one year from the tax act enactment date for companies to complete the accounting under asc 740. in accordance with sab 118, a company must reflect the income tax effects of those aspects of the tax act for which the accounting under asc 740 is complete. to the extent that a company's accounting for certain income tax effects of the tax act is incomplete but it is able to determine a reasonable estimate, it must record a provisional estimate in the financial statements. if a company cannot determine a provisional estimate to be included in the financial statements, it should continue to apply asc 740 on the basis of the provisions of the tax laws that were in effect immediately before the enactment of the tax act.
in connection with our initial analysis of the impact of the tax act, for certain of our net deferred tax liabilities, we have recorded a decrease of $112.4 million, net of the related change in valuation allowance, with a corresponding net adjustment to deferred income tax benefit for the year ending december 31, 2017 as a result of the corporate rate reduction. for various reasons that are discussed more fully below, we have not completed our accounting for the income tax effects of certain elements of the tax act, therefore, we have made reasonable estimates of the effects of the elements for which our analysis is not yet complete.
while we have not yet completed all of the computations necessary or completed an inventory of our 2017 expenditures that qualify for immediate expensing, we have recorded a provisional benefit based on our current intent to fully expense all qualifying expenditures. this did not result in any significant change to our current income tax payable or in our deferred tax liabilities due to our federal and state net operating loss carry forwards.
for the year ended december 31, 2015, the difference between the effective rate and the statutory rate is attributable primarily to the release of a majority of the federal and related state valuation allowances on our deferred tax assets and the non-taxable gain on the fair value adjustment of a previously unconsolidated affiliate. we continue to provide for a valuation allowance against net federal and state deferred tax assets associated with non-operating land, the sale of which could result in capital losses that can only be offset against capital gains. as of december 31, 2015, we also continued to provide for a valuation allowance against net state deferred tax assets relating to operations in pennsylvania and west virginia. management determined it was not more-likely-than-not that we will realize these net deferred tax assets.
for the year ended december 31, 2016, the difference between the effective rate and the statutory rate is attributable primarily to the release of a majority of the state valuation allowances on our west virginia deferred tax assets and excess tax benefits on stock compensation under accounting standards update 2016-09, compensation - stock compensation, which we adopted effective the first quarter of 2016. we continue to provide for a valuation allowance against net federal and state deferred tax assets associated with non-operating land, the sale of which could result in capital losses that can only be offset against capital gains. as of december 31, 2016, we also continued to provide for a valuation allowance against net state deferred tax assets relating to operations in pennsylvania. management determined it was not more-likely-than-not that we will realize these net deferred tax assets.
for the year ended december 31, 2017, the difference between the effective rate and the statutory rate is attributable primarily to the impact of the tax act discussed more fully above, non-deductible asset impairment charges, non-deductible transaction costs incurred and changes in the effective state tax rate associated with the acquisition of isle of capri casinos, inc., and the release of the valuation allowance against certain pennsylvania deferred tax assets. we continue to provide for a valuation allowance against net federal and state deferred tax assets associated with non-operating land, the sale of which could result in capital losses that can only be offset against capital gains. we also continue to provide for a valuation allowance against net state deferred tax assets relating to certain operations in pennsylvania, louisiana, colorado and iowa. management determined it was not more-likely-than-not that we will realize these net deferred tax assets.
a valuation allowance is recognized if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more-likely-than-not that some portion, or all, of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. management must analyze all available positive and negative evidence regarding realization of the deferred tax assets and make an assessment of the likelihood of sufficient future taxable income. for the year ended december 31, 2015, we were in a three-year cumulative income position and management concluded it is more-likely-than-not to realize its federal, louisiana and city of columbus, ohio deferred tax assets, with the exception of non-operating land. for the year ended december 31, 2016, we remained in a three-year cumulative income position and management concluded it is more-likely-than-not to realize its federal, louisiana, city of columbus, ohio and west virginia deferred tax assets, with the exception of non-operating land. for the year ended december 31, 2017, we remained in a three-year cumulative income position and management concluded it is more-likely-than-not to realize its

federal, city of columbus, ohio, city of kansas city, missouri, west virginia, missouri and certain pennsylvania, colorado and florida deferred tax assets, with the exception of non-operating land. we continue to provide for a valuation allowance against net state deferred tax assets relating to certain operations in pennsylvania, louisiana, colorado and iowa. management determined it was not more-likely-than-not that we will realize these net deferred tax assets. we will continue to evaluate the realization of its deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis and make adjustments to its valuation allowance as appropriate.
for income tax purposes we amortize or depreciate certain assets that have been assigned an indefinite life for book purposes. the incremental amortization or depreciation deductions for income tax purposes result in an increase in certain deferred tax liabilities that cannot be used as a source of future taxable income for purposes of measuring our need for a valuation allowance against the net deferred tax assets. therefore, we expect to record non cash deferred tax expense as we amortize these assets for tax purposes.
under the applicable accounting standards, we may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more‐likely‐than‐not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. the accounting standards also provide guidance on de‐recognition, classification, interest and penalties on income taxes, accounting in interim periods and disclosure requirements for uncertain tax positions. we have recorded no liability associated with uncertain tax positions at december 31, 2017 and 2016.
property and equipment and other long‐lived assets property and equipment is recorded at cost, except for assets acquired in the isle, silver legacy, circus reno and mtr gaming acquisitions, which were adjusted for fair value under asc 805 and are depreciated over their remaining estimated useful life or lease term. judgments are made in determining estimated useful lives and salvage values of these assets. the accuracy of these estimates affects the amount of depreciation expense recognized in our financial results and whether we have a gain or loss on the disposal of assets. we review depreciation estimates and methods as new events occur, more experience is acquired, and additional information is obtained that would possibly change our current estimates.
property, equipment and other long‐lived assets are assessed for impairment in accordance with asc 360-property, plant, and equipment. we evaluate our long‐lived assets periodically for impairment issues or, more frequently, whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. recoverability of these assets is determined by comparing the net carrying value to the sum of the estimated future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by these assets. the amount of impairment loss, if any, is measured by the difference between the net carrying value and the estimated fair value of the asset which is typically measured using a discounted cash flow model (level 3 of the fair value hierarchy). for assets to be disposed of, impairment is recognized based on the lower of carrying value or fair value less costs of disposal, as estimated based on comparable asset sales, offers received, or a discounted cash flow model. based on the results of our periodic reviews we have not recorded any long-lived assets impairment charges during the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015.
for undeveloped properties, including non‐operating real properties, when indicators of impairment are present, properties are evaluated for impairment and losses are recorded when undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by an asset or market comparisons are less than the asset's carrying amount. the amount of the impairment loss is calculated as the excess of the asset's carrying value over its fair value, which is determined using a discounted cash flow analysis, management estimates or market comparisons. the fair value measurements employed for our impairment evaluations, which are subject to the assumptions and factors as previously discussed, were generally based on a review of comparable activities in the marketplace, which fall within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.
goodwill and other indefinite‐lived intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price paid over the fair value of the net assets of the acquired business. intangible assets acquired in business combinations are recorded based upon their fair value at the date of acquisition. goodwill and other indefinite‐lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment annually, during the fourth quarter, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset might be impaired.
as a result of our annual impairment review, impairment charges totaling $34.9 million and $3.1 million related to goodwill and trade names, respectively, were recorded in 2017. the fair value measurements employed for our impairment evaluations, which are subject to the assumptions and factors as previously discussed, were generally based on a review of comparable activities in the marketplace, which fall within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy

goodwill is tested by comparing the carrying value of the reporting unit to its fair value. we estimate the fair value of the reporting unit utilizing income and market approaches. the income approach is based on projected future cash flow that is discounted to present value using factors that consider the timing and risk of the future cash flows. the market approach is based on our market capitalization at the testing date.
our indefinite‐lived intangible assets consist of racing and gaming licenses and trade names and are evaluated for impairment annually by comparing the fair value of the asset to its carrying value. any excess of carrying value over the fair value is recognized as an impairment within the consolidated statements of income in the period of review.
the gaming and racing licenses were valued in aggregate for each respective property, as these licenses are considered to be the most significant asset of the properties and the gaming licenses could not be obtained without holding the racing licenses. therefore, a market participant would consider the licenses in aggregate. the fair value of the licenses is calculated using an excess earnings methodology, which is an income approach methodology that allocates the projected cash flows of the property to the gaming license intangible assets less charges for the use of the other identifiable assets of the property, including working capital, fixed assets, and other intangible assets. we believe this methodology is appropriate as the gaming licenses are the primary asset to the properties, the licenses are linked to each respective facility and it's the lowest level at which discrete cash flows can be directly attributable to the assets. under the gaming legislation applicable to our properties, licenses are property specific and can only be acquired if a buyer acquires the existing facility. because existing licenses may not be acquired and transferred for use at a different facility, the estimated future cash flows of each of our properties was the primary assumption in the valuation of such property.
we value trade names using the relief‐from‐royalty method with royalty rates range from 0.5% ‐ 1.0%. trade names recorded as part of the merger with mtr are amortized on a straight‐line basis over a 3.5 year useful life and the trade names recorded as part of our acquisition of isle and acquisition of the reno properties are not amortized (deemed indefinite-lived).
the loyalty programs were valued using a combination of a replacement cost and lost profits analysis and the loyalty programs are amortized on a straight‐line basis over a one- to three-year useful life.
assessing goodwill and indefinite‐lived intangible assets for impairment is a process that requires significant judgment and involves detailed quantitative and qualitative business‐specific analysis and many individual assumptions which fluctuate between assessments. our properties' estimated future cash flows are a primary assumption in the respective impairment analyses. unforeseen events, changes in circumstances and market conditions and material differences in estimates of future cash flows could negatively affect the fair value of our assets and result in an impairment charge, which could be material. cash flow estimates include assumptions regarding factors such as recent and budgeted operating performance, net win per unit (revenue), patron visits, growth percentages which are developed considering general macroeconomic conditions as well as competitive impacts from current and anticipated competition through a review of customer market data, operating margins, and current regulatory, social and economic climates. these estimates could also be negatively impacted by changes in federal, state, or local regulations, economic downturns or developments and other market conditions affecting travel and access to the properties. the most significant of the assumptions used in our valuations include: (1) revenue growth/decline percentages; (2) discount rates; (3) effective income tax rates; (4) future terminal values and (5) capital expenditure assumptions. these assumptions were developed for each property based on historical trends, the current competitive markets in which they operate, and projections of future performance and competition.
we believe we have used reasonable estimates and assumptions to calculate the fair value of our goodwill reporting units and other indefinite‐lived intangible assets; however, these estimates and assumptions could be materially different from actual results. if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected, or if events occur or circumstances change that would reduce the fair value of our licensing intangibles below the carrying value reflected on the consolidated balance sheet, we may be required to conduct an interim test or possibly recognize impairment charges, which may be material, in future periods.
reserve for uncollectible accounts receivable we reserve an estimated amount for receivables that may not be collected. methodologies for estimating bad debt reserves range from specific reserves to various percentages applied to aged receivables. historical collection rates are considered, as are customer relationships, in determining specific reserves. as with many estimates, management must make judgments about potential actions by third parties in establishing and evaluating our reserves for bad debts.
49
self‐insurance reserves we are self‐insured for various levels of general liability, employee medical insurance coverage and workers' compensation coverage. insurance claims and reserves include accruals of estimated settlements for known claims, as well as accruals of estimates for claims incurred but not yet reported. we utilize independent consultants to assist management in its determination of estimated insurance liabilities. while the total cost of claims incurred depends on future developments, in managements' opinion, recorded reserves are adequate to cover future claims payments. self-insurance reserves for employee medical claims and workers' compensations are included in accrued payroll and related on the consolidated balance sheets. self‐insurance reserves for general liability claims are included in accrued other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.
loyalty program we offer programs whereby our participating patrons can accumulate points for wagering that can be redeemed for credits for free play on slot machines, lodging, food and beverage, merchandise and in limited situations, cash. based upon the estimated redemptions of loyalty program points, an estimated liability is established for the cost of redemption on earned but unredeemed points. the estimated cost of redemption utilizes estimates and assumptions of the mix of the various product offerings for which the points will be redeemed and costs of such product offerings. changes in the programs, membership levels and redemption patterns of our participating patrons can impact this liability.
litigation, claims and assessments we utilize estimates for litigation, claims and assessments. these estimates are based on our knowledge and experience regarding current and past events, as well as assumptions about future events. if our assessment of such a matter should change, we may have to change the estimates, which may have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. actual results could differ from these estimates.

item 1a. risk factors a description of the risk factors associated with our business is set forth below. the list is not exhaustive and you should carefully consider these risks and uncertainties before investing in our common stock.
a decrease in demand for our solutions could adversely affect our financial results.
we are subject to fluctuations in demand for our solutions due to a variety of factors, including market transitions, general economic conditions, competition, product obsolescence, technological change, shifts in buying patterns, the timing and duration of hardware refresh cycles, financial difficulties and budget constraints of our current and potential customers, public awareness of security threats to it systems and other factors. while such factors may, in some periods, increase product sales, fluctuations in demand can also negatively impact our sales. if demand for our solutions declines, whether due to general economic conditions, a shift in buying patterns or otherwise, our revenues and margins would likely be adversely affected.
fluctuations in our quarterly financial results have affected the trading price of our outstanding securities in the past and could affect the trading price of outstanding securities in the future.
our quarterly financial results have fluctuated in the past and are likely to vary in the future due to a number of factors, many of which are outside of our control. if our quarterly financial results or our predictions of future financial results fail to meet our expectations or the expectations of securities analysts and investors, the trading price of our outstanding securities could be negatively affected. volatility in our quarterly financial results may make it more difficult for us to raise capital in the future or pursue acquisitions. our operating results for prior periods may not be effective predictors of our future performance.
factors associated with our industry, the operation of our business, and the markets for our solutions may cause our quarterly financial results to fluctuate, including:
   fluctuations in our revenue due to the transition of our sales contracts to a higher mix of products subject to ratable versus point-in-time revenue recognition;

   the timing of satisfying revenue recognition criteria, particularly with regard to our enterprise sales transactions, as a result of our adoption of new revenue recognition accounting standards under asc 606 on march 31, 2018;

   fluctuations in demand for our solutions;

   entry of new competition into our markets;

   competitive pricing pressure for one or more of our classes of our solutions;

12
   our ability to timely complete the release of new or enhanced versions of our solutions;

   the timing and extent of significant restructuring charges;

   the impact of acquisitions and our ability to achieve expected synergies;

   fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates;

   the number, severity, and timing of threat outbreaks (e.g. worms, viruses, malware, ransomware and other malicious threats)
and cyber security incidents (e.g., large scale data breaches);

   our resellers making a substantial portion of their purchases near the end of each quarter;

   customers tendency to negotiate licenses and other agreements near the end of each quarter;

   cancellation, deferral, or limitation of orders by customers;

   changes in the mix or type of products and subscriptions sold;

   our ability to achieve targeted operating income and margins;

   movements in interest rates;

   the rate of adoption of new technologies and new releases of operating systems;

   changes in tax laws, rules, and regulations;

   weakness or uncertainty in general economic or industry conditions in any of the multiple markets in which we operate that could reduce customer demand and ability to pay for our solutions;

   political and military instability caused by war or other events, which could slow spending within our target markets, delay sales cycles, and otherwise adversely affect our ability to generate revenues and operate effectively;

   the timing of and rate and discounts at which customers replace older versions of our hardware products that reach end of life; and

   disruptions in our business operations or target markets caused by, among other things, terrorism or other intentional acts, outbreaks of disease, or earthquakes, floods, or other natural disasters.

any of the foregoing factors could cause the trading price of our outstanding securities to fluctuate significantly.
our business depends on customers renewing their arrangements for maintenance, subscriptions, managed security services and cloud-based (cloud) offerings.
a large portion of our revenue is derived from arrangements for maintenance, subscriptions, managed security services and cloud offerings, yet customers have no contractual obligation to purchase additional solutions after the initial subscription or contract period. our customers renewal rates, and our customer retention, may decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including their level of satisfaction with our solutions or our customer support, customer budgets and the pricing of our solutions compared with the solutions offered by our competitors, any of which may cause our revenue to grow more slowly than expected, or to decline. accordingly, we must invest significant time and resources in providing ongoing value to our customers. if these efforts fail, or if our customers do not renew for other reasons, or if they renew on terms less favorable to us, our revenue may decline and our business will suffer.
matters relating to or arising from our audit committee investigation, including regulatory investigations and proceedings, litigation matters and potential additional expenses, may adversely affect our business and results of operations.
as previously disclosed in our public filings, the audit committee of our board of directors (the audit committee) has recently completed an internal investigation (the audit committee investigation). in connection with the audit committee investigation, we voluntarily contacted the sec in may 2018. the sec commenced a formal investigation and we continue to cooperate with that investigation.
13
furthermore, if the sec commences legal action, we could be required to pay significant penalties and become subject to injunctions, a cease and desist order and other equitable remedies. the completion of the audit committee investigation and filing of delinquent periodic reports will not automatically resolve the sec investigation. we can provide no assurances as to the outcome of any governmental investigation.
we have incurred, and may continue to incur, significant expenses related to legal, accounting, and other professional services in connection with the internal investigation and related legal matters. these expenses, the delay in timely filing our periodic reports, and the diversion of the attention of the management team that has occurred, and is expected to continue, has adversely affected, and could continue to adversely affect, our business and financial condition.
as a result of the matters reported above, we are exposed to greater risks associated with litigation, regulatory proceedings and government enforcement actions. in addition, securities class actions and other lawsuits have been filed against us, our directors and officers (see also, we are subject to pending securities class action and stockholder derivative legal proceedings below). any future investigations or additional lawsuits may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
we are subject to pending securities class action and stockholder derivative legal proceedings that may adversely affect our business.
several securities class action and derivative lawsuits were filed against us following our announcement on may 10, 2018 of the audit committee investigation, including an action brought derivatively on behalf of symantecs 2008 employee stock purchase plan. in addition, we have received certain demands from purported stockholders to inspect corporate books and records under delaware law. no specific amounts of damages have been alleged in these lawsuits. we will continue to incur legal fees in connection with these pending cases, including expenses for the reimbursement of legal fees of present and former officers and directors under indemnification obligations. the expense of continuing to defend such litigation may be significant. we intend to defend these lawsuits vigorously, but there can be no assurance that we will be successful in any defense. if any of the lawsuits related to our audit committee investigation are decided adversely, we may be liable for significant damages directly or under our indemnification obligations, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and cash flows. further, the amount of time that will be required to resolve these lawsuits is unpredictable and these actions may divert managements attention from the day-to-day operations of our business, which could further adversely affect our business, results of operations and cash flows.
we have not been in compliance with nasdaqs requirements for continued listing and as a result our common stock may be delisted from trading on nasdaq, which would have a material effect on us and our stockholders.
we were delinquent in the filing of our periodic reports with the sec and have delayed convening our 2018 annual meeting of stockholders (the annual meeting), as a result of which we are not in compliance with listing requirements of the nasdaq stock market llc (nasdaq) listing rule 5250(c)(1), which requires timely filing of periodic financial reports with the sec. under nasdaqs listing rules, we were permitted to submit to nasdaq a plan to regain compliance with the nasdaq listing rules. we previously submitted such a plan to the nasdaq staff, and nasdaq has granted us until november 26, 2018 to regain compliance. we expect to file our delinquent quarterly reports as promptly as practicable following this annual report filing, however there can be no guarantee that we will be able to file by november 26, 2018, in which case our common stock may again be subject to delisting by nasdaq. if our common stock is delisted, there can no assurance whether or when it would
14
again be listed for trading on nasdaq or any other exchange. if our common stock is delisted, the market price of our shares will likely decline and become more volatile, and our stockholders may find that their ability to trade in our stock will be adversely affected. furthermore, institutions whose charters do not allow them to hold securities in unlisted companies might sell our shares, which could have a further adverse effect on the price of our stock.
the delayed filing of some of our periodic sec reports has made us currently ineligible to use a registration statement on form s-3 to register the offer and sale of securities, which could adversely affect our ability to raise future capital or complete acquisitions.
as a result of the delayed filing of some of our periodic reports with the sec, we will not be eligible to register the offer and sale of our securities using a registration statement on form s-3 until november 2019 at the earliest. should we wish to register the offer and sale of our securities to the public prior to the time we are eligible to use form s-3, both our transaction costs and the amount of time required to complete the transaction could increase, making it more difficult to execute any such transaction successfully and potentially harming our financial condition.
if we are unable to develop new and enhanced solutions that achieve widespread market acceptance, or if we are unable to continually improve the performance, features, and reliability of our existing solutions or adapt our business model to keep pace with industry trends, our competitive position may weaken and our business and operating results could be adversely affected.
our future success depends on our ability to effectively respond to the rapidly changing needs of our customers, as well as competitive technological developments and industry changes by developing or introducing new and enhanced solutions on a timely basis.
we have in the past incurred, and will continue to incur, significant research and development expenses as we strive to remain competitive. if we are unable to anticipate or react to competitive challenges or if existing or new competitors gain market share in any of our markets, our competitive position could weaken, and we could experience a decline in our sales that could adversely affect our business and operating results. additionally, we must continually address the challenges of dynamic and accelerating market trends and competitive developments, such as the emergence of advanced persistent threats in the security space, the continued decline in the pc market and the market shift towards mobility and the increasing transition towards cloud-based solutions, all of which continue to make it more difficult for us to compete effectively. for example, although we have been investing heavily in solutions that address the cloud security market, we cannot be certain that it will develop at a rate or in the manner we expect or that we will be able to compete successfully with new entrants or more established competitors. customers may require features and capabilities that our current solutions do not have. our failure to develop new solutions and improve our existing solutions that satisfy customer preferences and effectively compete with other market offerings in a timely and cost-effective manner may harm our ability to renew our subscriptions with existing customers and to create or increase demand for our solutions, which may adversely impact our operating results. the development and introduction of new solutions involves a significant commitment of time and resources and are subject to a number of risks and challenges including:
   lengthy development cycles;

   evolving industry standards and technological developments by our competitors and customers;

   evolving platforms, operating systems and hardware products, such as mobile devices, and related product and service interoperability challenges;

   entering into new or unproven markets;

   executing new product and service strategies;

15
   trade compliance difficulties;

   developing or expanding efficient sales channels; and

   obtaining sufficient licenses to technology and technical access to operating system software.

if we are not successful in managing these risks and challenges, or if our new or improved solutions are not technologically competitive or do not achieve market acceptance, our business and operating results could be adversely affected.
if we are unable to attract and retain qualified employees, lose key personnel, fail to integrate replacement personnel successfully, or fail to manage our employee base effectively, we may be unable to develop new and enhanced solutions, effectively manage or expand our business, or increase our revenues.
our future success depends upon our ability to recruit and retain key management, technical, sales, marketing, finance and other personnel. our officers and other key personnel are employees-at-will, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to retain them. competition for people with the specific skills that we require is significant, especially in and around our headquarters in silicon valley, and we face difficulties in attracting, retaining and motivating employees as a result. in order to attract and retain personnel in a competitive marketplace, we believe that we must provide a competitive compensation package, including cash and equity-based compensation. additionally, changes in immigration laws could impair our ability to attract and retain highly qualified employees. if we fail to attract new personnel or fail to retain and motivate our current personnel, our business and future growth prospects could suffer. the volatility in our stock price may from time to time adversely affect our ability to recruit or retain employees. in addition, we may be unable to obtain required stockholder approvals of future increases in the number of shares required for issuance under our equity compensation plans. as a result, we may issue fewer equity-based incentives and may be impaired in our efforts to attract and retain necessary personnel. if we are unable to hire and retain qualified employees, or conversely, if we fail to manage employee performance or reduce staffing levels when required by market conditions, our business and operating results could be adversely affected.
effective succession planning is also important to our long-term success. failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving key employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution. from time to time, key personnel leave our company. although we strive to reduce the negative impact of changes in our leadership, the loss of any key employee could result in significant disruptions to our operations, including adversely affecting the timeliness of product releases, the successful implementation and completion of company initiatives, the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, our internal control over financial reporting, and our results of operations. in addition, hiring, training, and successfully integrating replacement sales and other personnel could be time consuming and expensive, may cause additional disruptions to our operations, and may be unsuccessful, which could negatively impact future financial results. these risks may be exacerbated by the uncertainty associated with the acquisitions, divestitures and transitions we have experienced over the last few years.
we operate in a highly competitive environment, and our competitors may gain market share in the markets for our solutions that could adversely affect our business and cause our revenues to decline.
we operate in intensely competitive markets that experience rapid technological developments, changes in industry standards, changes in customer requirements and frequent new product introductions and improvements. if we are unable to anticipate or react to these competitive challenges or if existing or new competitors gain market share in any of our markets, our competitive position could weaken and we could experience a decline in our sales that could adversely affect our business
16
and operating results. to compete successfully, we must maintain an innovative research and development effort to develop new solutions and enhance our existing solutions, effectively adapt to changes in the technology or product rights held by our competitors, appropriately respond to competitive strategies and effectively adapt to technological changes and changes in the ways that our information is accessed, used and stored within our enterprise and consumer markets. if we are unsuccessful in responding to our competitors or to changing technological and customer demands, our competitive position and our financial results could be adversely affected.
our competitors include software and cloud-based vendors that offer solutions that directly compete with our offerings. in addition to competing with these vendors directly for sales to end-users of our solutions, we compete with them for the opportunity to have our solutions bundled with the offerings of our strategic partners such as computer hardware oems and isps. our competitors could gain market share from us if any of these strategic partners replace our solutions with those of our competitors or if these partners more actively promote our competitors solutions than our own. in addition, software and cloud-based vendors who have bundled our solutions with theirs may choose to bundle their solutions with their own or other vendors solutions or may limit our access to standard interfaces and inhibit our ability to develop solutions for their platform. in the future, further product development by these vendors could cause our solutions to become redundant, which could significantly impact our sales and financial results.
we face growing competition from network equipment, computer hardware manufacturers, large operating system providers and other technology companies, as well as from companies in the identity threat protection space such as credit bureaus. many of these competitors are increasingly developing and incorporating into their products data protection software that competes at some levels with our offerings. our competitive position could be adversely affected to the extent that our customers perceive the functionality incorporated into these products as replacing the need for our solutions.
security protection is also offered by some of our competitors at prices lower than our prices or, in some cases is offered free of charge. some companies offer lower-priced or free security products within their computer hardware or software products. our competitive position could be adversely affected to the extent that our customers perceive these lower cost or free security products as replacing the need for more effective, full featured solutions, such as those that we provide. the expansion of these competitive trends could have a significant negative impact on our sales and operating results by causing, among other things, price reductions of our solutions, reduced profitability and loss of market share.
many of our competitors have greater financial, technical, sales, marketing or other resources than we do and consequently, may have the ability to influence customers to purchase their products instead of ours. further consolidation within our industry or other changes in the competitive environment could result in larger competitors that compete with us on several levels. we also face competition from many smaller companies that specialize in particular segments of the markets in which we compete.
our cloud offerings present execution and competitive risks.
our cloud offerings are critical to our business. our competitors are rapidly developing and deploying cloud offerings for consumers and business customers. pricing and delivery models are evolving. devices and form factors influence how users access services in the cloud. we have made and are continuing to make significant investments in, and devoting significant resources to develop and deploy, our own cloud strategies. we cannot assure you that our ongoing investments in and development of cloud offerings will achieve the expected returns for us or that we will be able to compete successfully in the marketplace. in addition to software development costs, we are incurring significant costs to build and maintain infrastructure to support cloud offerings. these costs may
17
reduce the operating margins we have previously achieved. whether we are successful in this business model depends on our execution in a number of areas, including:
   continuing to innovate and bring to market compelling cloud-based solutions that generate increasing traffic and market share; and

   ensuring that our cloud offerings meet the reliability expectations of our customers and maintain the security of their data.

over the long term we intend to invest in research and development activities, and these investments may achieve delayed, or lower than expected, benefits which could harm our operating results.
while we continue to focus on managing our costs and expenses, over the long term, we also intend to invest significantly in research and development activities as we focus on organic growth through internal innovation in each of our business segments. we believe that we must continue to dedicate a significant amount of resources to our research and development efforts to maintain our competitive position, and that the level of these investments will increase in future periods. we recognize the costs associated with these research and development investments earlier than the anticipated benefits, and the return on these investments may be lower, or may develop more slowly, than we expect. if we do not achieve the benefits anticipated from these investments, or if the achievement of these benefits is delayed, our operating results may be adversely affected.
changes in industry structure and market conditions could lead to charges related to discontinuance of certain of our products or businesses and asset impairments.
in response to changes in industry structure and market conditions, we may be required to strategically reallocate our resources and consider restructuring, disposing of or otherwise exiting certain businesses. any decision to limit investment in or dispose of or otherwise exit businesses may result in the recording of special charges, such as inventory and technology-related write-offs, workforce reduction costs, charges relating to consolidation of excess facilities or claims from third parties who were resellers or users of discontinued products. our estimates with respect to the useful life or ultimate recoverability of our carrying basis of assets, including purchased intangible assets, could change as a result of such assessments and decisions. although in certain instances our supply agreements allow us the option to cancel, reschedule and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to firm orders being placed, our loss contingencies may include liabilities for contracts that we cannot cancel, reschedule or adjust with contract manufacturers and suppliers.
further, our estimates relating to the liabilities for excess facilities are affected by changes in real estate market conditions. additionally, we are required to evaluate goodwill impairment on an annual basis and between annual evaluations in certain circumstances, and future goodwill impairment evaluations may result in a charge to earnings.
we may need to change our pricing models to compete successfully.
the intense competition we face, in addition to general and economic business conditions, can put pressure on us to change our prices. if our competitors offer deep discounts on certain solutions or develop products or support offerings that the marketplace considers more valuable, we may need to lower prices or offer other favorable terms in order to compete successfully. any such changes may reduce margins and could adversely affect our operating results.
any broad-based change to our prices and pricing policies could cause our revenues to decline or be delayed as our sales force implements and our customers adjust to the new pricing policies. we or our competitors may bundle solutions for promotional purposes or as a long-term go-to-market or
18
pricing strategy or provide guarantees of prices. these practices could, over time, significantly constrain the prices that we can charge for certain of our offerings.
defects, disruptions or risks related to our cloud offerings could impair our ability to deliver our services and could expose us to liability, damage our brand and reputation or otherwise negatively impact our business.
our cloud offerings may contain errors or defects that users identify after they begin using them that could result in unanticipated service interruptions, which could harm our reputation and our business. since our customers use our cloud offerings for mission-critical protection from threats to electronic information, endpoint devices, and computer networks, any errors, defects, disruptions in service or other performance problems with our cloud offerings could significantly harm our reputation and may damage our customers businesses. if any such performance problems occur, customers could elect not to renew, or delay or withhold payment to us, we could lose future sales or customers may make warranty or other claims against us, which could result in an increase in our provision for doubtful accounts or warranty, an increase in collection cycles for accounts receivable or the expense and risk of litigation.
we currently serve our cloud-based customers from hosting facilities, including third-party hosting facilities, located across the globe. damage to, or failure of, any significant element of these hosting facilities could result in interruptions in our service, which could harm our customers and expose us to liability. the occurrence of a natural disaster or an act of terrorism, a decision to close the facilities without adequate notice or other unanticipated problems could result in lengthy interruptions in the delivery of our solutions. interruptions or failures in our service delivery could cause customers to terminate their subscriptions with us, could adversely affect our renewal rates, and could harm our ability to attract new customers. our business would also be harmed if our customers believe that our cloud offerings are unreliable.
our solutions are complex and operate in a wide variety of environments, systems, applications and configurations, which could result in failures of our solutions to function as designed.
because we offer very complex solutions, undetected errors, failures or bugs may occur, especially when solutions are first introduced or when new versions are released. our products are often installed and used in large-scale computing environments with different operating systems, system management software, and equipment and networking configurations, which may cause errors or failures in our solutions or may expose undetected errors, failures, or bugs in our solutions. our customers computing environments are often characterized by a wide variety of standard and non-standard configurations that make pre-release testing for programming or compatibility errors very difficult and time-consuming. in addition, despite testing by us and others, errors, failures, or bugs may not be found in new solutions or releases until after they are delivered to customers. in the past, we have discovered software errors, failures, and bugs in certain of our solutions after their introduction and, in some cases, have experienced delayed or lost revenues as a result of these errors.
errors, failures, or bugs in solutions released by us could result in negative publicity, damage to our brand and reputation, returns, loss of or delay in market acceptance of our products, loss of competitive position, or claims by customers or others. many of our end-user customers use our solutions in applications that are critical to their businesses and may have a greater sensitivity to defects in our solutions than to defects in other, less critical, software products. in addition, if an actual or perceived breach of information integrity, security or availability occurs in one of our end-user customers systems, regardless of whether the breach is attributable to our products, the market perception of the effectiveness of our solutions could be harmed. alleviating any of these problems could require significant expenditures, our capital and other resources and could cause interruptions,
19
delays, or cessation of our licensing, which could cause us to lose existing or potential customers and could adversely affect our operating results.
our products, solutions, cloud offerings, systems and website may be subject to intentional disruption that could adversely impact our reputation and future sales.
despite our precautions and significant ongoing investments to protect against security risks, data protection breaches, cyber-attacks and other intentional disruptions of our solutions, we expect to be an ongoing target of attacks specifically designed to impede the performance and availability of our offerings and harm our reputation as a company. similarly, experienced computer programmers or other sophisticated individuals or entities may attempt to penetrate our network security or the security of our systems and website and misappropriate proprietary information or cause interruptions of our services, including the operation of our global civilian cyber intelligence threat network. while we invest and devote significant resources to maintain and continually enhance and update our methods to detect and alert us to such breaches, attacks and disruptions, these efforts may not be sufficient, even with rapid detection, to prevent the damage such a breach of our products, solutions, cloud offerings, systems, and website may cause.
our inability to successfully recover from a disaster or other business continuity event could impair our ability to deliver our products and services and harm our business.
we are heavily reliant on our technology and infrastructure to provide our products and services to our customers. for example, we host many of our products using third-party data center facilities and we do not control the operation of these facilities. these facilities are vulnerable to damage, interruption or performance problems from earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, fires, power loss, telecommunications failures and similar events. they are also subject to break-ins, computer viruses, sabotage, intentional acts of vandalism and other misconduct. the occurrence of a natural disaster or an act of terrorism, a decision to close the facilities without adequate notice or other unanticipated problems could result in lengthy interruptions in the delivery of our products and services.
furthermore, our business administration, human resources and finance services depend on the proper functioning of our computer, telecommunication and other related systems and operations. a disruption or failure of these systems or operations because of a disaster or other business continuity event could cause data to be lost or otherwise delay our ability to complete sales and provide the highest level of service to our customers. in addition, we could have difficulty producing accurate financial statements on a timely basis, which could adversely affect the trading value of our stock. although we endeavor to ensure there is redundancy in these systems and that they are regularly backed-up, there are no assurances that data recovery in the event of a disaster would be effective or occur in an efficient manner, including the operation of our global civilian cyber intelligence threat network.
any errors, defects, disruptions or other performance problems with our products and services could harm our reputation and may damage our customers businesses. for example, we may experience disruptions, outages and other performance problems due to a variety of factors, including infrastructure changes, human or software errors, capacity constraints due to an overwhelming number of users accessing our website simultaneously, fraud or security attacks. in some instances, we may not be able to identify the cause or causes of these performance problems within an acceptable period of time. interruptions in our products and services, including the operation of our global civilian cyber intelligence threat network, could impact our revenues or cause customers to cease doing business with us. in addition, our business would be harmed if any of events of this nature caused our customers and potential customers to believe our services are unreliable. our operations are dependent upon our ability to protect our technology infrastructure against damage from business
20
continuity events that could have a significant disruptive effect on our operations. we could potentially lose customer data or experience material adverse interruptions to our operations or delivery of services to our clients in a disaster recovery scenario.
we collect, use, disclose, store or otherwise process personal information, which subjects us to privacy and data security laws and contractual commitments, and our actual or perceived failure to comply with such laws and commitments could harm our business.
we collect, use, store or disclose (collectively, process) an increasingly large amount of personal information, including from employees and customers, in connection with the operation of our business, particularly in relation to our identity and fraud protection offerings. we process an increasingly high volume, variety and velocity of personal information as a result of our identity and fraud protection offerings that rely on large data repositories of personal information and consumer transactions. the personal information we process is subject to an increasing number of federal, state, local and foreign laws regarding privacy and data security, as well as contractual commitments. any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with such obligations may result in governmental enforcement actions, fines, litigation, or public statements against us by consumer advocacy groups or others and could cause our customers to lose trust in us, which could have an adverse effect on our reputation and business. additionally, changes to applicable privacy or data security laws could impact how we process personal information, and therefore limit the effectiveness of our solutions or our ability to develop new solutions. for example, the european union general data protection regulation, which becomes fully effective on may 25, 2018, imposes more stringent data protection requirements, and provides for greater penalties for noncompliance of up to the greater of 20 million or four percent of worldwide annual revenues. our customers may also accidentally disclose their passwords or store them on a device that is lost or stolen, creating the perception that our systems are not secure against third-party access.
additionally, third parties with whom we work, such as vendors or developers, may violate applicable laws or our policies and such violations can place personal information of our customers at risk. this could have an adverse effect on our reputation and business. in addition, such third parties could be the target of cyberattack and other data breaches which could impact our systems or our customers records.
our acquisitions and divestitures create special risks and challenges that could adversely affect our financial results.
as part of our business strategy, we may acquire or divest businesses or assets. these activities can involve a number of risks and challenges, including:
   complexity, time and costs associated with managing these transactions, including the integration of acquired business operations, workforce, products, it systems and technologies;

   diversion of management time and attention;

   loss or termination of employees, including costs associated with the termination or replacement of those employees;

   assumption of liabilities of the acquired business or assets, including litigation related to the acquired business or assets;

   the addition of acquisition-related debt;

   increased or unexpected costs and working capital requirements;

   dilution of stock ownership of existing stockholders;

   unanticipated delays or failure to meet contractual obligations; and

   substantial accounting charges for acquisition-related costs, amortization of intangible assets, and higher levels of stock-based compensation expense.

21
we have invested and continue to invest and devote significant resources in the integration of businesses we acquire, including our august 2016 acquisition of blue coat, inc. (blue coat) and february 2017 acquisition of lifelock, inc. (life lock). the success of each acquisition depends in part on our ability to realize the anticipated business opportunities, including certain cost savings and operational efficiencies or synergies and growth prospects from integrating these businesses in an efficient and effective manner. if integration of our acquired businesses is not successful, we may not realize the potential benefits of an acquisition or suffer other adverse effects. to integrate acquired businesses, we must integrate and manage the personnel and business systems of the acquired operations. we also must effectively integrate the different cultures of acquired business organizations into our own in a way that aligns various interests, and may need to enter new markets in which we have no or limited experience and where competitors in such markets have stronger market positions. moreover, to be successful, large complex acquisitions depend on large-scale product, technology and sales force integrations that are difficult to complete on a timely basis or at all, and may be more susceptible to the special risks and challenges described above.
in addition, we have in the past, and may in the future, divest businesses, product lines or assets. for example, in january 2016 we completed the sale of veritas, and in october 2017 we divested our wss and pki solutions. these and similar initiatives may require significant separation activities that could result in the diversion of managements time and attention, loss of employees, substantial separation costs and accounting charges for asset impairments.
any of the foregoing, and other factors, could harm our ability to achieve anticipated levels of profitability or other financial benefits from our acquired or divested businesses, product lines or assets or to realize other anticipated benefits of divestitures or acquisitions.
if we fail to manage our sales and distribution channels effectively, or if our partners choose not to market and sell our solutions to their customers, our operating results could be adversely affected.
we sell our solutions to customers around the world through multi-tiered sales and distribution networks.
sales through these different channels involve distinct risks, including the following:
direct sales. a significant portion of our revenues from enterprise products is derived from sales by our direct sales force to end-users. risks associated with direct sales include:
   longer sales cycles associated with direct sales efforts;

   difficulty in hiring, retaining, and motivating our direct sales force, particularly through periods of transition in our organization;

              substantial amounts of training for sales representatives to become productive in selling our solutions, including regular updates to our products, and associated delays and difficulties in recognizing the expected benefits of investments in new products and updates;

   increased administrative costs in processing orders and increased credit risk in pursuing payment from each end user; and

   increased responsibility for custom and export activities that may result in added costs.

indirect sales channels. a significant portion of our revenues is derived from sales through indirect channels, including distributors that sell our products to end-users and other resellers. this channel involves a number of risks, including:
   our resellers and distributors are generally not subject to minimum sales requirements or any obligation to market our solutions to their customers;

22
   our reseller and distributor agreements are generally nonexclusive and may be terminated at any time without cause;

   our lack of control over the timing of delivery of our solutions to end-users;

   our resellers and distributors may violate applicable law or regulatory requirements or otherwise cause damage to our reputation through their actions;

      our resellers and distributors frequently market and distribute competing solutions and may, from time to time, place greater emphasis on the sale of these solutions due to pricing, promotions, and other terms offered by our competitors; and

   any consolidation of electronics retailers can continue to increase their negotiating power with respect to hardware and software providers such as us.

oem sales channels. a portion of our revenues is derived from sales through our oem partners that incorporate our products into, or bundle our products with, their products. our reliance on this sales channel involves many risks, including:
   our lack of control over the volume of products delivered and the timing of such delivery;

   most of our oem partners are not subject to minimum sales requirements. generally our oem partners do not have any obligation to market our products to their customers;

   our oem partners may terminate or renegotiate their arrangements with us and new terms may be less favorable due to competitive conditions in our markets and other factors;

   sales through our oem partners are subject to changes in general economic conditions, strategic direction, competitive risks, and other issues that could result in a reduction of oem sales;

   the development work that we must generally undertake under our agreements with our oem partners may require us to invest significant resources and incur significant costs with little or no assurance of ever receiving associated revenues;

   the time and expense required for the sales and marketing organizations of our oem partners to become familiar with our solutions may make it more difficult to introduce those solutions to the market; and

   our oem partners may develop, market, and distribute their own solutions and market and distribute products of our competitors, which could reduce our sales.

if we fail to manage our sales and distribution channels successfully, these channels may conflict with one another or otherwise fail to perform as we anticipate, which could reduce our sales and increase our expenses as well as weaken our competitive position. some of our distribution partners have experienced financial difficulties in the past, and if our partners suffer financial difficulties in the future because of general economic conditions or for other reasons, these partners may delay paying their obligations to us and we may have reduced revenues or collections that could adversely affect our operating results. in addition, reliance on multiple channels subjects us to events that could cause unpredictability in demand, which could increase the risk that we may be unable to plan effectively for the future, and could adversely affect our operating results.
we face heightened regulation in our consumer digital safety segment, which could impede our ability to market and provide our solutions or adversely affect our business, financial position and results of operations.
we are subject to heightened regulation in our consumer digital safety segment as a result of the sale of our identity and information protection products, which we began selling at the end of fiscal 2017 as a result of our acquisition of lifelock , including a wide variety of federal, state, and local laws and regulations, including the fair credit reporting act, the gramm-leach-bliley act, the federal trade commission act (ftc act), and comparable state laws that are patterned after the ftc act. moreover, lifelock entered into consent decrees and similar arrangements with the federal trade
23
commission (the ftc) and 35 states attorneys general in 2010, and a settlement with the ftc in 2015 relating to allegations that certain of lifelocks advertising and marketing practices constituted deceptive acts or practices in violation of the ftc act, which impose additional restrictions on the lifelock business, including prohibitions against making any misrepresentation of the means, methods, procedures, effects, effectiveness, coverage, or scope of lifelocks identity theft protection services. any of the laws and regulations that apply to our business are subject to revision or new or changed interpretations, and we cannot predict the impact of such changes on our business.
additionally, the nature of our identity and information protection products subjects us to the broad regulatory, supervisory, and enforcement powers of the consumer financial protection bureau (cfpb) which may exercise authority with respect to our services, or the marketing and servicing of those services, by overseeing our financial institution or credit reporting agency customers and suppliers, or by otherwise exercising its supervisory, regulatory, or enforcement authority over consumer financial products and services.
our international operations involve risks that could increase our expenses, adversely affect our operating results, and require increased time and attention of our management.
we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from customers located outside of the u.s. and we have significant operations outside of the u.s., including engineering, sales, customer support, and production. our international operations are subject to risks in addition to those faced by our domestic operations, including:
   potential loss of proprietary information due to misappropriation or laws that may be less protective of our intellectual property rights than u.s. laws or that may not be adequately enforced;

   requirements of foreign laws and other governmental controls, including tariffs, trade barriers and labor restrictions and related laws that reduce the flexibility of our business operations;

   potential changes in trade relations arising from policy initiatives or other political factors;

   regulations or restrictions on the use, import, or export of encryption technologies that could delay or prevent the acceptance and use of encryption products and public networks for secure communications;

   local business and cultural factors that differ from our normal standards and practices, including business practices that we are prohibited from engaging in by the foreign corrupt practices act and other anti-corruption laws and regulations;

   central bank and other restrictions on our ability to repatriate cash from our international subsidiaries or to exchange cash in international subsidiaries into cash available for use in the u.s.;

                        fluctuations in currency exchange rates, economic instability and inflationary conditions could reduce our customers
ability to obtain financing for software products or could make our products more expensive or could increase our costs of doing business in certain countries;

   limitations on future growth or inability to maintain current levels of revenues from international sales if we do not invest sufficiently in our international operations;

   longer payment cycles for sales in foreign countries and difficulties in collecting accounts receivable;

   difficulties in staffing, managing, and operating our international operations;

   difficulties in coordinating the activities of our geographically dispersed and culturally diverse operations;

   seasonal reductions in business activity in the summer months in europe and in other periods in other countries;

   costs and delays associated with developing software and providing support in multiple languages; and

24
   political unrest, war, or terrorism, or regional natural disasters, particularly in areas in which we have facilities.

a significant portion of our transactions outside of the u.s. is denominated in foreign currencies. accordingly, our revenues and expenses will continue to be subject to fluctuations in foreign currency rates. we have in the past and expect in the future to be affected by fluctuations in foreign currency rates, especially if international sales continue to grow as a percentage of our total sales or our operations outside the u.s. continue to increase.
if we fail to accurately predict our manufacturing requirements and manage our supply chain we could incur additional costs or experience manufacturing delays that could harm our business.
we generally provide forecasts of our requirements to our supply chain partners on a rolling basis. if our forecast exceeds our actual requirements, a supply chain partner may assess additional charges or we may have liability for excess inventory, each of which could negatively affect our gross margin. if our forecast is less than our actual requirements, the applicable supply chain partner may have insufficient time or components to produce or fulfill our product requirements, which could delay or interrupt manufacturing of our products or fulfillment of orders for our products, and result in delays in shipments, customer dissatisfaction, and deferral or loss of revenue. further, we may be required to purchase sufficient inventory to satisfy our future needs in situations where a component or product is being discontinued. if we fail to accurately predict our requirements, we may be unable to fulfill those orders or we may be required to record charges for excess inventory. any of the foregoing could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.
we are dependent on original design manufacturers, contract manufacturers and third-party logistics providers to design and manufacture our hardware-based products and to fulfill orders for our hardware-based products.
we depend primarily on original design manufacturers (each of which is a third-party original design manufacturer for numerous companies) to co-design and co-develop the hardware platforms for our products. we also depend on independent contract manufacturers (each of which is a third-party contract manufacturer for numerous companies) to manufacture and fulfill our hardware-based products. these supply chain partners are not committed to design or manufacture our products, or to fulfill orders for our products, on a long-term basis in any specific quantity or at any specific price. in addition, certain of our products or key components of our products are currently manufactured by a single third-party supplier. there are alternative suppliers that could provide components, as our agreements do not provide for exclusivity or minimum purchase quantities, but the transition and qualification from one supplier to another could be lengthy, costly and difficult. also, from time to time, we may be required to add new supply chain partner relationships or new manufacturing or fulfillment sites to accommodate growth in orders or the addition of new products. it is time consuming and costly to qualify and implement new supply chain partner relationships and new manufacturing or fulfillment sites, and such additions increase the complexity of our supply chain management. our ability to ship products to our customers could be delayed, and our business and results of operations could be adversely affected if we fail to effectively manage our supply chain partner relationships; if one or more of our original design manufacturers does not meet our development schedules; if one or more of our independent contract manufacturers experiences delays, disruptions or quality control problems in manufacturing our products; if one or more of our third-party logistics providers experiences delays or disruptions or otherwise fails to meet our fulfillment schedules; or if we are required to add or replace original design manufacturers, independent contract manufacturers, third-party logistics providers or fulfillment sites.
25
in addition, these supply chain partners have access to certain of our critical confidential information and could wrongly disclose or misuse such information or be subject to a breach or other compromise that introduces a vulnerability or other defect in the products manufactured by our supply chain partners. while we take precautions to ensure that hardware manufactured by our independent contractors is reviewed, any espionage acts, malware attacks, theft of confidential information or other malicious cyber incidents perpetrated either directly or indirectly through our independent contractors, may compromise our system infrastructure, expose us to litigation and associated expenses and lead to reputational harm that could result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results. in addition, we are subject to risks resulting from the perception that certain jurisdictions, including china, do not comply with internationally recognized rights of freedom of expression and privacy and may permit labor practices that are deemed unacceptable under evolving standards of social responsibility. if manufacturing or logistics in these foreign countries is disrupted for any reason, including natural disasters, it system failures, military or government actions or economic, business, labor, environmental, public health, or political issues, or if the purchase or sale of products from such foreign countries is prohibited or disfavored, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.
if we do not protect our proprietary information and prevent third parties from making unauthorized use of our products and technology, our financial results could be harmed.
most of our software and underlying technology is proprietary. we seek to protect our proprietary rights through a combination of confidentiality agreements and procedures and through copyright, patent, trademark and trade secret laws. however, these measures afford only limited protection and may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented by third parties. third parties may copy all or portions of our products or otherwise obtain, use, distribute, and sell our proprietary information without authorization.
third parties may also develop similar or superior technology independently by designing around our patents. our shrink-wrap license agreements are not signed by licensees and therefore may be unenforceable under the laws of some jurisdictions. furthermore, the laws of some foreign countries do not offer the same level of protection of our proprietary rights as the laws of the u.s., and we may be subject to unauthorized use of our products in those countries. the unauthorized copying or use of our products or proprietary information could result in reduced sales of our products. any legal action to protect proprietary information that we may bring or be engaged in with a strategic partner or vendor could adversely affect our ability to access software, operating system, and hardware platforms of such partner or vendor, or cause such partner or vendor to choose not to offer our products to their customers. in addition, any legal action to protect proprietary information that we may bring or be engaged in, could be costly, may distract management from day-to-day operations, and may lead to additional claims against us, which could adversely affect our operating results.
from time to time we are a party to lawsuits and investigations, which typically require significant management time and attention and result in significant legal expenses, and which could negatively impact our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.
we have initiated and been named as a party to lawsuits, including patent litigation, class actions and governmental claims and we may be named in additional litigation. the expense of initiating and defending, and in some cases settling, such litigation may be costly and divert managements attention from the day-to-day operations of our business, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and cash flows. in addition, an unfavorable outcome in such litigation could result in significant fines, settlements, monetary damages or injunctive relief that could negatively impact our ability to conduct our business, results of operations, and cash flows.
26
third parties claiming that we infringe their proprietary rights could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and prevent us from selling our products.
from time to time, third parties may claim that we have infringed their intellectual property rights, including claims regarding patents, copyrights, and trademarks. because of constant technological change in the segments in which we compete, the extensive patent coverage of existing technologies, and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents, it is possible that the number of these claims may grow. in addition, former employers of our former, current, or future employees may assert claims that such employees have improperly disclosed to us confidential or proprietary information of these former employers. any such claim, with or without merit, could result in costly litigation and distract management from day-to-day operations. if we are not successful in defending such claims, we could be required to stop selling, delay shipments of, or redesign our products, pay monetary amounts as damages, enter into royalty or licensing arrangements, or satisfy indemnification obligations that we have with some of our customers. we cannot assure you that any royalty or licensing arrangements that we may seek in such circumstances will be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all. we have made and expect to continue making significant expenditures to investigate, defend and settle claims related to the use of technology and intellectual property rights as part of our strategy to manage this risk.
in addition, we license and use software from third parties in our business. these third-party software licenses may not continue to be available to us on acceptable terms or at all, and may expose us to additional liability. this liability, or our inability to use any of this third-party software, could result in delivery delays or other disruptions in our business that could materially and adversely affect our operating results.
changes to our effective tax rate could increase our income tax expense and reduce (increase) our net income (loss).
our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by several factors, many of which are outside of our control, including:
   changes to the u.s. federal income tax laws, including impacts of the recently enacted tax cuts and jobs act (h.r.1) (the
act) and future interpretations of the act, the consequences of which have not yet been fully determined;

                                            changes to other tax laws, regulations, and interpretations in multiple jurisdictions in which we operate, including actions resulting from the organisation for economic co-operation and developments base erosion and profit shifting project, proposed actions by international bodies, as well as the requirements of certain tax rulings;

   changes in the relative proportions of revenues and income before taxes in the various jurisdictions in which we operate that have differing statutory tax rates;

   the tax effects of purchase accounting for acquisitions and restructuring charges that may cause fluctuations between reporting periods; and

   tax assessments, or any related tax interest or penalties that could significantly affect our income tax expense for the period in which the settlements take place.

we report our results of operations based on our determination of the aggregate amount of taxes owed in the tax jurisdictions in which we operate. from time to time, we receive notices that a tax authority in a particular jurisdiction believes that we owe a greater amount of tax than we have reported to such authority. we are regularly engaged in discussions and sometimes disputes with these tax authorities. if the ultimate determination of our taxes owed in any of these jurisdictions is for an amount in excess of the tax provision we have recorded or reserved for, our operating results, cash flows, and financial condition could be adversely affected.
27
we cannot predict our future capital needs and we may be unable to obtain financing, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
adverse economic conditions or a change in our business performance may make it more difficult to obtain financing for our operations, investing activities (including potential acquisitions or divestitures) or financing activities. any required financing may not be available on terms acceptable to us, or at all. if we raise additional funds by obtaining loans from third parties, the terms of those financing arrangements may include negative covenants or other restrictions on our business that could impair our financial or operational flexibility, and would also require us to fund additional interest expense. if additional financing is not available when required or is not available on acceptable terms, we may be unable to successfully develop or enhance our software and services through acquisitions in order to take advantage of business opportunities or respond to competitive pressures, which could have a material adverse effect on our software and services offerings, revenues, results of operations and financial condition.
failure to maintain our credit ratings could adversely affect our liquidity, capital position, ability to hedge certain financial risks, borrowing costs and access to capital markets.
our credit risk is evaluated by the major independent rating agencies, and such agencies have in the past and could in the future downgrade our ratings. we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain our current credit ratings, and any additional actual or anticipated changes or downgrades in our credit ratings, including any announcement that our ratings are under further review for a downgrade, may have a negative impact on our liquidity, capital position, ability to hedge certain financial risks and access to capital markets. in addition, changes by any rating agency to our outlook or credit rating could increase the interest we pay on outstanding or future debt.
there are risks associated with our outstanding and future indebtedness that could adversely affect our financial condition.
as of march 30, 2018, we had an aggregate of $5.1 billion of outstanding indebtedness that will mature in calendar years 2018 through 2025, including approximately $4.0 billion in aggregate principal amount of existing senior notes and $1.1 billion of outstanding term loans under our senior credit facilities, and we may incur additional indebtedness in the future and/or enter into new financing arrangements. in addition, as of march 30, 2018, we had $1.0 billion available for borrowing under our revolving credit facility. our ability to meet expenses, to remain in compliance with the covenants under our debt instruments and to pay interest and repay principal for our substantial level of indebtedness depends on, among other things, our operating performance, competitive developments and financial market conditions, all of which are significantly affected by financial, business, economic and other factors. we are not able to control many of these factors. accordingly, our cash flow may not be sufficient to allow us to pay principal and interest on our debt, including the notes, and meet our other obligations.
our substantial level of indebtedness could have important consequences, including the following:
                                                                 we must use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to pay interest and principal on the term loans and revolving credit facility and our existing senior notes and other indebtedness, which reduces funds available to us for other purposes such as working capital, capital expenditures, other general corporate purposes and potential acquisitions;

   we may be unable to refinance our indebtedness or to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or general corporate purposes;

   we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates because borrowings under our senior credit facilities bear interest at variable rates;

28
   our leverage may be greater than that of some of our competitors, which may put us at a competitive disadvantage and reduce our flexibility in responding to current and changing industry and financial market conditions;

   we may be more vulnerable to an economic downturn and adverse developments in our business;

                                              we may be unable to comply with financial and other covenants in our debt agreements, which could result in an event of default that, if not cured or waived, may result in acceleration of certain of our debt and would have an adverse effect on our business and prospects and could force us into bankruptcy or liquidation; and

   changes by any rating agency to our outlook or credit rating could negatively affect the value of our debt and and/or our common stock, adversely affect our access to debt markets, and increase the interest we pay on outstanding or future debt.

there can be no assurance that we will be able to manage any of these risks successfully.
in addition, we conduct a significant portion of our operations through our subsidiaries, which are generally not guarantors of our debt. accordingly, repayment of our indebtedness will be dependent in part on the generation of cash flow by our subsidiaries and their ability to make such cash available to us by dividend, debt repayment or otherwise. in general, our subsidiaries will not have any obligation to pay amounts due on our debt or to make funds available for that purpose. our subsidiaries may not be able to, or may not be permitted to, make distributions to enable us to make payments in respect of our indebtedness. each subsidiary is a distinct legal entity, and under certain circumstances legal and contractual restrictions may limit our ability to obtain cash from our subsidiaries. in the event that we do not receive distributions from our subsidiaries, we may be unable to make the required principal and interest payments on our indebtedness.
our existing credit agreements impose operating and financial restrictions on us.
the existing credit agreements contain covenants that limit our ability and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to:
   incur additional debt;

   create liens on certain assets to secure debt;

   enter into certain sale and leaseback transactions;

   pay dividends on or make other distributions in respect of our capital stock or make other restricted payments; and

   consolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets.

all of these covenants may adversely affect our ability to finance our operations, meet or otherwise address our capital needs, pursue business opportunities, react to market conditions or otherwise restrict activities or business plans. a breach of any of these covenants could result in a default in respect of the related indebtedness. if a default occurs, the relevant lenders could elect to declare the indebtedness, together with accrued interest and other fees, to be immediately due and payable and, to the extent such indebtedness is secured in the future, proceed against any collateral securing that indebtedness.
some of our products contain open source software, and any failure to comply with the terms of one or more of these open source licenses could negatively affect our business.
certain of our products are distributed with software licensed by its authors or other third parties under so-called open source licenses, which may include, by way of example, the gnu general public license, gnu lesser general public license, the mozilla public license, the bsd license, and the apache license.
29
some of these licenses contain requirements that we make available source code for modifications or derivative works we create based upon the open source software, and that we license such modifications or derivative works under the terms of a particular open source license or other license granting third parties certain rights of further use. by the terms of certain open source licenses, we could be required to release the source code of our proprietary software if we combine our proprietary software with open source software in a certain manner. in addition to risks related to license requirements, usage of open source software can lead to greater risks than use of third party commercial software, as open source licensors generally do not provide warranties or controls on origin of the software. we have established processes to help alleviate these risks, including a review process for screening requests from our development organizations for the use of open source, but we cannot be sure that all open source is submitted for approval prior to use in our products. in addition, many of the risks associated with usage of open source cannot be eliminated, and could, if not properly addressed, negatively affect our business.
our contracts with the u.s. government include compliance, audit and review obligations. any failure to meet these obligations could result in civil damages and/or penalties being assessed against us by the government.
we sell products and services through government contracting programs directly and via partners, though we no longer hold a gsa contract. in the ordinary course of business, sales under these government contracting programs may be subject to audit or investigation by the u.s. government. noncompliance identified as a result of such reviews (as well as noncompliance identified on our own) could subject us to damages and other penalties, which could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.
item 7. managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations please read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included under item 15 of this annual report on form 10-k.overview fiscal calendar and basis of presentation we have a 52/53-week fiscal year ending on the friday closest to march 31. unless otherwise stated, references to years in this report relate to fiscal year ended march 30, 2018, march 31, 2017 and april 1, 2016, each of which was a 52-week year.
key financial metrics the following table provides our key financial metrics for continuing operations for fiscal 2018 compared with fiscal 2017:
(in millions, except for percentages and per share amounts)        fiscal 2018   fiscal 2017
net revenues                                                            $4,834   $4,019
operating income (loss)                                                    $49   $(100           )
income (loss) from continuing operations                                $1,127   $(236           )
income (loss) per share from continuing operations  diluted             $1.69   $(0.38          )
cash, cash equivalent and short-term investments                        $2,162   $4,256
net cash provided by (used in) continuing operating activities            $957   $(145           )
deferred revenue                                                        $3,103   $2,787
                                                                 net revenues grew 20% in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 primarily as a result of the inclusion of revenue from our consumer identity and information protection products acquired at the end of fiscal 2017 for a full year and increased revenues from sales of our enterprise network and web security solutions which included products acquired in our fiscal 2017
acquisition, partially offset by a decrease in revenue as a result of the divestiture of our wss and pki solutions. see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on our products and services revenues.

                                                                       operating income increased primarily as a result of increased net revenues and our cost reduction initiatives and integration synergy program we announced in fiscal 2017. this increase was partially offset by increased operating expenses as a result of acquisitions of blue coat and lifelock, including stock-based compensation, amortization of intangible assets, and advertising and promotional expenses. the increase in operating income was also partially offset by increased transition costs primarily due to costs related to our enterprise resource planning and supporting systems and separation costs related to the divestiture of our wss and pki solutions.

36
                                                                 income from continuing operations and diluted income per share from continuing operations increased primarily as a result of the $653 million gain on the divestiture of our wss and pki solutions and a net tax benefit of $690 million primarily as a result of the tax cuts and jobs act (h.r.1) (the act). partially offsetting the increase in the diluted income per share from continuing operations was a higher diluted share count due to including the dilutive effect of potentially issuable common shares under our equity award programs and convertible debt. such potentially issuable common shares were excluded from our net loss per share computation in fiscal 2017 as they would have been anti-dilutive.

                                                                  cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments decreased primarily as a result of our $3.2 billion of debt repayments as part of our plan to deleverage our balance sheet and $401 million paid for acquisitions, partially offset by $933 million in net cash proceeds from the divestiture of our wss and pki solutions and cash flow from continuing operating activities of $957 million.

                                                           cash flow from continuing operating activities increased primarily due to a one-time tax payment of $887 million related to the gain on sale from the divestiture of our information management business (veritas) in fiscal 2017 and an increase in deferred revenue.

                                                             deferred revenue increased $316 million, primarily due to our shift in sales contracts to a higher mix of solutions subject to ratable versus point in time revenue recognition and longer contract duration in our enterprise security segment, which resulted in less in-period revenue recognized, and due to higher billings towards the end of the fiscal year, reflecting seasonal sales cycles in that segment. these factors were partially offset by a decrease of $319 million in deferred revenue as a result of the divestiture of our wss and pki solutions.

critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related notes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the u.s. (gaap) requires us to make estimates, including judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. we have based our estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. we evaluate our estimates on a regular basis and make changes accordingly. management believes that the accounting estimates employed and the resulting amounts are reasonable; however, actual results may differ from these estimates. making estimates and judgments about future events is inherently unpredictable and is subject to significant uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control. should any of these estimates and assumptions change or prove to have been incorrect, it could have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.
a summary of our significant accounting policies is included in note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10-k. an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made, if different estimates reasonably could have been used, or if changes in the estimate that are reasonably possible could materially impact the financial statements. management believes the following critical accounting policies reflect the significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.
revenue recognition we recognize revenue primarily pursuant to the requirements under the authoritative guidance on software revenue recognition, and any applicable amendments or modifications. revenue recognition requirements in the software industry are very complex and require us to make estimates and assumptions.

we enter into arrangements that can include various combinations of software and non-software elements. where elements are delivered over different periods of time, and when allowed under gaap, revenue is allocated to the respective elements based on their relative selling prices at the inception of the arrangement, and revenue is recognized as each element is delivered. we use a hierarchy to determine the fair value to be used for allocating revenue to non-software elements: (i) vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value (vsoe), (ii) third-party evidence, and (iii) estimated selling price (esp). for software elements, we follow the industry-specific software guidance which only allows for the use of vsoe in establishing fair value. vsoe of each element is based on the price for which the undelivered element is sold separately by us. we determine fair value of the undelivered elements based on historical evidence of our stand-alone sales of these elements to third parties or from the stated renewal rate for the undelivered elements. when vsoe does not exist for serial undelivered items, the entire arrangement fee is recognized ratably over the performance period. when vsoe does not exist for a discrete undelivered item, consideration for the entire arrangement is deferred until that item is delivered. our deferred revenue consists primarily of the unamortized balance of enterprise product maintenance, consumer product content updates, managed security services, subscriptions, and arrangements where vsoe does not exist. changes to the elements in a software arrangement, the ability to identify vsoe for those elements, the fair value of the respective elements, and increasing flexibility in contractual arrangements could materially impact the amount recognized in the current period and deferred over time. esps for non-software elements are established as best estimates of what the selling prices would be if the deliverables were sold regularly on a stand-alone basis. our process for determining esps requires judgment and considers multiple factors that may vary over time depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each deliverable.
valuation of goodwill, intangible assets and long-lived assets business combinations. we allocate the purchase price of acquired businesses to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values on the acquisition date. any residual purchase price is recorded as goodwill. goodwill is allocated to reporting units expected to benefit from the business combination. the allocation of purchase price requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions in determining the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed especially with respect to intangible assets.
critical estimates in valuing intangible assets include, but are not limited to, future expected cash flows from customer relationships, developed technology, trade names and acquired patents; and discount rates. management estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual results.
income taxes we are subject to tax in multiple u.s. and foreign tax jurisdictions. we are required to estimate the current tax exposure as well as assess the temporary differences between the accounting and tax treatment of assets and liabilities, including items such as accruals and allowances not currently deductible for tax purposes. we apply judgment in the recognition and measurement of current and deferred income taxes which includes the following critical accounting estimates.
we use a two-step process to recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions. the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. if we determine that the tax position will more likely than not be sustained on audit, the second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest
38
amount that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement. it is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts, as this requires us to determine the probability of various outcomes. we re-evaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. this evaluation is based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, effectively settled issues under audit, and new audit activity. such a change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision in the period.
as of march 30, 2018, we have not completed our accounting for the tax effects of enactment of the act; however, in certain cases, as described below, we have made a reasonable estimate of the effects on our existing deferred tax balances and the one-time transition tax. these amounts may require further adjustments as a result of additional future guidance from the u.s. department of the treasury, changes in our assumptions, and the availability of further information and interpretations. in other cases, we have not been able to make a reasonable estimate and we continue to account for those items based on our existing accounting policies and the provisions of the tax laws that were in effect immediately prior to enactment. for the items for which we were able to determine a reasonable estimate, we recognized a provisional tax benefit of $659 million, which is included as a component of income tax expense from continuing operations. this includes an income tax benefit of $1.6 billion resulting from the application of the act to existing deferred tax balances, including a reduction of the previously accrued deferred tax liability for foreign earnings by $1.4 billion. this was partially offset by $893 million of tax expense that was recorded for the one-time transition tax liability under the act.
stock-based compensation stock-based compensation expense is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award. we recognize stock-based compensation cost over the awards requisite service period on a straight-line basis except for performance-based restricted stock units (prus) with graded vesting which we recognize on a graded basis. for awards with performance conditions, the amount of compensation cost we recognize over the requisite service period is based on the actual achievement of the performance condition or managements best estimate of the achievement if not yet known. no compensation cost is ultimately recognized for forfeited awards in which employees do not render the requisite service. we estimate the number of stock-based awards that will be forfeited due to employee turnover. our forfeiture assumption is primarily based on historical experience.
the fair value of each restricted stock unit (rsu) and pru that does not contain a market condition is equal to the market value of our common stock on the date of grant. the fair value of each pru that contains a market condition is estimated using the monte carlo simulation option pricing model. the fair values of rsus and prus are not discounted by the dividend yield because our rsus and prus are entitled to dividend equivalents to be paid in the form of cash upon vesting for each share of the underlying unit.
we use the black-scholes model to determine the fair value of unvested stock options assumed in acquisitions and the fair value of rights to acquire shares of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan (espp). the determination of the fair value of awards using the black-scholes model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables. if the acquired companies lack sufficient historical exercise data to provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate expected term, we estimate the expected life of assumed options using the simplified method. for vested options, this represents the midpoint between the valuation date and the contractual term. for unvested options, this represents the midpoint between the average vesting time and full contractual term. expected volatility is based on the average of historical volatility over the most recent period commensurate with the expected life of the option and the implied volatility of traded options. the risk-free interest rate is equal to the u.s. treasury rates for the period equal to the expected life. the options assumed are without dividend equivalents and their fair values are discounted by our dividend yield.
39
we will continue to use judgment in evaluating the assumptions related to our stock-based compensation on a prospective basis. as we continue to accumulate additional data related to our common stock, we may have refinements to our estimates which could materially impact our future stock-based compensation expense.
loss contingencies we are subject to contingencies that expose us to losses, including various legal and regulatory proceedings, asserted and potential claims that arise in the ordinary course of business. an estimated loss from such contingencies is recognized as a charge to income if it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether a loss is reasonably estimable. we review the status of each significant matter quarterly and we may revise our estimates. until the final resolution of such matters, there may be an exposure to loss in excess of the amount recorded, and such amounts could be material. should any of our estimates and assumptions change or prove to have been incorrect, it could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements for that reporting period.

fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017
net revenues increased $815 million, attributable to increases of $616 million from our consumer digital safety segment and $199 million from our enterprise security segment, net of the impact of the divestiture of our wss and pki solutions. the increase in revenue from our consumer digital safety segment was primarily a result of the inclusion of revenue from our identity and information protection products acquired at the end of fiscal 2017 for a full year.
fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016
net revenues increased $419 million, primarily due to an increase of $425 million in revenue from our enterprise security segment as a result of the acquisition of blue coat during the second quarter of fiscal 2017.

fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017
our percentage of revenue from the americas increased, primarily as a result of the inclusion of revenue from our identity and information protection products acquired at the end of fiscal 2017 for a full year as sales of these products are generated entirely in the united states.
fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016
the geographical distribution of our revenue was relatively consistent in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016.

fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017
our cost of revenues increased $179 million primarily due to an increase related to our network and web security solutions and consumer identity and information protection products that were acquired in fiscal 2017, including $88 million of increased amortization of acquired intangible assets and $60 million of increased technical support costs primarily driven by the consumer identity and information protection products, and an increase of $30 million in royalty fees.
41
fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016
our cost of revenues increased $238 million primarily due to $122 million of increased amortization of acquired intangible assets and increased other costs related to sales of our network and web security solutions and consumer identity and information protection products that were acquired in fiscal 2017, including an acquired product inventory fair value write-up of $24 million. these increases in cost of revenues were partially offset by decreased costs related to veritas of $22 million.

fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017
sales and marketing expense increased $134 million primarily due to increases of $148 million in advertising and promotional expense, largely related to promotion of our identity and information protection products, and $58 million in stock-based compensation expense. these increases were partially offset by the decreased expenses from our divested wss and pki solutions.
research and development expense increased $133 million primarily due to increases of $90 million in stock-based compensation expense and $27 million in salary and benefits expense as a result of higher headcount.
general and administrative expense increased $10 million primarily due to a $35 million increase in salary and benefits expense as a result of higher headcount, a $15 million increase in stock-based compensation expense and increased cybersecurity and compliance costs, partially offset by a decrease of $41 million in acquisition-related and integration expenses due to a lower level of acquisition activities in fiscal 2018.
stock-based compensation expense reported in operating expenses increased $163 million to $582 million in fiscal 2018 from $419 million in fiscal 2017, primarily due to the equity awards granted in connection with our fiscal 2018 and 2017 acquisitions.
amortization of intangible assets increased $73 million primarily due to the intangible assets acquired in our fiscal 2017 acquisitions.
restructuring, transition and other costs increased $137 million, primarily due to an increase of $178 million in transition costs, including increases of $90 million in costs primarily related to our enterprise resource planning and supporting systems and other transformation initiatives and $88 million in separation costs related to the sale of our wss and pki solutions.
fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016
sales and marketing expense increased $167 million primarily as a result of our fiscal 2017 acquisitions and included increases of $54 million in stock-based compensation expense and
42
$24 million in integration expense. these increases were partially offset by a reduction of expenses from new and ongoing cost savings initiatives and decreased costs related to veritas of $88 million.
research and development expense increased $75 million primarily as a result of the acquisition of blue coat and included an increase of $54 million in stock-based compensation expense. this increase was partially offset by a reduction of expenses from new and ongoing cost savings initiatives and decreased costs related to veritas of $44 million.
general and administrative expense increased $269 million primarily as a result of the acquisition of blue coat and included an increase of $160 million in stock-based compensation expense. in addition, we incurred higher acquisition-related and integration expenses of $79 million. these increases were partly offset by a reduction of expenses from new and ongoing cost savings initiatives and decreased costs related to veritas of $32 million.
our stock-based compensation in operating expenses increased $268 million to $419 million in fiscal 2018 from $151 million in fiscal 2017, primarily due to the equity awards granted in connection with the blue coat and lifelock acquisitions, and the expected level of achievement for prus granted in fiscal 2017.
amortization of intangible assets increased $90 million primarily due to the $2.9 billion of intangible assets acquired in the blue coat and lifelock acquisitions.
restructuring, transition and other costs increased $137 million, primarily due to increases of $60 million in advisory fees incurred in connection with restructuring events and facilities exit costs and $52 million in severance costs as we initiated a restructuring plan during fiscal 2017.

non-operating income (expense), net, increased, primarily due to a $653 million gain as a result of the divestiture of our wss and pki solutions, partially offset by an increase of $48 million in interest expense primarily due to increased interest associated with the debt issued in fiscal 2017, an increase of $26 million in net foreign currency loss, and a $26 million loss from our equity method investment received in connection with the divestiture of our wss and pki solutions.
fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016
non-operating expense, net, increased, primarily due to an increase of $133 million in interest expense, mainly related to our increased borrowings in fiscal 2017. this increase was partially offset by an increase of $14 million in income, net of direct costs, from transition services provided to veritas.
provision for income taxes we are a u.s.-based multinational company subject to tax in multiple u.s. and international tax jurisdictions. a substantial portion of our international earnings were generated from subsidiaries
43
organized in ireland and singapore. our results of operations would be adversely affected to the extent that our geographical mix of income becomes more weighted toward jurisdictions with higher tax rates and would be favorably affected to the extent the relative geographic mix shifts to lower tax jurisdictions. any change in our mix of earnings is dependent upon many factors and is therefore difficult to predict.

fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017
the decrease in our effective tax rate in fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017 was primarily due to a provisional tax benefit of $659 million, which is included as a component of income tax expense from continuing operations. this includes an income tax benefit of $1,552 million resulting from the application of the act to existing deferred tax balances, including a reduction of the previously accrued deferred tax liability for foreign earnings by $1,420 million, partially offset by $893 million of tax expense that was recorded for the one-time transition tax liability under the act.
fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016
the decrease in our effective tax rate in fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016 was primarily driven by tax expense of $1.1 billion in fiscal 2016 for providing u.s. taxes on certain undistributed foreign earnings, primarily those attributable to the sale of veritas, partially offset by tax expense of $52 million in fiscal 2017 related to the loss of tax attributes as a result of restructuring activities.
see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for more information.
segment operating results we do not allocate to our operating segments certain operating expenses that we manage separately at the corporate level and are not used in evaluating the results of, or in allocating resources to, our segments. these unallocated expenses primarily consist of unallocated corporate charges related to veritas in fiscal 2016 and stock-based compensation expense, amortization of intangible assets, restructuring, transition and other costs, and acquisition-related costs in all periods presented. see note 14 for more information.

protection solutions, partially offset by a $184 million decrease in revenue as a result of the divestiture of our wss and pki solutions. revenue during fiscal 2018 was also unfavorably affected by a shift in the mix of sales towards subscription and cloud-delivered solutions subject to ratable revenue recognition, which resulted in less in-period recognized revenue and more revenue deferred to the balance sheet as compared to fiscal 2017. operating income increased $286 million, primarily due to higher revenue discussed above, a $51 million decrease in sales and marketing expenses and a $38 million decrease in cost of revenues.
fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016
revenue increased $425 million, primarily due to a $422 million increase from sales of our network and web security solutions, primarily as a result of our acquisition of blue coat. operating income increased $85 million, primarily due to higher revenue and a reduction of expenses from cost savings initiatives. these increases were partially offset by expenses associated with the blue coat acquisition in the post-acquisition period, and the cost of revenues from acquired inventory write-ups related to the blue coat acquisition of $24 million.

fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017
revenue increased $616 million due to a $639 million increase in revenue from sales of our identity and information protection products acquired at the end of fiscal 2017, offset by a $23 million decrease in revenue related to our consumer security products. our revenue growth reflects the benefit of the shift to subscription-based contracts and bundling of our consumer products, which is helping to mitigate the trend of declining revenues from sales of stand-alone security products. operating income increased $272 million, primarily due to sales of our identity and information protection products, partially offset by higher related cost of sales and operating expenses.
fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016
revenue decreased $6 million due to a decline in revenue from sales of consumer security products of $83 million as the revenue generated from customer additions was not sufficient to replace revenue lost through customer attrition. this decline was mostly offset by a $77 million increase in revenue due to sales of our identity and information protection products acquired in the acquisition of lifelock. operating income decreased $85 million, primarily due to the consumer security revenue decline coupled with increased operating expenses as a result of the lifelock acquisition.

liquidity, capital resources and cash requirements liquidity we have historically relied on cash generated from operations, borrowings under credit facilities, issuances of debt, and proceeds from divestitures for our liquidity needs.
as of march 30, 2018, we had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $2.2 billion, of which $1.3 billion was held by our foreign subsidiaries. our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments are managed with the objective to preserve principal, maintain liquidity, and generate investment returns. under the transition tax of the act, we have treated all previously untaxed foreign earnings as taxable in the u.s. and as a result we recorded a provisional liability for the one-time transition tax, payable over eight years, of $896 million in fiscal 2018. the move to a participation exemption system under the act allows us to make distributions of non-u.s. earnings to the u.s. without incurring additional u.s. federal tax, however these distributions may be subject to applicable state or non-u.s. taxes. we have not recognized deferred income taxes for local country income and withholding taxes that could be incurred on distributions of certain non-u.s. earnings or for outside basis differences in our subsidiaries, because we plan to indefinitely reinvest such earnings and basis differences.
we also have an undrawn credit facility of $1.0 billion which expires in may 2021.
our principal cash requirements are primarily to meet our working capital needs, support on-going business activities, including the payment of taxes, fund capital expenditures, service existing debt, and invest in business acquisitions. as a part of our plan to deleverage our balance sheet, we may from time to time make optional repayments of our debt obligations, which may include repurchases of our outstanding debt, depending on various factors such as market conditions.
our capital allocation strategy is to balance driving shareholder returns, managing financial risk, and preserving our flexibility to pursue strategic options, including acquisitions. historically this has included a quarterly cash dividend, the repayment of debt and the repurchase of our common stock.
cash flows the following table summarizes our cash flow activities:

cash from continuing operating activities our primary source of cash from operations has been from cash collections from our customers. due to seasonality, our billings are generally higher in our third and fourth fiscal quarters and lower in our first and second fiscal quarters. cash inflows are affected by fluctuations in our billings and timing of the related collections.
our primary uses of cash include payments for operating expenses and income taxes, payments to our resellers and distribution partners, and other on-going business activities.
46
our cash flows from operations in fiscal 2018 were $957 million, compared to cash used of $145 million in fiscal 2017. our cash flows for fiscal 2018 reflected net income of $1.1 billion adjusted by non-cash amortization and depreciation of $640 million, stock-based compensation of $610 million, offset by a deferred tax benefit of $1.8 billion, primarily as a result of the enactment of the act in december 2017, and a gain on divestiture of $653 million. our cash flows for fiscal 2017 reflected a net loss of $106 million, adjusted by non-cash amortization and depreciation of $492 million, stock-based compensation of $440 million, offset by a deferred tax provision of $168 million.
changes in operating assets and liabilities consisted primarily of:
accounts receivable increased $170 million in fiscal 2018, compared to a decrease of $45 million in fiscal 2017, reflecting higher billings in the last month of fiscal 2018 and our shift in sales to solutions with ratable revenue recognition in our enterprise security segment.
deferred revenue increased $541 million in fiscal 2018, compared to an increase of $125 million in fiscal 2017, reflecting the factors discussed in the overview.
income taxes payable increased $880 million in fiscal 2018, compared to a decrease of $871 million in fiscal 2017. the increase in fiscal 2018 reflected the one-time transition tax of $896 million discussed above, while the decrease in fiscal 2017 was primarily the result of a one-time tax payment of $887 million related to the gain on sale from the divestiture of veritas.
the decrease in cash flow from continuing operating activities in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 was primarily due to net loss from continuing operation of $106 million in fiscal 2017, compared to net income of $2.5 billion in fiscal 2016, as well as a higher adjustment to net income for deferred taxes in fiscal 2016. in addition, income taxes payable decreased $871 million in fiscal 2017, reflecting the cash payment for taxes as a result of the gain on sale from the divestiture of veritas, compared to an increase in tax payable of $742 million in fiscal 2016.
cash from continuing investing activities our cash flows from continuing investing activities consisted primarily of proceeds from divestitures, payments for acquisitions, and net purchases of short-term investments. our investing activities in fiscal 2018 included $933 million in net cash proceeds from the divestiture of our wss and pki solutions, partially offset by $401 million paid for acquisitions and net purchases of $387 million of short-term investments, while our investing activities in fiscal 2017 primarily included $6.7 billion paid for the blue coat and lifelock acquisitions.
our investing activities in fiscal 2016 primarily included proceeds from the divestiture of veritas of $6.5 billion and net proceeds from short-term investments of $1.0 billion.
cash from continuing financing activities our financing cash flows consist primarily of issuances and repayments of debt, payment of dividends and dividend equivalents to stockholders, stock repurchases, and tax payments related to shares withheld in the settlement of rsus. our financing activities in fiscal 2018 primarily consisted of debt repayments of $3.2 billion, while our financing activities in fiscal 2017 primarily consisted of net proceeds from borrowings of $6.1 billion.
our financing activities in fiscal 2016 primarily consisted of payments of dividends and dividend equivalents of $3.0 billion and repurchases of common stock of $1.9 billion.

dividends - on may 10, 2018, we announced a cash dividend of $0.075 per share of common stock to be paid in june 2018. on august 2, 2018, we announced a cash dividend of $0.075 per share of common stock to be paid in september 2018. any future dividends will be subject to the approval of our board of directors. see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for more information on our dividends and dividend equivalents.
share repurchases - under our stock repurchase programs, we may purchase shares of our outstanding common stock through open market and through accelerated stock repurchase transactions. as of march 30, 2018, the remaining balance of our share repurchase authorization is $800 million and does not have an expiration date. see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for more information on our share repurchases.

(1)   see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on our debt.

(2)                                                               interest payments were calculated based on the contractual terms of the related senior notes, convertible senior notes and senior term facilities. interest on variable rate debt was calculated using the interest rate in effect as of march 30, 2018. see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on the senior notes, convertible senior notes and senior term facilities.

(3)                                                                    these amounts are associated with agreements for purchases of goods or services generally including agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum, or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. the table above also includes agreements to purchase goods or services that have cancellation provisions requiring little or no payment. the amounts under such contracts are included in the table above because management believes that cancellation of these contracts is unlikely, and we expect to make future cash payments according to the contract terms or in similar amounts for similar materials.

48
(4)   purchase obligations do not include future minimum contractual obligations related to a five-year purchase agreement with a service provider for a total contract value of $500 million that we entered into in september 2018.

(5)                                                 these amounts represent the transition tax on previously untaxed foreign earnings of foreign subsidiaries under the act which may be paid in installments over an eight-year period. see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on our income taxes and the impact from the recently enacted legislation.

(6)             we have entered into various non-cancelable operating lease agreements that expire on various dates through fiscal 2029. the amounts in the table above exclude expected sublease income.

due to the uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash flows associated with our unrecognized tax benefits and other long-term taxes as of march 30, 2018 we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities. therefore, $302 million in long-term income taxes payable has been excluded from the contractual obligations table. see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for further information.
fiscal 2019 restructuring plan on august 2, 2018, we announced a restructuring plan under which we will initiate targeted reductions of our global workforce of up to approximately 8%. we estimate that we will incur total costs in connection with the restructuring plan of approximately $50 million, primarily for severance and termination benefits. these actions are expected to be completed in fiscal 2019.
indemnifications in the ordinary course of business, we may provide indemnifications of varying scope and terms to customers, vendors, lessors, business partners, subsidiaries and other parties with respect to certain matters, including, but not limited to, losses arising out of our breach of agreements or representations and warranties made by us. refer to note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on our indemnifications.
item 7a. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to various market risks related to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. we may use derivative financial instruments to mitigate certain risks in accordance with our investment and foreign exchange policies. we do not use derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.
interest rate risk our short-term investments primarily consist of corporate bonds. an increase in interest could have an adverse impact on its market value. as of march 30, 2018, the fair value of our short-term investments was $388 million. a hypothetical increase in the corporate bonds yield curve of 50 basis points would not result in a significant reduction in fair value.
as of march 30, 2018, we had $4.0 billion in aggregate principal amount of fixed-rate senior notes and convertible senior notes outstanding, with a carrying amount and a fair value of $3.9 billion, based on level 2 inputs. since these notes bear interest at fixed rates, they do not result in any financial statement risk associated with changes in interest rates. however, the fair value of these notes fluctuates when interest rates change.
as of march 30, 2018, we also had $1.1 billion outstanding debt with variable interest rates based on the london interbank offered rate (libor). a reasonably possible hypothetical adverse change of 50 basis points in libor would not result in a significant increase in interest expense on an annualized basis.
49
in addition, we have a $1.0 billion revolving credit facility that if drawn bears interest at a variable rate based on libor and would be subject to the same risks associated with adverse changes in libor.
foreign currency exchange rate risk we conduct business in numerous currencies through our worldwide operations and, as such, we are exposed to foreign currency risk. our entities conduct their businesses in the primary local currency in which they operate; however, they may also conduct business in other currencies. to the extent our entities hold monetary assets or liabilities, earn revenues or incur costs in currencies other than the entitys functional currency, they are exposed to foreign exchange gains or losses and impacts to operating results as a result. as part of our foreign currency risk mitigation strategy, we have entered into foreign exchange forward contracts with up to six months in duration to help mitigate foreign exchange risk; however, we are not able to hedge our foreign currency exposure in a manner that entirely offsets the effects of the changes in foreign exchange rates. we have considered historical trends in exchange rates and determined that it is possible that adverse changes in exchange rates for any currency could occur. as of march 30, 2018 and march 31, 2017, we had open foreign currency forward contracts with notional amounts of $848 million and $696 million, respectively. a hypothetical ten percent depreciation of foreign currency would result in a reduction in fair value of $55 million and $29 million for fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017, respectively. this analysis disregards the possibilities that the rates can move in opposite directions and that losses from one geographic area may be offset by gains from another geographic area.

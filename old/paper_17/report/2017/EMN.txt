and other forward-looking statements and related disclosures made by the company in this annual report and elsewhere from time to time, represents management's best judgment as of the date the information is given. the company does not undertake responsibility for updating any of such information, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise, except as required by law. investors are advised, however, to consult any further public company disclosures (such as in filings with the securities and exchange commission or in company press releases) on related subjects.

item 7a.  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk eastman has exposure to various market risks principally due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, the pricing of various commodities, and interest rates. in an effort to manage these risks, the company employs various strategies, including pricing, inventory management, and hedging. the company enters into derivative contracts which are governed by policies, procedures, and internal processes set forth by its board of directors.
the company determines its exposures to market risk by utilizing sensitivity analyses, which measure the potential losses in fair value resulting from one or more selected hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices, or interest rates.
foreign currency risk due to a portion of the company's operating cash flows and borrowings being denominated in foreign currencies, the company is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. the company continually evaluates its foreign currency exposure based on current market conditions and the locations in which the company conducts business. the company manages most foreign currency exposures on a consolidated basis, which allows the company to net certain exposures and take advantage of natural offsets. to mitigate foreign currency risk, from time to time, the company enters into derivative instruments to hedge the cash flows related to certain sales and purchase transactions expected within a rolling three year period and denominated in foreign currencies, and enters into forward exchange contracts to hedge certain firm commitments denominated in foreign currencies. the gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in the value of related exposures. additionally, the company, from time to time, enters into non-derivative instruments to hedge the foreign currency exposure of the net investment in certain foreign operations. the foreign currency change in the designated investment values of the foreign subsidiaries will generally be offset by a foreign currency change in the carrying value of the euro-denominated borrowings. it is the company's policy to enter into foreign currency derivative and non-derivative instruments only to the extent considered necessary to meet its objectives as stated above. the company does not enter into foreign currency derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
at december 31, 2017 , the market risk associated with certain cash flows under these derivative transactions assuming a 10 percent adverse move in the u.s. dollar relative to these foreign currencies was $45 million, with an additional $5 million exposure for each additional one percentage point adverse change in those foreign currency rates. at december 31, 2016 , the market risk associated with cash flows under these derivative transactions assuming a 10 percent adverse move in the u.s. dollar relative to those currencies was $39 million, with an additional $4 million exposure for each additional one percentage point adverse change in those exchange rates.
since the company utilizes currency-sensitive derivative instruments for hedging anticipated foreign currency transactions, a loss in fair value from those instruments is generally offset by an increase in the value of the underlying anticipated transactions.
at december 31, 2017 , a 10 percent fluctuation in the euro currency rate would have had a $149 million impact on the designated net investment values in the foreign subsidiaries. at december 31, 2016 , a 10 percent fluctuation in the euro currency rate would have had a $131 million impact on the designated net investment values in the foreign subsidiaries. though, a foreign currency change in the designated investment values of the foreign subsidiaries will generally be offset by a foreign currency change in the carrying value of the euro-denominated borrowings. as a result of the designation of the euro-denominated borrowings as hedges of the net investments, foreign currency translation gains and losses on the borrowings are recorded as a component of the "change in cumulative translation adjustment" within "other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax" in the consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income and retained earnings in part ii, item 8 of this annual report.
commodity risk the company is exposed to fluctuations in market prices for certain of its raw materials and energy, as well as contract sales of certain commodity products. to mitigate short-term fluctuations in market prices for certain commodities, principally propane, ethane, natural gas, paraxylene, ethylene, and benzene, as well as selling prices for ethylene, the company enters into derivative transactions to hedge the cash flows related to certain sales and purchase transactions expected within a rolling three year period. at december 31, 2017 and december 31, 2016 , the market risk associated with these derivative contracts, assuming an instantaneous parallel shift in the underlying commodity price of 10 percent and no corresponding change in the selling price of finished goods, was $30 million and $37 million, respectively, with an additional $3 million and $4 million, respectively, of exposure at each date for each one percentage point move in closing price thereafter.
67
interest rate risk eastman is exposed to interest rate risk primarily as a result of its borrowing and investing activities, which include long-term borrowings used to maintain liquidity and to fund its business operations and capital requirements. the nature and amount of the company's long-term and short-term debt may vary from time to time as a result of business requirements, market conditions, and other factors. the company manages global interest rate exposure as part of regular operational and financing strategies. the company had variable interest rate borrowings
(including credit facility borrowings and commercial paper borrowings) of $589 million and $829 million at december
31, 2017 and 2016 , respectively. these borrowings represented approximately 10 percent and 15 percent of total outstanding debt and bore weighted average interest rates of 1.89 percent and 1.69 percent at december 31, 2017 and
2016 , respectively. a hypothetical 10 percent increase in the average interest rate applicable to these borrowings would change annualized interest expense by approximately $1 million as of both december 31, 2017 and 2016 .
eastman may enter into interest rate swaps, collars, or similar instruments with the objective of reducing interest rate volatility relating to the company's borrowing costs. as of both december 31, 2017 and 2016 , the company had an interest rate swap outstanding with a notional value of $75 million. for purposes of calculating the market risks associated with the fair value of interest-rate-sensitive instruments, the company uses a hypothetical 10
percent increase in interest rates. the corresponding market risk of the interest rate swap hedging the interest rate risk on the 3.8% bonds maturing march 2025 was $1 million as of both december 31, 2017 and december 31, 2016 .

"company") and its subsidiaries as of december 31, 2017 and december 31, 2016, and the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income and retained earnings and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended december 31, 2017, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the "consolidated financial statements"). we also have audited the company's internal control over financial reporting as of december
31, 2017, based on criteria established in internal control - integrated framework (2013) issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission (coso).
in our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the company as of december 31, 2017 and december 31, 2016
, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended december
31, 2017 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america. also in our opinion, the company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31, 2017, based on criteria established in internal control - integrated framework (2013) issued by the coso.
basis for opinions the company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in management's report on internal control over financial reporting appearing under item 9a. our responsibility is to express opinions on the company's consolidated financial statements and on the company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. we are a public accounting firm registered with the public company accounting oversight board (united states) ("pcaob") and are required to be independent with respect to the company in accordance with the u.s. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the securities and exchange commission and the pcaob.
we conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the pcaob. those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. we believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
definition and limitations of internal control over financial reporting a company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. a company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
71
because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

notes to the audited consolidated financial statements
1.  significant accounting policies financial statement presentation the consolidated financial statements of eastman chemical company ("eastman" or the "company") and subsidiaries are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted ("gaap") in the united states and of necessity include some amounts that are based upon management estimates and judgments. future actual results could differ from such current estimates. the consolidated financial statements include assets, liabilities, sales revenue, and expenses of all majority-owned subsidiaries and joint ventures in which a controlling interest is maintained.
eastman accounts for other joint ventures and investments in minority-owned companies where it exercises significant influence on the equity basis. intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated in consolidation.
certain prior period data has been reclassified in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying footnotes to conform to current period presentation.
cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents include cash, time deposits, and readily marketable securities with original maturities of three months or less.
fair value measurements eastman records recurring and non-recurring financial assets and liabilities as well as all non-financial assets and liabilities subject to fair value measurement at the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. these fair value principles prioritize valuation inputs across three broad levels. level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. level 2 inputs are quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly through market corroboration, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument. level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs based on the company's assumptions used to measure assets and liabilities at fair value. an asset or liability's classification within the various levels is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest. eastman maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments. the allowances are based on the number of days an individual receivable is delinquent and management's regular assessment of the financial condition of the company's customers. the company considers a receivable delinquent if it is unpaid after the terms of the related invoice have expired. the company evaluates the allowance based on a monthly assessment of the aged receivables. write-offs are recorded at the time a customer receivable is deemed uncollectible. allowance for doubtful accounts was $12 million and $10 million at december 31,
2017 and 2016 , respectively. the company does not enter into receivables of a long-term nature, also known as financing receivables, in the normal course of business.
inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market. eastman determines the cost of most raw materials, work in process, and finished goods inventories in the united states and switzerland by the last-in, first-out ("lifo")
method. the cost of all other inventories is determined by the average cost method, which approximates the first-
in, first-out ("fifo") method. the company writes-down its inventories for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the carrying value of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions.
properties eastman records properties at cost. maintenance and repairs are charged to earnings; replacements and betterments are capitalized. when eastman retires or otherwise disposes of assets, it removes the cost of such assets and related accumulated depreciation from the accounts. the company records any profit or loss on retirement or other disposition into earnings. asset impairments are reflected as increases in accumulated depreciation for properties that have been placed in service. in instances when an asset has not been placed in service and is impaired, the associated costs are removed from the appropriate property accounts.
76
notes to the audited consolidated financial statements depreciation and amortization depreciation expense is calculated based on historical cost and the estimated useful lives of the assets, generally using the straight-line method. estimated useful lives for buildings and building equipment generally range from 20
to 50 years. estimated useful lives generally ranging from 3 to 33 years are applied to machinery and equipment in the following categories: computer software (3 to 5 years); office furniture and fixtures and computer equipment (5
to 10 years); vehicles, railcars, and general machinery and equipment (5 to 20 years); and manufacturing-related improvements (20 to 33 years). accelerated depreciation is reported when the estimated useful life is shortened and continues to be reported in cost of sales.
amortization expense for definite-lived intangible assets is generally determined using a straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the asset.
for additional information, see note 4, "goodwill and other intangible assets" .
impairment of long-lived assets definite-lived assets properties and equipment and definite-lived intangible assets to be held and used by eastman are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. the review of these long-lived assets is performed at the asset group level, which is the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. if the carrying amount is not considered to be recoverable, an analysis of fair value is triggered. an impairment is recognized for the excess of the carrying amount of the asset over the fair value. fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset in an orderly transaction between market participants .
goodwill eastman conducts testing of goodwill annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently when events and circumstances indicate an impairment may have occurred. the testing of goodwill is performed at the "reporting unit" level which the company has determined to be its "components". components are defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment, and in order to be a reporting unit, the component must 1) be a "business"
as defined by applicable accounting standards (an integrated set of activities and assets that is capable of being conducted and managed for the purpose of providing a return in the form of dividends, lower costs, or other economic benefits directly to the investors or other owners, members, or participants); 2) have discrete financial information available; and 3) be reviewed regularly by company operating segment management. the company aggregates certain components into reporting units based on economic similarities.
the company uses an income approach and applies a fair value methodology based on discounted cash flows in testing the carrying value of goodwill for each reporting unit. key assumptions and estimates used in the company's 2017
goodwill impairment testing included projections of revenues, expenses, and cash flows determined using the company's annual multi-year strategic plan and a market participant tax rate. the most critical assumptions are the estimated discount rate and a projected long-term growth rate. the company believes these assumptions are consistent with those a hypothetical market participant would use given circumstances that were present at the time the estimates were made. however, actual results and amounts may be significantly different from the company's estimates. in addition, the use of different estimates or assumptions could result in materially different determinations. in order to determine the discount rate, the company uses a market perspective weighted average cost of capital ("wacc") approach. the wacc is calculated incorporating weighted average returns on debt and equity from market participants. therefore, changes in the market, which are beyond the control of the company, may have an impact on future calculations of estimated fair value.
if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is determined to be less than the carrying value of the net assets of the reporting unit including goodwill, additional steps, including a valuation of the estimated fair value of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit, would be necessary to determine the amount, if any, of goodwill impairment.
77
notes to the audited consolidated financial statements indefinite-lived intangible assets eastman conducts testing of indefinite-lived intangible assets annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently when events and circumstances indicate an impairment may have occurred. the carrying value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset is considered to be impaired when the fair value, as established by appraisal or based on discounted future cash flows of certain related products, is less than the respective carrying value.
indefinite-lived intangible assets, primarily consisting of various tradenames, are tested for potential impairment by comparing the estimated fair value to the carrying amount. the company uses an income approach, specifically the relief from royalty method, to test indefinite-lived intangible assets. the estimated fair value of the tradenames is determined based on an assumed royalty rate savings, discounted by the calculated market participant wacc plus a risk premium.
investments the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of eastman and all its subsidiaries and entities or joint ventures in which a controlling interest is maintained.
investments in affiliates over which the company has significant influence but not a controlling interest are carried on the equity basis. under the equity method of accounting, these investments are included in other noncurrent assets. the company includes its share of earnings and losses of such investments in "other (income)
charges, net", and its share of "other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax" ("oci") located in the consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income and retained earnings and in the appropriate component of "accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)" ("aoci") located in the consolidated statements of financial position.
pension and other postretirement benefits eastman maintains defined benefit pension plans that provide eligible employees with retirement benefits. under its other postretirement benefit plans in the u.s., eastman provides life insurance for eligible retirees hired prior to january 1, 2007. eastman provides a subsidy for pre-medicare health care and dental benefits to eligible retirees hired prior to january 1, 2007 that will end on december 31, 2021. company funding is also provided for eligible medicare retirees hired prior to january 1, 2007 with a health reimbursement arrangement. the estimated amounts of the costs and obligations related to these benefits reflect the company's assumptions related to discount rates, expected return on plan assets, rate of compensation increase or decrease for employees, and health care cost trends. the estimated cost of providing plan benefits also depends on demographic assumptions including retirements, mortality, turnover, and plan participation.
eastman's pension and other postretirement benefit plans costs consist of two elements: 1) ongoing costs recognized quarterly, which are comprised of service and interest costs, expected returns on plan assets, and amortization of prior service credits; and 2) mark-to-market ("mtm") gains and losses recognized annually, in the fourth quarter of each year, primarily resulting from changes in actuarial assumptions for discount rates and the differences between actual and expected returns on plan assets. any interim remeasurements triggered by a curtailment, settlement, or significant plan changes are recognized in the quarter in which such remeasurement event occurs.
for additional information, see note 10, "retirement plans" .
environmental costs eastman accrues environmental remediation costs when it is probable that the company has incurred a liability at a contaminated site and the amount can be reasonably estimated. when a single amount cannot be reasonably estimated but the cost can be estimated within a range, the company accrues the minimum undiscounted amount. this undiscounted accrued amount reflects liabilities expected to be paid within approximately 30 years and the company's assumptions about remediation requirements at the contaminated site, the nature of the remedy, the outcome of discussions with regulatory agencies and other potentially responsible parties at multi-party sites, and the number and financial viability of other potentially responsible parties. changes in the estimates on which the accruals are based, unanticipated government enforcement action, or changes in health, safety, environmental, and chemical control regulations and testing requirements could result in higher or lower costs.
78
notes to the audited consolidated financial statements the company also establishes reserves for closure and post-closure costs associated with the environmental and other assets it maintains. environmental assets include but are not limited to waste management units, such as landfills, water treatment facilities, and surface impoundments. when these types of assets are constructed or installed, a loss contingency reserve is established for the anticipated future costs associated with the retirement or closure of the asset based on its expected life and the applicable regulatory closure requirements.
the company recognizes the asset retirement obligations in the period in which they are incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. the asset retirement obligations are discounted to expected present value and subsequently adjusted for changes in fair value. these future estimated costs are charged into earnings over the estimated useful life of the assets. currently, the company's environmental assets are expected to reach the end of their useful lives at different times over the next 50 years . if the company changes its estimate of the environmental asset retirement obligation costs or its estimate of the useful lives of these assets, the expenses charged to earnings will be impacted.
the current portion of accruals for environmental liabilities is included in payables and other current liabilities and the long-term portion is included in other long-term liabilities. these accruals exclude claims for recoveries from insurance companies or other third parties. environmental costs are capitalized if they extend the life of the related property, increase its capacity, or mitigate or prevent future contamination. the cost of operating and maintaining environmental control facilities is charged to expense as incurred.
for additional information see note 12, "environmental matters and asset retirement obligations" .
derivative and non-derivative financial instruments eastman uses derivative and non-derivative instruments to manage its exposure to market risks, such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices, and interest rates. the company does not enter into derivative transactions for speculative purposes.
counterparties to the derivative contracts are highly rated financial institutions which the company believes carry minimal risk of nonperformance, and the company diversifies its positions among such counterparties to reduce its exposure to counterparty risk and credit losses. the company monitors the creditworthiness of its counterparties on an on-going basis.
the company's derivative instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial position and measured at fair value. for qualifying derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the changes in the fair value are reported as a component of aoci in the consolidated statements of financial position and recognized in earnings when the hedged items affect earnings. for qualifying derivatives designated as fair value hedges, the effective portion of the changes in the fair value are reported as
"long-term borrowings" on the consolidated statements of financial position and recognized in earnings when the hedged items affect earnings. for qualifying non-derivatives designated as net investment hedges, the effective portion of the changes in fair value are reported as a translation adjustment in the "change in cumulative translation adjustment" ("cta") within oci located in the consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income and retained earnings. the ineffective portion of hedges, hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness, and changes in the fair value of nonqualifying derivatives or derivatives that are not designated as hedges, are recognized in current earnings. hedge accounting will be discontinued prospectively for all hedges that no longer qualify for hedge accounting treatment. cash flows from derivative instruments designated as hedges are reported in the same category as the cash flows from the items being hedged.
for additional information, see note 9, "derivative and non-derivative financial instruments" .
litigation and contingent liabilities eastman and its operations from time to time are, and in the future, may be, parties to or targets of lawsuits, claims, investigations, and proceedings, including product liability, personal injury, asbestos, patent and intellectual property, commercial, contract, environmental, antitrust, health and safety, and employment matters, which are handled and defended in the ordinary course of business. the company accrues a contingent loss liability for such matters when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated.
when a single amount cannot be reasonably estimated but the cost can be estimated within a range, the company accrues the minimum amount. the company expenses legal costs, including those expected to be incurred in connection with a loss contingency, as incurred.
79
notes to the audited consolidated financial statements revenue recognition and customer incentives eastman recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, the price to the customer is fixed or determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured.
revenue for products is recognized when title and risk of loss transfer to the customer.
the company records estimated obligations for customer programs and incentive offerings, which consist primarily of revenue or volume-based amounts that a customer must achieve over a specified period of time, as a reduction of revenue from each underlying revenue transaction as the customer progresses toward goals specified in incentive agreements. these estimates are based on a combination of forecasts of customer sales and actual sales volume and revenues against established goals, the customer's current level of purchases, eastman's knowledge of customer purchasing habits, and industry pricing practice. the incentive payment rate may be variable, based upon the customer reaching higher purchasing levels over a specified period of time in order to receive an agreed upon incentive payment.
shipping and handling fees and costs shipping and handling fees related to sales transactions are billed to customers and are recorded as sales revenue.
shipping and handling costs incurred are recorded in cost of sales.
restructuring of operations eastman records restructuring charges for costs incurred in connection with consolidation of operations, exited business or product lines, or shutdowns of specific sites that are expected to be substantially completed within twelve months. these restructuring charges are recorded as incurred, and are associated with site closures, legal and environmental matters, demolition, contract terminations, obsolete inventory, or other costs and charges directly related to the restructuring. the company records severance charges for employee separations when the separation is probable and reasonably estimable. in the event employees are required to perform future service, the company records severance charges ratably over the remaining service period of those employees. for additional information, see note 15, "asset impairments and restructuring charges, net" .
share-based compensation eastman recognizes compensation expense in the financial statements for stock options and other share-based compensation awards based upon the grant-date fair value over the substantive vesting period. for additional information, see note 17, "share-based compensation plans and awards" .
income taxes the (benefit from) provision for income taxes has been determined using the asset and liability approach of accounting for income taxes. under this approach, deferred taxes represent the future tax consequences expected to occur when the reported amounts of assets and liabilities are recovered or paid. the (benefit from) provision for income taxes represents income taxes paid or payable for the current year plus the change in deferred taxes during the year. deferred taxes result from differences between the financial and tax bases of eastman's assets and liabilities and are adjusted for changes in tax rates and tax laws when changes are enacted. valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized.
provision has been made for income taxes on unremitted earnings of subsidiaries and affiliates, except for subsidiaries in which earnings are deemed to be indefinitely reinvested.
the company recognizes income tax positions that meet the more likely than not threshold and accrues interest related to unrecognized income tax positions which is recorded as a component of the income tax provision.

7.  income taxes on december 22, 2017, the 2017 "tax cuts and jobs act" ("tax reform act") was enacted. accounting for the impacts of newly enacted tax legislation are generally required to be completed in the period of enactment. following enactment of the tax reform act, the sec provided guidance for initial accounting for the tax reform act in staff accounting bulletin no. 118, "income tax accounting implications of the tax cuts and jobs act" ("sab 118"). the period to finalize accounting for the tax reform act is up to one year following the enactment date and sab 118
allows companies to provide for the impact of the tax reform act under three scenarios: (1) a company is complete with its accounting for certain effects of tax reform, (2) a company is able to determine a reasonable estimate for certain effects of the tax reform act and records that estimate as a provisional amount, or (3) a company is not able to determine a reasonable estimate and therefore continues to apply accounting based on the provisions of the tax laws that were in effect immediately prior to tax reform being enacted. because the enactment of the tax reform act was close to eastman's year end, the company was not able to complete the accounting for certain effects of the changes in tax law but has been able to reasonably estimate the effects and has recognized those estimates as provisional amounts as of december 31, 2017.
the company recognized a $339 million estimated net tax benefit in 2017, primarily resulting from the tax reform act and a tax loss from outside-u.s. entity reorganizations as part of the formation of an international treasury services center. the net tax benefit included a $533 million benefit from the one-time revaluation of deferred tax liabilities, partially offset by a one-time transition tax on deferred foreign income of $71 million and $123
million in changes in valuation of deferred tax assets associated with tax law changes and outside-u.s. entity reorganizations as part of the formation of an international treasury services center.
the income tax payable for the transition tax will be paid over eight years. as of december 31, 2017, a non-current income tax payable of approximately $60 million attributable to the transition tax is reflected in "other long term liabilities" of the consolidated statement of financial position.
as of december 31, 2017, the company considers the accounting for the following impacts of the tax reform act to be provisional and, accordingly, subject to adjustment in future periods: the transition tax on deferred foreign income (which consists of post-1986 accumulated earnings and profits of controlled foreign corporations and the determination of cash versus non-cash balances), the impact of the change in income tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities, and the evaluation of gross foreign tax credit carryforwards and related valuation allowances. in preparing the provisional estimates for the year ended december 31, 2017, the company has considered notices and revenue procedures issued by the internal revenue service and authoritative accounting guidance issued through february 12, 2018.
certain of the provisional amounts will be finalized in conjunction with the filing of the company's u.s. federal income tax return for the year ended december 31, 2017 that will not be finalized until later in 2018. while historically differences between amounts reported in the company's consolidated financial statements and the company's u.s. federal income tax return have resulted in offsetting changes in estimates in current and deferred taxes for items which are timing related, the reduction of the u.s. tax rate will result in adjustments to the company's income tax (benefit) provision when recognized. the company also considers it likely that further technical guidance regarding certain aspects of the new provisions included in the tax reform act, as well as clarity regarding state income tax conformity to current federal tax code, may be issued which could result in changes to the provisional amounts reported as of december 31, 2017 and related state income tax effects.
the company is analyzing the future impact of the tax reform act for the fiscal year beginning january 1, 2018, including the new provisions known as the base erosion anti-abuse tax ("beat") and global intangible low-tax income
("gilti") tax, as well as other provisions. under u.s. gaap, companies can make an accounting policy election to either treat taxes resulting from gilti as a current-period expense when incurred or factor such amounts into the measurement of deferred taxes. the company has not completed its analysis of the effects of the gilti provisions and will further consider the accounting policy election within the measurement period as provided under sab 118.

the 2017 effective tax rate was lower than the 2016 effective tax rate due to a $339 million net tax benefit, primarily resulting from the tax reform act and a tax loss from outside-u.s. entity reorganizations as part of the formation of an international treasury services center, a $20 million benefit due to amendments to prior years'
domestic income tax returns, and a $30 million benefit reflecting the finalization of prior years' foreign income tax returns. the 2016 effective tax rate included one-time tax benefits discussed immediately below.
the 2016 effective tax rate was lower than 2015 due to a benefit in the foreign rate variance as a result of higher earnings in foreign jurisdictions partially offset by a reduction in the u.s. federal tax manufacturing deduction due to a decrease in domestic taxable income. the 2016 effective tax rate included a tax benefit of $16 million related to foreign tax credits as a result of the amendment of prior year income tax returns, a $16 million one-
time benefit for the restoration of tax basis for which depreciation deductions were previously limited, and a $9
million tax benefit primarily due to adjustments to the tax provision to reflect the finalization of 2014 foreign income tax returns.

as of december 31, 2017 , the company has accumulated undistributed earnings generated by our foreign subsidiaries of approximately $1.2 billion which was subject to the one-time transition tax of approximately $71 million on deferred foreign income as required by the tax reform act. we continue to consider these earnings as reinvested indefinitely.
for certain consolidated foreign subsidiaries, income and losses directly flow through to taxable income in the united states. these entities are also subject to taxation in the foreign tax jurisdictions. net operating loss carryforwards exist to offset future taxable income in foreign tax jurisdictions and valuation allowances are provided to reduce deferred related tax assets if it is more likely than not that this benefit will not be realized. changes in the estimated realizable amount of deferred tax assets associated with net operating losses for these entities could result in changes in the deferred tax asset valuation allowance in the foreign tax jurisdiction. at the same time, because these entities are also subject to tax in the united states, a deferred tax liability for the expected future taxable income will be established concurrently. therefore, the impact of any reversal of valuation allowances on consolidated income tax expense will be only to the extent that there are differences between the united states statutory tax rate and the tax rate in the foreign jurisdiction. a valuation allowance of $17 million at december 31, 2017 has been provided against the deferred tax asset resulting from these operating loss carryforwards.
at december 31, 2017 , foreign net operating loss carryforwards totaled $2.5 billion . of this total, $285 million will expire in 1 to 20 years and $2.2 billion have no expiration date. a valuation allowance of approximately $260
million has been provided against such net operating loss carryforwards.
at december 31, 2017 , federal net operating loss carryforwards of $16 million were available to offset future taxable income, which expire from 2027 to 2030. at december 31, 2017 , foreign tax credit carryforwards of approximately $72 million were available to reduce possible future u.s. income taxes and which expire from 2018 to
2021. as a result of the tax reform act, the company may no longer be able to utilize the solutia, inc. ("solutia")
u.s. foreign tax credit carryforwards; therefore, management established a full valuation allowance of $72 million on the remaining deferred tax asset as of december 31, 2017 .
87
notes to the audited consolidated financial statements a partial valuation allowance of $54 million has been established for the solutia state net operating loss carryforwards. the valuation allowance will be retained until there is sufficient positive evidence to conclude that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized or the related statute expires.

all of the unrecognized tax benefits would, if recognized, impact the company's effective tax rate.
interest, net of tax, related to unrecognized tax benefits is recorded as a component of income tax expense. as of january 1, 2017 , the company had accrued a liability of $4 million for interest, net of tax, and $1 million for estimated tax penalties. during 2017 , the company recognized $3 million of expense for interest, net of tax, and no penalties associated with unrecognized tax benefits, offset by $1 million of income for interest, net of tax, and no penalties, associated with the expiration of the statute of limitations. at december 31, 2017 , the company had accrued balances of $6 million for interest, net of tax benefit, and $1 million for penalties.
as of january 1, 2016 , the company had accrued a liability of $4 million for interest, net of tax, and $1 million for tax penalties. during 2016 , the company recognized $1 million of expense for interest, net of tax, and no penalties associated with unrecognized tax benefits, offset by $1 million of income for interest, net of tax, and no penalties, associated with the expiration of the statute of limitations. at december 31, 2016, the company had accrued balances of $4 million for interest, net of tax benefit, and $1 million for penalties.
as of january 1, 2015 , the company had accrued a liability of $4 million for interest, net of tax, and $3 million for tax penalties. during 2015, the company recognized $2 million of expense for interest, net of tax, and no penalties associated with unrecognized tax benefits, offset by $2 million of income for interest, net of tax, and
$2 million of penalties, associated with the expiration of the statute of limitations. at december 31, 2015 , the company had accrued balances of $4 million for interest, net of tax benefit, and $1 million for penalties.
the company files income tax returns in the united states and various state and foreign jurisdictions. the company is no longer subject to u.s. federal income tax examinations by tax authorities for years before 2011 for eastman legal entities and years before 2002 for solutia legal entities. with few exceptions, eastman is no longer subject to state and local income tax examinations by tax authorities for years before 2010. solutia and related subsidiaries are no longer subject to state and local income tax examinations for years before 2000. with few exceptions, the company is no longer subject to foreign income tax examinations by tax authorities for tax years before 2007.
it is reasonably possible that, as a result of the resolution of federal, state, and foreign examinations and appeals, and the expiration of various statutes of limitation, unrecognized tax benefits could decrease within the next twelve months by up to $20 million .

9.  derivative and non-derivative financial instruments overview of hedging programs eastman is exposed to market risks, such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices, and interest rates. to mitigate these market risks and their effects on the cash flows of the underlying transactions and investments in foreign subsidiaries, the company uses various derivative and non-derivative financial instruments, when appropriate, in accordance with the company's hedging strategy and policies. designation is performed on a specific exposure basis to support hedge accounting. the company does not enter into derivative transactions for speculative purposes.
cash flow hedges cash flow hedges are derivative instruments designated as and used to hedge the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows that are attributable to a particular risk. the derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a cash flow hedge are reported on the balance sheet at fair value and the changes in fair value of these hedging instruments are offset in part or in whole by corresponding changes in the anticipated cash flows of the underlying exposures being hedged. the net of the change in the hedge instrument and item being hedged for qualifying cash flow hedges is reported as a component of aoci located in the consolidated statements of financial position and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. gains and losses on the derivatives representing either hedge ineffectiveness or hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recognized in current earnings.
foreign currency exchange rate hedging eastman manufactures and sells its products in a number of countries throughout the world and, as a result, is exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. to manage the volatility relating to these exposures, the company nets the exposures on a consolidated basis to take advantage of natural offsets. to manage the remaining exposure, the company enters into currency option and forward cash flow hedges to hedge probable anticipated, but not yet committed, export sales and purchase transactions expected within a rolling three year period and denominated in foreign currencies (principally the euro and japanese yen). additionally, the company, from time to time, enters into forward exchange contract cash flow hedges to hedge certain firm commitments denominated in foreign currencies.
91
notes to the audited consolidated financial statements commodity hedging certain raw material and energy sources used by eastman, as well as sales of certain commodity products by the company, are subject to price volatility caused by weather, supply and demand conditions, economic variables and other unpredictable factors. this volatility is primarily related to the market pricing of propane, ethane, natural gas, paraxylene, ethylene, and benzene. in order to mitigate expected fluctuations in market prices, the company enters into option and forward contracts and designates these contracts as cash flow hedges. the company currently hedges commodity price risks using derivative financial instrument transactions within a rolling three year period.
the company weights its hedge portfolio more heavily in the first year with declining coverage over the remaining periods.
interest rate hedging eastman's policy is to manage interest expense using a mix of fixed and variable rate debt. to manage interest rate risk effectively, the company, from time to time, enters into cash flow interest rate derivative instruments, primarily forward starting swaps and treasury locks, to hedge the company's exposure to movements in interest rates prior to anticipated debt offerings. these instruments are designated as cash flow hedges and are typically 100
percent effective. as a result, there is normally no impact on earnings due to hedge ineffectiveness.
fair value hedges fair value hedges are defined as derivative or non-derivative instruments designated as and used to hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset or a liability or an identified portion thereof that is attributable to a particular risk. the derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value and the changes in fair value of these hedging instruments are offset in part or in whole by corresponding changes in the anticipated cash flows of the underlying exposures being hedged. the net of the change in the hedge instrument and item being hedged for qualifying fair value hedges is reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings.
gains and losses on the derivatives representing hedge ineffectiveness are recognized in current earnings.
interest rate hedging eastman's policy is to manage interest expense using a mix of fixed and variable rate debt. to manage the company's mix of fixed and variable rate debt effectively, from time to time, the company enters into interest rate swaps in which the company agrees to exchange the difference between fixed and variable interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed upon notional principal amount. these swaps are designated as hedges of the fair value of the underlying debt obligations and the interest rate differential is reflected as an adjustment to interest expense over the life of the swaps. as these instruments are typically 100 percent effective, there is normally no impact on earnings due to hedge ineffectiveness.
in 2016, the company entered into a $75 million notional fixed-to-floating interest rate swap on the 3.8% notes due march 2025 in order to manage the company's mix of fixed and variable rate debt.
net investment hedges net investment hedges are defined as derivative or non-derivative instruments designated as and used to hedge the foreign currency exposure of the net investment in certain foreign operations. the net of the change in the hedge instrument and item being hedged for qualifying net investment hedges is reported as a component of the cta within oci located in the consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income and retained earnings. gains and losses representing either hedge ineffectiveness or hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recognized in current earnings.
the company designated the euro-denominated 1.50% notes due may 2023 in the principal amounts of €200 million (
$213 million ) in fourth quarter 2016 and €550 million ( $614 million ) in second quarter 2016 and the euro-
denominated 1.875% notes due november 2026 in the principal amount of €500 million ( $534 million ) in fourth quarter 2016 as non-derivative net investment hedges of a portion of the company's net investments in euro functional currency-denominated subsidiaries to offset foreign currency fluctuations.

fair value measurements for additional information on fair value measurement, see note 1, "significant accounting policies" .
the fair value principles prioritize valuation inputs across three broad levels. level 1 inputs are quoted prices
(unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. level 2 inputs are quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly through market corroborations, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument. level 3
inputs are unobservable inputs based on the company's assumptions used to measure assets and liabilities at fair value.
all the company's derivative assets and liabilities are currently classified as level 2. level 2 fair value is based on estimates using standard pricing models. these standard pricing models use inputs that are derived from or corroborated by observable market data such as interest rate yield curves and currency spot and forward rates. the fair value of commodity contracts is derived using forward curves supplied by an industry recognized and unrelated third party. in addition, on an ongoing basis, the company tests a subset of its valuations against valuations received from the transaction's counterparty to validate the accuracy of its standard pricing models.
counterparties to these derivative contracts are highly rated financial institutions which the company believes carry minimal risk of nonperformance, and the company diversifies its positions among such counterparties to reduce its exposure to counterparty risk and credit losses. the company monitors the creditworthiness of its counterparties on an on-going basis. the company did not realize a credit loss during the years ended december 31,
2017 or 2016 .
all the company's derivative contracts are subject to master netting arrangements, or similar agreements, which provide for the option to settle contracts on a net basis when they settle on the same day and in the same currency. in addition, these arrangements provide for a net settlement of all contracts with a given counterparty in the event that the arrangement is terminated due to the occurrence of default or a termination event. the company does not have any cash collateral due under such agreements.

(1)  foreign exchange derivatives denominated in multiple currencies and are transacted and settled in the same quarter.
pre-tax monetized positions and mtm gains and losses from raw materials and energy, currency, and certain interest rate hedges that were included in aoci included losses of $214 million at december 31, 2017 and losses of $57
million at december 31, 2016 . losses in aoci increased in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily as a result of an increase in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly the euro, partially offset by an increase in commodity prices, particularly propane. if realized, approximately $6 million in pre-tax losses will be reclassified into earnings during the next 12 months.
the company had no material ineffectiveness from the hedging programs during the years ended december 31, 2017 or
2016 .
in fourth quarter 2016 as a result of the early repayments of borrowings, the company settled the notional amount of $500 million associated with the 2017 forward starting interest rate swap, which had a mtm loss on the settlement date of $44 million and was included as part of investing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows. the early repayment of borrowings resulted in a charge of $18 million for cash flow hedges and a gain of $4 million for fair value hedges, which is included within the $76 million of debt extinguishment costs and related derivatives and hedging items on the consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income and retained earnings. for further information, see note 8, "borrowings" .

notes to the audited consolidated financial statements
10.  retirement plans as described below, eastman offers various postretirement benefits to its employees.
defined contribution plans eastman sponsors a defined contribution employee stock ownership plan (the "esop"), which is a component of the eastman investment plan and employee stock ownership plan ("eip/esop"), under section 401(a) of the internal revenue code. eastman made a contribution in february 2018 to the eip/esop for substantially all u.s. employees equal to 5 percent of their eligible compensation for the 2017 plan year. employees may allocate contributions to other investment funds within the eip from the esop at any time without restrictions. allocated shares in the esop totaled 2,130,176 ; 2,183,950 ; and 2,199,000 shares as of december 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively.
dividends on shares held by the eip/esop are charged to retained earnings. all shares held by the eip/esop are treated as outstanding in computing earnings per share.
in 2006, the company amended its eip/esop to provide a company match of 50 percent of the first 7 percent of an employee's compensation contributed to the plan for employees who are hired on or after january 1, 2007. employees who are hired on or after january 1, 2007, are also eligible for the contribution to the esop as described above.
charges for domestic contributions to the eip/esop were $64 million , $63 million , and $62 million for 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively.
defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans pension plans eastman maintains defined benefit pension plans that provide eligible employees with retirement benefits.
effective january 1, 2000, the company's eastman retirement assistance plan, a u.s. defined benefit pension plan, was amended. employees' accrued pension benefits earned prior to january 1, 2000 are calculated based on previous plan provisions using the employee's age, years of service, and final average compensation as defined in the plans.
the amended plan uses a pension equity formula to calculate an employee's retirement benefits from january 1, 2000
forward. benefits payable will be the combined pre-2000 and post-1999 benefits. employees hired on or after january
1, 2007 are not eligible to participate in eastman's u.s. defined benefit pension plans.
benefits are paid to employees from trust funds. contributions to the trust funds are made as permitted by laws and regulations. the pension trust funds do not directly own any of the company's common stock.
pension coverage for employees of eastman's non-u.s. operations is provided, to the extent deemed appropriate, through separate plans. the company systematically provides for obligations under such plans by depositing funds with trustees, under insurance policies, or by book reserves.
other postretirement benefit plans under its other postretirement benefit plans in the u.s., eastman provides life insurance for eligible retirees hired prior to january 1, 2007. eastman provides a subsidy for pre-medicare health care and dental benefits to eligible retirees hired prior to january 1, 2007 that will end on december 31, 2021. company funding is also provided for eligible medicare retirees hired prior to january 1, 2007 with a health reimbursement arrangement. a few of the company's non-u.s. operations have supplemental health benefit plans for certain retirees, the cost of which is not significant to the company.

notes to the audited consolidated financial statements in fourth quarter 2016, eastman changed benefits provided to retirees by an eastman other postretirement benefit plan which triggered a remeasurement of the plan's obligation. the remeasurement resulted in a pre-tax reduction in the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation of approximately $106 million which will be amortized as a prior service credit from aoci over approximately eight years. the remeasurement was included in the 2016 year end remeasurement process.
in third quarter 2016, the company announced a change to a uk defined benefit pension plan which triggered an interim remeasurement of the plan obligation resulting in a mtm loss of $30 million . the mtm loss was primarily due to a lower discount rate at the third quarter 2016 remeasurement date compared to december 31, 2015. the lower discount rate was reflective of changes in global market conditions and interest rates on high-grade corporate bonds. the plan was remeasured in fourth quarter 2016 as part of the annual mtm remeasurement process.
in first quarter 2016, the company changed the approach used to calculate service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit costs for its significant defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans. the company elected to calculate service and interest costs by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve to the plans' projected cash flows. the change does not affect the measurement of the total benefit obligation or the annual net periodic benefit cost or credit of the plans because the change in the service and interest costs will be offset in the mtm actuarial gain or loss which typically is recognized in the fourth quarter of each year or in any other quarters in which an interim remeasurement is triggered. the change in the approach for full-year
2016 pre-tax expense was an increase to service cost of approximately $2 million and a reduction in interest cost of approximately $22 million compared to the previous method. the net reduction of approximately $20 million was offset by a mtm loss as part of the annual remeasurement of the plans in fourth quarter 2016.
in fourth quarter 2015, the company changed benefits provided to retirees by the eastman other postretirement benefit plan which triggered a remeasurement of the plan's obligation. the remeasurement resulted in a reduction in the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation of approximately $140 million which will be amortized as a prior service credit from aoci over approximately eight years. the remeasurement was included in the 2015 year end remeasurement process.
the estimated prior service credit for the u.s. pension and other postretirement benefit plans that will be amortized from aoci into net periodic cost in 2018 is $1 million and $40 million , respectively.

a 6.75 percent rate of increase in per capita cost of covered health care benefits is assumed for 2018. the rate is assumed to decrease gradually to five percent in 2025 and remain at that level thereafter. a one percent increase or decrease in health care cost trend would have had no material impact on the 2017 service and interest costs or the 2017 benefit obligation, because the company's contributions for benefits are fixed.
in 2017, the company performed a five year experience study on assumptions for the u.s. plans, including a review of the mortality tables. as a result of the study, the company has updated the mortality assumptions used to a modified rp-2017 table with a modified mp-2017 improvement scale and no collar adjustment.
the fair value of plan assets for the u.s. pension plans at december 31, 2017 and 2016 was $2.1 billion and $2.0
billion , respectively, while the fair value of plan assets at december 31, 2017 and 2016 for non-u.s. pension plans was $773 million and $667 million , respectively. at december 31, 2017 and 2016 , the expected weighted-
average long-term rate of return on u.s. pension plan assets was 7.48 percent and 7.49 percent, respectively. the expected weighted-average long-term rate of return on non-u.s. pension plans assets was 4.83 percent and 5.02
percent at december 31, 2017 and 2016 , respectively.

(3)  rate that approximates market returns and investments in underlying securities whose market values are unobservable and determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques.
investments measured at net asset value: the underlying debt and public equity investments in this category are generally held in common trust funds, which are either actively or passively managed investment vehicles, that are valued at the net asset value per unit/share multiplied by the number of
(4)  units/shares held as of the measurement date. the other alternative investments in this category are valued under the practical expedient method which is based on the most recently reported net asset value provided by the management of each private investment fund, adjusted as appropriate, for any lag between the date of the financial reports and the measurement date.

investment strategy eastman's investment strategy for its defined benefit pension plans is to maximize the long-term rate of return on plan assets within an acceptable level of risk in order to meet or exceed the plan's actuarially assumed long-term rate of return and to minimize the cost of providing pension benefits. a periodic asset/liability study is conducted in order to assist in the determination and, if necessary, modification of the appropriate long-term investment policy for the plan. the investment policy establishes a target allocation range for each asset class and the fund is managed within those ranges. the plans use a number of investment approaches including investments in equity, real estate, and fixed income funds in which the underlying securities are marketable in order to achieve this target allocation. the plans also invest in private equity and other funds. diversification is created through investments across various asset classes, geographies, fund managers, and individual securities. this investment process is designed to provide for a well-diversified portfolio with no significant concentration of risk. the investment process is monitored by an investment committee that includes senior management.
eastman's investment strategy for its veba trust is to invest in intermediate-term, well diversified, high quality investment instruments, with a primary objective of capital preservation.
103
notes to the audited consolidated financial statements the expected rate of return for all plans was determined primarily by modeling the expected long-term rates of return for the categories of investments held by the plans and the targeted allocation percentage against various potential economic scenarios.
the company funded its u.s. defined benefit pension plans in the amount of $200 million in 2016 and made no contributions in 2017 . for 2018, there are no minimum required cash contributions for the u.s. defined benefit pension plans under the employee retirement income security act of 1974, as amended, and the internal revenue code of 1986, as amended.
the estimated future benefit payments, reflecting expected future service, as appropriate, are as follows:

eastman had various purchase obligations at december 31, 2017 totaling approximately $2.9 billion over a period of approximately 30 years for materials, supplies, and energy incident to the ordinary conduct of business. the company also had various lease commitments for property and equipment under cancelable, noncancelable, and month-
to-month operating leases totaling approximately $270 million over a period of approximately 40 years. of the total lease commitments, approximately 50 percent relate to real property, including office space, storage facilities, and land; approximately 40 percent relate to railcars; and approximately 10 percent relate to machinery and equipment, including computer and communications equipment and production equipment. rental expense, net of sublease income, was $94 million , $90 million , and $79 million in 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively.
amounts in other liabilities represent the current estimated cash payments required to be made by the company primarily for pension and other postretirement benefits, environmental loss contingency reserves, accrued compensation benefits, uncertain tax liabilities, one-time transition tax on deferred foreign income under the 2017
tax cuts and jobs act, and commodity and foreign exchange hedging in the periods indicated. due to uncertainties in the timing of the effective settlement of tax positions with respect to taxing authorities, management is unable to determine the timing of payments related to uncertain tax liabilities and these amounts are included in the "2023
and beyond" line item.

notes to the audited consolidated financial statements guarantees eastman has operating leases with terms that require the company to guarantee a portion of the residual value of the leased assets upon termination of the lease as well as other guarantees. disclosures about each group of similar guarantees are provided below.
residual value guarantees the company has operating leases with terms that require the company to guarantee a portion of the residual value of the leased assets upon termination of the lease. these residual value guarantees totaled $71 million at december
31, 2017 and consist primarily of leases for railcars that will expire beginning in third quarter 2018. residual guarantee payments that become probable and estimable are accrued to rent expense over the remaining life of the applicable lease. management's current expectation is that the likelihood of material residual guarantee payments is remote.
other guarantees guarantees and claims also arise during the ordinary course of business from relationships with customers, suppliers, joint venture partners, and other parties when the company undertakes an obligation to guarantee the performance of others, if specified triggering events occur. non-performance under a contract could trigger an obligation of the company. the company's current other guarantees include guarantees relating to intellectual property, environmental matters, and other indemnifications and have arisen through the normal course of business.
the ultimate effect on future financial results is not subject to reasonable estimation because considerable uncertainty exists as to the final outcome of these claims, if they were to occur. these other guarantees have terms up to 30 years with maximum potential future payments of approximately $35 million in the aggregate, with none of these guarantees being individually significant to the company's operating results, financial position, or liquidity. the company's current expectation is that future payment or performance related to non-performance under other guarantees is remote.
other off balance sheet arrangements the company has off balance sheet non-recourse factoring facilities with various commitment dates. these arrangements include customer specific receivables in the united states and europe. the company sells the receivables at face value which equals the carrying value and fair value, and thus no gain or loss is recognized.
there is no continuing involvement with these receivables once sold and no credit loss exposure. the total amount of cumulative receivables sold in 2017 was $35 million .

notes to the audited consolidated financial statements
12.  environmental matters and asset retirement obligations certain eastman manufacturing sites generate hazardous and nonhazardous wastes, the treatment, storage, transportation, and disposal of which are regulated by various governmental agencies. in connection with the cleanup of various hazardous waste sites, the company, along with many other entities, has been designated a potentially responsible party ("prp") by the u.s. environmental protection agency under the comprehensive environmental response, compensation and liability act, which potentially subjects prps to joint and several liability for certain cleanup costs. in addition, the company will incur costs for environmental remediation and closure and post-closure under the federal resource conservation and recovery act. reserves for environmental contingencies have been established in accordance with eastman's policies described in note 1, "significant accounting policies" . although the resolution of uncertainties related to these environmental matters may have a material adverse effect on the company's consolidated results of operations in the period recognized, because of the availability of legal defenses, the company's preliminary assessment of actions that may be required, and, if applicable, the expected sharing of costs, management does not believe that the company's liability for these environmental matters, individually or in the aggregate, will be material to the company's consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. the company's total reserve for environmental loss contingencies was $304 million and $321 million at december 31, 2017 and december 31, 2016 , respectively. the environmental reserve includes costs related to sites previously closed and impaired by eastman and sites that have been divested by eastman but for which the company retains the environmental liability related to these sites of $7 million and
$8 million at december 31, 2017 and december 31, 2016 , respectively.
the company's total environmental reserve that management believes to be probable and estimable for environmental contingencies, including remediation costs and asset retirement obligations, is included as part of "payables and other current liabilities" and "other long-term liabilities" in the consolidated statements of financial position as follows:

environmental remediation estimated future environmental expenditures for undiscounted remediation costs ranged from the best estimate or minimum of $280 million to the maximum of $483 million and from the best estimate or minimum of $295 million to the maximum of $503 million at december 31, 2017 and december 31, 2016 , respectively. the best estimate or minimum estimated future environmental expenditures are considered to be probable and reasonably estimable and include the amounts accrued at both december 31, 2017 and december 31, 2016 .
costs of certain remediation projects included in the environmental reserve are subject to a cost-sharing arrangement with monsanto company ("monsanto") under the provisions of the amended and restated settlement agreement effective february 28, 2008 (the "effective date"), into which solutia entered with monsanto upon its emergence from bankruptcy (the "monsanto settlement agreement"). under the provisions of the monsanto settlement agreement, solutia, which became a wholly-owned subsidiary of eastman on july 2, 2012, shares responsibility with monsanto for remediation at certain locations outside of the boundaries of plant sites in anniston, alabama and sauget, illinois (the "shared sites"). solutia is responsible for the funding of environmental liabilities at the shared sites up to a total of $325 million from the effective date. if remediation costs for the shared sites exceed this amount, such costs will thereafter be shared equally between solutia and monsanto. including payments by solutia prior to its acquisition by eastman, $84 million had been paid for costs at the shared sites as of december 31, 2017 . as of december 31, 2017 , an additional $204 million has been accrued for estimated future remediation costs at the shared sites, over a period of approximately 30 years .

notes to the audited consolidated financial statements reserves for environmental remediation include liabilities expected to be paid within approximately 30 years . the amounts charged to pre-tax earnings for environmental remediation and related charges are included within "cost of sales" in the consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income and retained earnings. changes in the reserves for environmental remediation liabilities for twelve months ended 2017 are summarized below:

asset retirement obligations an asset retirement obligation is an obligation for the retirement of a tangible long-lived asset that is incurred upon the acquisition, construction, development, or normal operation of that long-lived asset. eastman recognizes a sset retirement obligations in the period in which they are incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. the asset retirement obligations are discounted to expected present value and subsequently adjusted for changes in fair value. the associated estimated asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying value of the long-lived assets and depreciated over their useful life. environmental asset retirement obligations consist of primarily closure and post-closure costs. for sites that have environmental asset retirement obligations, the best estimate accrued to date for these asset retirement obligation costs was $24 million and $26
million at december 31, 2017 and december 31, 2016 , respectively.
other environmental costs are capitalized if they extend the life of the related property, increase its capacity, or mitigate the possibility of future contamination. the cost of operating and maintaining environmental control facilities is charged to expense as incurred. eastman's cash expenditures related to environmental protection and improvement were $257 million , $267 million , and $290 million in 2017 , 2016 , and 2015 , respectively, and include operating costs associated with environmental protection equipment and facilities, engineering costs, and construction costs. the cash expenditures above include environmental capital expenditures of approximately $38
million and $45 million in 2017 and 2016 , respectively.
the company also has contractual asset retirement obligations not associated with environmental liabilities.
eastman's non-environmental asset retirement obligations are primarily associated with the future closure of leased manufacturing assets at pace, florida and oulu, finland. these accrued non-environmental asset retirement obligations were $49 million and $46 million at december 31, 2017 and december 31, 2016 , respectively.
13.  legal matters general from time to time, eastman and its operations are parties to, or targets of, lawsuits, claims, investigations and proceedings, including product liability, personal injury, asbestos, patent and intellectual property, commercial, contract, environmental, antitrust, health and safety, and employment matters, which are handled and defended in the ordinary course of business. while the company is unable to predict the outcome of these matters, it does not believe, based upon currently available facts, that the ultimate resolution of any such pending matters will have a material adverse effect on its overall financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.

(1)  cash dividends includes cash dividends paid and dividends declared, but unpaid.
(2)  share-based compensation expense is the fair value of share-based awards.
eastman is authorized to issue 400 million shares of all classes of stock, of which 50 million may be preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share, and 350 million may be common stock, par value $0.01 per share. the company declared dividends per share of $2.09 in 2017 , $1.89 in 2016 , and $1.66 in 2015 .
the company established a benefit security trust in 1997 to provide a degree of financial security for unfunded obligations under certain unfunded plans and contributed to the trust a warrant to purchase up to 6 million shares of common stock of the company for par value. the warrant, which remains outstanding, is exercisable by the trustee if the company does not meet certain funding obligations, which obligations would be triggered by certain occurrences, including a change in control or potential change in control, as defined, or failure by the company to meet its payment obligations under certain covered unfunded plans. such warrant is excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share because the conditions upon which the warrant becomes exercisable have not been met.

notes to the audited consolidated financial statements
17.  share-based compensation plans and awards
2017 omnibus stock compensation plan eastman's 2017 omnibus stock compensation plan ("2017 omnibus plan") was approved by stockholders at the may 4,
2017 annual meeting of stockholders and shall remain in effect until its fifth anniversary. the 2017 omnibus plan authorizes the compensation and management development committee of the board of directors to grant awards, designate participants, determine the types and numbers of awards, determine the terms and conditions of awards and determine the form of award settlement. under the 2017 omnibus plan, the aggregate number of shares reserved and available for issuance is 10 million , which consist of shares not previously authorized for issuance under any other plan. the number of shares covered by an award is counted against this share reserve as of the grant date of the award. shares covered by full value awards (e.g. performance shares and restricted stock awards) are counted against the total number of shares available for issuance or delivery under the plan as 2.5 shares for every one share covered by the award. any stock distributed pursuant to an award may consist of, in whole or in part, authorized and unissued stock, treasury stock, or stock purchased on the open market. under the 2017 omnibus plan and previous plans, the forms of awards have included restricted stock and restricted stock units, stock options, stock appreciation rights ("sars"), and performance shares. the 2017 omnibus plan is flexible as to the number of specific forms of awards, but provides that stock options and sars are to be granted at an exercise price not less than 100 percent of the per share fair market value on the date of the grant .
director stock compensation subplan eastman's 2017 director stock compensation subplan ("directors' subplan"), a component of the 2017 omnibus plan, remains in effect until terminated by the board of directors or the earlier termination of the 2017 omnibus plan.
the directors' subplan provides for structured awards of restricted shares to non-employee members of the board of directors. restricted shares awarded under the directors' subplan are subject to the same terms and conditions of the 2017 omnibus plan. the directors' subplan does not constitute a separate source of shares for grant of equity awards and all shares awarded are part of the 10 million shares authorized under the 2017 omnibus plan. shares of restricted stock are granted on the first day of a non-employee director's initial term of service and shares of restricted stock are granted each year to each non-employee director on the date of the annual meeting of stockholders.
it has been the company's practice to issue new shares rather than treasury shares for equity awards for compensation plans, including the 2017 omnibus plan and the directors' subplan, that require settlement by the issuance of common stock and to withhold or accept back shares awarded to cover the related income tax obligations of employee participants. shares of unrestricted common stock owned by non-employee directors are not eligible to be withheld or acquired to satisfy the withholding obligation related to their income taxes. shares of unrestricted common stock owned by specified senior management level employees are accepted by the company to pay the exercise price of stock options in accordance with the terms and conditions of their awards.
compensation expense for 2017 , 2016 , and 2015 , total share-based compensation expense (before tax) of approximately $52 million , $36
million , and $36 million , respectively, was recognized in "selling, general and administrative expense" in the consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income and retained earnings for all share-based awards of which approximately $8 million , $7 million , and $7 million , respectively, related to stock options. the compensation expense is recognized over the substantive vesting period, which may be a shorter time period than the stated vesting period for qualifying termination eligible employees as defined in the forms of award notice. for 2017 ,
2016 , and 2015 , approximately $2 million of stock option compensation expense was recognized each year due to qualifying termination eligibility preceding the requisite vesting period.
stock option awards options have been granted on an annual basis to non-employee directors under the directors' subplan and predecessor plans and by the compensation and management development committee of the board of directors under the 2017 omnibus plan and predecessor plans to employees. option awards have an exercise price equal to the closing price of the company's stock on the date of grant. the term of options is 10 years with vesting periods that vary up to three years. vesting usually occurs ratably over the vesting period or at the end of the vesting period. the company utilizes the black scholes merton option valuation model which relies on certain assumptions to estimate an option's fair value.
113
notes to the audited consolidated financial statements the weighted average assumptions used in the determination of fair value for stock options awarded in 2017 , 2016 , and 2015 are provided in the table below:
assumptions                          2017      2016      2015
expected volatility rate           20.45%    23.71%    24.11%
expected dividend yield             2.64%     2.31%     1.75%
average risk-free interest rate     1.91%     1.23%     1.45%
expected term years                   5.0       5.0       4.8
the volatility rate of grants is derived from historical company common stock price volatility over the same time period as the expected term of each stock option award. the volatility rate is derived by mathematical formula utilizing the weekly high closing stock price data over the expected term.
the expected dividend yield is calculated using the company's average of the last four quarterly dividend yields .
the average risk-free interest rate is derived from united states department of treasury published interest rates of daily yield curves for the same time period as the expected term.
the weighted average expected term reflects the analysis of historical share-based award transactions and includes option swap and reload grants which may have much shorter remaining expected terms than new option grants.
a summary of the activity of the company's stock option awards for 2017 , 2016 , and 2015 is presented below:

other share-based compensation awards in addition to stock option awards, eastman has awarded long-term performance share awards, restricted stock awards, and sars. the long-term performance share awards are based upon actual return on capital compared to a target return on capital and total stockholder return compared to a peer group ranking by total stockholder return over a three year performance period. the awards are valued using a monte carlo simulation based model and vest pro-rata over the three year performance period. the number of long-term performance award target shares granted for the 2017-2019, 2016-2018, and 2015-2017 periods were 357 thousand , 427 thousand , and 347 thousand , respectively. the target shares granted are assumed to be 100 percent. at the end of the three-year performance period, the actual number of shares awarded can range from zero percent to 250 percent of the target shares granted based on the award notice. the number of restricted stock awards granted during 2017 , 2016 , and 2015 were 172
thousand , 190 thousand , and 233 thousand , respectively. the fair value of a restricted stock award is equal to the closing stock price of the company's stock on the date of grant and normally vests over a period of three years. the recognized compensation expense before tax for these other share-based awards in the years ended december 31, 2017 , 2016 , and 2015 was approximately $44 million , $29 million , and $29 million , respectively.
the unrecognized compensation expense before tax for these same type awards at december 31, 2017 was approximately

22.  recently issued accounting standards in may 2014, the financial accounting standards board ("fasb") and international accounting standards board jointly issued new principles-based accounting guidance for revenue recognition that provides a five-step process to the principles-based guidance. in august 2015, the fasb issued new guidance to delay the effective date of the new revenue standard by one year. the deferral results in the new revenue standard being effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after december 15, 2017. early application is permitted under the original effective date of fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after december 15, 2016. in april 2016, the fasb issued clarifying guidance to the 2014 revenue standard in regard to the identification of performance obligations and licensing. in may 2016, the fasb issued narrow-scope improvements and practical expedients to the new revenue standard that include clarification of the collectability criterion, specification for the measurement of noncash considerations, clarification of a completed contract for transition purposes and clarification in regards to the retrospective application, as well as, policy elections, and other practical expedients. in december 2016, the fasb issued additional corrections and improvements that affect various narrow aspects of the guidance. the effective date for all amendments is the same as that of the revenue standard stated above. management does not expect that changes in its accounting required by this new guidance will materially impact the company's financial statements and related disclosures. the company adopted the standard under the modified-retrospective approach on january 1, 2018.
in february 2016, the fasb issued guidance on lease accounting. the new guidance establishes two types of leases for lessees: finance and operating. both finance and operating leases will have associated right-of-use assets and liabilities initially measured at the present value of the lease payments. this guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after december 15, 2018, including interim periods within that reporting period and early adoption is permitted. the new guidance is to be applied under a modified retrospective approach wherein practical expedients have been allowed that will not require reassessment of current leases at the effective date.
management is currently evaluating implementation options and impact on the company's financial statements and related disclosures.

notes to the audited consolidated financial statements in june 2016, the fasb issued guidance relating to credit losses. the amendments require a financial asset
(including trade receivables) to be presented at the net amount expected to be collected through the use of allowances for credit losses valuation account. the income statement will reflect the measurement of credit losses for newly recognized financial assets, as well as the expected increases or decreases of expected credit losses that have taken place during the period. this guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after december 15, 2019, including interim periods within that reporting period and early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period, beginning after december 15, 2018. the new guidance application is mixed among the various elements that include modified retrospective and prospective transition methods. management does not expect that changes in its accounting required by the new guidance will materially impact the company's financial position or results of operations and related disclosures.
in october 2016, the fasb issued guidance as a part of its simplification initiative in regard to income tax of intra-entity asset transfers. the release requires an entity to recognize the income tax consequences of an intra-
entity transfer of an asset other than inventory when the transfer occurs. consequently, the amendments eliminate the exception for an intra-entity transfer of an asset other than inventory that prohibited recognizing current and deferred income tax consequences for an intra-entity asset transfer until the asset or assets have been sold to an outside party. this guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after december 15, 2017, including interim periods within those annual reporting periods and early adoption is permitted as of the beginning of an annual reporting period for which financial statements (interim or annual) have not been issued or made available for issuance. the new guidance is to be applied on a modified retrospective basis through a cumulative-effect adjustment directly to retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption. management does not expect that changes in its accounting required by this new guidance will materially impact the company's financial statements and related disclosures.
in january 2017, the fasb issued guidance clarifying the definition of a business that provides a two-step analysis in the determination of whether an acquisition or derecognition is a business or an asset. the update removes the evaluation of whether a market participant could replace any missing elements and provides a framework to assist entities in evaluating whether both an input and a substantive process are present. this guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after december 15, 2017, including interim periods within those annual reporting periods and early adoption is permitted for transactions that meet specified criteria. this guidance is to be applied on a prospective basis for transactions that occur after the effective date.
in january 2017, the fasb issued guidance as a part of its simplification initiative that bases the impairment of goodwill on any difference for which the carrying value is greater than the fair value of the reporting unit. this guidance is effective for annual reporting periods, or interim period testing performed, beginning after december
15, 2019. early adoption is permitted for interim or annual goodwill impairment testing performed after january 1,
2017. this guidance is to be applied on a prospective basis for goodwill testing that occur after the effective date. management does not expect that changes in its accounting required by the new guidance will materially impact the company's financial position or results of operations and related disclosures.
in february 2017, the fasb issued guidance that clarifies the scope of nonfinancial asset derecognition and the accounting for partial sales of nonfinancial assets. this guidance is effective at the same time as the amendments in the revenue recognition standard stated above, for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after december 15, 2017, and must be applied in conjunction with that standard. adoption can be applied either on a retrospective or modified retrospective approach. management does not expect that changes in its accounting required by the new guidance will materially impact the company's financial position or results of operations and related disclosures.
in march 2017, the fasb issued guidance to improve the presentation of net periodic pension and postretirement benefit costs that will require the reporting of the service cost component in the same line item or items as other compensation costs arising from services rendered by the pertinent employees during the period. the other components of net benefit cost (interest cost, expected return on plan assets, curtailment gains or losses, amortization of prior service costs or credits, and mtm gains or losses) are to be presented in the income statement separately from the service cost component and outside the subtotal of income from operations, if presented. in addition, the new requirement prescribes only the service cost component to be eligible for capitalization. this guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after december 15, 2017, including interim periods within those annual reporting periods, and early adoption is permitted as of the beginning of an annual period for which financial statements (interim or annual) have not been issued or made available for issuance. the new guidance is to be applied retrospectively for income statement effect and prospectively for balance sheet effects. the total of other components of net benefit cost for 2017, 2016, and 2015
were $135 million credit, $3 million credit, and $40 million cost, respectively.
122
notes to the audited consolidated financial statements in may 2017, the fasb issued guidance to clarify when changes to the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award would require an entity to apply modification accounting. this guidance is effective for annual reporting periods, and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after december 15, 2017. early adoption is permitted, including adoption in any interim period, for reporting periods for which financial statements have not yet been issued. the new guidance is to be applied prospectively to an award modified on or after the adoption date.
in august 2017, the fasb issued guidance to simplify the application of the current hedge accounting guidance and improve the financial reporting of hedging relationships to better portray the economic results of an entity's risk management activities in the financial statements. this guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15, 2018, and interim periods within those fiscal years. early adoption is permitted in any interim period after issuance of the guidance. income statement impacts are to be adopted on a retrospective basis as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption. the amended presentation and disclosure guidance is required only prospectively. management is currently evaluating the impact on the company's financial statements and related disclosures.

item 9.  changes in and disagreements with accountants on accounting and financial disclosure none.
item 9a.  controls and procedures disclosure controls and procedures eastman chemical company ("eastman" or the "company") maintains a set of disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the company in reports that it files or submits under the securities exchange act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in securities and exchange commission rules and forms. disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the company in the reports that it files or submits under the securities exchange act of 1934 is accumulated and communicated to the company's management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. an evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of the company's management, including the chief executive officer
("ceo") and chief financial officer ("cfo"), of the effectiveness of the company's disclosure controls and procedures. based on that evaluation, the ceo and cfo have concluded that as of december 31, 2017 , the company's disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed was accumulated and communicated to management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
management necessarily applies its judgment in assessing the costs and benefits of such controls and procedures, which, by their nature, can provide only reasonable assurance regarding management's control objectives.
management, including the ceo and cfo, does not expect that the company's disclosure controls and procedures can prevent all possible errors or fraud. a control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance; judgments in decision-making can be faulty; and breakdowns can occur because of simple errors or mistakes. additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of one or more persons. the design of any system of controls is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and while the company's disclosure controls and procedures are designed to be effective under circumstances where they should reasonably be expected to operate effectively, there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. because of the inherent limitations in any control system, misstatements due to possible errors or fraud may occur and not be detected.
management's report on internal control over financial reporting management of the company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. the company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed under the supervision of the company's ceo and cfo to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the company's financial statements for external purposes in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles.
the company's internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that:
•  pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect transactions and acquisitions and dispositions of assets of the company;
provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
•  statements in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and the directors of the company; and
•  provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the company's financial statements.
because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
124
management has assessed the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting as of december 31, 2017
based on the framework established in internal control - integrated framework (2013) issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission. based on this assessment, management has determined that the company's internal control over financial reporting was effective as of december 31, 2017 .
the effectiveness of the company's internal control over financial reporting as of december 31, 2017 has been audited by pricewaterhousecoopers llp, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears herein.
changes in internal control over financial reporting there has been no change in the company's internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended december 31, 2017 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially effect, the company's internal control over financial reporting.

management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations significant acquisitions expose the company to risks and uncertainties, the occurrence of any of which could materially adversely affect the company's business, financial condition, and results of operations.
while acquisitions have been and continue to be a part of eastman's growth strategy, acquisitions of large companies (such as the previous acquisitions of taminco and solutia) subject the company to a number of risks and uncertainties, the occurrence of any of which could have a material adverse effect on eastman. these include, but are not limited to, the possibilities that the financial performance of the acquired business may be significantly worse than expected; that significant additional indebtedness may constrain the company's ability to access the credit and capital markets at attractive interest rates and favorable terms, which may negatively impact the company's liquidity or ability to pursue certain growth initiatives; that the company may not be able to achieve the cost, revenue, tax, or other "synergies" expected from any acquisition, or that there may be delays in achieving any such synergies; that management's time and effort may be dedicated to the new business resulting in a loss of focus on the successful operation of the company's existing businesses; and that the company may be required to expend significant additional resources in order to integrate any acquired business into eastman or that the integration efforts will not achieve the expected benefits.
in addition to the foregoing most significant known risk factors to the company, there may be other factors, not currently known to the company, which could, in the future, materially adversely affect the company, its business, financial condition, or results of operations. the foregoing discussion of the most significant risk factors to the company does not necessarily present them in order of importance. this disclosure, including that under "outlook"
and other forward-looking statements and related disclosures made by the company in this annual report and elsewhere from time to time, represents management's best judgment as of the date the information is given. the company does not undertake responsibility for updating any of such information, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise, except as required by law. investors are advised, however, to consult any further public company disclosures (such as in filings with the securities and exchange commission or in company press releases) on related subjects.

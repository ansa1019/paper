item 1a. risk factors the risks set forth in the following risk factors could have a materially adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity in a particular year or quarter, and could cause those results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in our forward-looking statements. the information set forth in this item 1a. "risk factors" should be read in conjunction with the rest of the information included in this annual report, including item 7 "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" and item 8 "financial statements and supplementary data."
significant governmental legislation and regulation over commercial, operating and environmental matters could affect us, our customers, and the markets we serve. congress can enact laws that could increase economic regulation of the industry. railroads presently are subject to commercial regulation by the stb, which has jurisdiction to varying extents over rates, routes, customer access provisions, fuel surcharges, conditions of service, and the extension or abandonment of rail lines. the stb also has jurisdiction over the consolidation, merger, or acquisition of control of and by rail common carriers. additional economic regulation of the rail industry by congress or the stb, whether under new or existing laws, could have a significant negative impact on our ability to determine prices for rail services and on the efficiency of our operations. this potential material adverse effect could also result in reduced capital spending on our rail network or abandonment of lines.
railroads are also subject to the enactment of laws by congress and regulation by the dot and the dhs (which regulate most aspects of our operations) related to safety and security. the rail safety improvement act of 2008 (rsia), the surface transportation extension act of 2015, and the implementing regulations promulgated by the fra (collectively "the ptc laws and regulations") require us (and each other class i railroad) to implement, on certain mainline track where intercity and commuter passenger railroads operate and where tih hazardous materials are transported, an interoperable positive train control system (ptc). ptc is a set of highly advanced technologies designed to prevent train-to-train collisions, speed-related derailments, and certain other accidents caused by human error, but ptc will not prevent all types of train accidents or incidents. the ptc laws and regulations require us to install all hardware and to implement the ptc system on some of those rail lines by december 31, 2018, and to implement such system on the remainder of those rail lines by december 31, 2020.
full implementation of ptc in compliance with rsia, as amended, will result in additional operating costs and capital expenditures, and ptc implementation may result in reduced operational efficiency and service levels, as well as increased compensation and benefits expenses, and increased claims and litigation costs.

our operations are subject to extensive federal and state environmental laws and regulations concerning, among other things, emissions to the air; discharges to waterways or groundwater supplies; handling, storage, transportation, and disposal of waste and other materials; and the cleanup of hazardous material or petroleum releases. the risk of incurring environmental liability, for acts and omissions, past, present, and future, is inherent in the railroad business. this risk includes property owned by us, whether currently or in the past, that is or has been subject to a variety of uses, including our railroad operations and other industrial activity by past owners or our past and present tenants.
environmental problems that are latent or undisclosed may exist on these properties, and we could incur environmental liabilities or costs, the amount and materiality of which cannot be estimated reliably at this time, with respect to one or more of these properties. moreover, lawsuits and claims involving other unidentified environmental sites and matters are likely to arise from time to time.
concern over climate change has led to significant federal, state, and international legislative and regulatory efforts to limit greenhouse gas (ghg) emissions. restrictions, caps, taxes, or other controls on ghg emissions, including diesel exhaust, could significantly increase our operating costs, decrease the amount of traffic handled, and decrease the value of coal reserves we own.
in addition, legislation and regulation related to ghgs could negatively affect the markets we serve and our customers. even without legislation or regulation, government incentives and adverse publicity relating to ghgs could negatively affect the markets for certain of the commodities we carry and our customers that (1) use commodities that we carry to produce energy, including coal, (2) use significant amounts of energy in producing or delivering the commodities we carry, or (3) manufacture or produce goods that consume significant amounts of energy.
as a common carrier by rail, we must offer to transport hazardous materials, regardless of risk. transportation of certain hazardous materials could create catastrophic losses in terms of personal injury and property (including environmental) damage, and compromise critical parts of our rail network. the cost of a catastrophic rail accident involving hazardous materials could exceed our insurance coverage. we have obtained insurance for potential losses for third-party liability and first-party property damages (see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements); however, insurance is available from a limited number of insurers and may not continue to be available or, if available, may not be obtainable on terms acceptable to us.
we may be affected by general economic conditions. prolonged negative changes in domestic and global economic conditions could affect the producers and consumers of the commodities we carry. economic conditions could also result in bankruptcies of one or more large customers.
significant increases in demand for rail services could result in the unavailability of qualified personnel and locomotives. in addition, workforce demographics and training requirements, particularly for engineers and conductors, could have a negative impact on our ability to meet short-term demand for rail service. unpredicted increases in demand for rail services may exacerbate such risks.
we may be affected by energy prices. volatility in energy prices could have a significant effect on a variety of items including, but not limited to: the economy; demand for transportation services; business related to the energy sector, including crude oil, natural gas, and coal; fuel prices; and fuel surcharges.
we face competition from other transportation providers. we are subject to competition from motor carriers, railroads and, to a lesser extent, ships, barges, and pipelines, on the basis of transit time, pricing, and quality and reliability of service. while we have used primarily internal resources to build or acquire and maintain our rail system, trucks and barges have been able to use public rights-of-way maintained by public entities. any future improvements, expenditures, legislation, or regulation materially increasing the quality or reducing the cost of alternative modes of transportation in the regions in which we operate (such as granting materially greater latitude k 11
for motor carriers with respect to size or weight limitations or adoption of autonomous commercial vehicles) could have a material adverse effect on our operations.
the operations of carriers with which we interchange may adversely affect our operations. our ability to provide rail service to customers in the u.s. and canada depends in large part upon our ability to maintain collaborative relationships with connecting carriers (including shortlines and regional railroads) with respect to, among other matters, freight rates, revenue division, car supply and locomotive availability, data exchange and communications, reciprocal switching, interchange, and trackage rights. deterioration in the operations of or service provided by connecting carriers, or in our relationship with those connecting carriers, could result in our inability to meet our customers' demands or require us to use alternate train routes, which could result in significant additional costs and network inefficiencies. additionally, any significant consolidations, mergers or operational changes among other railroads may significantly redefine our market access and reach.
we rely on technology and technology improvements in our business operations. if we experience significant disruption or failure of one or more of our information technology systems, including computer hardware, software, and communications equipment, we could experience a service interruption, a security breach, or other operational difficulties. we also face cybersecurity threats which may result in breaches of systems, or compromises of sensitive data, which may result in an inability to access or operate systems necessary for conducting operations and providing customer service, thereby impacting our efficiency and/or damaging our corporate reputation. additionally, if we do not have sufficient capital to acquire new technology or we are unable to implement new technology, we may suffer a competitive disadvantage within the rail industry and with companies providing other modes of transportation service.
the vast majority of our employees belong to labor unions, and labor agreements, strikes, or work stoppages could adversely affect our operations. approximately 80% of our railroad employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements with various labor unions. if unionized workers were to engage in a strike, work stoppage, or other slowdown, we could experience a significant disruption of our operations. additionally, future national labor agreements, or renegotiation of labor agreements or provisions of labor agreements, could significantly increase our costs for health care, wages, and other benefits.
we may be subject to various claims and lawsuits that could result in significant expenditures. the nature of our business exposes us to the potential for various claims and litigation related to labor and employment, personal injury, commercial disputes, freight loss and other property damage, and other matters. job-related personal injury and occupational claims are subject to the federal employer's liability act (fela), which is applicable only to railroads. fela's fault-based tort system produces results that are unpredictable and inconsistent as compared with a no-fault worker's compensation system. the variability inherent in this system could result in actual costs being different from the liability recorded.
any material changes to current litigation trends or a catastrophic rail accident involving any or all of freight loss property damage, personal injury, and environmental liability could have a material adverse effect on us to the extent not covered by insurance. we have obtained insurance for potential losses for third-party liability and first-party property damages; however, insurance is available from a limited number of insurers and may not continue to be available or, if available, may not be obtainable on terms acceptable to us.
severe weather could result in significant business interruptions and expenditures. severe weather conditions and other natural phenomena, including hurricanes, floods, fires, and earthquakes, may cause significant business interruptions and result in increased costs, increased liabilities, and decreased revenues.
we may be affected by terrorism or war. any terrorist attack, or other similar event, any government response thereto, and war or risk of war could cause significant business interruption. because we play a critical role in the nation's transportation system, we could become the target of such an attack or have a significant role in the government's preemptive approach or response to an attack or war.
k 12
although we currently maintain insurance coverage for third-party liability arising out of war and acts of terrorism, we maintain only limited insurance coverage for first-party property damage and damage to property in our care, custody, or control caused by certain acts of terrorism. in addition, premiums for some or all of our current insurance programs covering these losses could increase dramatically, or insurance coverage for certain losses could be unavailable to us in the future.
we may be affected by supply constraints resulting from disruptions in the fuel markets or the nature of some of our supplier markets. we consumed approximately 458 million gallons of diesel fuel in 2017. fuel availability could be affected by any limitation in the fuel supply or by any imposition of mandatory allocation or rationing regulations. a severe fuel supply shortage arising from production curtailments, increased demand in existing or emerging foreign markets, disruption of oil imports, disruption of domestic refinery production, damage to refinery or pipeline infrastructure, political unrest, war or other factors could impact us as well as our customers and other transportation companies.
due to the capital intensive nature, as well as the industry-specific requirements of the rail industry, high barriers of entry exist for potential new suppliers of core railroad items, such as locomotives and rolling stock equipment. additionally, we compete with other industries for available capacity and raw materials used in the production of locomotives and certain track and rolling stock materials. changes in the competitive landscapes of these limited supplier markets could result in increased prices or significant shortages of materials.
the state of capital markets could adversely affect our liquidity. we rely on the capital markets to provide some of our capital requirements, including the issuance of debt instruments, as well as the sale of certain receivables. significant instability or disruptions of the capital markets, including the credit markets, or deterioration of our financial condition due to internal or external factors could restrict or eliminate our access to, and/or significantly increase the cost of, various financing sources, including bank credit facilities and issuance of corporate bonds. instability or disruptions of the capital markets and deterioration of our financial condition, alone or in combination, could also result in a reduction in our credit rating to below investment grade, which could prohibit or restrict us from accessing external sources of short- and long-term debt financing and/or significantly increase the associated costs.
item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations norfolk southern corporation and subsidiaries the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes.
overview we are one of the nation's premier transportation companies.  our norfolk southern railway company subsidiary operates approximately 19,500 miles of road in 22 states and the district of columbia, serves every major container port in the eastern united states, and provides efficient connections to other rail carriers.  we operate the most extensive intermodal network in the east and are a major transporter of coal, automotive and industrial products.
throughout 2017 we further pursued our strategic plan, focused on a balanced approach of growth, increasing efficiency, and delivering a strong customer service product. we achieved a record-setting railway operating ratio for the year (a measure of the amount of operating revenues consumed by operating expenses) and delivered approximately $150 million of productivity savings, the direct result of our commitment to achieving the targets set forth in our plan. operational leverage allowed us to grow our business by providing a competitive service product to our customers while simultaneously driving productivity.
in 2018, we will continue to implement our balanced, dynamic strategic plan. we remain committed to consistently providing high levels of rail service and increasing the efficiency of our resources, thereby generating higher returns on capital and increasing shareholder value.

on december 22, 2017, the tax cuts and jobs act ("tax reform") was signed into law. for more information on the impact of tax reform, see note 3. as a result of the enactment of this law, "purchased services and rents" includes a $151 million benefit and "income taxes" includes a $3,331 million benefit, which added $3,482 million to "net income" and $12.00 to "diluted earnings per share." the operating ratio was favorably impacted by 1.4 percentage points.
the following table adjusts our gaap financial results to exclude the effects of tax reform (specifically, the effects of remeasurement of net deferred tax liabilities related to the reduction of the federal tax rate from 35% to 21%). we use these non-gaap financial measures internally and believe this information provides useful supplemental information to investors to facilitate making period-to-period comparisons by excluding the effects of tax reform. while we believe that these non-gaap financial measures are useful in evaluating our business, this information should be considered as supplemental in nature and is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with gaap. in addition, these non-gaap financial measures may not be the same as similar measures presented by other companies.

the increases in net income for both comparisons resulted from higher income from railway operations. for 2017, a 7% increase in revenues was partially offset by a 4% rise in adjusted operating expenses. for 2016, an 11% decline in operating expenses more than offset a 6% decrease in revenues. the higher percentage increases in diluted earnings per share compared with the percentage increases in net income for both years was largely the result of our share repurchase program.

revenues increased $663 million in 2017, following a $623 million decline in 2016. as reflected in the table below, the rise in 2017 was largely the result of increased volume, particularly in our coal and intermodal markets, coupled with pricing gains. the decline in 2016 reflected lower revenue per unit, the effects of reduced fuel surcharges and changes in traffic mix, which more than offset price increases, as well as lower volume, primarily driven by reductions in energy-related markets and the restructuring of our triple crown services (tcs) subsidiary.

most of our contracts include negotiated fuel surcharges, typically tied to either west texas intermediate crude oil (wti) or on-highway diesel (ohd). approximately 90% of our revenue base is covered by these negotiated fuel surcharges, with about two-thirds tied to ohd. for both 2017 and 2016, contracts tied to ohd accounted for about 90% of our fuel surcharge revenue, as oil price levels were below most of our surcharge trigger points in contracts tied to wti. revenues associated with fuel surcharges totaled $359 million, $236 million, and $477 million in 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively.
merchandise revenues increased in 2017, but decreased in 2016, compared with the years before. in 2017, the growth was a result of higher average revenue per unit, driven by pricing gains. volume was relatively flat compared to the prior year, as gains in the metals and construction group were offset by declines in automotive, agriculture, and chemicals traffic. in 2016, the effects of lower volume were offset in part by a slight increase in average revenue per unit. price increases were tempered by reduced fuel surcharge revenues and unfavorable changes in traffic mix.
for 2018, merchandise revenues are expected to increase, primarily the result of pricing gains and higher fuel surcharge revenues.
chemicals revenues were modestly higher in 2017, following a decline in 2016. the increase in 2017 was due to higher average revenue per unit, a result of favorable mix and price improvements, which outweighed declines in volume. both periods reflected fewer shipments of crude oil from the bakken oil fields, and 2017 reflected lower shipments of coal ash; in both periods, these reductions were partially offset by more shipments of plastics. the 2016 volume decline also reflected lower chlor-alkali and rock salt traffic, the result of market consolidations and softened demand. the 2016 volume decrease was offset in part by higher average revenue per unit, due to favorable mix as increased volumes of higher-rated plastics more than offset reduced fuel surcharge revenues.
for 2018, chemicals revenues are anticipated to increase, as average revenue per unit is expected to be higher, the effect of favorable mix influenced by increased volumes of higher-rated plastics and organic chemicals, as well as, overall pricing gains. we expect carload declines of liquefied petroleum gas to be offset by gains in plastics, industrial chemicals, and crude oil.
one of our chemical customers, sunbelt chlor alkali partnerships (sunbelt), filed in 2011 a rate reasonableness complaint before the stb alleging that our tariff rates for transportation of regulated movements are unreasonable. since april 1, 2011, we have been billing and collecting amounts based on the challenged tariff rates. in 2014, the k 20
stb resolved this rate reasonableness complaint in our favor and in june 2016, the stb resolved petitions for reconsideration. the matter remains decided in our favor; however, the findings are still subject to appeal. we believe the estimate of any reasonably possible loss will not have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations, or liquidity.
agriculture, consumer products, and government revenues were flat in 2017 after rising in 2016. in 2017, lower traffic volume was offset by higher revenue per unit, driven by pricing gains. volume declines in ethanol and soybeans, reflecting reduced market demand, more than offset increases in fertilizer. the improvement in 2016 was driven by higher average revenue per unit, primarily the result of pricing gains, offset in part by lower fuel surcharge revenues. volumes decreased in 2016, driven by weaker demand for feed shipments and the effects of customer sourcing changes on corn volumes, offset in part by an increase in soybean export shipments and higher food oil volumes driven by service improvements.
for 2018, agriculture, consumer products, and government revenues are expected to increase, driven by more shipments of ethanol, corn and feed products, and by increased average revenue per unit, primarily a result of pricing gains.
metals and construction revenues rose in both periods, reflecting higher traffic volume and, for 2017, higher average revenue per unit. in 2017, volume growth was a result of more frac sand shipments for use in natural gas drilling in the marcellus and utica regions and more iron and steel shipments driven by continued improvement in construction activity. these increases were partially offset by a decline in coil steel traffic due to customer sourcing changes. revenue per unit growth in 2017 was driven by favorable changes in traffic mix. the volume increase in 2016 was driven by higher demand for aggregates and iron and steel shipments, and more coil steel traffic due to customer sourcing changes. these increases were offset in part by lower demand for materials used in natural gas and oil drilling as a result of depressed commodity prices. average revenue per unit declined in 2016, driven by lower fuel surcharge revenues and changes in traffic mix.
for 2018, metals and construction revenues are expected to rise, primarily driven by increased revenue per unit, a result of pricing gains and positive mix. traffic volume growth should result from the continued rise in frac sand shipments in addition to more shipments of steel related products.
automotive revenues fell in 2017, but rose in 2016. the decline in 2017 was driven mainly by decreases in u.s. light vehicle production, as well as temporary shutdowns for retooling of several ns-served facilities. average revenue per unit increased for the year, driven by pricing gains and higher fuel surcharge revenue. in 2016, volumes increased as a result of higher automotive parts shipments and growth in the production of u.s. light vehicles. lower fuel surcharge revenues offset in part by pricing gains drove the decrease in average revenue per unit in 2016.
for 2018, automotive revenues are expected to increase as a result of higher revenue per unit driven by price increases and higher fuel surcharge, partially offset by volume declines due to reduced customer demand.
paper, clay and forest products revenues rose in 2017 following a decline in 2016. the increase in 2017 was due to higher revenue per unit, a result of pricing gains and changes in the traffic mix. traffic was flat for the year as increases in waste and pulp shipments were offset by continued losses in woodchip volume due to customer sourcing changes. the decline in 2016 reflected volume decreases in our pulpboard and woodchip markets due to customer sourcing changes, in addition to lower paper shipments as a result of decreased demand and further contraction of the paper market. average revenue per unit increased in 2016 driven by pricing gains, offset in part by lower fuel surcharge revenues.
for 2018, paper, clay, and forest products revenues are anticipated to increase, reflecting pricing gains and increased volume, driven by growth in pulpboard as a result of tightening truck capacity, lumber due to more construction activity, and our miscellaneous waste markets. these increases may be partially offset by weaker export demand for kaolin shipments, and further contraction of the paper market.
k 21
intermodal revenues increased in 2017, but declined in 2016, compared to the prior years. the 2017 increase resulted from higher traffic volume and higher average revenue per unit, driven by fuel surcharge revenue and pricing gains. the decline in 2016 was due to lower average revenue per unit that more than offset a small volume increase. reduced fuel surcharge revenues and the effects of the tcs subsidiary restructuring (which together lowered average revenue per unit $57) offset the effects of price increases.
for 2018, we expect higher intermodal revenues due to increased average revenue per unit, driven by higher fuel surcharge revenues and rate increases, as well as, higher volumes.

total domestic volume increased in 2017, but decreased 2016, a result of the restructuring of our tcs subsidiary which decreased overall domestic volume. domestic volumes in both years benefitted from continued highway conversions and growth from new and existing accounts.
for 2018, we expect higher domestic volumes driven by strong demand due to favorable economic conditions combined with continued highway conversions.
international volume increased in both years reflecting increased demand from existing customers and market share gains.
for 2018, we expect continued growth in our international volume largely driven by more traffic from both new and existing customers.
coal revenues increased in 2017, but decreased in 2016, compared with the prior years. the increase in 2017 was a result of higher volume, primarily in the export market, and higher revenue per unit, driven by fuel surcharge revenue and pricing gains. the 2016 decline was a result of lower carload volumes across all markets and decreased average revenue per unit, primarily due to reduced fuel surcharge revenues that lowered average revenue per unit by $34 in 2016.
for 2018, coal revenues are expected to decline, driven by lower export and utility volumes, in addition to decreased revenue per unit, primarily the result of lower pricing in our export market.

utility coal tonnage increased in 2017, driven by market share gains. both years were affected by limited coal burn due to milder weather and sustained lower natural gas prices. the decline in 2016 was additionally impacted by residual customer stockpile overhang.
for 2018, we expect utility tonnage to decrease, the result of continued pressure from natural gas prices and new renewable and natural gas capacity.
export coal tonnage grew significantly in 2017 as continued tightening of international coal supply drove incremental production increases and higher demand for u.s. coal. in 2016, the decrease was a result of strong competition faced by u.s. coal suppliers as excess coal supply, weak seaborne coal prices, and a strong u.s. dollar reduced demand. volume through norfolk was up 5.5 million tons, or 57%, in 2017, following a drop of 1.7 million tons, or 15%, in 2016. volume through baltimore was up 6.4 million tons, or 129%, in 2017 and was up slightly in 2016.
for 2018, we expect export coal tonnage to decrease due to expected contraction of the elevated 2017 market.
domestic metallurgical coal tonnage was up in 2017, but down in 2016. in 2017, the increase was a result of market share gains while the 2016 decline was largely driven by softness in the metallurgical market.
for 2018, domestic metallurgical coal tonnage is expected to remain relatively flat year-over-year.
industrial coal tonnage decreased in both years, a result of plant outages, natural gas conversions and decreased coal burn.
for 2018, industrial coal tonnage is expected to increase driven by increased customer demand, but will continue to face pressure due to natural gas conversions and customer sourcing changes.

in 2017, we experienced an overall increase in expense compared to the prior year, reflecting higher fuel expense, incentive compensation, inflationary increases, and volume-related costs, partially offset by improved productivity and increased equity in earnings of certain investees as a result of the enactment of tax reform. in 2016, expenses were lower across all categories driven largely from cost-control initiatives, lower fuel expense, the absence of restructuring costs incurred in 2015, and service improvements.
compensation and benefits increased in 2017, reflecting changes in:
•   incentive and stock-based compensation (up $125 million)
•   higher health and welfare benefit rates for agreement employees (up $62 million),
•   pay rates (up $43 million),
•   increased overtime (up $24 million), and
•   employment levels (down $81 million).
in 2016, compensation and benefits decreased, a result of changes in:
•   employment levels, including overtime and trainees (down $184 million),
•   pension costs (down $38 million),
•   payroll taxes (down $27 million),
•   labor agreement payments in 2015 ($24 million),
•   pay rates (up $34 million),
•   health and welfare benefit costs for agreement employees (up $35 million), which reflected higher rates, offset in part by favorability from reduced headcount, and
•   bonus accruals (up $59 million).

the remaining increase in purchased services expense was a result of higher intermodal volume-related costs. the 2016 decrease reflected lower tcs operational costs, reduced repair and maintenance expenses, and decreased transportation activity costs, offset in part by higher intermodal volume-related costs.
equipment rents, which includes our cost of using equipment (mostly freight cars) owned by other railroads or private owners less the rent paid to us for the use of our equipment, decreased in both 2017 and 2016. in 2017, in addition to the effects of tax reform, the decline was a result of lower automotive volume. in 2016, the decrease was largely from improved network velocity, partly offset by higher rates and conventional intermodal volumes.
fuel expense, which includes the cost of locomotive fuel as well as other fuel used in railway operations, increased in 2017, but decreased in 2016. the change in both years was principally due to locomotive fuel prices (up 22% in 2017 and down 18% in 2016). locomotive fuel consumption decreased 1% in 2017 despite an increase in volume of 5% and declined 5% in 2016 with a volume decrease of 3%, both the direct result of our strategic initiative to increase fuel efficiency. we consumed approximately 458 million gallons of diesel fuel in 2017, compared with 462 million gallons in 2016 and 487 million gallons in 2015.
depreciation expense increased in 2017, but decreased in 2016. both periods reflect growth in our roadway and equipment capital base as we continue to invest in our infrastructure and rolling stock. in 2016, the decrease was a result of the effects of $63 million in accelerated depreciation related to the tcs restructuring in 2015.
materials and other expenses decreased in both periods as shown in the following table.

casualties and other claims expenses include the estimates of costs related to personal injury, property damage, and environmental matters. the decrease in 2017 was the result of lower loss and damage, offset in part by unfavorable developments in personal injury cases. the increase in 2016 was primarily driven by higher derailment expenses.
both declines in other expenses reflected more gains from the sale of operating properties (up $42 million in 2017 and $37 million in 2016). the 2016 decline was also driven by the absence of expenses that occurred in 2015 for relocating employees in connection with the closure of our roanoke, virginia office.
income taxes income taxes in 2017 includes a benefit of $3,331 million related to the effects of the enactment of tax reform from the reduction in our net deferred tax liabilities driven by the change in the federal rate. our tax benefit on 2017 income resulted in an effective rate of negative 72.8%, which includes negative 106.5% related to tax reform, compared with 35.4% in 2016 and 36.3% in 2015. both 2017 and 2016 benefited from favorable tax benefits associated with stock-based compensation and higher returns from corporate-owned life insurance. the 2016 and 2015 years also benefited from favorable reductions in deferred taxes for state tax law changes and certain business tax credits.
we expect our effective tax rate to approximate 24% on a go-forward basis. in addition, we expect cash paid for income taxes to be approximately 25% lower than 2017 levels, which is less than the percentage decline in the effective rate, as 2017 benefited from accelerated tax deductions related to our two debt exchanges (see note 8).
financial condition, liquidity, and capital resources cash provided by operating activities, our principal source of liquidity, was $3.3 billion in 2017, $3.0 billion in 2016, and $2.9 billion in 2015. the increases in both 2017 and 2016 were primarily the result of improved operating results. we had working capital deficits of $396 million and $48 million at december 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. cash and cash equivalents totaled $690 million and $956 million at december 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. we expect cash on hand combined with cash provided by operating activities will be sufficient to meet our ongoing obligations.

off balance sheet arrangements consist of obligations related to operating leases, which are included in the table of contractual obligations above and disclosed in note 9.
cash used in investing activities was $1.5 billion in 2017, compared with $1.8 billion in 2016, and $2.1 billion in 2015.  both year-over-year comparisons reflected lower cash outflows for property additions. a decline in corporate-owned life insurance investments additionally impacted 2017. the decrease in 2016 is also a reflection of lower proceeds from corporate-owned life insurance investments.
capital spending and track and equipment statistics can be found within the "railway property" section of part i of this report on form 10-k. for 2018, we expect capital spending to total $1.8 billion.
cash used in financing activities was $2.0 billion in 2017, compared with $1.3 billion in 2016, and $693 million in 2015.  both year-over-year comparisons reflected lower debt proceeds. in 2017, the rise was further affected by increased repurchases of common stock. contributing to the increase in 2016 were higher debt repayments, partially offset by lower repurchases of common stock.
share repurchases totaled $1.0 billion in 2017, $803 million in 2016, and $1.1 billion in 2015 for the purchase and retirement of 8.2 million, 9.2 million, and 11.3 million shares, respectively.  on september 26, 2017, our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to an additional 50 million shares of common stock through december 31, 2022. as of december 31, 2017, 56.5 million shares remain authorized for repurchase.  the timing and volume of future share repurchases will be guided by our assessment of market conditions and other pertinent factors.  any near-term purchases under the program are expected to be made with internally generated cash, cash on hand, or proceeds from borrowings.
in may of 2017, we issued $300 million of 3.15% senior notes due 2027. in august of 2017, we issued $750 million of 4.05% senior notes due 2052 as part of a debt exchange for $551 million of previously issued notes. in november of 2017, we issued $750 million of senior notes at 3.94% due 2047 and paid $52 million of premium in exchange for $613 million of previously issued notes (see note 8).
we discuss our credit agreement and our accounts receivable securitization program in note 8, and we have authority from our board of directors to issue an additional $1.2 billion of debt or equity securities through public or private sale, all of which provide for access to additional liquidity should the need arise. our debt-to-total capitalization ratio was 37.5% at december 31, 2017, compared with 45.1% at december 31, 2016.
upcoming annual debt maturities are disclosed in note 8.  overall, our goal is to maintain a capital structure with appropriate leverage to support our business strategy and provide flexibility through business cycles.
application of critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period.  these estimates and assumptions may require significant judgment about matters that are inherently uncertain, and future events are likely to occur that may require us to make changes to these estimates and assumptions.  accordingly, we regularly review these estimates and assumptions based on historical experience, changes in the business environment, and other factors we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances.  the following critical accounting policies are a subset of our significant accounting policies described in note 1.
k 27
pensions and other postretirement benefits accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefit plans requires us to make several estimates and assumptions (note 11).  these include the expected rate of return from investment of the plans' assets and the expected retirement age of employees as well as their projected earnings and mortality.  in addition, the amounts recorded are affected by changes in the interest rate environment because the associated liabilities are discounted to their present value.  we make these estimates based on our historical experience and other information that we deem pertinent under the circumstances (for example, expectations of future stock market performance).  we utilize an independent actuarial consulting firm's studies to assist us in selecting appropriate actuarial assumptions and valuing related liabilities.
in recording our net pension benefit, we assumed a long-term investment rate of return of 8.25%, which was supported by the long-term total rate of return on plan assets since inception, as well as our expectation of future returns. a one-percentage point change to this rate of return assumption would result in a $22 million change in pension expense. we review assumptions related to our defined benefit plans annually, and while changes are likely to occur in assumptions concerning retirement age, projected earnings, and mortality, they are not expected to have a material effect on our net pension expense or net pension liability in the future. the net pension liability is recorded at net present value using discount rates that are based on the current interest rate environment in light of the timing of expected benefit payments.  we utilize analyses in which the projected annual cash flows from the pension and postretirement benefit plans are matched with yield curves based on an appropriate universe of high-quality corporate bonds.  we use the results of the yield curve analyses to select the discount rates that match the payment streams of the benefits in these plans.
properties and depreciation most of our assets are long-lived railway properties (note 6).  as disclosed in note 1, the primary depreciation method for our asset base is group life.  see note 1 for a more detailed discussion of the assumptions and estimates in this area.
depreciation expense for 2017 totaled $1.1 billion.  our composite depreciation rates for 2017 are disclosed in note 6; a one-tenth percentage point increase (or decrease) in these rates would have resulted in a $40 million increase (or decrease) to depreciation expense.  for 2017, roadway depreciation rates ranged from 0.83% to 29.12% and equipment depreciation rates ranged from 1.38% to 33%.
personal injury casualties and other claims expense, included in "materials and other" in the consolidated statements of income, includes our accrual for personal injury liabilities.
to aid in valuing our personal injury liability and determining the amount to accrue with respect to such claims during the year, we utilize studies prepared by an independent consulting actuarial firm. the actuarial firm studies our historical patterns of reserving for claims and subsequent settlements, taking into account relevant outside influences. we adjust the liability quarterly based upon our assessment and the results of the study. our estimate is subject to inherent limitation given the difficulty of predicting future events and as such the ultimate loss sustained may vary from the estimated liability recorded.
for a more detailed discussion of the assumptions and estimates in accounting for personal injury see note 16.
income taxes our net deferred tax liability totaled $6.3 billion at december 31, 2017 (note 3).  this liability is estimated based on the expected future tax consequences of items recognized in the financial statements.  after application of the k 28
federal statutory tax rate to book income, judgment is required with respect to the timing and deductibility of expenses in our income tax returns.  for state income and other taxes, judgment is also required with respect to the apportionment among the various jurisdictions. a valuation allowance is recorded if we expect that it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will not be realized. we have a $44 million valuation allowance on $366 million of deferred tax assets as of december 31, 2017, reflecting the expectation that almost all of these assets will be realized. see discussion of tax reform in note 3.
other matters labor agreements approximately 80% of our railroad employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements with various labor unions.  pursuant to the railway labor act, these agreements remain in effect until new agreements are reached, or until the bargaining procedures mandated by the railway labor act are completed.  we largely bargain nationally in concert with other major railroads, represented by the national carriers conference committee (nccc).  moratorium provisions in the labor agreements govern when the railroads and unions may propose changes to the agreements.
beginning in late 2014, the nccc and the various unions exchanged new proposals to begin the current round of national negotiations.  the unions formed three separate bargaining coalitions and the nccc has reached agreements with 2 of these coalitions representing 10 separate unions and approximately 80% of the unionized workforce. some of these agreements (applicable to approximately 10% of the unionized workforce) are still pending ratification by the union membership while the rest have already been ratified and are now final. negotiations with the other coalition is ongoing with the assistance of mediators from the national mediation board.  in accordance with the railway labor act, current agreements will remain in effect during the statutory bargaining process. separately, ns has reached agreement covering wages and work rules through 2019 with the brotherhood of locomotive engineers and trainmen (blet), which represents approximately 4,600 ns engineers.
market risks we manage overall exposure to fluctuations in interest rates by issuing both fixed- and floating-rate debt instruments. at december 31, 2017, debt subject to interest rate fluctuations totaled $100 million. a one-percentage point increase in interest rates would increase total annual interest expense related to all variable debt by approximately $1 million. we consider it unlikely that interest rate fluctuations applicable to these instruments will result in a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or liquidity.
new accounting pronouncements for a detailed discussion of new accounting pronouncements, see note 1.
inflation in preparing financial statements, gaap requires the use of historical cost that disregards the effects of inflation on the replacement cost of property.  as a capital-intensive company, we have most of our capital invested in long-lived assets.  the replacement cost of these assets, as well as the related depreciation expense, would be substantially greater than the amounts reported on the basis of historical cost.

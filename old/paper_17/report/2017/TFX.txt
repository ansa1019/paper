item 1a.    risk factors in addition to the other information set forth in this annual report on form 10-k, you should carefully consider the following factors which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or stock price. the risks below are not the only risks we face. additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or stock price.
we face strong competition. our failure to successfully develop and market new products could adversely affect our business.
the medical device industry is highly competitive. we compete with many domestic and foreign medical device companies ranging from small start-up enterprises that might sell only a single or limited number of competitive products or compete only in a specific market segment, to companies that are larger and more established than us, have a broad range of competitive products, participate in numerous markets and have access to significantly greater financial and marketing resources than we do.
in addition, the medical device industry is characterized by extensive product research and development and rapid technological advances. the future success of our business will depend, in part, on our ability to design and manufacture new competitive products and enhance existing products. our product development efforts may require us to make substantial investments. there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully develop new products, enhance existing products or achieve market acceptance of our products, due to, among other things, our inability to:
•   identify viable new products;
16
•   maintain sufficient liquidity to fund our investments in research and development and product acquisitions;
•   obtain adequate intellectual property protection;
•   gain market acceptance of new products; or
•   successfully obtain regulatory approvals.
in addition, our competitors currently may be developing, or may develop in the future, products that provide better features, clinical outcomes or economic value than those that we currently offer or subsequently develop. our failure to successfully develop and market new products or enhance existing products could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
our customers depend on third party coverage and reimbursements, and the failure of healthcare programs to provide sufficient coverage and reimbursement for our medical products could adversely affect us.
the ability of our customers to obtain coverage and reimbursement for our products is important to our business. demand for many of our existing and new medical products is, and will continue to be, affected by the extent to which government healthcare programs and private health insurers reimburse our customers for patients' medical expenses in the countries where we do business. even when we develop or acquire a promising new product, demand for the product may be limited unless reimbursement approval is obtained from private and government third party payors. internationally, healthcare reimbursement systems vary significantly. in some countries, medical centers are constrained by fixed budgets, regardless of the volume and nature of patient treatment. other countries require application for, and approval of, government or third party reimbursement. without both favorable coverage determinations by, and the financial support of, government and third party insurers, the market for many of our medical products would be adversely affected. in this regard, we cannot be sure that third party payors will maintain the current level of coverage and reimbursement to our customers for use of our existing products. adverse coverage determinations, including reductions in the amount of reimbursement, could harm our business by discouraging customers' selection of our products and reducing the prices they are willing to pay.
in addition, as a result of their purchasing power, third party payors are implementing cost cutting measures such as seeking discounts, price reductions or other incentives from medical products suppliers and imposing limitations on coverage and reimbursement for medical technologies and procedures. these trends could compel us to reduce prices for our products and could cause a decrease in the size of the market or a potential increase in competition that could negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
we may not be successful in achieving expected operating efficiencies and sustaining or improving operating expense reductions, and may experience business disruptions associated with restructuring, facility consolidations, realignment, cost reduction and other strategic initiatives.
over the past several years we have implemented a number of restructuring, realignment and cost reduction initiatives, including facility consolidations, organizational realignments and reductions in our workforce, and we may engage in similar efforts in the future. while we have realized some efficiencies from these initiatives, we may not realize the benefits of these or future initiatives to the extent we anticipated. further, such benefits may be realized later than expected, and the ongoing difficulties in implementing these measures may be greater than anticipated, which could cause us to incur additional costs or result in business disruptions. in addition, if these measures are not successful or sustainable, we may be compelled to undertake additional restructuring, realignment and cost reduction efforts, which could result in significant additional charges. moreover, if our restructuring, realignment and cost reduction efforts prove ineffective, our ability to achieve our other strategic and business plan goals may be adversely affected.
in addition, as part of our efforts to increase operating efficiencies, we have implemented a number of initiatives over the past several years to consolidate our enterprise resource planning, or erp, systems. to date, we have not experienced any significant disruptions to our business or operations in connection with these initiatives. however, as we continue our efforts to further consolidate our erp systems, we could experience business disruptions, which could adversely affect customer relationships and divert the attention of management away from daily operations. in addition, any delays in the implementation of these initiatives could cause us to incur additional unexpected costs. should we experience such difficulties, our business, cash flows and results of operations could be adversely affected.
17
a significant portion of our united states revenues is derived from sales to distributors, and "destocking" activity by these distributors can adversely affect our revenues and results of operations.
a significant portion of our revenues in the united states is derived from sales to distributors, who, in turn, sell our products to hospitals and other health care institutions. from time to time, these distributors may decide to reduce their levels of inventory with regard to certain of our products, a practice we refer to as "destocking." a distributor's decision to reduce inventory levels with respect to our products may be based on a number of factors, such as distributor expectations regarding demand for a particular product, distributor buying decisions (including decisions to purchase competing products), changes in distributor policies regarding the maintenance of inventory levels, economic conditions and other factors. for example, during the third quarter of 2016, we experienced a decline in purchases by our united states distributors that adversely affected our revenues and results of operations. we believe the reduction resulted from the distributors' expectations of a less severe 2016-2017 flu season, which resulted in reduced levels of purchasing with respect to certain of our products that are used for treatment of hospitalized patients suffering from the flu. following such instances of reduced purchases, distributors may revert to previous purchasing levels; nevertheless, we cannot assure that distributors will, in fact, increase purchases of our products in this manner. a decline in the level of product purchases by our united states distributors in the future could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations during a reporting period, and an extended decline in such product purchases could have a longer term material adverse effect.
we are subject to extensive government regulation, which may require us to incur significant expenses to ensure compliance. our failure to comply with those regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
our products are classified as medical devices and are subject to extensive regulation in the united states by the fda and by comparable government agencies in other countries. the regulations govern, among other things, the development, design, approval, manufacturing, labeling, importing and exporting and sale and marketing of many of our products. moreover, these regulations are subject to future change.
in the united states, before we can market a new medical device, or a new use of, or claim for, or significant modification to, an existing product, we generally must first receive either 510(k) or de novo clearance or approval of a premarket approval application, or pma, from the fda. similarly, most major markets for medical devices outside the united states also require clearance, approval or compliance with certain standards before a product can be commercially marketed. the process of obtaining regulatory clearances and approvals to market a medical device, particularly from the fda and certain foreign government authorities, can be costly and time consuming, and clearances and approvals might not be granted for new products on a timely basis, if at all. in addition, once a device has been cleared or approved, a new clearance or approval may be required before the device may be modified or its labeling changed. furthermore, the fda or a foreign government authority may make its review and clearance or approval process more rigorous, which could require us to generate additional clinical or other data, and expend more time and effort, in obtaining future product clearances or approvals. the regulatory clearance and approval process may result in, among other things, delayed realization of product revenues, substantial additional costs or limitations on indicated uses of products, any one of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. even after a product has received marketing approval or clearance, such product approval or clearance can be withdrawn or limited due to unforeseen problems with the device or issues relating to its application.
failure to comply with applicable regulations could lead to adverse effects on our business, which could include:
•   partial suspension or total shutdown of manufacturing;
•   product shortages;
•   delays in product manufacturing;
•   warning or untitled letters;
•   fines or civil penalties;
•   delays in obtaining new regulatory clearances or approvals;
•   withdrawal or suspension of required clearances, approvals or licenses;
•   product seizures or recalls;
•   injunctions;
•   criminal prosecution;
18
•   advisories or other field actions;
•   operating restrictions; and
•   prohibitions against exporting of products to, or importing products from, countries outside the united states.
we could be required to expend significant financial and human resources to remediate failures to comply with applicable regulations and quality assurance guidelines. in addition, civil and criminal penalties, including exclusion under medicaid or medicare, could result from regulatory violations. any one or more of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
medical devices are cleared or approved for one or more specific intended uses and performance claims must be adequately substantiated. promoting a device for an off-label use or making misleading or unsubstantiated claims could result in government enforcement action.
furthermore, our facilities are subject to periodic inspection by the fda and other federal, state and foreign government authorities, which require manufacturers of medical devices to adhere to certain regulations, including the fda's quality system regulation, which requires periodic audits, design controls, quality control testing and documentation procedures, as well as complaint evaluations and investigation. in addition, any facilities assembling convenience kits that include drug components and are registered as drug repackaging establishments are also subject to current good manufacturing practices requirements for drugs. the fda also requires the reporting of certain adverse events and product malfunctions and may require the reporting of recalls or other field safety corrective actions. issues identified through such inspections and reports may result in fda enforcement action through any of the actions discussed above. moreover, issues identified through such inspections and reports may require significant resources to resolve.
we are subject to healthcare fraud and abuse laws, regulation and enforcement; our failure to comply with those laws could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
we are subject to healthcare fraud and abuse regulation and enforcement by the federal government and the governments of those states and foreign countries in which we conduct our business. the laws that may affect our ability to operate include:
•   the federal healthcare anti-kickback statute, which, among other things, prohibits persons from knowingly and willfully offering or paying remuneration to induce either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs such as medicare and medicaid, or soliciting payment for such referrals, purchases, orders and recommendations;
•   federal false claims laws which, among other things, prohibit individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, false or fraudulent claims for payment from the federal government, including medicare, medicaid or other third-party payors;
•   the federal health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 ("hipaa"), which prohibits schemes to defraud any healthcare benefit program and false statements relating to healthcare matters; and
•   state law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers.
if our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other government regulations, we may be subject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, the exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs and imprisonment of personnel, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results. the risk of our being found to have violated these laws is increased by the fact that many of them have not been fully interpreted by the regulatory authorities or the courts, and their provisions are open to a variety of interpretations.
further, the patient protection and affordable care act, as amended by the health care and education reconciliation act (collectively, the "affordable care act"), imposed annual reporting and disclosure requirements on device manufacturers for any "transfer of value" made or distributed to physicians or teaching hospitals. the reported information is made publicly available in a searchable format. in addition, device manufacturers are required to report and disclose any investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members during the preceding calendar year. failure to submit required information may result in civil monetary penalties for each payment, transfer
19
of value or ownership or investment interests not reported in an annual submission, up to an aggregate of $150,000 per year (and up to an aggregate of $1 million per year for "knowing failures").
in addition, there has been a recent trend of increased federal and state regulation of payments made to healthcare providers. some states, such as california, connecticut, nevada and massachusetts, mandate implementation of compliance programs that include the tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation for consulting and other services, and other remuneration to healthcare providers. the shifting commercial compliance environment and the need to build and maintain robust and expandable systems to comply with the different compliance and/or reporting requirements among a number of jurisdictions increases the possibility that we may inadvertently violate one or more of the requirements, resulting in increased compliance costs that could adversely impact our results of operations.
we may incur material losses and costs as a result of product liability and warranty claims, as well as product recalls, any of which may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. furthermore, our reputation as a medical device company may be damaged if one or more of our products are, or are alleged to be, defective.
our businesses expose us to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the design, manufacture and marketing of our products. in particular, our medical device products are often used in surgical and intensive care settings for procedures involving seriously ill patients. in addition, many of our products are designed to be implanted in the human body for varying periods of time. product defects or inadequate disclosure of product-related risks with respect to products we manufacture or sell could result in patient injury or death. in addition, in connection with the divestitures of our former non-medical businesses, we agreed to retain certain liabilities related to those businesses, which include, among other things, liability for products manufactured prior to the date on which we completed the sale of the business. product liability and warranty claims often involve very large or indeterminate amounts, including punitive damages. the magnitude of potential losses from product liability lawsuits may remain unknown for substantial periods of time, and the related legal defense costs may be significant. we could experience material warranty or product liability losses in the future and incur significant costs to defend these claims.
in addition, if any of our products are, or are alleged to be, defective, we may voluntarily participate, or be required by regulatory authorities to participate, in a recall of that product. in the event of a recall, we may lose sales and be exposed to individual or class-action litigation claims. moreover, negative publicity regarding a quality or safety issue, whether accurate or inaccurate, could harm our reputation, decrease demand for our products, lead to product withdrawals or impair our ability to successfully launch and market our products in the future. product liability, warranty and recall costs may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
the ongoing volatility in the domestic and global financial markets, combined with a continuation of constrained global credit markets could adversely impact our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
we are subject to risks arising from adverse changes in general domestic and global economic conditions. the economic slowdown and disruption of credit markets that occurred in recent years led to recessionary conditions and depressed levels of consumer and commercial spending, resulting in reductions, delays or cancellations of purchases of our products and services. despite some improvements in recent years, economic conditions continue to cause disruption in some financial markets, resulting in, among other things, diminished liquidity and credit availability. we cannot predict the duration or extent of any economic recovery or the extent to which our customers will return to more typical spending behaviors. the continuation of the present broadly applicable economic trends of weak economic growth, constricted credit, public sector austerity measures in response to public budget deficits and foreign currency volatility, particularly with respect to the euro, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
additionally, our customers, particularly in italy, spain, portugal and greece, have extended or delayed payments for products and services already provided, which has increased our focus on collectability with respect to our accounts receivable from these customers. to date, we have not experienced an inordinate amount of payment defaults by our customers, and we have sufficient lending commitments in place to enable us to fund our foreseeable additional operating needs. however, the ongoing uncertainty in the european financial markets, combined with a continuation of constrained european credit markets creates a risk that some of our european customers and suppliers may be unable to access liquidity. as of december 31, 2017 and 2016, our aggregate net current and long term trade accounts receivable in italy, spain, portugal and greece were $49.1 million and $51.1 million, respectively. in 2017, 2016 and
20
2015, net revenues from these countries were approximately 6%, 7% and 7% of total net revenues, respectively, and average days that accounts receivable from these countries were outstanding were 154, 182 and 204 days, respectively. although we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts to cover the estimated losses which may occur when customers cannot make their required payments, we cannot assure that the loss rate will not increase in the future given the volatility in the worldwide economy. if our allowance for doubtful accounts is insufficient to address receivables we ultimately determine are uncollectible, we would be required to incur additional charges, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations. moreover, our inability to collect outstanding receivables could adversely affect our financial condition and cash flow from operations.
in addition, adverse economic and financial market conditions may result in future impairment charges with respect to our goodwill and other intangible assets, which would not directly affect our liquidity but could have a material adverse effect on our reported financial results.
our strategic initiatives, including acquisitions, may not produce the intended growth in revenue and operating income and may have material impacts on our operating results.
our strategic initiatives include making significant investments designed to achieve revenue growth and to enable us to meet or exceed margin improvement targets. if we do not achieve the expected benefits from these investments or otherwise fail to execute on our strategic initiatives, we may not achieve the growth improvement we are targeting and our results of operations may be adversely affected.
in addition, as part of our strategy for growth, we have made, and may continue to make, acquisitions and divestitures and enter into strategic alliances such as joint ventures and joint development agreements. however, we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates, complete acquisitions or integrate acquisitions successfully, and our joint ventures or strategic alliances may not prove to be successful. in this regard, acquisitions involve numerous risks, including difficulties in the integration of acquired operations, technologies, services and products and the diversion of management's attention from other business concerns. moreover, the products and technologies that we acquire may not be successful or may require us to devote significantly greater development, marketing and other resources, as well as significantly greater investments, than we anticipated. we could also experience negative effects on our results of operations and financial condition from acquisition-related charges, amortization of intangible assets, asset impairment charges and other matters that could arise in connection with the acquisition of a company or business, including matters related to internal control over financial reporting and regulatory compliance, as well as the short-term effects of increased costs on results of operations.  although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in any particular transaction, there can be no assurance that we will identify all such risks or the magnitude of the risks. in addition, prior acquisitions have resulted, and future acquisitions could result, in the incurrence of substantial additional indebtedness and expenditures. future acquisitions may also result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities. there can be no assurance that difficulties encountered in connection with acquisitions will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
in connection with certain of our completed acquisitions, we have agreed to pay consideration that is contingent upon the achievement of specified objectives, such as receipt of regulatory approval, commercialization of a product or achievement of sales targets. as of the acquisition date, we record a contingent liability representing the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration we expect to pay. as of december 31, 2017, we accrued $272.1 million of contingent consideration, of which, the vast majority related to our acquisition of neotract. on a quarterly basis, we revalue these obligations and record increases or decreases in their fair value as an adjustment to operating earnings, which could have a material impact on our results of operations. in addition, actual payments may differ materially from the amount of the contingent liability we have recorded, which could have a material impact on our cash flows and liquidity. for information regarding assumptions related to our contingent consideration liabilities, see "critical accounting policies and estimates" under item 7, management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included in this annual report on form 10-k. for additional information regarding our acquisitions, see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10-k.
health care reform may have a material adverse effect on our industry and our business.
political, economic and regulatory developments have effected fundamental changes in the healthcare industry. the affordable care act substantially changed the way health care is financed by both government and private insurers. it also encourages improvements in the quality of health care products and services and significantly impacts the united states pharmaceutical and medical device industries. among other things, the affordable care act:
21
•   established a 2.3% excise tax on sales of medical devices with respect to any entity that manufactures or imports specified medical devices offered for sale in the united states, although this tax was suspended for 2016 and 2017 as a result of the enactment of the consolidated appropriations act of 2016 and has been further suspended for 2018 and 2019 as a result of the enactment of the consolidated appropriations act of 2018;
•   established a new patient-centered outcomes research institute to oversee, identify priorities in and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research;
•   implemented payment system reforms, including a national pilot program to encourage hospitals, physicians and other providers to improve the coordination, quality and efficiency of certain health care services through bundled payment models; and
•   created an independent payment advisory board that will submit recommendations to reduce medicare spending if projected medicare spending exceeds a specified growth rate.
in 2015, we recorded an expense of $10.2 million with respect to the medical device excise tax. while, as noted above, the excise tax has been suspended through 2019,we will again be subject to the excise tax in 2020 unless the suspension is extended further. we cannot predict at this time the full impact of the affordable care act or other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. in this regard, several legislative initiatives to repeal and replace the affordable care act were proposed, but not adopted in 2017. however, the recently adopted tax cuts and jobs act eliminated the individual mandate under the affordable care act, which has resulted in increased uncertainty regarding insurance premium prices for participants in insurance exchanges under the act, and may have other effects. the longer-term viability of, or the nature of any modification of, or legislative substitution for, the affordable care act is highly uncertain, and we cannot predict the effect that any of these events would have on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
we are subject to risks associated with our non-united states operations.
we have significant manufacturing and distribution facilities, research and development facilities, sales personnel and customer support operations in a number of countries outside the united states, including belgium, the czech republic, germany, ireland, malaysia and mexico. in addition, a significant portion of our non-united states revenues are derived from sales to third party distributors. as of december 31, 2017, 75% of our full-time and temporary employees were employed in countries outside of the united states, and approximately 45% of our net property, plant and equipment was located outside the united states. in addition, for the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 approximately 42%, 46% and 47%, respectively, of our net revenues (based on the teleflex entity generating the sale) were derived from operations outside the united states.
our international operations are subject to risks inherent in doing business outside the united states, including:
•   exchange controls, currency restrictions and fluctuations in currency values;
•   trade protection measures;
•   potentially costly and burdensome import or export requirements;
•   laws and business practices that favor local companies;
•   changes in foreign medical reimbursement policies and procedures;
•   subsidies or increased access to capital for firms that currently are or may emerge as competitors in countries in which we have operations;
•   substantial foreign tax liabilities, including potentially negative consequences resulting from changes in tax laws;
•   restrictions and taxes related to the repatriation of foreign earnings;
•   differing labor regulations;
•   additional united states and foreign government controls or regulations;
•   difficulties in the protection of intellectual property; and
•   unsettled political and economic conditions and possible terrorist attacks against american interests.
in addition, the united states foreign corrupt practices act (the "fcpa") and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws in non-united states jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper
22
payments to non-united states officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. the fcpa also imposes accounting standards and requirements on publicly traded united states corporations and their foreign affiliates, which, among other things, are intended to prevent the diversion of corporate funds to the payment of bribes and other improper payments to government officials, and to prevent the establishment of "off the books" slush funds from which such improper payments can be made. because of the predominance of government-sponsored health care systems around the world, many of our customer relationships outside of the united states are with government entities and are therefore subject to such anti-bribery laws. our policies mandate compliance with these anti-bribery laws. however, we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced government corruption to some degree.  despite meaningful measures that we undertake to facilitate lawful conduct, which include training and compliance programs and internal control policies and procedures, we may not always prevent reckless or criminal acts by our employees, distributors or other agents. in addition, we may be exposed to liability due to pre-acquisition conduct of employees, distributors or other agents of businesses or operations we acquire. violations of anti-bribery laws, or allegations of such violations, could disrupt our operations, involve significant management distraction and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. we also could be subject to severe penalties and other adverse consequences, including criminal and civil penalties, disgorgement, substantial expenditures related to further enhancements to our procedures, policies and controls, personnel changes and other remedial actions, as well as harm to our reputation.
furthermore, we are subject to the export controls and economic embargo rules and regulations of the united states, including the export administration regulations and trade sanctions against embargoed countries, which are administered by the office of foreign assets control within the department of the treasury, as well as other laws and regulations administered by the department of commerce. these regulations limit our ability to market, sell, distribute or otherwise transfer our products or technology to prohibited countries or persons. while we train our employees and contractually obligate our distributors to comply with these regulations, we cannot assure that a violation will not occur, whether knowingly or inadvertently. failure to comply with these rules and regulations may result in substantial civil and criminal penalties, including fines and the disgorgement of profits, the imposition of a court-appointed monitor, the denial of export privileges and debarment from participation in united states government contracts, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our international operations or on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
foreign currency exchange rate, commodity price and interest rate fluctuations may adversely affect our results.
we are exposed to a variety of market risks, including the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices and interest rates. products manufactured in, and sold into, foreign markets represent a significant portion of our operations. our consolidated financial statements reflect translation of financial statements denominated in non-united states currencies to united states dollars, our reporting currency, as well as the foreign currency exchange gains and losses resulting from the remeasurement of assets and liabilities and from transactions denominated in currencies other than the primary currency of the country in which the entity operates, which we refer to as "non-functional currencies." a strengthening or weakening of the united states dollar in relation to the foreign currencies of the countries in which we sell or manufacture our products, such as the euro, will affect our united states dollar-reported revenue and income. although we have entered into forward contracts with several major financial institutions to hedge a portion of our monetary assets and liabilities and projected cash flows denominated in non-functional currencies in order to reduce the effects of currency rate fluctuations, changes in the relative values of currencies may, in some instances, have a significant effect on our results of operations.
many of our products have significant plastic resin content. we also use quantities of other commodities, such as aluminum and steel. increases in the prices of these commodities could increase the costs of our products and services. we may not be able to pass on these costs to our customers, particularly with respect to those products we sell under group purchase agreements, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows.
increases in interest rates may adversely affect the financial health of our customers and suppliers, thereby adversely affecting their ability to buy our products and supply the components or raw materials we need. in addition, our borrowing costs could be adversely affected if interest rates increase. any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
23
fluctuations in our effective tax rate and changes to tax laws may adversely affect us.
as a global company, we are subject to taxation in numerous countries, states and other jurisdictions. our effective tax rate is derived from a combination of applicable tax rates in the various countries, states and other jurisdictions in which we operate. in preparing our financial statements, we estimate the amount of tax that will become payable in each of these jurisdictions. our effective tax rate may, however, differ from the estimated amount due to numerous factors, including a change in the mix of our profitability from country to country and changes in tax laws (including the impact of recently enacted united states tax legislation as discussed immediately below). any of these factors could cause us to experience an effective tax rate significantly different from previous periods or our current expectations, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and cash flows.
the tax cuts and jobs act (the "tcja") was enacted on december 22, 2017. the tcja permanently reduces the united states corporate income tax rate from a maximum of 35% to 21%; puts into effect a territorial tax system, generally providing for, among other things, a dividends received deduction on the foreign source portion of dividends received from a foreign corporation if specified conditions are met; imposes a one-time repatriation tax on undistributed post-1986 earnings and profits of foreign subsidiaries, which are deemed repatriated for purposes of the tax; and creates, modifies or repeals many other statutory and regulatory provisions. our consolidated financial statements as of, and for the year ended december 31, 2017, include provisional amounts with respect to the deemed repatriated earnings and the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities. while we believe that the provisional amounts constitute reasonable estimates, we continue to examine the impact the tcja may have on our business. once our accounting for the income tax effects of the tcja is complete, the amounts with respect to the income tax effects of the tcja may differ from the provisional amounts, possibly materially, due to, among other things, additional analysis, changes in interpretations and assumptions we have made, additional regulatory guidance that may be issued, and actions we may take as a result of the tcja.
an interruption in our manufacturing or distribution operations or our supply of raw materials may adversely affect our business.
many of our key products are manufactured at or distributed from single locations, and the availability of alternate facilities is limited. if operations at one or more of our facilities is suspended due to natural disasters or other events, we may not be able to timely manufacture or distribute one or more of our products at previous levels or at all. furthermore, our ability to establish replacement facilities or to substitute suppliers may be delayed due to regulations and requirements of the fda and other regulatory authorities regarding the manufacture of our products. in addition, in the event of delays or cancellations in shipments of raw materials by our suppliers, we may not be able to timely manufacture or supply the affected products at previous levels or at all. the manufacture of our products is highly exacting and complex, due in part to strict regulatory requirements. problems in the manufacturing process, including equipment malfunction, failure to follow specific protocols and procedures, defective raw materials and environmental factors, could lead to launch delays, product shortages, unanticipated costs, lost revenues and damage to our reputation. a failure to identify and address manufacturing problems prior to the release of products to our customers may also result in quality or safety issues.  a reduction or interruption in manufacturing or distribution, or our inability to secure suitable alternative sources of raw materials or components, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
our ability to attract, train, develop and retain key employees is important to our success.
our success depends, in part, on our ability to continue to retain our key personnel, including our executive officers and other members of our senior management team. our success also depends, in part, on our ability to attract, train, develop and retain other key employees, including research and development, sales, marketing and operations personnel. we may experience difficulties in retaining executives and other employees due to many factors, including:
•   the intense competition for skilled personnel in our industry;
•   fluctuations in global economic and industry conditions;
•   changes in our organizational structure;
•   our restructuring initiatives;
•   competitors' hiring practices; and
•   the effectiveness of our compensation programs.
24
our inability to attract, train, develop and retain such personnel could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
we depend upon relationships with physicians and other health care professionals.
we depend on our ability to maintain strong working relationships with physicians and other healthcare professionals in connection with research and development for some of our products. we rely on these professionals to provide us with considerable knowledge and advice regarding the development and use of these products. physicians assist us as researchers, product consultants, inventors and public speakers. if we fail to maintain our working relationships with physicians and, as a result, no longer have the benefit of their knowledge and advice, our products may not be developed in a manner that is responsive to the needs and expectations of the professionals who use and support our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
our technology is important to our success, and our failure to protect our intellectual property rights could put us at a competitive disadvantage.
we rely on the patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws of the united states and other countries to protect our proprietary rights. although we own numerous united states and foreign patents and have submitted numerous patent applications, we cannot be assured that any pending patent applications will issue, or that any patents, issued or pending, will provide us with any competitive advantage or will not be challenged, invalidated or circumvented by third parties. in addition, we rely on confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements with employees and take other measures to protect our know-how and trade secrets. the steps we have taken may not prevent unauthorized use of our technology by competitors or other persons who may copy or otherwise obtain and use these products or technology, particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as in the united states. we cannot assure that current and former employees, contractors and other parties will not breach their confidentiality agreements with us, misappropriate proprietary information, copy or otherwise obtain and use our information and proprietary technology without authorization or otherwise infringe on our intellectual property rights. our inability to protect our proprietary technology could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. moreover, there can be no assurance that others will not independently develop know-how and trade secrets comparable to ours or develop better technology than our own, which could reduce or eliminate any competitive advantage we have developed.
our products or processes may infringe the intellectual property rights of others, which may cause us to pay unexpected litigation costs or damages or prevent us from selling our products.
we cannot be certain that our products do not and will not infringe issued patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties. we may be subject to legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of our business, including claims of alleged infringement of the intellectual property rights of third parties. any such claims, whether or not meritorious, could result in litigation and divert the efforts of our personnel. if we are found liable for infringement, we may be compelled to enter into licensing agreements (which may not be available on acceptable terms or at all) or to pay damages or cease making or selling certain products. we may need to redesign some of our products or processes to avoid future infringement liability. any of the foregoing events could be detrimental to our business.
other pending and future litigation may involve significant costs and adversely affect our business.
we are party to various lawsuits and claims arising in the normal course of business involving, among other things, contracts, intellectual property, import and export regulations, employment and environmental matters. the defense of these lawsuits may divert our management's attention, and we may incur significant expenses in defending these lawsuits. in addition, we may be required to pay damage awards or settlements, or become subject to injunctions or other equitable remedies, that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. while we do not believe that any litigation in which we are currently engaged would have such an adverse effect, the outcome of litigation, including regulatory matters, is often difficult to predict, and we cannot assure that the outcome of pending or future litigation will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
25
our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.
as of december 31, 2017, we had total consolidated indebtedness of 2.3 billion.
our substantial level of indebtedness increases the risk that we may be unable to generate cash sufficient to satisfy our debt obligations. it could also have significant effects on our business. for example, it could:
•   increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;
•   require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, research and development efforts and other general corporate purposes;
•   limit our ability to borrow additional funds for such general corporate purposes;
•   limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;
•   restrict us from pursuing business opportunities; and
•   place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less indebtedness.
if we do not generate sufficient cash flow from operations or if future borrowings are not available to us in an amount sufficient to pay our indebtedness when due or to fund our other liquidity needs, we may be forced to:
•   refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness;
•   sell assets;
•   reduce or delay capital expenditures; or
•   seek to raise additional capital.
we may not be able to effect any of these actions on commercially reasonable terms or at all. our ability to refinance our indebtedness will depend on our financial condition at the time, the restrictions in the instruments governing our outstanding indebtedness and other factors, including market conditions.
our inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt service obligations, or to refinance or restructure our obligations on commercially reasonable terms or at all, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
our debt agreements impose restrictions on our business, which could prevent us from capitalizing on business opportunities and taking some corporate actions and may adversely affect our ability to respond to changes in our business and manage our operations.
our senior credit agreement and the indentures governing our 5.25% senior notes due 2024 (the "2024 notes"), our 4.875% senior notes due 2026 (the "2026 notes") and our 4.625% senior notes due 2027 (the "2027 notes" and, together with the 2024 notes, the "senior notes") contain covenants that, among other things, impose significant restrictions on our business. the restrictions that these covenants place on us and our restricted subsidiaries include limitations on our and their ability to, among other things:
•   incur additional indebtedness or issue preferred stock or otherwise disqualified stock;
•   create liens;
•   pay dividends, make investments or make other restricted payments;
•   sell assets;
•   use the proceeds of permitted sales of our assets;
•   merge, consolidate, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets; and
•   enter into transactions with our affiliates.
in addition, our senior credit agreement also contains financial covenants, including covenants requiring maintenance of a consolidated leverage ratio, a secured leverage ratio and a consolidated interest coverage ratio, calculated in accordance with the terms of the senior credit agreement. a breach of any covenants under any one or
26
more of our debt agreements could result in a default, which if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of all of our debt. in addition, any debt agreements we enter into in the future may further limit our ability to enter into certain types of transactions.
the warrant transactions entered into in connection with the issuance of our convertible notes may adversely affect the value of our common stock.
in connection with the issuance of our 3.875% convertible senior subordinated notes due 2017 (the "convertible notes"), we entered into privately negotiated hedge transactions with two counterparties, which we refer to as the "hedge counterparties." the hedge transactions involved the issuance to us of call options that covered the number of shares of our common stock underlying the convertible notes. the call options were designed to reduce the dilution with respect to our common stock we were required to issue and/or cash payments we were required to make upon conversion of the convertible notes. separately, we also entered into privately negotiated warrant transactions with the hedge counterparties under which we have issued shares of our common stock, and very likely will be obligated to issue additional shares of our common stock on various warrant expiration dates that occur through august 31, 2018, at an exercise price of $74.65, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments. when convertible notes were converted in accordance with their terms, the hedge transactions were effected through our exercise of call options; when we purchased convertible notes from the holders in exchange for cash and our common stock, the call options with respect to shares underlying those convertible notes were canceled, and the number of outstanding warrants was reduced. following the maturity of the convertible notes on august 1, 2017, no further call options were outstanding, and warrants to purchase 724,648 shares of our common stock remained outstanding. subsequent warrant exercises have had, and based on recent market prices of our common stock, will continue to have, a dilutive effect with respect to our common stock. between november 1, 2017 and december 31, 2017, warrants to purchase 165,034 shares were exercised and, after retaining 43,251 shares to cover payment of the exercise price and paying cash in lieu of fractional shares, we delivered 105,638 shares to the hedge counterparties. as of december 31, 2017, warrants to purchase 559,614 shares of our common stock remained outstanding. if we so elect, in lieu of delivering our common stock upon exercise of the warrants, we may make cash payments to the extent that the market price per share of our common stock exceeds the exercise price of the warrants on any expiration date of the warrants. in addition, under applicable accounting guidance, changes in the share price of our common stock can have a significant impact on the number of shares that we must include in the fully diluted earnings per share calculation with respect to the warrants, which, in turn, could impact our reported financial results. based on the average market price of our common stock during 2017, 0.5 million shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants were included in the total diluted shares outstanding for the year ended december 31, 2017. for additional information, see "financing arrangements" under item 7, management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included in this annual report on form 10-k.
in connection with establishing their positions under the convertible note hedge transactions and the warrant transactions, the hedge counterparties (and/or their affiliates) entered into various cash-settled over-the-counter derivative transactions with respect to our common stock concurrently with, or shortly following, the pricing of the convertible notes. the hedge counterparties (and/or their affiliates) may, in their sole discretion, with or without notice, modify their hedge positions from time to time by entering into or unwinding various over-the-counter derivative transactions with respect to shares of our common stock, and/or by purchasing or selling shares of our common stock in privately negotiated transactions and/or open market transactions. the effect, if any, of these transactions and activities on the market price of our common stock will depend in part on market conditions and cannot be ascertained at this time, but any of these activities could adversely affect the value of our common stock.
we may issue additional shares of our common stock or instruments convertible into our common stock, which could lower the price of our common stock.
we are not restricted from issuing additional shares of our common stock or other instruments convertible into our common stock. as of december 31, 2017, we had outstanding approximately 45.2 million shares of our common stock, options to purchase approximately 1.7 million shares of our common stock (of which approximately 1.2 million were vested as of that date), restricted stock units covering approximately 0.2 million shares of our common stock (which are expected to vest over the next three years) and approximately 9,600 shares of our common stock to be distributed from our deferred compensation plan. as of december 31, 2017, 4.5 million shares of our common stock are reserved for issuance upon the exercise of stock options and upon the exercise of the warrants issued in connection with the convertible notes. we cannot predict the size of future issuances or the effect, if any, that they may have on the market price for our common stock.
27
if we issue additional shares of our common stock or instruments convertible into our common stock, such issuances may materially and adversely affect the price of our common stock. furthermore, our issuance of shares following the exercise of some or all of the outstanding stock options and warrants, as well as the vesting of restricted stock units will dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders, and any sales in the public market of such shares of our common stock could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock. in addition, the issuance and sale of substantial amounts of our common stock, including common stock issued as a result of the exercise of stock options and warrants and vesting of restricted stock units could depress the price of our common stock.
disruption of critical information systems or material breaches in the security of our systems may adversely affect our business and customer relationships.
we rely on information technology systems to process, transmit, and store electronic information in our day-to-day operations. we also rely on our technology infrastructure, among other functions, to enable us to interact with customers and suppliers, fulfill orders, generate invoices, collect and make payments, ship products, provide support to customers, fulfill contractual obligations and otherwise conduct business. our internal information technology systems, as well as those systems maintained by third-party providers, may be subjected to computer viruses or other malicious codes, unauthorized access attempts, and cyber-attacks, any of which could result in data leaks or otherwise compromise our confidential or proprietary information and disrupt our operations. cyber-attacks are becoming more sophisticated and frequent, and in some cases have caused significant harm. although we have taken numerous measures to protect our information systems and enhance data security, we cannot assure that these measures will prevent security breaches that could have a significant impact on our business, reputation and financial results. if we fail to monitor, maintain or protect our information technology systems and data integrity effectively or fail to anticipate, plan for or manage significant disruptions to these systems, we could, among other things, lose customers, have difficulty preventing fraud, have disputes with customers, physicians and other health care professionals, be subject to regulatory sanctions or penalties, incur expenses, lose revenues or suffer other adverse consequences.  any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.
regulations related to conflict minerals may increase our costs and adversely affect our business.
in 2012, the sec promulgated rules under the dodd-frank wall street reform and consumer protection act regarding disclosure of the use of tin, tantalum, tungsten and gold, known as "conflict minerals," included in components of products either manufactured by public companies or for which public companies have contracted to manufacture. these rules require that we undertake due diligence efforts to determine whether such minerals originated from the democratic republic of congo (the "drc") or an adjoining country and, if so, whether such minerals helped finance armed conflict in the drc or an adjoining country. in accordance with applicable regulations, we have filed conflict minerals reports annually, beginning in 2014. as discussed in these reports, we have determined that certain of our products contain the specified minerals, and we have undertaken, and continue to undertake, efforts to identify where such minerals originated.  we have incurred, and expect to continue to incur, costs associated with complying with these disclosure requirements, including costs related to determining the sources of the specified minerals used in our products. these rules could adversely affect the sourcing, supply and pricing of materials used in our products. our customers may require that our products be free of conflict minerals, and our revenues and margins may be adversely affected if we are unable to provide assurances to our customers that our products are "drc conflict free" (generally, the product does not contain conflict minerals originating in the drc or an adjoining country that directly or indirectly finance or benefit specified armed groups) due to, among other things, our inability to procure conflict free minerals at a reasonable price, or at all. moreover, we may be adversely affected if we are unable to pass through any increased costs associated with meeting customer demands that we provide products that are drc conflict free.  we also may face reputational challenges if our due diligence efforts do not enable us to verify the origins of all conflict minerals or to determine that any conflict minerals used in products we manufacture or in products manufactured by others for us are drc conflict-free.
our operations expose us to the risk of material environmental and health and safety liabilities.
we are subject to numerous foreign, federal, state and local environmental protection and health and safety laws governing, among other things:
•   the generation, storage, use and transportation of hazardous materials;
•   emissions or discharges of substances into the environment; and
28
•   the health and safety of our employees.
these laws and regulations are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time. we cannot provide assurance that our costs of complying with current or future environmental protection and health and safety laws, or our liabilities arising from past or future releases of, or exposures to, hazardous substances, which may include claims for personal injury or cleanup, will not exceed our estimates or will not adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
our workforce covered by collective bargaining and similar agreements could cause interruptions in our provision of products and services.
as of december 31, 2017, approximately 10% of our employees in the united states and in other countries were covered by union contracts or collective bargaining arrangements. it is likely that a portion of our workforce will remain covered by collective bargaining and similar agreements for the foreseeable future. strikes or work stoppages could occur that would adversely impact our relationships with our customers and our ability to conduct our business.
we may not pay dividends on our common stock in the future.
holders of our common stock are entitled to receive dividends only as our board of directors may declare out of funds legally available for such payments. the declaration and payment of future dividends to holders of our common stock will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon many factors, including our financial condition, earnings, requirements under covenants in our debt instruments, legal requirements and other factors as our board of directors deems relevant. we cannot assure that our cash dividend will not be reduced, or eliminated, in the future.
certain provisions of our corporate governing documents, delaware law and our senior notes could discourage, delay, or prevent a merger or acquisition.
provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could impede a merger, takeover or other business combination involving us or discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer for our common stock. for example, our certificate of incorporation authorizes our board of directors to determine the number of shares in a series, the consideration, dividend rights, liquidation preferences, terms of redemption, conversion or exchange rights and voting rights, if any, of unissued series of preferred stock, without any vote or action by our stockholders. thus, our board of directors can authorize and issue shares of preferred stock with voting or conversion rights that could adversely affect the voting or other rights of holders of our common stock. we are also subject to section 203 of the delaware general corporation law, which imposes restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between us and any holder of 15% or more of our common stock. these provisions could have the effect of delaying or deterring a third party from acquiring us even if an acquisition might be in the best interest of our stockholders, and accordingly could reduce the market price of our common stock.
certain provisions in the indentures governing the senior notes could make it more difficult or more expensive for a third party to acquire us. if an acquisition event constitutes a "change of control," as defined in the indentures governing the senior notes, holders of such notes will have the right to require us to purchase their notes in cash (in the case of the 2027 notes, the right will apply if the change in control is coupled with a ratings downgrade). our obligations under the senior notes could increase the cost of acquiring us or otherwise discourage a third party from acquiring us or removing incumbent management, and accordingly could cause a reduction in the market price of our common stock.
item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a global provider of medical technology products that enhance clinical benefits, improve patient and provider safety and reduce total procedural costs. we primarily design, develop, manufacture and supply single-use medical devices used by hospitals and healthcare providers for common diagnostic and therapeutic procedures in critical care and surgical applications. we market and sell our products worldwide through a combination of our direct sales force and distributors. because our products are used in numerous markets and for a variety of procedures, we are not dependent upon any one end-market or procedure. we are focused on achieving consistent, sustainable and profitable growth by increasing our market share and improving our operating efficiencies.
we evaluate our portfolio of products and businesses on an ongoing basis to ensure alignment with our overall objectives. based on our evaluation, we may identify opportunities to expand our margins through strategic divestitures of existing businesses and product lines that do not meet our objectives. in addition, we may seek to optimize utilization of our facilities through restructuring initiatives designed to further reduce our cost base and enhance our competitive position. for a discussion of our ongoing restructuring programs, see "restructuring and impairment charges" under "results of operations" below. finally, we may continue to explore opportunities to expand the size of our business and improve our margins through a combination of acquisitions and distributor to direct sales conversions, which generally involve our elimination of a distributor from the sales channel, either by acquiring the distributor or terminating the distributor relationship (in some instances, particularly in asia, the conversions involve our acquisition or termination of a master distributor and the continued sale of our products through sub-distributors). our distributor to direct sales conversions are designed to facilitate improved product pricing and more direct access to the end users of our products within the sales channel.
on february 17, 2017, we acquired vascular solutions, inc. ("vascular solutions"), a medical device company that developed and marketed clinical products for use in minimally invasive coronary and peripheral vascular procedures, for an aggregate purchase price of $975.5 million. the acquisition is expected to meaningfully accelerate the growth of our vascular and interventional access product portfolios by facilitating our further expansion into the coronary and peripheral vascular market, and by generating increased cross-portfolio selling opportunities to both our and vascular solutions' customer bases. we financed the acquisition through a combination of term loan and revolving credit borrowings under our amended and restated credit agreement (the "credit agreement"). the credit agreement is described in more detail below under "borrowings" within "liquidity and capital resources".
on october 2, 2017, we completed the acquisition of neotract, inc. ("neotract"), a medical device company that developed and commercialized the urolift system, a minimally invasive medical device for treating lower urinary tract symptoms due to benign prostatic hyperplasia, or bph. the estimated fair value of the consideration transferred to acquire neotract was $975.2 million, which included initial payments of $725.6 million in cash less a favorable working capital adjustment of $1.4 million (for which we had not yet received payment as of december 31, 2017) and $251.0 million in estimated fair value of contingent consideration. the contingent consideration liability represents the estimated fair value of additional consideration of up to $375 million we would be required to pay if specified net sales goals through the end of 2020 are achieved. the acquisition of neotract was financed with revolving credit borrowings under our credit agreement. see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for additional information.
during the year ended december 31, 2017, we also completed acquisitions related to our anesthesia and respiratory product portfolios and distributor to direct sales conversions. the total fair value of the consideration related to these acquisitions was $80.1 million.
during 2016, we completed acquisitions of businesses that are included in our oem and asia reportable operating segments. in addition, during 2016, we acquired the remaining 26% ownership interest in an indian affiliate from the noncontrolling shareholders; we already owned the 74% controlling interest. the total fair value of the consideration paid in these transactions was $22.8 million.
change in reporting segments following our acquisition of vascular solutions, we commenced an integration program under which we are combining vascular solutions' businesses with certain of our legacy businesses. specifically, we are combining
35
vascular solutions' north american business with our interventional access business, which formerly was part of our vascular north america operating segment, and our cardiac business, which formerly was a separate operating segment included in the "all other" category for purposes of segment reporting. these businesses are now in our interventional north american segment. additionally, we are combining the vascular solutions businesses in europe, asia and latin america with our legacy businesses in the respective locations, and these vascular solutions businesses are now part of our emea (europe, middle east and africa), asia and latin america operating segments, respectively. the changes in our operating segments, which became effective in the fourth quarter 2017, also reflect the manner in which our new chief operating decision maker assesses business performance and allocation of resources.
as a result of the operating segment changes described above, we have the following seven reportable segments: vascular north america, interventional north america, anesthesia north america, surgical north america, emea, asia and oem. in connection with the presentation of segment information, we will continue to present certain operating segments, which now include interventional urology and respiratory north america as well as latin america, in the "all other" category because they are not material. all prior comparative periods presented in this report have been restated to reflect these changes. additionally, because these changes affected certain of our reporting units, we reallocated the goodwill balances based on the relative fair values of the reporting units and performed goodwill impairment analyses on the affected reporting units. we did not record any goodwill impairment charges as a result of these analyses.
recently enacted u.s. tax legislation the tax cuts and jobs act (the "tcja") was enacted on december 22, 2017. the legislation significantly changes united states (or "u.s.") tax law by, among other things, reducing the u.s. corporate income tax rate from a maximum of 35% to 21%; implementing a territorial tax system, generally providing for, among other things, a dividends received deduction on the foreign source portion of dividends received from a foreign corporation if specified conditions are met; and imposing a one-time repatriation tax on undistributed post-1986 earnings and profits of foreign subsidiaries, which will be deemed repatriated for purposes of the tax.
on december 22, 2017, the sec staff issued staff accounting bulletin no. 118 ("sab 118") to address the application of u.s. gaap in situations where a company does not have the necessary information available, prepared, or analyzed (including computations) in reasonable detail to complete the accounting for certain income tax effects of the tcja. sab 118 states that in these circumstances, if the company can determine a reasonable estimate for the income tax effects, the sec staff would not object if the company includes in its financial statements the reasonable estimate it has determined (and the sec staff also expressed its belief that it would not be appropriate for a company to exclude a reasonable estimate from its financial statements to the extent a reasonable estimate has been determined). we have included provisional amounts related to deemed repatriated earnings and the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and included these amounts in our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31, 2017. while we believe that the provisional amounts constitute reasonable estimates, we continue to examine the impact the tcja may have on our business. once our accounting for the income tax effects of the tcja is complete, the amounts with respect to the income tax effects of the tcja may differ from the provisional amounts, possibly materially, due to, among other things, additional analysis, changes in interpretations and assumptions we have made, additional regulatory guidance that may be issued, and actions we may take as a result of the tcja.
in 2017, we recognized a $107.9 million net tax expense as a result of the tcja. additional information on the impacts of the tcja is included below and in note 13 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10-k.
health care reform in 2010, the patient protection and affordable care act (as amended, the "affordable care act") was signed into law. the legislation is far-reaching and is intended to expand access to health insurance coverage and improve the quality and reduce the costs of healthcare. for medical device companies such as teleflex, the expansion of medical insurance coverage should lead to greater utilization of the products we manufacture, but the provisions of the legislation designed to contain the cost of healthcare could negatively affect pricing of our products and encourage patient outcome driven results. the overall impact of the affordable care act on our business is yet to be determined, mainly due to uncertainties around future customer behaviors, which we believe will be affected by reimbursement factors such as insurance coverage, statistics, patient outcomes and patient satisfaction. several legislative initiatives to repeal the affordable care act and adopt a form of replacement legislation were proposed, but not adopted, in 2017. however, the recently adopted tax cuts and jobs act eliminated the individual mandate under the affordable care act, which generally required most americans to maintain a minimum level of health insurance coverage. as a result, the level of insurance premium prices for participants in insurance exchanges under the affordable care act is subject to
36
increased uncertainty. the nature and effect of any modification of, or legislative substitution for, the affordable care act, as well as the longer-term viability of the act, is uncertain.
the affordable care act imposed a 2.3% excise tax on sales of medical devices, beginning in 2013. although the excise tax has been suspended through 2019, its status remains unclear for subsequent years. for the year ended december 31, 2015, we recorded medical device excise taxes of $10.2 million, which was included in selling, general and administrative expenses.
global economic conditions global economic conditions in the past decade have had adverse impacts on market activities due to, among other things, failure of financial institutions, falling asset values, diminished liquidity, reduced demand for products and services and significant fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. in response, we adjusted production levels and engaged in new restructuring activities. we continue to review and evaluate our manufacturing, warehousing and distribution processes to maximize efficiencies through the elimination of redundancies in our operations and the consolidation of facilities. although, on a consolidated basis, the consequences of economic conditions, other than fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, have not had a significant adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations or liquidity, healthcare policies and practice trends vary by country, and the impact of the global economic downturn was felt to varying degrees in each of our regional markets over the last several years. while there has been some degree of improvement in economic conditions recently, the continuation of economic trends of uncertain economic growth, constricted credit, public sector austerity measures in response to public budget deficits and foreign currency volatility, particularly with respect to the euro, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and our liquidity.
in recent years, hospitals in some regions of the united states experienced a decline in admissions, a weaker payor mix, and a reduction in elective procedures.  consequently, hospitals took actions to reduce their costs, including limiting their capital spending. despite recent improvements in the economic environment, challenges persist, particularly in some european countries, as discussed below. approximately 95% of our net revenues come from single-use products primarily used in critical care and surgical applications, and our sales volume could be negatively impacted if hospital admission rates or payor mix change. conversely, our sales volume could increase due to the greater number of insured individuals as a result of the affordable care act, which has had the effect of facilitating medical insurance coverage for many persons who previously were not covered, although, as noted above, the affordable care act may be subject to repeal, further modification or replacement, and its longer-term viability is uncertain.
a number of european countries continue to contend with considerable government debt, annual deficits and high levels of unemployment. despite some indications of a more positive economic outlook in europe, the healthcare sector remains weak. in particular, budgetary restraints among european countries have led to cost control measures, such as delays in approvals for elective surgeries.the public healthcare systems in certain countries in western europe, most notably greece, spain, portugal and italy, have experienced significantly reduced liquidity due to recessionary conditions, which continues to result in delays in payments to us by customers in these countries. moreover, the impact of brexit, economic and trade policies of the trump administration and political developments in european nations could have a profound economic effect in europe and elsewhere.
in asia, we are experiencing an increasing trend of government-implemented price management and reimbursement controls, particularly in china and australia. there also has been an increase in government initiatives to help local manufacturers access a bigger share of the local market. moreover, many countries in the region have become more proactive with respect to regulatory requirements, and as a result, we expect longer, costlier and more complicated regulatory approval processes in these countries.
in latin america, some highly regulated economies such as argentina and venezuela have experienced unusually high inflation rates and weakening currencies. this has impacted the budgets of the public healthcare systems resulting in delays in the importation of medical devices. although latin america does not represent a significant portion of our business, our operations in this region may be adversely affected by these factors.
results of operations as used in this discussion, "new products" are products for which commercial sales have commenced within the past 36 months, and "existing products" are products for which commercial sales commenced more than 36 months
37
ago. discussion of results of operations items that reference the effect of one or more acquired businesses (except as noted below with respect to acquired distributors) generally reflects the impact of the acquisitions within the first 12 months following the date of the acquisition. in addition to increases and decreases in the per unit selling prices of our products to our customers, our discussion of the impact of product price increases and decreases also reflects, for the first 12 months following the acquisition or termination of a distributor, the impact on the pricing of our products resulting from the elimination of the distributor from the sales channel. to the extent an acquired distributor had pre-acquisition sales of products other than ours, the impact of the post-acquisition sales of those products on our results of operations is included within our discussion of the impact of acquired businesses.
certain financial information is presented on a rounded basis, which may cause minor differences.
revenues
2017                             2016                  2015

net revenues      $2,146.3              $1,868.0              $1,809.7
comparison of 2017 and 2016
net revenues for the year ended december 31, 2017 increased 14.9%, or $278.3 million, compared to the prior year. the increase is primarily attributable to net revenues of $205.8 million generated by acquired businesses, primarily vascular solutions and neotract and, to a lesser extent, an increase in new product sales.
comparison of 2016 and 2015
net revenues for the year ended december 31, 2016 increased 3.2%, or $58.3 million, compared to the prior year. the increase is primarily attributable to an increase in sales volumes of existing products of $37.3 million and an increase in new product sales of $24.2 million, both across all of our segments. the increase was partially offset by unfavorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.

comparison of 2017 and 2016
for the year ended december 31, 2017, gross margin increased 130 basis points, or 2.4%, compared to the prior year. the increase in gross margin is primarily attributable to gross margin generated by acquired businesses, a more favorable mix of products sold, cost improvement initiatives, including the 2016 and 2014 footprint realignment plans described below and the impact of price increases. these increases were partially offset by the unfavorable $10.4 million impact of the step-up in carrying value of inventory recognized in connection with the vascular solutions acquisition that adversely affected cost of goods sold upon sale of such inventory during 2017, as well as higher logistics and distributions costs.
comparison of 2016 and 2015
for the year ended december 31, 2016, gross margin increased 110 basis points, or 2.1%, compared to the prior year. the increase in gross margin is primarily attributable to the impact of an increase in sales of higher margin products, primarily in the anesthesia north america and emea segments, as well as lower manufacturing costs resulting from cost improvement initiatives, including the 2014 manufacturing footprint realignment plan.

comparison of 2017 and 2016
selling, general and administrative expenses increased $136.7 million during the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to the prior year. the increase is primarily attributable to $108.3 million in expenses related to acquired businesses and distributor to direct conversions, the unfavorable impact of increases in the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities and unfavorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.
comparison of 2016 and 2015
selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $5.7 million during the year ended december 31, 2016 compared to the prior year. the decrease is primarily attributable to the favorable impact of the suspension of the excise tax on medical devices under the affordable care act of $10.2 million and the favorable impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates of $2.7 million, partially offset by an increase in selling and marketing expenses of $7.5 million.

comparison of 2017 and 2016
the increase in research and development expenses for the year ended december 31, 2017 is primarily attributable to expenses incurred by acquired businesses, primarily vascular solutions, and to a lesser extent, neotract. additionally, 2017 research and development expenses reflect increased spending on new product development with respect to several of our segments.
comparison of 2016 and 2015
the increase in research and development expenses for the year ended december 31, 2016 is primarily attributable to increased spending on new product development with respect to several of our segments.
restructuring and impairment charges the following table provides information regarding restructuring charges we have incurred with respect to each of our ongoing restructuring plans and programs, as well as impairment charges, for the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015. the restructuring charges listed in the table primarily consist of termination benefits.

anticipated charges and pre-tax savings related to restructuring plans and programs with respect to our restructuring plans and programs that were ongoing at december 31, 2017, the table below summarizes (1) the estimated total charges that will be incurred and the estimated annual pre-tax savings once the plans and programs are completed; (2) the charges incurred and estimated pre-tax savings realized through december 31, 2017; and (3) the estimated charges to be incurred and the estimated incremental pre-tax savings to be realized for these plans and programs from january 1, 2018 through their respective anticipated completion dates.
estimated charges and pre-tax savings are subject to change based on, among other things, the nature and timing of restructuring activities, changes in the scope of restructuring plans and programs, unanticipated expenditures and other developments, the effect of additional acquisitions or dispositions and other factors that were not reflected in the assumptions made by management in previously estimating restructuring and restructuring related charges and estimated pre-tax savings. moreover, estimated pre-tax savings relating to programs involving the integration of acquired businesses are particularly difficult to forecast because the estimate of pre-tax savings, to a considerable extent, involves assumptions regarding operation of businesses during periods when those businesses were not administered by our management. it is likely that estimates of charges and pre-tax savings will change from time to time, and the table below reflects changes from amounts previously estimated. in addition, the table below has been updated to remove estimated charges and pre-tax savings related to completed programs. estimated charges and pre-tax savings are described in more detail below, within the discussions of the specific restructuring plans and programs.

(1)   restructuring related charges principally constitute accelerated depreciation and other costs primarily related to the transfer of manufacturing operations to new locations and are expected to be recognized primarily in cost of goods sold.
(2)   approximately 55% of the pre-tax savings are expected to result in reductions to cost of goods sold. as previously disclosed, during 2016, in connection with our execution of the 2014 manufacturing footprint realignment plan, we implemented changes to medication delivery devices included in certain of our kits, which are expected to result in increased product costs (and therefore reduced the annual savings we anticipated at the inception of the program). however, we also expect to achieve improved pricing on these kits to offset the cost, which is expected to result in estimated annual increased revenues of $5 million to $6 million, which is not reflected in the table above. we realized a $1.0 million benefit resulting from this incremental pricing in 2017. more recently, during the fourth quarter of 2017, we entered into an agreement with an alternate provider for the development and supply of a component to be included in certain kits sold by our vascular and anesthesia north america operating segments. the agreement will result in increased development costs, but is expected to reduce the cost of the component supply, once the supply becomes commercially available, as compared to the costs
40
incurred with respect to our current suppliers. therefore, we anticipate a net savings from the agreement, which is reflected in the table above. see "2014 manufacturing footprint realignment plan" below for additional information.
(3)   while pre-tax savings address anticipated cost savings to be realized with respect to our historical expense items, they also reflect anticipated efficiencies to be realized with respect to increased costs that otherwise would have resulted from our acquisition of vascular solutions and pyng medical corp. ("pyng"), which we acquired in 2017. in this regard, the pre-tax savings are expected to result from the elimination of redundancies between our operations and vascular solutions' and pyng's operations, principally through the elimination of personnel redundancies.
the following provides additional details with respect to our ongoing restructuring plans and programs:
2017 vascular solutions integration program during the first quarter 2017, we committed to a restructuring program related to the integration of vascular solutions' operations into our operations. we initiated the program in the first quarter 2017 and expect the program to be substantially completed by the end of the second quarter 2018. we estimate that we will record aggregate pre-tax restructuring charges of $6.5 million to $8.0 million related to this program as compared to the prior estimate of $6.0 million to $7.5 million. we expect $5.5 million to $6.2 million of the total restructuring charges will constitute termination benefits, and $1.0 million to $1.8 million will relate to other exit costs, including employee relocation and outplacement costs. additionally, we expect to incur $2.5 million to $3.0 million of restructuring related charges, consisting primarily of retention bonuses offered to certain employees expected to remain with our company after completion of the program. all of these charges will result in future cash outlays. we began realizing program-related savings in the first quarter 2017 and expect to achieve annual pre-tax savings of $25 million to $30 million once the program is fully implemented. this is an increase as compared to the prior estimate of $20 million to $25 million. the increase in the estimated restructuring charges and annual pre-tax savings ranges as compared to the prior estimates were the result of an increase in the headcount reduction initially contemplated under the program.
2017 emea restructuring program during the first quarter 2017, we committed to a restructuring program to centralize certain administrative functions in europe. the program commenced in the second quarter 2017 and is expected to be substantially completed by the end of 2018. we estimate that we will record aggregate pre-tax restructuring charges of approximately $5.0 million related to this program, almost all of which constitute termination benefits, and all of which will result in future cash outlays. this represents a decrease as compared to the prior estimate of aggregate pre-tax restructuring charges of $7.1 million to $8.5 million. we expect to achieve annual pre-tax savings of approximately $2.5 million once the program is fully implemented and will begin realizing program related savings in the first quarter 2018. this represents a decrease as compared to the prior estimate of annual pre-tax savings of $2.7 million to $3.3 million. the reduction in expected charges and annual pre-tax savings is the result of a decrease in the headcount reduction initially contemplated under the program.
2016 manufacturing footprint realignment plan in 2016, we initiated a restructuring plan involving the relocation of certain manufacturing operations, the relocation and outsourcing of certain distribution operations and a related workforce reduction at certain of our facilities. (the "2016 manufacturing footprint realignment plan"). these actions commenced in the first quarter 2016 and are expected to be substantially completed by the end of 2018. we estimate that we will incur aggregate pre-tax charges in connection with these restructuring activities of approximately $34 million to $44 million, of which we estimate $27 million to $31 million will result in future cash outlays. additionally, we expect to incur aggregate capital expenditures of approximately $17 million to $19 million in connection with the 2016 manufacturing footprint realignment plan. we began realizing plan-related savings in 2017 and expect to achieve annual pre-tax savings of $12 million to $16 million once the plan is fully implemented.
2014 manufacturing footprint realignment plan in april 2014, we initiated a restructuring plan (the "2014 manufacturing footprint realignment plan") involving the consolidation of operations and a related reduction in workforce at certain facilities, and the relocation of manufacturing operations from certain higher-cost locations to existing lower-cost locations. these actions commenced in the second quarter 2014.
during the fourth quarter 2017, we executed an agreement with an alternate provider for the development and supply of a component to be included in certain kits primarily sold by our vascular north america and anesthesia north america operating segments. this will result in increased development costs, but also is expected to reduce the cost
41
of the component supply once it becomes commercially available, as compared to costs incurred with respect to current suppliers. therefore, we anticipate a net savings as a result of this agreement. as a result, we revised our cost , annual pre-tax savings and timing estimates with respect to the 2014 manufacturing footprint realignment plan. we estimate that we will incur aggregate pre-tax charges in connection with the 2014 manufacturing footprint realignment plan of approximately $46 million to $51 million, compared to our most recent prior estimate of approximately $43 million to $48 million. additionally, we estimate that we will achieve annual pre-tax savings of $26 million to $29 million as compared to our most recent prior estimate of $23 million to $27 million. as a result of the changes to the plan described above, we now expect the plan will be substantially complete by the end of 2021, as compared to our prior estimate of the second half of 2020.
we continue to anticipate an increase in annual revenues resulting from improved pricing on our vascular kits as a result of changes made to our medication delivery devices. we anticipate that this projected increase in annual revenues, taken together with the projected annual savings we expect to realize under the 2014 manufacturing footprint realignment plan, should enable us to improve our pre-tax income on an annual basis by approximately $31 million to $35 million once the plan has been completed.
we expect aggregate cash outlays associated with the plan to be in the range of $38 million to $43 million, compared to our most recent prior estimate of approximately $33 million to $38 million. additionally, we continue to expect that we will incur $24 million to $30 million in aggregate capital expenditures under the plan.
2016 other restructuring programs during the second half of 2016, we commenced restructuring activities involving the consolidation of global administrative functions and manufacturing operations. these programs are expected to be substantially complete by the end of the first quarter of 2018. we estimate that we will record aggregate pre-tax charges of $3.8 million to $4.7 million related to these programs, which constitute termination benefits and contract termination costs that will result in future cash outlays. additionally, we expect to incur approximately $1.5 million of accelerated depreciation and other costs directly related to the programs, which we anticipate will be recognized in cost of goods sold; we anticipate that approximately $1.0 million of this amount will result in cash outlays. as of december 31, 2017, we expect to achieve annual pre-tax savings of $9.0 million to $10.0 million once this program is fully implemented, which is an increase to the prior estimate of $6.9 million to $8.5 million. the increase in the estimated annual pre-tax savings is due to an increase in the headcount reduction initially contemplated under the program.

interest expense                                  $82.5             $54.9             $61.3
average interest rate on debt during the year      3.70   %          3.80   %          3.84   %
comparison of 2017 and 2016
the increase in interest expense for the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to the prior year was primarily due to an increase in average debt outstanding, mainly attributable to borrowings under the credit agreement that were utilized to fund the vascular solutions and neotract acquisitions, offset by a slight decline in the average interest rate on debt.
comparison of 2016 and 2015
the decrease in interest expense for the year ended december 31, 2016 compared to the prior year was primarily due to our repurchase of our 3.875% convertible senior subordinated notes due 2017 (the "convertible notes") from certain holders of those notes in exchange for cash and shares of our common stock (which transactions are referred to below as "exchange transactions") and conversions of the convertible notes, resulting in lower average amounts of debt outstanding compared to the prior period. the decrease was also the result of a lower average interest rate due to our june 1, 2015 redemption of our 6.875% senior subordinated notes due 2019 (the "2019 notes"), which were replaced by borrowings under our previous revolving credit facility and subsequently by our issuance of 4.875%
42
senior notes due 2026 (the "2026 notes"). the interest rates on both the revolving credit facility and the 2026 notes are lower than the interest rate on the 2019 notes. the decrease in interest expense was partially offset by financing fees of $3.4 million incurred for the year ended december 31, 2016 to secure bridge financing commitments related to our acquisition of vascular solutions.
loss on extinguishment of debt
2017                                           2016              2015

loss on extinguishment of debt      $5.6             $19.3             $10.5
for the year ended december 31, 2017, we recognized a $5.6 million loss on the extinguishment of debt, of which $5.2 million related to our repurchase, on january 5, 2017, of $91.7 million in aggregate principal amount of convertible notes through exchange transactions with certain holders of the convertible notes, and $0.4 million related to the amendment and restatement of our previous credit agreement, which was considered a partial extinguishment of debt. see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10-k for additional information.
for the year ended december 31, 2016, we recognized a loss on the extinguishment of debt of $19.3 million, of which, $16.3 million related to our repurchase of $219.2 million in aggregate principal amount of convertible notes through exchange transactions with certain holders of the convertible notes and $3.0 million related to the conversions of $44.4 million in aggregate principal amount of the convertible notes.

during the year ended december 31, 2016, we recognized a gain of $4.4 million, primarily as a result of the sale, for $8.9 million, of two buildings, one of which was previously classified as held for sale.
taxes on income from continuing operations

effective income tax rate   45.5   %     3.3   %     3.2   %
we generate substantial earnings from our international operations. most of the international jurisdictions in which we file tax returns historically have had statutory tax rates that are lower than the united states statutory tax rate; as a result, our consolidated effective income tax rate for 2017 (excluding the impact of the tcja) and earlier years has been substantially below the united states statutory tax rate. the principal international jurisdictions in which the statutory tax rate in 2017 and earlier years is lower than the united states statutory tax rate and from which we derive substantial earnings include ireland, bermuda, luxembourg, germany and italy.
despite the tcja's reduction of the united states corporate income tax rate, we anticipate that we will continue to have a consolidated effective income tax rate that is below the newly enacted statutory tax rate due to the lower tax rates applicable to our foreign operations in many of the relevant international jurisdictions. however, changes to either the currently enacted united states tax rates or international statutory tax rates could affect our effective income tax rate in the future.
excluding the impact of any discrete items, the provisions of the tcja are expected to be neutral or to reduce somewhat our effective tax rate in 2018 compared to what the rate would have been prior to the adoption of the tcja . the ultimate impact on our effective tax rate will largely depend on a variety of factors, including the portion of pretax earnings that we generate in various taxing jurisdictions.
43
comparison of 2017 and 2016
the effective income tax rate for 2017 was 45.5% compared to 3.3% for 2016. taxes on income from continuing operations in 2017 were $129.6 million compared to $8.1 million in 2016. the effective income tax rate for 2017 was impacted by a net tax expense of $107.9 million resulting from the enactment of the tcja. the $107.9 million net tax expense reflects a tax expense of $154.0 million for the deemed repatriation of undistributed foreign earnings, partially offset by a $46.1 million tax benefit resulting from the reassessment and revaluation of the net deferred tax liabilities. additionally, the effective tax rate for 2017 was impacted by a net excess tax benefit related to share-based compensation and a benefit resulting from the expiration of various statutes of limitation. see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10-k for additional information.
comparison of 2016 and 2015
the effective income tax rate in 2016 was 3.3% compared to 3.2% in 2015. taxes on income from continuing operations in 2016 were $8.1 million compared to $7.8 million in 2015. the effective income tax rate for 2016 was impacted by a tax benefit associated with u.s. federal tax return filings, a benefit resulting from the reduction of german tax reserves as a result of the conclusion of an audit, a benefit resulting from the expiration of various statutes of limitation and a benefit associated with an ipr&d asset impairment.

liquidity and capital resources we assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund our operating, investing and financing activities. our principal source of liquidity is operating cash flows. in addition to operating cash flows, other significant factors that affect our overall management of liquidity include: capital expenditures, acquisitions, pension funding, dividends, taxes, scheduled principal and interest payments with respect to outstanding indebtedness, adequacy of available bank lines of credit and access to capital markets.
we believe our cash flow from operations, available cash and cash equivalents and borrowings under our revolving credit facility (which is provided for under our credit agreement) and accounts receivable securitization facility will enable us to fund our operating requirements, capital expenditures and debt obligations for the next 12 months and the foreseeable future.
of our $333.6 million of cash and cash equivalents at december 31, 2017, $286.3 million was held at foreign subsidiaries. we manage our worldwide cash requirements by monitoring the funds available among our subsidiaries and determining the extent to which we can access those funds on a cost effective basis.
the tcja significantly changes u.s. tax law by, among other things, imposing a one-time repatriation tax on undistributed post-1986 earnings and profits of foreign subsidiaries. previously, we were not taxed on foreign earnings deemed to be permanently invested overseas. under the tcja, we will have to pay $154.0 million over eight years for the deemed repatriation of foreign earnings, regardless of whether such earnings are actually repatriated. see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10-k for additional information. as a result of the repatriation tax provisions of the tcja, we anticipate that, generally, we will be able to access cash located at our foreign subsidiaries without incurring any additional u.s. federal income tax liabilities. we are not aware of any other restrictions on repatriation of these funds and, subject to cash payment of additional foreign withholding taxes, these funds could be repatriated, if necessary.
we have not experienced significant payment defaults by our customers and we have sufficient lending commitments in place to enable us to fund our anticipated operating needs. however, as discussed above in "global economic conditions", although there have been recent improvements in certain countries, global financial markets remain volatile and the global credit markets are constrained, which creates risk that our customers and suppliers may be unable to access liquidity. consequently, we continue to monitor our credit risk, particularly with respect to customers in greece, italy, portugal and spain, as well as consider other risk mitigation strategies. in january 2017, we sold $16.1 million of receivables payable from publicly funded hospitals in italy for $16.0 million.
48
as of december 31, 2017 and 2016, our net trade accounts receivable from publicly funded hospitals in greece, italy, portugal and spain were $24.7 million and $29.2 million, respectively. for the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, net revenues from customers in these countries were approximately 6%, 7% and 7%, respectively, of our total net revenues, and average days that current and long-term trade accounts receivable with respect to these customers were outstanding were 154, 182 and 204 days, respectively. as of december 31, 2017 and 2016, net current and long-term trade accounts receivable from these countries were approximately 15% and 19%, respectively, of our consolidated net current and long-term trade accounts receivable. if economic conditions in these countries deteriorate, we may experience significant credit losses related to the public hospital systems in these countries. moreover, if global economic conditions generally deteriorate, we may experience further delays in customer payments, reductions in our customers' purchases and higher credit losses, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows in 2018 and future years. see "critical accounting policies and estimates" below for additional information regarding the critical accounting estimates related to our accounts receivable.
the aggregate total fair value of consideration we provided for the acquisitions we made in 2017 and 2016 was $2.0 billion and $22.8 million, respectively. the most significant acquisitions completed in 2017 were vascular solutions and neotract. see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10-k for additional information regarding our acquisitions.
in january 2017, we entered into the credit agreement, which provides for a five-year revolving credit facility of $1.0 billion and a term loan facility of $750.0 million. we used the term loan facility to finance most of the consideration for the vascular solutions acquisition (the remaining consideration was provided through borrowings under the revolving credit facility). the revolving credit facility provides us with significant flexibility to meet our foreseeable working capital and other liquidity needs. in addition, during 2017, we reacquired, through conversion or exchange, and retired our 3.875% convertible senior subordinated notes, which matured on august 1, 2017 ("convertible notes"), using available funds under the revolving credit facility. we also used $725 million in borrowings under our revolving credit facility to finance, in part, our acquisition of neotract. additionally, in november 2017, we sold $500.0 million in principal amount of 4.625% senior notes due 2027 (the "2027 notes"), the net proceeds of which were used to repay borrowings under the revolving credit facility.
in connection with the original issuance of the convertible notes in 2010, we entered into a convertible note hedge transaction to purchase call options. the call options enabled the company to economically hedge the dilutive impact of the convertible notes conversions on the weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding. in connection with convertible note conversions and exchanges, we exercised or unwound these related call options. we also entered into warrant transactions in connection with issuance of the convertible notes. counterparties continue to hold warrants to purchase our common stock that they acquired at the time of the initial issuance of the convertible notes. at december 31, 2017, warrants to purchase 559,614 shares at an exercise price of $74.65 per share remained outstanding. the remaining warrants expire ratably over a period ending on august 31, 2018. at december 31, 2017, the intrinsic value of the warrants (i.e. the excess of the aggregate market price of the underlying shares over the aggregate exercise price of the warrants) was $98.0 million.
we may at any time, from time to time, repurchase our outstanding debt securities in open market purchases, via tender offers or in privately negotiated transactions, exchange transactions or otherwise, at such price or prices as we deem appropriate. such purchases or exchanges, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors and may be commenced or suspended at any time.
see "financing arrangements" below as well as note 8 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10-k for further information related to our borrowings.

comparison of 2017 and 2016
cash flow from operating activities net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations was $426.3 million during 2017 and $410.6 million during 2016. the $15.7 million increase is attributable to favorable operating results partially offset by a net cash outflow for income taxes resulting primarily from a tax refund received in 2016. excluding income taxes, the net impact of the working capital changes was consistent in 2017 as compared to 2016; an increase in inventories was offset by an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses, and to a lesser extent, a net decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets. the increase in inventories for the year ended december 31, 2017 was $22.4 million compared to a decrease of $6.4 million for the year ended december 31, 2016. the increase is attributable to inventory purchases to achieve desired safety stock levels as well as inventory from a former chinese distributor that was returned to us during 2017 as part of an arbitration proceeding. see note 15 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10-k for additional information regarding this arbitration proceeding. the net increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses was $39.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2017 as compared to an increase of $15.4 million for the year ended december 31, 2016; the increase is primarily attributable to an increase in payroll and benefit related accruals.
cash flow from investing activities net cash used in investing activities from continuing operations was $1.8 billion during 2017, primarily resulting from $1.8 billion in payments for businesses acquired, principally vascular solutions and neotract; and capital expenditures of $70.9 million, which were partially offset by proceeds of $6.3 million from the sale of two properties, one of which was a building that had been previously classified as held for sale.
cash flow from financing activities net cash provided by financing activities from continuing operations was $1.1 billion during 2017, primarily resulting from a net increase in borrowings of $1.2 billion. our borrowings under the credit agreement included $1.0 billion to finance the vascular solutions acquisition, together with related fees and expenses, and $725 million to finance the neotract acquisition. in addition, we sold $500 million in principal amount of the 2027 notes. these increases were partially offset by our repayments of 1.1 billion of borrowings under the credit agreement. additionally, we had a $136.1 million reduction in borrowings under our 3.875% convertible senior subordinated notes due 2017 (the "convertible notes") resulting from exchange transactions, and payment upon maturity of all remaining convertible notes outstanding, each of which is discussed below under "borrowings."
net cash provided by financing activities from continuing operations was also impacted by dividend payments of $61.2 million and debt issuance and amendment fees of $26.7 million, which included fees paid in connection with our entry into the credit agreement, the issuance of the 2027 notes and a bridge facility and backstop commitment that was put in place to assist with the financing of the vascular solutions acquisition, but was never utilized because the required financing was provided under the credit agreement.

comparison of 2016 and 2015
cash flow from operating activities net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations was $410.6 million during 2016 and $303.4 million during 2015. the $107.2 million increase is primarily attributable to improved operating results, a net favorable impact from changes in working capital and a reduction in income tax payments.
the net cash inflow from working capital is primarily the result of an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses and a decrease in inventories partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable. the cash inflow for accounts payable and accrued expenses was $15.4 million for the year ended december 31, 2016 as compared to a cash outflow of $0.1 million for the year ended december 31, 2015. the cash inflow for accounts payable and accrued expenses, excluding the impact of the net increase in the restructuring reserve, is attributable to certain non-recurring accrued expense payments made during the year ended december 31, 2015. the cash inflow for inventories was $6.4 million in 2016 as compared to a $8.4 million net cash outflow in 2015. the lower inventory levels in 2016 are primarily the result of higher than expected net revenues in the fourth quarter and fewer inventory builds in support of distributor to direct sales conversions. the cash outflow related to accounts receivable was $11.0 million in 2016 as compared to a cash inflow of $0.4 million in 2015. the increase in accounts receivable for the year ended december 31, 2016 is attributable to higher fourth quarter net revenues as compared to 2015, partially offset by stronger collections, particularly in europe.
cash flow from investing activities net cash used in investing activities from continuing operations was $57.0 million during 2016, primarily resulting from capital expenditures of $53.1 million and payments for businesses and intangibles acquired of $14.0 million. the acquired business and intangibles included certain assets of cartika medical, inc. and certain distributors in new zealand, which were comprised primarily of intangible assets, including goodwill, and inventory. these payments were partially offset by proceeds from asset sales of $10.2 million, primarily related to two buildings.
cash flow from financing activities net cash used in financing activities from continuing operations was $118.7 million during 2016, primarily resulting from dividends paid of $59.0 million and a net reduction in borrowings of $42.9 million. the net reduction in borrowings included reductions of $263.6 million resulting from exchange transactions and conversions related to convertible notes and the net reduction of $186.0 million in the outstanding balance of our revolving credit facility, partially offset by our issuance of $400.0 million in principal amount of the 2026 notes and increased borrowings of $6.7 million under our securitization program. net cash used in financing activities also reflected a $9.2 million payment for our acquisition of the remaining 26% noncontrolling interest of teleflex medical private limited, our indian affiliate in which we already owned the 74% controlling interest, $9.0 million in debt extinguishment, issuance and amendment fees, including transaction fees associated with the issuance of the 2026 notes and $7.3 million in contingent consideration payments. these cash payments were partially offset by $9.1 million of net proceeds from share-based compensation plans and the related tax benefits, primarily related to stock option exercises.

fixed rate debt comprised 50.7% and 75.1% of total debt at december 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. the decrease in fixed rate borrowings as a percentage of total borrowings at december 31, 2017 compared to the fixed rate borrowings as a percentage of total borrowings at december 31, 2016 is primarily due to variable rate borrowings under our amended and restated senior credit facility (described below) offset by the increase in fixed rate borrowings as a result of the issuance of the 2027 notes.
amended and restated senior credit facility on january 20, 2017, we amended and restated our then-existing senior credit agreement by entering into an amended and restated credit agreement (the "credit agreement"). as noted above, the credit agreement provides for a five-year revolving credit facility of $1.0 billion and a term loan facility of $750.0 million. the term loan facility and borrowings under the revolving credit facility were used to finance the acquisition of vascular solutions. the obligations under the credit agreement are guaranteed (subject to certain exceptions and limitations) by substantially all of our material domestic subsidiaries and are secured by a lien on substantially all of our and each guarantor's owned assets. the revolving credit facility and the term loan facility will mature on january 20, 2022 and february 17, 2022, respectively. at december 31, 2017, we had $349.0 million in borrowings outstanding and approximately $3.2 million in outstanding standby letters of credit under our $1.0 billion revolving credit facility.
the credit agreement contains customary representations and warranties and covenants that, among other things and subject to certain exceptions, qualifications and thresholds, place limitations on our ability, and the ability of our subsidiaries, to incur additional indebtedness, create additional liens, enter into a merger, consolidation or amalgamation, dispose of certain assets, make certain investments or acquisitions, pay dividends on, repurchase or make distributions in respect of capital stock and enter into swap agreements. additionally, the credit agreement contains financial covenants that require us to maintain a consolidated total leverage ratio (generally, consolidated total funded indebtedness, as defined in the credit agreement, on the determination date to consolidated ebitda, as defined in the credit agreement, for the four most recent fiscal quarters ending on or preceding the determination date) of not more than 4.50 to 1, a secured leverage ratio (generally, consolidated senior secured funded indebtedness, as defined in the credit agreement, on the determination date to consolidated ebitda, as defined in the 2017 credit agreement, for the four most recent fiscal quarters ending on or preceding the determination date) of not more than 3.50 to 1 and a consolidated interest coverage ratio (generally, consolidated ebitda for the four most recent quarters ending on or preceding the determination date to consolidated interest expense, as defined in the credit agreement, paid in cash for such period) of not less than 3.50 to 1.

2024, 2026 and 2027 senior notes (collectively, the "senior notes")
as of december 31, 2017, the outstanding principal amount of the 2024 notes, 2026 notes and 2027 notes was $250.0, $400.0 million and $500.0 million, respectively. the indentures governing the 2024 notes and 2026 notes contain covenants that, among other things, limit or restrict our ability, and the ability of our subsidiaries, to incur debt, create liens, consolidate, merge or dispose of certain assets, make certain investments, engage in acquisitions, and pay dividends on, repurchase or make distributions in respect of capital stock, subject to specified conditions. the indenture governing the 2027 notes contains covenants that, among other things, limit or restrict our ability, and the ability of our subsidiaries, to create liens; consolidate, merge or dispose of certain assets; and enter into sale leaseback transactions. the obligations under the senior notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, by each of our existing and future 100% owned domestic subsidiaries that are a guarantor or other obligor under the credit agreement and by certain of our other 100% owned domestic subsidiaries. as of december 31, 2017, we were in compliance with all of the terms of our senior notes.
accounts receivable securitization we have an accounts receivable securitization facility under which we sell an undivided interest in domestic accounts receivable for consideration of up to $50.0 million to a commercial paper conduit. as of december 31, 2017, we borrowed the maximum amount available of $50.0 million under this facility. this facility is utilized to provide increased flexibility in funding short term working capital requirements. the agreement governing the accounts receivable securitization facility contains certain covenants and termination events. an occurrence of an event of default or a termination event under this facility may give rise to the right of our counterparty to terminate this facility. as of december 31, 2017, we were in compliance with the covenants and none of the termination events had occurred. as of december 31, 2016, we had $50.0 million of outstanding borrowings under our accounts receivable securitization facility.
convertible notes our convertible notes matured on august 1, 2017 (the "maturity date"). the convertible notes were convertible under certain circumstances, including the attainment of at least a specified last reported sales price per share of our common stock during a specified period. since the fourth quarter 2013, our closing stock price exceeded the threshold for conversion. moreover, commencing on may 1, 2017 and through july 28, 2017, the convertible notes were convertible regardless of the closing price of our stock. we elected a net settlement method to satisfy our conversion obligations, under which we settled the conversion of convertible notes by paying the principal amount of the convertible notes in cash and providing shares having a value equal to the excess of the conversion value of the convertible notes over the principal amount of the notes; however, cash was paid in lieu of fractional shares.
in january 2017, we acquired $91.7 million aggregate outstanding principal amount of the convertible notes in exchange for an aggregate of $93.2 million in cash (including approximately $1.5 million in accrued and previously unpaid interest) and approximately 0.93 million shares of our common stock (the "exchange transactions"). we funded the cash portion of the consideration paid through borrowings under our revolving credit facility. in advance of the maturity of the convertible notes, $44.2 million in aggregate principal amount of the convertible notes (the "converted notes") were tendered to us for conversion. on the maturity date, we repaid the remaining $44.3 million in aggregate principal amount of the convertible notes outstanding, together with unpaid interest due and owing on the convertible notes (the "cash payment"). in addition to the cash payment, on the maturity date, we delivered to the holders of the converted notes, in the aggregate, 0.5 million shares of our common stock. we funded the cash payment through borrowings under our revolving credit facility.

(1)   interest payments on floating rate debt are based on the interest rate in effect on december 31, 2017.
(2)   purchase and other obligations are defined as an unconditional commitments to purchase goods or services that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: quantities to be purchased; price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. the amounts include commitments for inventory purchases and capital expenditures that do not exceed our projected requirements in the normal course of business and penalties due upon cancellation of cancellable agreements; the amounts exclude operating lease obligations.
(3)   pursuant to the provisions of the tcja, we recognized tax expense of $154.0 million for the deemed repatriation of foreign earnings, which we have elected to pay in annual installments over eight years (as prescribed by the tcja).
we recorded a noncurrent liability for uncertain tax positions of $12.3 million and $17.5 million as of december 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. due to uncertainties regarding the ultimate resolution of ongoing or future tax examinations, we are not able to reasonably estimate the amount of any income tax payments that will be required to settle uncertain income tax positions or the periods in which any such payments will be made and as a result, these amounts are excluded from the contractual obligations table above.
we recorded contingent consideration liabilities of $272.1 million and $7.1 million as of december 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, of which $74.2 million and $0.6 million, respectively, were recorded as the current portion of contingent consideration. due to uncertainty regarding the timing and amount of future payments related to these liabilities, these amounts are excluded from the contractual obligations table above.
see notes 10, 13 and 14 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10-k for additional information.
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. actual results could differ materially from the amounts derived from those estimates and assumptions.
we have identified the following as critical accounting estimates, which are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties, are the most pervasive and important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and could potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions. the following discussion should be considered in conjunction with the description of our accounting policies in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form 10-k.
allowance for doubtful accounts in the ordinary course of business, we grant non-interest bearing trade credit to our customers on normal credit terms.  in an effort to reduce our credit risk, we (i) establish credit limits for all of our customer relationships, (ii) perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers' financial condition, (iii) monitor the payment history and aging of our customers' receivables, and (iv) monitor open orders against an individual customer's outstanding receivable balance.
54
an allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained for trade accounts receivable based on the expected collectability of accounts receivable, after considering the company's historical collection experience, the length of time an account is outstanding, the financial position of the customer and information provided by credit rating services. the adequacy of this allowance is reviewed each reporting period and adjusted as necessary. our allowance for doubtful accounts was $10.3 million and $8.6 million at december 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, which constituted 2.8% and 3.0% of gross trade accounts receivable at december 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
in light of the volatility in global economic markets in recent years, we have procedures in place within countries where we have collectability concerns to facilitate customer-by-customer risk assessment when estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts.  these procedures include monthly credit control committee meetings, at which customer credit risks are identified after review of, among other things, accounts that exceed specified credit limits, payment delinquencies and other customer issues.  in addition, with respect to government customers, we evaluate receivables for potential collection risks associated with any limitations on the availability of government funding and reimbursement practices.  to reduce risk exposures with respect to certain of our non-government customers, we have instituted procedures that include reducing credit limits and requiring that payments accompany orders. some of our customers, particularly in greece, italy, spain and portugal, have extended or delayed payments for products and services already provided resulting in collectability concerns regarding our accounts receivable from these customers. if the financial condition of these customers or the healthcare systems in these countries deteriorate to the extent that the ability of an increasing number of customers to make payments is uncertain, additional allowances may be required in future periods.
although we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts to cover the estimated losses which may occur when customers cannot make their required payments, we cannot be assured that the allowances will be sufficient to cover future losses given the volatility in the worldwide economy and the possibility that other, unanticipated events may adversely affect collectability of the accounts.  if our allowance for doubtful accounts is insufficient to address receivables we ultimately determine are uncollectible, we would be required to incur additional charges, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations.  moreover, our inability to collect outstanding receivables could adversely affect our financial condition and cash flow from operations.
distributor rebates we offer rebates to certain distributors and record a reserve with respect to the estimated amount of the rebates as a reduction of revenues at the time of sale. in estimating rebates, we consider the lag time between the point of sale and the payment of the distributor's rebate claim, distributor-specific trend analyses, contractual commitments, including stated rebate rates, historical experience and other relevant information. when necessary, we adjust the reserves, with a corresponding adjustment to revenue, to reflect differences between estimated and actual experience. historical adjustments to recorded reserves have not been significant and we do not expect significant revisions of these estimates in the future. the reserve for estimated rebates was $12.2 million and $11.6 million at december 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. we expect to pay amounts subject to the reserve as of december 31, 2017 within 90 days subsequent to year-end.
inventory utilization inventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value. we maintain a reserve for excess and obsolete inventory that reduces the carrying value of our inventories to reflect the diminution of value resulting from product obsolescence, damage or other issues affecting marketability. the reduction in carrying value is equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and its estimated net realizable value.  factors utilized in the determination of estimated net realizable value and whether a reserve is required include (i) current sales data and historical return rates, (ii) estimates of future demand, (iii) competitive pricing pressures, (iv) new product introductions, (v) product expiration dates, and (vi) component and packaging obsolescence.
the adequacy of the reserve is reviewed each reporting period and adjusted as necessary.  we regularly compare inventory quantities on hand against historical usage or forecasts related to specific items in order to evaluate obsolescence and excessive quantities. in assessing historical usage, we also qualitatively assess business trends to evaluate the reasonableness of using historical information in estimating future usage.
our inventory reserve was $35.6 million and $36.4 million at december 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, which represents 8.3% and 10.3% of gross inventories at those respective dates.
55
long-lived assets we assess the remaining useful life and recoverability of long-lived assets whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. for example, such an assessment may be initiated if, as a result of a change in expectations, we believe it is more likely than not that the asset will be sold or disposed of significantly before the end of its useful life or if an adverse change occurs in the business employing the asset. significant judgments in this area involve determining whether such events or circumstances have occurred and determining the appropriate asset group requiring evaluation. the recoverability evaluation is based on various analyses, including undiscounted cash flow projections, which involve significant management judgment. any impairment loss, if indicated, equals the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset.
goodwill and other intangible assets intangible assets include indefinite-lived assets (such as goodwill, certain trade names and in-process research and development ("ipr&d")), as well as finite-lived intangibles (such as trade names that do not have indefinite lives, customer relationships, intellectual property and distribution rights). the costs of finite-lived intangibles are amortized to expense over their estimated useful life. determining the useful life of an intangible asset requires considerable judgment as different types of intangible assets typically will have different useful lives. goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized; we test these assets annually for impairment during the fourth quarter, using the first day of the quarter as the measurement date, or earlier upon the occurrence of certain events or substantive changes in circumstances that indicate an impairment may have occurred. such conditions may include an economic downturn in a geographic market or a change in the assessment of future operations. our impairment testing for goodwill is performed separately from our impairment testing of indefinite-lived intangibles.
considerable management judgment is necessary in making the assumptions used in the impairment analysis including evaluating the impact of operating and macroeconomic changes and estimating future cash flows, which are key elements in determining fair value. assumptions we use in our impairment evaluations, such as forecasted growth rates and cost of capital, are consistent with our internal projections and operating plans. we believe these assumptions and estimates are also comparable to those that would be used by other marketplace participants.
goodwill goodwill impairment assessments are performed at a reporting unit level. for purposes of this assessment, a reporting unit is an operating segment, or a business one level below that operating segment. we have ten reporting units. in applying the goodwill impairment test, we may assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. qualitative factors may include, but are not limited to, macroeconomic conditions, industry conditions, the competitive environment, changes in the market for our products and services, regulatory and political developments, and entity specific factors such as strategies and financial performance. if, after completing the qualitative assessment, we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, we proceed to a two-step quantitative impairment test, described below. alternatively, we may test goodwill for impairment through the two-step quantitative impairment test without conducting the qualitative analysis. under guidance issued by the financial accounting standards board, the quantitative goodwill impairment test will be simplified, effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15, 2019, subject to optional early adoption. see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form 10-k for additional information.
the first step of the two-step impairment test is to compare the fair value of a reporting unit to the carrying value. in performing the first step, we calculate the fair value of the reporting unit using equal weighting of two methods; one which estimates the discounted cash flows of the reporting unit based on projected earnings in the future (the income approach) and one which is based on sales of similar businesses to those of the reporting unit in actual transactions (the market approach).  if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value, there is no impairment. if the reporting unit carrying value exceeds the fair value, we recognize an impairment loss based on the amount by which the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, which we determine in the second step of the two-step test. the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by deducting the fair value of a reporting unit's identifiable assets and liabilities from the fair value of the reporting unit as a whole, as if that reporting unit had just been acquired and the fair value of the individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed were being determined initially.
56
determining fair value requires the exercise of significant judgment. the more significant judgments and assumptions used in the income approach include (1) the amount and timing of expected future cash flows, which are based primarily on our estimates of future sales, operating income, industry trends and the regulatory environment of the individual reporting units, (2) the expected long-term growth rates for each of our reporting units, which approximate the expected long-term growth rate of the global economy and of the medical device industry, and (3) discount rates that are used to discount future cash flows to their present values, which are based on an assessment of the risk inherent in the future cash flows of the respective reporting units along with various market based inputs.  the more significant judgments and assumptions used in the market approach include (1) determination of appropriate revenue and ebitda multiples used to estimate a reporting unit's fair value and (2) the selection of appropriate comparable companies to be used for purposes of determining those multiples. there were no changes to the underlying methods used in 2017 as compared to the valuations of our reporting units in 2016.
our expected future growth rates estimated for purposes of the goodwill impairment test are based on our estimates of future sales, operating income and cash flow and are consistent with our internal budgets and business plans, which reflect a modest amount of core revenue growth coupled with the successful launch of new products each year; the effect of these growth indicators more than offset volume losses from products that are expected to reach the end of their life cycle. changes in assumptions underlying the income approach could cause a reporting unit's carrying value to exceed its fair value. while we believe our assumed growth rates of sales and cash flows are reasonable, the possibility remains that the revenue growth of a reporting unit may not be as high as expected, and, as a result, the estimated fair value of that reporting unit may decline. in this regard, if our strategy and new products are not successful and we do not achieve anticipated core revenue growth in the future with respect to a reporting unit, the goodwill in the reporting unit may become impaired and, in such case, we may incur material impairment charges. moreover, changes in revenue and ebitda multiples in actual transactions from those historically present could result in an assessment that a reporting unit's carrying value exceeds its fair value, in which case we also may incur material impairment charges.
we did not record any goodwill impairment charges as a result of the annual goodwill impairment testing performed during the fourth quarter 2017. as noted above under "changes in reporting segments," because changes in our operating segments during the fourth quarter 2017 affected certain of our reporting units, we reallocated the goodwill balances of the reporting units based on their relative fair values and performed goodwill impairment analyses on those reporting units. we did not record any goodwill impairment charges as a result of these analyses.
other intangible assets intangible assets are assets acquired that lack physical substance and that meet the specified criteria for recognition apart from goodwill. management tests indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually, and more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment may have occurred. similar to the goodwill impairment test process, we may assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying value. if, after completing the qualitative assessment, we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset is greater than its carrying amount, the asset is not impaired. if we conclude it is more likely than not that the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than the carrying value, we then proceed to a quantitative impairment test, which consists of a comparison of the fair value of the intangible asset to its carrying amount. alternatively, we may elect to forgo the qualitative analysis and test the indefinite-lived intangible asset for impairment through the quantitative impairment test.
in connection with the quantitative impairment test, since quoted market prices are seldom available for intangible assets, we utilize several present value techniques to estimate fair value. the fair value of trade names and ipr&d is estimated by the use of a relief from royalty method, a form of income approach that values an intangible asset by estimating the royalties saved through the ownership of an asset. under this method, an owner of an intangible asset determines the arm's length royalty that likely would have been charged if the owner had to license the asset from a third party. the value of the hypothetical royalty, which is based on the estimated royalty rate applied against forecasted sales, is tax-effected and discounted to present value using a discount rate commensurate with the relative risk of achieving the cash flow attributable to the asset. management must estimate the volume of sales, hypothetical royalty rate, discount rate, and terminal growth rate to estimate the hypothetical royalty associated with the asset.  discount rate assumptions are based on an assessment of the risk inherent in the future cash flows generated from the intangible asset. assumptions about royalty rates are based on the rates at which similar intangible assets are being licensed in the marketplace.
57
no impairment was recorded as a result of the annual indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment testing performed during the fourth quarter 2017. for the year ended december 31, 2016, we recognized a pre-tax ipr&d impairment charge of $41.0 million. see "restructuring and impairment charges" within "result of operations" above as well as note 4 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10-k for additional information on this charge.
pensions and other postretirement benefits we provide a range of benefits to eligible employees and retired employees, including under plans that provide pension and postretirement healthcare benefits. several statistical and other factors that are designed to project future events are used in calculating the expense and liability related to these plans. these factors include actuarial assumptions about discount rates, expected rates of return on plan assets, compensation increases, turnover rates and healthcare cost trend rates. we review the actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and make modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when appropriate.
significant differences in our actual experience or significant changes in our assumptions may materially affect our pension and other postretirement obligations and our future expense. the following table shows the sensitivity of plan expenses and benefit obligations to changes in the weighted average assumptions:
assumed discount rate                                                   expected return on plan assets                          assumed healthcare trend rate

share-based compensation we estimate the fair value of share-based awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model. the value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense over the requisite service periods. share-based compensation expense related to stock options is measured using a black-scholes option pricing model that takes into account subjective and complex assumptions with respect to expected life of options, volatility, risk-free interest rate and expected dividend yield. the expected life of options granted represents the period of time that options are expected to be outstanding, which is derived from the vesting period of the award, as well as historical exercise behavior. expected volatility is based on a blend of historical volatility and implied volatility derived from publicly traded options to purchase our common stock, which we believe is more reflective of market conditions and a better indicator of expected volatility than solely using historical volatility. the risk-free interest rate is the implied yield currently available on united states treasury zero-coupon issues with a remaining term equal to the expected life of the option. share based compensation expense for 2017, 2016 and 2015 was $19.4 million, $16.9 million and $14.5 million, respectively.
contingent consideration liabilities in connection with an acquisition, we may be required to pay future consideration that is contingent upon the achievement of specified objectives, such as receipt of regulatory approval, commercialization of a product or achievement of sales targets. as of the acquisition date, we record a contingent liability representing the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration we expect to pay. we determined the fair value of the contingent consideration liability related to the neotract acquisition, which represented the vast majority of our contingent consideration liabilities at december 31, 2017, using a monte carlo valuation approach, which simulates future revenues during the earn out-period using management's best estimates. we determined the fair value of our other contingent consideration liabilities using a probability-weighted discounted cash flow analysis. increases in projected revenues and probabilities of payment may result in significantly higher fair value measurements; decreases in these items may have the opposite effect. increases in discount rates and the period prior to payment may result in significantly lower fair value

measurements; decreases in these items may have the opposite effect. see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10-k for additional information.
we remeasure the liability each reporting period and recognize the change in the liability's fair value within selling, general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statement of income. as of december 31, 2017 and 2016, we accrued $272.1 million and $7.1 million of contingent consideration, respectively. for the year ended december 31, 2017 there were no changes to the estimated probabilities associated with the contingent consideration liabilities. for the years ended december 31 2016 and 2015, we recognized a reduction to contingent consideration of $8.3 million and $4.4 million, respectively, resulting from changes in estimated probabilities associated with certain regulatory and sales milestones.
income taxes our annual provision for income taxes and determination of the deferred tax assets and liabilities require management to assess uncertainties, make judgments regarding outcomes and utilize estimates. we conduct a broad range of operations around the world, subjecting us to complex tax regulations in numerous international jurisdictions, resulting at times in tax audits, disputes with tax authorities and potential litigation, the outcome of which is uncertain. in connection with its estimates of our tax assets and liabilities, management must, among other things, make judgments about the outcome of these uncertain matters. deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured and recorded using currently enacted tax rates, which we expect will apply to taxable income in the years in which differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their tax bases are recovered or settled. the likelihood of a material change in our expected realization of these assets is dependent on future taxable income, our ability to use foreign tax credit carryforwards and carrybacks, final united states and foreign tax settlements, changes in tax law, and the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies in the various relevant jurisdictions. while management believes that its judgments and interpretations regarding income taxes are appropriate, significant differences in actual experience may require future adjustments to our tax assets and liabilities, which could be material.
in assessing the realizability of our deferred tax assets, we evaluate positive and negative evidence and use judgments regarding past and future events, including results of operations and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the deferred tax assets. based on this assessment, we determine when it is more likely than not that all or some portion of our deferred tax assets may not be realized, in which case we apply a valuation allowance to offset the amount of such deferred tax assets.  to the extent facts and circumstances change in the future, adjustments to the valuation allowances may be required. the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets of $104.8 million and $104.5 million at december 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, relates principally to the uncertainty of the utilization of tax loss and credit carryforwards in various jurisdictions.
significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions and in evaluating tax positions. we establish additional provisions for income taxes when, despite the belief that tax positions are supportable, there remain certain positions that do not meet the minimum probability threshold, which is a tax position that is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the applicable taxing authority. in the normal course of business, we are examined by various federal, state and foreign tax authorities. we regularly assess the potential outcomes of these examinations and any future examinations for the current or prior years in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. we adjust the income tax provision, the current tax liability and deferred taxes in any period in which we become aware of facts that necessitate an adjustment. we are currently under examination in canada, germany, italy and the united states. the ultimate outcome of these examinations could result in increases or decreases to our recorded tax liabilities, which would affect our financial results. see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form 10-k for additional information regarding our uncertain tax positions.
as noted above, the tcja significantly changes u.s. tax law. as permitted by sab 118, we have included in our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31, 2017, provisional amounts reflecting the tax impact related to deemed repatriated earnings and the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities. once our accounting for the income tax effects of the tcja is complete, the amounts with respect to the income tax effects of the tcja may differ from these provisional amounts, possibly materially, due to, among other things, additional analysis, changes in interpretations and assumptions we have made, additional regulatory guidance that may be issued, and actions we may take as a result of the tcja. see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10-k for additional information.

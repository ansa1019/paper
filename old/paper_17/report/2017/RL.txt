item 1a.   risk factors there are risks associated with an investment in our securities. the following risk factors should be read carefully in connection with evaluating our business and the forward-looking statements contained in this annual report on form 10-k. any of the following risk factors could materially adversely affect our business, our prospects, our results of operations, our financial condition, our liquidity, the trading price of our securities, and/or the actual outcome of matters as to which forward-looking statements are made in this report. additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently view as immaterial may also materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition in future periods or if circumstances change.
the loss of the services of mr. ralph lauren, members of our executive management team, or other key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business.
mr. ralph lauren's leadership in the design and marketing areas of our business has been a critical element of our success since the inception of our company. mr. r. lauren is instrumental to, and closely identified with, our brand that bears his name. our ability to maintain our brand image and leverage the goodwill associated with mr. r. lauren's name may be damaged if we were to lose his services. the death or disability of mr. r. lauren or other extended or permanent loss of his services, or any negative market or industry perception with respect to him or arising from his loss, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
we also depend on the service and management experience of other key executive officers and other members of senior management who have substantial experience and expertise in our industry and our business and have made significant contributions to our growth and success. competition in our industry to attract and retain these employees is intense and is influenced by our reputation, our ability to offer competitive compensation and benefits, and economic conditions, among other factors. the loss of the services of any of our key executive officers or other members of senior management, or one or more of our other key personnel, or the concurrent loss of several of these individuals or any negative public perception with respect to these individuals, could also have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
we are not protected by a material amount of key-man or similar life insurance covering our executive officers, including mr. r. lauren, or other members of senior management. we have entered into employment agreements with certain of our executive officers, but competition for experienced executives in our industry is intense and the non-compete period with respect to certain of our executive officers could, in some circumstances in the event of their termination of employment with our company, end prior to the employment term set forth in their employment agreements.
recent changes in our executive and senior management team, including the departure of mr. stefan larsson and the appointment of mr. patrice louvet, may be disruptive to, or cause uncertainty in, our business.
effective may 2017, mr. stefan larsson departed as the company's president and ceo and as a member of our board of directors. subsequent to mr. larsson's departure, mr. patrice louvet was appointed as the company's new president and ceo and as a member of our board of directors, effective july 2017. our ability to continue to execute our growth strategy may be adversely affected or delayed by the uncertainty associated with this transition. in addition to mr. larsson's departure, certain other members of our executive and senior management team have departed in recent years, and we may implement other management and organizational changes in connection with our growth strategy. any changes in our executive and senior management team may be disruptive to, or cause uncertainty in, our business and future strategic direction. the departure of certain key individuals and the failure to ensure a smooth transition and effective transfer of knowledge involving senior employees could hinder or delay our strategic planning and execution, as well as adversely affect our ability to attract and retain other experienced and talented employees. any such disruption or uncertainty could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. further, such disruption may hinder our ability to maintain an effective system of internal controls and compliance with the requirements under the sarbanes-oxley act of 2002.
we cannot assure the successful implementation of our growth strategy.
we have developed a long-term growth strategy with the objective of delivering sustainable, profitable growth and long-term value creation for shareholders, as described in item 1 - "business - objectives and opportunities." our ability to successfully execute our growth strategy is subject to various risks and uncertainties, as described within this "risk factors" section of our form 10-k.
21
although we believe that our growth strategy will lead to long-term growth in revenue and profitability, there can be no assurance regarding the timing of or extent to which we will realize the anticipated benefits, if at all. our failure to realize the anticipated benefits, which may be due to our inability to execute the various elements of our growth strategy, changes in consumer preferences, competition, economic conditions, and other risks described herein, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. our failure could also result in the implementation of additional restructuring-related activities, which may be dilutive to our earnings in the short term.
achievement of our growth strategy may require investment in new capabilities, distribution channels, and technologies. these investments may result in short-term costs without accompanying current revenues and, therefore, may be dilutive to our earnings in the short term. there can be no assurance regarding the timing of or extent to which we will realize the anticipated benefits of these investments and other costs, if at all.
we may not fully realize the expected cost savings and/or operating efficiencies from our restructuring plans.
we have implemented restructuring plans to support key strategic initiatives, such as the way forward plan, as described in item 1 - "business - recent developments." although designed to deliver long-term sustainable growth, restructuring plans present significant potential risks that may impair our ability to achieve anticipated operating enhancements and/or cost reductions, or otherwise harm our business, including:
•   higher than anticipated costs in implementing planned workforce reductions, particularly in highly regulated locations outside the u.s.;
•   higher than anticipated lease termination and store closure costs (see "our business is subject to risks associated with leasing real estate and other assets under long-term, non-cancellable leases");
•   failure to meet operational targets or customer requirements due to the loss of employees or inadequate transfer of knowledge;
•   failure to maintain adequate controls and procedures while executing, and subsequent to completing, our restructuring plans;
•   diversion of management attention and resources from ongoing business activities and/or a decrease in employee morale;
•   attrition beyond any planned reduction in workforce; and
•   damage to our reputation and brand image due to our restructuring-related activities, including the closure of certain of our stores.
if we are not successful in implementing and managing our restructuring plans, we may not be able to achieve targeted operating enhancements, sales growth, and/or cost reductions, which could adversely impact our business, results of operations, and financial condition. our failure to achieve targeted results could also lead to the implementation of additional restructuring-related activities, which may be dilutive to our earnings in the short term.
we may not be successful in the expansion of our multi-channel distribution network.
implementation of our growth strategy involves the continuation and expansion of our multi-channel distribution network, including within international markets such as china, which is subject to many factors, including, but not limited to, our ability to:
•   identify new or underpenetrated markets where our products and brand will be accepted by consumers;
•   attract customers, particularly in new markets;
•   identify desirable freestanding and department store locations, the availability of which may be out of our control;
•   negotiate acceptable lease terms, including desired tenant improvement allowances;
•   efficiently and cost effectively build-out stores and shop-within-shop locations;
•   source sufficient inventory levels to meet the needs of the new stores and shop-within-shops;
22
•   hire, train, and retain competent store personnel; and
•   integrate new stores and shop-within-shops into our existing systems and operations.
any of these challenges could delay or otherwise prevent us from successfully executing our distribution expansion strategy. there can be no assurance that our new stores and shop-within-shops will be successful and profitable or if the capital costs associated with the build-out of such new locations will be recovered. further, entry into new markets may bring us into competition with new or existing competitors that have a more established market presence than us or other competitive advantages. other risks related to our international expansion plans include general economic conditions in specific countries or markets, changes in diplomatic and trade relationships, political instability, and foreign government regulation, among other risks described herein. if our expansion plans are unsuccessful or do not deliver an appropriate return on our investments, our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be adversely affected.
the success of our business also depends on our ability to continue to maintain, enhance, and expand our digital footprint and capabilities. consumers are increasingly shopping online using computers, smartphones, tablets, and other devices. any failure on our part, or on the part of our third party digital partners, to provide attractive, reliable, secure, and user-friendly digital commerce platforms could negatively impact our customers' shopping experience resulting in reduced website traffic, diminished loyalty to our brands, and lost sales. in addition, as we continue to expand and increase the global presence of our digital commerce business, sales from our brick and mortar stores and wholesale channels of distribution in areas where digital commerce sites are introduced may decline due to changes in consumer shopping habits and cannibalization.
the success of our business depends on our ability to respond to constantly changing fashion and retail trends and consumer demands in a timely manner, develop products that resonate with our existing customers and attract new customers, and provide a seamless shopping experience to our customers.
the industries in which we operate have historically been subject to rapidly changing fashion trends and consumer preferences. our success depends in large part on our ability to originate and define fashion product and home product trends, as well as to anticipate, gauge, and react to changing consumer demands in a timely manner. our products must appeal to a broad range of consumers worldwide whose preferences cannot be predicted with certainty and are subject to rapid change, influenced by fashion trends, current economic conditions, and weather conditions, among other factors. this issue is further compounded by the increasing use of digital and social media by consumers and the speed by which information and opinions are shared across the globe. we cannot assure that we will be able to continue to develop appealing styles or successfully meet constantly changing consumer demands in the future. in addition, we cannot assure that any new products or brands that we introduce will be successfully received by consumers. any failure on our part to anticipate, identify, and respond effectively to changing consumer demands and fashion trends could adversely affect retail and consumer acceptance of our products and leave us with a substantial amount of unsold inventory or missed opportunities. conversely, if we underestimate consumer demand for our products or if manufacturers fail to supply quality products in a timely manner, we may experience inventory shortages. any of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. for a discussion of risks related to our inventory management, see "our profitability may decline if we are unable to effectively manage inventory or as a result of increasing pressure on margins."
our marketing and advertising programs are integral to the success of our product offerings and on our ability to attract new customers and retain existing customers. our communication campaigns are increasingly being executed through digital and social media platforms to drive further engagement with the younger consumer, with a focus on influencers. however, we cannot assure that our marketing and advertising programs will be successful or appeal to consumers.
the success of our business also depends on our ability to continue to develop and maintain a reliable omni-channel experience for our customers. our business has evolved from an in-store experience to a shopping experience through multiple technologies, including computers, smartphones, tablets, and other devices, as our customers have become increasingly technologically savvy. we are increasingly using digital and social media platforms to interact with customers and as a means to enhance their shopping experience. if we are unable to develop and continuously improve our customer-facing technologies, we may not be able to provide a convenient and consistent experience to our customers regardless of the sales channel. this could negatively affect our ability to compete with other retailers and result in diminished loyalty to our brands, which could adversely impact our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
we have also implemented, and expect to continue to implement, new store design concepts as part of our growth strategy. there can be no assurance that any of our new store designs will resonate with customers or otherwise achieve the desired sales and profitability measures necessary to recover our initial capital investments. if we are unable to successfully develop new store designs, or if customers are not receptive to the design layout or visual merchandising, our business, results of operations, and
23
financial condition could be adversely affected. in addition, the failure of new store designs to achieve acceptable results could lead to our decision to close a store prior to the lease expiration date. for additional discussion of risks related to the early termination of our leases, see "our business is subject to risks associated with leasing real estate and other assets under long-term, non-cancellable leases."
the success of our business depends on our ability to retain the value and reputation of our brands.
our success depends on the value and reputation of our brands and our ability to consistently anticipate, identify, and respond to customers' demands, preferences, and fashion trends in the design, pricing, and production of our products, including the preference for certain products to be manufactured in the u.s. as the ralph lauren name is integral to our business, any negative publicity regarding mr. r. lauren or our company, especially through social media which accelerates and increases the potential scope of negative publicity, could negatively impact the image of our brands with our customers and result in diminished loyalty to our brands, even if the subject of such publicity is unverified or inaccurate. additionally, our failure to comply with ethical, social, product safety, labor, health, environmental or other standards and regulations could damage the reputation of our brands and lead to adverse consumer actions, as well as expose us to government enforcement action and/or private litigation. even if we react appropriately to negative publicity, our customers' perception of our brand image and our reputation could be negatively impacted. any failure on our part to retain the value and reputation of brands could adversely impact our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
we face intense competition worldwide in the markets in which we operate.
we face increasing competition from companies selling apparel, accessories, home, and other of our product categories through the internet. although we sell our products through the internet, increased competition and promotional activity in the worldwide apparel, accessory, and home product industries from internet-based competitors could reduce our sales, prices, and margins and adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. we also face intense competition from other domestic and foreign fashion-oriented apparel, footwear, accessory, and casual apparel producers that sell products through brick and mortar stores and wholesale and licensing channels. we compete with these companies primarily on the basis of:
•   anticipating and responding in a timely fashion to changing consumer demands and shopping preferences, including the increasing shift to digital brand engagement, social media communications, and online shopping;
•   creating and maintaining favorable brand recognition, loyalty, and a reputation for quality;
•   developing and producing innovative, high-quality products in sizes, colors, and styles that appeal to consumers of varying age groups;
•   competitively pricing our products and creating an acceptable value proposition for consumers;
•   providing strong and effective marketing support;
•   obtaining sufficient retail floor space and effective presentation of our products at retail stores;
•   attracting consumer traffic to both retail stores and websites;
•   sourcing raw materials at cost-effective prices;
•   anticipating and maintaining proper inventory levels;
•   ensuring product availability and optimizing supply chain and distribution efficiencies with third-party manufacturers and retailers;
•   recruiting and retaining key employees;
•   maintaining and growing market share; and
•   protecting our intellectual property.
some of our competitors may be significantly larger and more diversified and may have greater financial, marketing, and distribution resources, more desirable store locations, and/or greater digital commerce presence than us, among other competitive advantages. such competitive advantages may enable them to better withstand unfavorable economic conditions, compete more effectively on the basis of price and production, and/or more quickly respond to rapidly changing fashion trends and consumer
24
demands than us. in addition, technological advances and the retail industry's low barriers to entry allow for the introduction of new competitors and products at a rapid pace.
any increased competition, or our failure to adequately address any of these competitive factors, could result in reduced market share or sales, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
our profitability may decline if we are unable to effectively manage inventory or as a result of increasing pressure on margins.
we have implemented key strategic initiatives designed to optimize our inventory levels and improve the efficiency and responsiveness of our supply chain. although we have shortened lead times for the design, sourcing, and production of certain of our product lines, we expect to continue to place orders with our vendors for the majority of our products in advance of the related selling season. as a result, we are vulnerable to changes in consumer preferences and demand and pricing shifts. our failure to continue to shorten lead times or to correctly anticipate consumer preferences and demand could result in the build-up of excess inventory. if that occurs, we may be forced to rely on less preferred distribution channels, markdowns, promotional sales, destruction, or donations to dispose of excess, slow-moving inventory, which may negatively impact our overall profitability and/or impair the image of our brands. conversely, if we underestimate consumer demand for our products or if manufacturers fail to supply quality products in a timely manner, we may experience inventory shortages, which may negatively impact customer relationships, diminish brand loyalty, and result in lost sales. any of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
additionally, our industry is subject to significant pricing pressure caused by many factors, including intense competition and a highly promotional retail environment, consolidation in the retail industry, pressure from retailers to reduce the costs of products, and changes in consumer spending patterns. although we have reduced our promotional activity in connection with our quality of sales initiatives, these factors may cause us to reduce our sales prices to retailers and consumers, which could cause our gross margin to decline if we are unable to appropriately manage inventory levels and/or otherwise offset price reductions with comparable reductions in our costs. if our sales prices decline and we fail to sufficiently reduce our product costs or operating expenses, our profitability will decline. this could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. in addition, changes in our customer, channel, and geographic sales mix could have a negative impact on our profitability.
our business is subject to risks associated with leasing real estate and other assets under long-term, non-cancellable leases.
we generally operate most of our retail stores and corporate facilities under long-term, non-cancellable leasing arrangements. our retail store leases typically require us to make minimum rental payments, and often contingent rental payments based upon sales. in addition, our leases generally require us to pay our proportionate share of the cost of insurance, taxes, maintenance, and utilities. we generally cannot cancel our leases at our option. if we decide to close a store, or if we decide to downsize, consolidate, or relocate any of our corporate facilities, we may be required to record an impairment charge and/or exit costs associated with the disposal of the store or corporate facility. in addition, we may remain obligated under the applicable lease for, among other things, payment of the base rent for the remaining lease term, even after the space is exited. such costs and obligations related to the early closure of our stores or termination of our leases, such as the recent closing of our polo store at 711 fifth avenue in new york city, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. in addition, as each of our leases naturally expires, we may be unable to negotiate renewals, either on commercially acceptable terms or at all, which could lead store closures resulting in lost sales.
economic, political, and other conditions may adversely affect the level of consumer purchases of discretionary items and luxury retail products, including our products.
the industries in which we operate are cyclical. many economic and other factors outside of our control affect the level of consumer spending in the apparel, cosmetic, fragrance, accessory, jewelry, watch, and home product industries, including, among others:
•   actual and perceived economic conditions;
•   employment levels and wage rates;
•   stock market performance;
•   inflation;
•   interest rates;
25
•   foreign currency exchange rates;
•   the housing market;
•   consumer debt levels;
•   the availability of consumer credit;
•   commodity prices, including fuel and energy costs;
•   taxation;
•   consumer confidence in future economic conditions;
•   general domestic and international political conditions;
•   the threat, outbreak, or escalation of terrorism, military conflicts, or other hostilities; and
•   weather conditions.
consumer purchases of discretionary items and luxury retail products, including our products, tend to decline during recessionary periods and at other times when disposable income is lower. unfavorable economic conditions and other factors may also reduce consumers' willingness and ability to travel to major cities and vacation destinations in which our stores are located. further, consumers may prefer to spend more of their discretionary income on "experiences," such as dining and entertainment, over consumer goods. a downturn or an uncertain outlook in the economies in which we, or our wholesale and licensing partners, sell our products may materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. see item 7 - "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - global economic conditions and industry trends" for further discussion.
a data security or privacy breach could damage our reputation and our relationships with our customers or employees, expose us to litigation risk, and adversely affect our business.
we are dependent on information technology systems and networks, including the internet, for a significant portion of our direct-to-consumer sales, including our digital commerce operations and retail business credit card transaction authorization and processing. we are also responsible for storing data relating to our customers and employees and rely on third parties for the operation of our digital commerce websites and for the various social media tools and websites we use as part of our marketing strategy. in our normal course of business, we often collect, retain, and transmit certain sensitive and confidential customer information, including credit card information, over public networks. there is significant concern by consumers, employees, and lawmakers alike over the security of personal information transmitted over the internet, consumer identity theft, and user privacy, as cyber-criminals are becoming increasingly more sophisticated in their attempts to gain unauthorized access to computer systems and confidential or sensitive data.
we have a longstanding information security risk program committed to regular risk management practices surrounding the protection of confidential data. this program includes various technical controls, including security monitoring, data leakage protection, network segmentation and access controls around the computer resources that house confidential or sensitive data. we have also implemented employee awareness training programs around phishing, malware, and other cyber risks. we continually evaluate the security environment surrounding the handling and control of our critical data, especially the private data we receive from our customers, employees and partners, and have instituted additional measures to help protect us from system intrusion or data breaches. additionally, we have purchased network security and cyber liability insurance in order to provide a level of financial protection, should a data breach occur.
despite the security measures we currently have in place, our facilities and systems and those of our third-party service providers may be vulnerable to security breaches, acts of vandalism, phishing attacks, computer viruses, misplaced or lost data, programming and/or human errors, or other internet or email events. the increased use of smartphones, tablets, and other devices may also heighten these and other operational risks. the retail industry in particular continues to be the target of many cyber-attacks, which are becoming increasingly more difficult to anticipate and prevent due to their rapidly evolving nature. the technology we use to protect our systems from being breached or compromised could become outdated as a result of advances in computer capabilities or other technological developments. additionally, measures we implement to protect our computer systems against cyber-attacks may make them harder to use or reduce the speed at which they operate, which in turn could negatively impact our customers' shopping experience resulting in reduced website traffic, diminished loyalty to our brands, and lost sales.
26
any perceived or actual electronic or physical security breach involving the misappropriation, loss, or other unauthorized disclosure of confidential or personally identifiable information, including penetration of our network security, whether by us or by a third party, could disrupt our business, severely damage our reputation and our relationships with our customers or employees, expose us to risks of litigation, significant fines and penalties, and liability, and result in deterioration in our customers' and employees' confidence in us, and adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. since we do not control third-party service providers and cannot guarantee that no electronic or physical computer break-ins and security breaches will occur in the future, any perceived or actual unauthorized disclosure of personally identifiable information regarding our employees, customers or website visitors could harm our reputation and credibility, result in lost sales, impair our ability to attract website visitors, and/or reduce our ability to attract and retain employees and customers. as these threats develop and grow, we may find it necessary to make significant further investments to protect data and our infrastructure, including the implementation of new computer systems or upgrades to existing systems, deployment of additional personnel and protection-related technologies, engagement of third-party consultants, and training of employees. in addition, as the regulatory environment relating to information security and privacy is becoming increasingly more demanding, we may also incur significant costs in complying with the various applicable state, federal, and foreign laws regarding protection of, and unauthorized disclosure of, personal information.
risks and uncertainties associated with the implementation of information systems may negatively impact our business.
we are continually improving and upgrading our computer systems and software. for example, as part of a multi-year plan to integrate and upgrade our global systems and processes, we recently completed the migration of our european operations to sap, the operating and financial reporting information technology system used by our north america operations. we also transitioned our north america digital commerce operations to a third-party cloud-based platform during fiscal 2018, and we have plans to transition our other digital commerce operations during fiscal 2019 and beyond.
implementation of new information systems, such as the global operating and financial reporting system recently implemented, or the transition to a new digital commerce platform, involves risks and uncertainties. any disruptions, delays, or deficiencies in the design, implementation, or transition of such systems could result in increased costs, disruptions in the sourcing, sale, and shipment of our product, delays in the collection of cash from our customers, and/or adversely affect our ability to accurately report our financial results in a timely manner, all of which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. for additional discussion of risks related to our information systems, see "our business could suffer if our computer systems and websites are disrupted or cease to operate effectively."
our business could suffer if our computer systems and websites are disrupted or cease to operate effectively.
we are dependent on our computer systems to record and process transactions and manage and operate our business, including in designing, marketing, manufacturing, importing, tracking, and distributing our products, processing payments, accounting for and reporting financial results, and managing our employees and employee benefit programs. we also utilize an automated replenishment system to facilitate the processing of basic replenishment orders from our retail business and our wholesale customers, the movement of goods through distribution channels, and the collection of information for planning and forecasting. in addition, we have digital commerce and other informational internet websites in north america, europe, and asia, including australia and new zealand, and have plans for additional digital commerce sites in the future. given the complexity of our business and the significant number of transactions that we engage in on a daily basis, it is imperative that we maintain uninterrupted operation of our computer hardware and software systems. despite our preventative efforts, our systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from, among other things, security breaches, computer viruses, technical malfunctions, inadequate system capacity, power outages, natural disasters, and usage errors by our employees or third-party consultants. if our information technology systems become damaged or otherwise cease to function properly, we may have to make significant investments to repair or replace them. additionally, confidential or sensitive data related to our customers or employees could be lost or compromised. any material disruptions in our information technology systems could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
our ability to conduct business globally may be affected by a variety of legal, regulatory, political, and economic risks.
our ability to capitalize on growth in new international markets and to maintain our current level of operations in our existing markets is subject to certain risks associated with operating in various locations around the globe. these include, but are not limited to:
•   complying with a variety of u.s. and foreign laws and regulations, including, but not limited to, trade, labor, and product safety trading restrictions, as well as the foreign corrupt practices act, which prohibits u.s. companies from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business, and similar
27
foreign country laws, such as the u.k. bribery act, which prohibits u.k. and related companies from any form of bribery;
•   adapting to local customs and culture;
•   unexpected changes in laws, judicial processes, or regulatory requirements;
•   the imposition of additional duties, tariffs, taxes, and other charges or other barriers to trade;
•   changes in diplomatic and trade relationships;
•   political instability and terrorist attacks; and
•   general economic fluctuations in specific countries or markets.
changes in regulatory, geopolitical, social, economic, or monetary policies and other factors may have a material adverse effect on our business in the future, or may require us to exit a particular market or significantly modify our current business practices. for example, there are growing concerns regarding trade relations between the u.s. and china, as both countries recently indicated their intention to impose significant tariffs on the importation of certain product categories. although the u.s. has not proposed new tariffs on apparel-related imports, it had indicated that it was considering expanding the product categories that would be subject to new tariffs. as approximately one-third of our products are sourced from china, the u.s.'s imposition of new tariffs on apparel or other goods imported from china could have a material adverse effect on our cost of sales and profitability. although we are actively reviewing options to mitigate this risk, including diverting production to other countries, there can be no assurance that we will be able to offset any increased costs through pricing actions or other means. for a discussion of risks associated with the importation of products, see "our business is subject to risks associated with importing products and the ability of our manufacturers to produce our goods on time and to our specifications."
our business could also be impacted by changes to the tax laws and regulations in the countries where we operate. for example, the organisation for economic co-operation and development, which represents a coalition of member countries, is supporting changes to numerous long-standing tax principles through its base erosion and profit shifting project, which is focused on a number of issues, including the shifting of profits among affiliated entities located in different tax jurisdictions. taxing authorities of certain foreign jurisdictions may also decide to modify existing tax laws in response to the recently enacted u.s. tax legislation commonly referred to as the tcja, as described in item 1 - "business - recent developments." we cannot predict which, if any, of these items will be enacted into law or the resulting impact any such enactment will have on our consolidated financial statements. however, if new legislation were enacted, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. for a discussion of risks related to the tcja, see "the impact to our business of recently enacted u.s. tax legislation could differ materially from our current estimates."
additionally, in june 2016, voters in the united kingdom approved an advisory referendum to withdraw from the european union, commonly referred to as "brexit." subsequently, in march 2017, the united kingdom's government invoked article 50 of the treaty on european union, which formally triggered the two-year negotiation process to exit the european union. negotiations to determine the united kingdom's future relationship with the european union, including terms of trade, are complex and there can be no assurance regarding the terms or timing of any such arrangements. a withdrawal could significantly disrupt the free movement of goods, services, and people between the united kingdom and the european union, and result in increased legal and regulatory complexities, as well as potential higher costs of conducting business in europe. the uncertainty surrounding the terms of the united kingdom's withdrawal and its consequences could adversely impact consumer and investor confidence, and the level of consumer purchases of discretionary items and luxury retail products, including our products. any of these effects, among others, could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. brexit has also contributed to significant volatility and uncertainty in global stock markets and currency exchange rates, and such volatility could continue to occur as the negotiation process progresses. for a discussion of risks related to currency exchange fluctuations, see "our business is exposed to domestic and foreign currency fluctuations."
our business is subject to risks associated with importing products and the ability of our manufacturers to produce our goods on time and to our specifications.
we do not own or operate any manufacturing facilities and depend exclusively on independent third parties for the manufacture of our products. our products are manufactured to our specifications through arrangements with over 500 foreign manufacturers in various countries. in fiscal 2018, over 97% of our products (by dollar value) were produced outside of the u.s., primarily in asia, europe, and latin america. risks inherent in importing our products include:
28
•   changes in social, political, and economic conditions or terrorist acts that could result in the disruption of trade from the countries in which our manufacturers or suppliers are located;
•   the imposition of additional regulations, quotas, or safeguards relating to imports or exports, and costs of complying with such regulations and other laws relating to the identification and reporting of the sources of minerals used in our products;
•   the imposition of additional duties, tariffs, taxes, and other charges on imports or exports;
•   unfavorable changes in the availability, cost, or quality of raw materials and commodities;
•   increases in the cost of labor, travel, and transportation;
•   disruptions of shipping and international trade caused by natural and man-made disasters, labor strikes, or other unforeseen events;
•   heightened terrorism-related security concerns, which could subject imported or exported goods to additional, more frequent, or more thorough inspections, leading to delays in the delivery of cargo;
•   decreased scrutiny by customs officials for counterfeit goods, leading to lost sales, increased costs for our anti-counterfeiting measures, and damage to the reputation of our brands;
•   pandemic and epidemic diseases, which could result in closed factories, reduced workforces, scarcity of raw materials, and scrutiny or embargoing of goods produced in infected areas;
•   the imposition of anti-dumping or countervailing duty proceedings resulting in the potential assessment of special duties; and
•   the imposition of sanctions in the form of additional duties either by the u.s. or its trading partners to remedy perceived illegal actions by national governments.
any one of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. for a discussion of risks related to the potential imposition of additional regulations and laws, see "our ability to conduct business globally may be affected by a variety of legal, regulatory, political, and economic risks."
in addition, the inability of a manufacturer to ship orders of our products in a timely manner or to meet our strict quality standards could cause us to miss the delivery date requirements of our customers for those items, which could result in cancellation of orders, refusal to accept deliveries, or a substantial reduction in purchase prices, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. prices of raw materials used to manufacture our products may also fluctuate, and increases in prices of such raw materials could have a material adverse effect on our cost of sales. furthermore, the cost of labor at many of our third-party manufacturers has been increasing significantly and, as the middle class in developing countries such as china continues to grow, it is unlikely that such cost pressure will abate. the cost of transportation remains significant as well, and it is likely that such cost will fluctuate significantly if oil prices remain volatile. we may not be able to offset such increases in raw materials, freight, or labor costs through pricing actions or other means.
fluctuations in our tax obligations and effective tax rate may result in volatility of our operating results.
we are subject to income taxes in many u.s. and certain foreign jurisdictions, with the applicable tax rates varying by jurisdiction. we record tax expense based on our estimates of future payments, which include reserves for uncertain tax positions in multiple tax jurisdictions. at any one time, multiple tax years are subject to audit by various taxing authorities. the results of these audits and negotiations with taxing authorities may affect the ultimate settlement of these issues. as a result, we expect that throughout the year there could be ongoing variability in our quarterly tax rates as events occur and exposures are evaluated. our effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may also be materially impacted by changes in the mix and level of earnings by jurisdiction or by changes to existing accounting rules. for example, accounting standards update ("asu") no. 2016-09, "improvements to employee share-based payment accounting" ("asu 2016-09"), which became effective for our company during the first quarter of fiscal 2018, has resulted in, and is expected to continue to result in, increased volatility in the provision of income taxes. see note 4 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion of asu 2016-09.
in addition, the tax laws and regulations in the countries where we operate may change, such as the recently enacted u.s. tax legislation commonly referred to as the tcja, or there may be changes in interpretation and enforcement of existing tax laws, which could materially affect our income tax expense in our consolidated financial statements. for a discussion of risks related
29
to the potential imposition of additional regulations and laws, see "our ability to conduct business globally may be affected by a variety of legal, regulatory, political, and economic risks" and "the impact to our business of recently enacted u.s. tax legislation could differ materially from our current estimates."
the impact to our business of recently enacted u.s. tax legislation could differ materially from our current estimates.
on december 22, 2017, president trump signed into law new tax legislation commonly referred to as the tcja, as described in item 1 - "business - recent developments." the tcja is complex and widely considered to be the most significant overhaul to the u.s. federal tax code since 1986.
although we expect the tcja will ultimately benefit our results of operations and financial condition in future periods, primarily due to it reducing the u.s. federal statutory income tax rate from 35% to 21%, its enactment resulted in the recognition of net charges of $221.4 million within our income tax provision during fiscal 2018. these charges were recorded on a provisional basis, as permitted by sab 118, based on our present interpretations of the tcja, current available information, and assumptions about future events. although we believe these provisional amounts represent a reasonable estimate of the ultimate enactment-related impact the tcja will have on our consolidated financial statements, the amounts could be adjusted materially as additional information becomes available and further analyses are completed. the impact of the tcja to our business in future periods is also subject to a variety of factors beyond our control including, but not limited to, (i) potential amendments to the tcja; (ii) potential changes to state, local, and foreign tax laws in response to the tcja; and (iii) potential new or interpretative guidance issued by the financial accounting standards board or the internal revenue service and other tax agencies. any of these factors could cause our actual results to differ materially from our current expectations and/or investors' expectations and there can be no assurance that the tcja will ultimately benefit our business, results of operations, and financial condition in future periods.
our business is exposed to domestic and foreign currency fluctuations.
our business is exposed to foreign currency exchange risk. specifically, changes in exchange rates between the u.s. dollar and other currencies impact our financial results from a transactional perspective, as our foreign operations generally purchase inventory in u.s. dollars, as is common for most apparel companies. given that we source most of our products overseas, the cost of these products may be affected by changes in the value of the relevant currencies. changes in currency exchange rates may also impact consumers' willingness or ability to travel abroad and/or purchase our products while traveling, as well as affect the u.s. dollar value of the foreign currency denominated prices at which our international businesses sell products. additionally, the operating results and financial position of our international subsidiaries are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as their financial results are translated from the respective local currency into u.s. dollars during the financial statement consolidation process. the foreign currencies to which we are exposed to from a transactional and translational perspective primarily include the euro, the japanese yen, the south korean won, the australian dollar, the canadian dollar, the british pound sterling, the swiss franc, the swedish krona, the chinese renminbi, the new taiwan dollar, and the hong kong dollar. the expansion of our international business increases our exposure to foreign currency exchange risk.
although we hedge certain exposures to changes in foreign currency exchange rates arising in the ordinary course of business, we cannot fully anticipate all of our currency exposures and therefore foreign currency fluctuations may have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. in addition, factors that could impact the effectiveness of our hedging activities include the volatility of currency markets, the accuracy of forecasted transactions, and the availability of hedging instruments. as such, our hedging activities may not completely mitigate the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on our results of operations. see item 7 - "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - market risk management."
a substantial portion of our revenue is derived from a limited number of large wholesale customers. our business could be adversely affected as a result of consolidations, liquidations, restructurings, other ownership changes in the retail industry, and/or any financial instability of our large wholesale customers.
several of our department store customers, including some under common ownership, account for a significant portion of our wholesale net sales. a substantial portion of sales of our licensed products by our domestic licensing partners are also made to our largest department store customers. during fiscal 2018, sales to our largest wholesale customer, macy's, accounted for approximately 8% of total net revenues. further, sales to our three largest wholesale customers, including macy's, accounted for approximately 19% of total net revenues for fiscal 2018, and constituted approximately 29% of our total gross trade accounts receivable outstanding as of march 31, 2018. substantially all sales to our three largest wholesale customers related to our north america segment.
30
we typically do not enter into long-term agreements with our customers. instead, we enter into a number of purchase order commitments with our customers for each of our product lines every season. a decision by the controlling owner of a group of stores or any other significant customer, whether motivated by competitive conditions, financial difficulties, or otherwise, to decrease or eliminate the amount of merchandise purchased from us or our licensing partners or to change their manner of doing business with us or our licensing partners or their new strategic and operational initiatives, including their continued focus on further development of their "private label" initiatives, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
in addition, as a result of unfavorable economic conditions, certain of our large wholesale customers, particularly those located in the u.s., have been highly promotional in recent years and have aggressively marked down their merchandise, including our products. such promotional activity could negatively impact our brand image and/or lead to requests from those customers for increased markdown allowances at the end of the season, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. in response and in connection with our growth plan, we began to strategically reduce shipments to certain of our customers during fiscal 2018.
the department store sector has also experienced numerous consolidations, restructurings, reorganizations, and other ownership changes in recent years. any such actions in the future could result in a reduction in the number of stores that carry our products, and the stores that remain open may purchase fewer of our products and/or reduce the retail floor space designated to our brands. there can be no assurance that consolidations, restructurings, reorganizations, or other ownership changes in the department store sector will not have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
we sell our wholesale merchandise primarily to major department stores across north america, europe, asia, australia, and latin america, and extend credit based on an evaluation of each wholesale customer's financial condition, usually without requiring collateral. however, the financial difficulties of a wholesale customer could cause us to limit or eliminate our business with that customer. we may also assume more credit risk relating to that customer's receivables. our inability to collect on our trade accounts receivable from any one of these customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. see item 1 - "business - wholesale credit control."
economic conditions could have a negative impact on our major customers, suppliers, vendors, and lenders, which in turn could materially adversely affect our business.
although we believe that our cash provided by operations and available borrowing capacity under our credit facilities and commercial paper borrowing program will provide us with sufficient liquidity, the impact of economic conditions on our major customers, suppliers, vendors, and lenders and their ability to access global capital markets cannot be predicted. the inability of major manufacturers to ship our products could impair our ability to meet the delivery date requirements of our customers. deterioration in global financial markets could affect our ability to access sources of liquidity to provide for our future cash needs, increase the cost of any future financing, or cause our lenders to be unable to meet their funding commitments under our credit facilities. a disruption in the ability of our significant customers to access liquidity could cause serious disruptions or an overall deterioration of their businesses which could lead to a significant reduction in their future orders of our products and the inability or failure on their part to meet their payment obligations to us, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
our business could suffer if we need to replace manufacturers or distribution centers.
we do not own or operate any manufacturing facilities and depend exclusively on independent third parties for the manufacture of our products. we compete with other companies for the production capacity of our manufacturers. some of these competitors have greater financial and other resources than we have, and thus may have an advantage in securing production capacity. if we experience a significant increase in demand, or if an existing manufacturer of ours must be replaced, we may have to expand our third-party manufacturing capacity. we cannot guarantee that this additional capacity will be available when required on terms that are acceptable to us. see item 1 - "business - sourcing, production and quality." we enter into a number of purchase order commitments each season specifying a time for delivery, method of payment, design and quality specifications, and other standard industry provisions, but do not have long-term contracts with any manufacturer. none of the manufacturers we use produce our products exclusively.
in addition, we rely on a number of owned and independently-operated distribution facilities around the world to warehouse and ship products to our customers and perform other related logistic services. our ability to meet the needs of our customers depends on the proper operation of these distribution centers. if any of our distribution centers were closed or were to become inoperable or inaccessible for any reason, we could experience a substantial loss of inventory, disruption of deliveries to our customers and our retail stores, increased costs, and longer lead times associated with the distribution of products during the period
31
that would be required to reopen or replace the facility. these disruptions could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
our business could be adversely affected by natural disasters and other catastrophic events in the locations in which we or our customers or suppliers operate.
we have operations, including retail, distribution, and warehousing operations, in locations subject to natural disasters, such as severe weather, geological events, and epidemic diseases, and other catastrophic events, such as terrorist attacks and military conflict, any of which could disrupt our operations. in addition, our customers and suppliers also have operations in these locations and could experience similar disruptions. the occurrence of natural disasters or other catastrophic events may result in sudden disruptions in the business operations of the local economies affected, as well as of the regional and global economies. in addition, our business can be affected by unseasonable weather conditions, such as extended periods of unseasonably warm temperatures in the winter or unseasonably cold temperatures in the summer. any of these events could result in decreased demand for our products and disruptions in our sales channels and manufacturing and distribution networks, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
our trademarks and other intellectual property rights may not be adequately protected outside the u.s.
we believe that our trademarks, intellectual property, and other proprietary rights are extremely important to our success and our competitive position. we devote substantial resources to the establishment and protection of our trademarks and anti-counterfeiting activities worldwide. however, significant counterfeiting and imitation of our products continues to exist. in the course of our international expansion we have experienced conflicts with various third parties that have acquired or claimed ownership rights to some of our key trademarks that include polo and/or a representation of a polo player astride a horse, or otherwise have contested our rights to our trademarks. we have resolved certain of these conflicts through both legal action and negotiated settlements. we cannot guarantee that the actions we have taken to establish and protect our trademarks and other proprietary rights will be adequate to prevent counterfeiting, lost business, or brand dilution, any of which may have a material adverse effect on our business. we expect to continue to devote substantial resources to challenge brands arising from imitation of our products. also, there can be no assurance that others will not assert rights in, or ownership of, trademarks and other proprietary rights of ours or that we will be able to successfully resolve these types of conflicts to our satisfaction or at all. in addition, the laws of certain foreign countries do not protect trademarks or other proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the u.s. and, as a result, our intellectual property may be more vulnerable and difficult to protect in such countries. see item 1 - "business - trademarks," and item 3 - "legal proceedings."
our business could suffer if we fail to comply with labor laws or if one of our manufacturers fails to use acceptable labor or environmental practices.
we are subject to labor laws governing relationships with employees, including minimum wage requirements, overtime, working conditions, and citizenship requirements. compliance with these laws may lead to increased costs and operational complexity and may increase our exposure to governmental investigations or litigation.
in addition, we require our licensing partners and independent manufacturers to operate in compliance with applicable laws and regulations. while our internal and vendor operating guidelines promote ethical business practices and our employees periodically visit and monitor the operations of our independent manufacturers, we do not control these manufacturers or their labor practices. the violation of labor, environmental, or other laws by an independent manufacturer used by us or one of our licensing partners, or the divergence of an independent manufacturer's or licensing partner's labor or environmental practices from those generally accepted as ethical or appropriate in the u.s., could interrupt or otherwise disrupt the shipment of finished products to us or damage our reputation. any of these events, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
certain legal proceedings, regulatory matters, and accounting changes could adversely affect our business.
we are involved in certain legal proceedings and regulatory matters and are subject from time to time to various claims involving alleged breach of contract claims, intellectual property and other related claims, escheatment and unclaimed property, credit card fraud, security breaches in certain of our retail store information systems, employment issues, consumer matters, and other litigation. certain of these lawsuits and claims, if decided adversely to us or settled by us, could result in material liability to our company or have a negative impact on our reputation or relations with our employees, customers, licensees, or other third parties. in addition, regardless of the outcome of any litigation or regulatory proceedings, such proceedings could result in substantial costs and may require our company to devote substantial time and resources to defend itself. further, changes in governmental regulations both in the u.s. and in other countries where we conduct business operations could have an adverse impact on our
32
business, results of operations, and financial condition. see item 3 - "legal proceedings" for further discussion of our company's legal matters.
in addition, we are subject to changes in accounting rules and interpretations issued by the financial accounting standards board and other regulatory agencies. if and when effective, such changes to accounting standards could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. see note 4 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a description of certain recently issued or proposed accounting standards.
the trading prices of our securities periodically may rise or fall based on the accuracy of predictions of our earnings or other financial performance, including our ability to return value to shareholders.
our business planning process is designed to maximize our long-term strength, growth, and profitability, and not to achieve an earnings target in any particular fiscal quarter. we believe that this longer-term focus is in the best interests of our company and our stockholders. at the same time, however, we recognize that, from time to time, it may be helpful to provide investors with guidance as to our quarterly and annual forecast of net sales and earnings. while we generally expect to provide updates to our guidance when we report our results each fiscal quarter, we do not have any responsibility to update any of our forward-looking statements at such times or otherwise. in addition, any longer-term guidance that we provide is based on goals that we believe, at the time guidance is given, are reasonably attainable. however, such long-range targets are more difficult to predict than our current quarter and full fiscal year expectations. if, or when, we announce actual results that differ from those that have been predicted by us, outside analysts, or others, the market price of our securities could be adversely affected. investors who rely on these predictions when making investment decisions with respect to our securities do so at their own risk. we take no responsibility for any losses suffered as a result of such changes in the prices of our securities.
in addition, we periodically return value to shareholders through our payment of quarterly cash dividends and common stock share repurchases. investors may have an expectation that we will continue to pay quarterly cash dividends, further increase our cash dividend rate, and/or repurchase shares available under our class a common stock repurchase program. our ability to pay quarterly cash dividends and repurchase our class a common stock will depend on our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations in the future. this ability may be subject to certain economic, financial, competitive, and other factors that are beyond our control. further, our board of directors may, at its discretion, elect to suspend or otherwise alter these programs at any time. the market price of our securities could be adversely affected if our cash dividend payments and/or class a common stock share repurchase activity differ from investors' expectations.
the voting shares of our company's stock are concentrated in one majority stockholder.
as of march 31, 2018, mr. ralph lauren, or entities controlled by the lauren family, held approximately 82% of the voting power of the outstanding common stock of our company. in addition, mr. r. lauren serves as our executive chairman and chief creative officer, mr. r. lauren's son, mr. david lauren, serves as our chief innovation officer, strategic advisor to the ceo, and vice chairman of the board of directors, and we employ other members of the lauren family. from time to time, we may have other business dealings with mr. r. lauren, members of the lauren family, or entities affiliated with mr. r. lauren or the lauren family. as a result of his stock ownership and position in our company, mr. r. lauren has the ability to exercise significant control over our business, including, without limitation, (i) the election of our class b common stock directors, voting separately as a class and (ii) any action requiring the approval of our stockholders, including the adoption of amendments to our certificate of incorporation and the approval of mergers or sales of all or substantially all of our assets.
we rely on our licensing partners to preserve the value of our licenses. failure to maintain licensing partners could harm our business.
the risks associated with our own products also apply to our licensed products in addition to any number of possible risks specific to a licensing partner's business, including risks associated with a particular licensing partner's ability to:
•   obtain capital;
•   execute its business plans;
•   manage its labor relations;
•   maintain relationships with its suppliers and customers; and
•   manage its credit and bankruptcy risks effectively.
33
although a number of our license agreements prohibit our licensing partners from entering into licensing arrangements with our competitors, our licensing partners generally are not precluded from offering, under other non-competitor brands, the types of products covered by their license agreements with us. a substantial portion of sales of our products by our domestic licensing partners are also made to our largest customers. while we have significant control over our licensing partners' products and advertising, we rely on our licensing partners for, among other things, operational and financial control over their businesses. changes in management, reduced sales of licensed products, poor execution, or financial difficulties with respect to any of our licensing partners could adversely affect our revenues, both directly from reduced licensing revenue received and indirectly from reduced sales of our other products.
although we believe that we could replace our existing licensing partners in most circumstances, if necessary, our inability to do so for any period of time could adversely affect our revenues, both directly from reduced licensing revenue received and indirectly from reduced sales of our other products. see item 1 - "business - our licensing business."
item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.
the following management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ("md&a") should be read together with our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto, which are included in this annual report on form 10-k. we utilize a 52-53 week fiscal year ending on the saturday closest to march 31. as such, fiscal 2018 ended on march 31, 2018 and was a 52-week period; fiscal 2017 ended on april 1, 2017 and was a 52-week period; fiscal 2016 ended on april 2, 2016 and was a 53-week period; and fiscal 2019 will end on march 30, 2019 and will be a 52-week period.
introduction md&a is provided as a supplement to the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes thereto to help provide an understanding of our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. md&a is organized as follows:
•   overview. this section provides a general description of our business, global economic conditions and industry trends, and a summary of our financial performance for fiscal 2018. in addition, this section includes a discussion of recent developments and transactions affecting comparability that we believe are important in understanding our results of operations and financial condition, and in anticipating future trends.

•   recently issued accounting standards. this section discusses the potential impact on our reported results of operations and financial condition of certain accounting standards that have been recently issued or proposed.
overview our business our company is a global leader in the design, marketing, and distribution of premium lifestyle products, including apparel, accessories, home furnishings, and other licensed product categories. our long-standing reputation and distinctive image have been developed across an expanding number of products, brands, sales channels, and international markets. our brand names include ralph lauren, ralph lauren collection, ralph lauren purple label, polo ralph lauren, double rl, lauren ralph lauren, polo ralph lauren children, chaps, and club monaco, among others.
we diversify our business by geography (north america, europe, and asia, among other regions) and channels of distribution (wholesale, retail, and licensing). this allows us to maintain a dynamic balance as our operating results do not depend solely on the performance of any single geographic area or channel of distribution. our wholesale sales are made principally to major department stores and specialty stores around the world. we also sell directly to consumers through our integrated retail channel, which includes our retail stores, concession-based shop-within-shops, and digital commerce operations around the world. in addition, we license to unrelated third parties for specified periods the right to operate retail stores and/or to use our various trademarks in connection with the manufacture and sale of designated products, such as certain apparel, eyewear, fragrances, and home furnishings.
38
we organize our business into the following three reportable segments:
•   north america - our north america segment, representing approximately 52% of our fiscal 2018 net revenues, primarily consists of sales of our ralph lauren branded products made through our wholesale and retail businesses in the u.s. and canada, excluding club monaco. in north america, our wholesale business is comprised primarily of sales to department stores, and to a lesser extent, specialty stores. our retail business in north america is comprised of our ralph lauren stores, our factory stores, and our digital commerce site, www.ralphlauren.com.
•   europe - our europe segment, representing approximately 26% of our fiscal 2018 net revenues, primarily consists of sales of our ralph lauren branded products made through our wholesale and retail businesses in europe and the middle east, excluding club monaco. in europe, our wholesale business is comprised of a varying mix of sales to both department stores and specialty stores, depending on the country. our retail business in europe is comprised of our ralph lauren stores, our factory stores, our concession-based shop-within-shops, and our various digital commerce sites.
•   asia - our asia segment, representing approximately 15% of our fiscal 2018 net revenues, primarily consists of sales of our ralph lauren branded products made through our wholesale and retail businesses in asia, australia, and new zealand. our retail business in asia is comprised of our ralph lauren stores, our factory stores, and our concession-based shop-within-shops. in addition, we sell our products through various third-party digital partner commerce sites. in asia, our wholesale business is comprised primarily of sales to department stores, with related products distributed through shop-within-shops.
in addition to these reportable segments, we also have other non-reportable segments, representing approximately 7% of our fiscal 2018 net revenues, which primarily consist of (i) sales of club monaco branded products made through our retail businesses in the u.s., canada, and europe, and our licensing alliances in europe and asia, (ii) sales of ralph lauren branded products made through our wholesale business in latin america, and (iii) royalty revenues earned through our global licensing alliances, excluding club monaco.
approximately 45% of our fiscal 2018 net revenues were earned outside of the u.s. see note 19 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our segment reporting structure.
our business is typically affected by seasonal trends, with higher levels of wholesale sales in our second and fourth fiscal quarters and higher retail sales in our second and third fiscal quarters. these trends result primarily from the timing of seasonal wholesale shipments and key vacation travel, back-to-school, and holiday shopping periods impacting our retail business.
global economic conditions and industry trends the global economy and our industry are impacted by many different influences. most recently, the u.s. enacted new tax legislation known as the tcja (as defined within "recent developments"), which is intended to stimulate economic growth and capital investment in the u.s. by, among its other provisions, lowering tax rates for both corporations and individuals alike. certain other worldwide events, including political unrest, acts of terrorism, monetary policy changes, and currency and commodity price changes, increase volatility in the global economy. in addition, the current domestic and international political environment, including potential changes to other u.s. policies related to global trade, immigration, and healthcare, have also resulted in uncertainty surrounding the future state of the global economy. as our international business continues to grow, and because the majority of our products are produced outside of the u.s., major changes in global tax policies or trade relations could have a material adverse effect on our business or operating results. our results also have been, and are expected to continue to be, impacted by foreign exchange rate fluctuations.
in addition, the retail landscape in which we operate is evolving, with consumers continuing to diversify the channels in which they transact and shifting their shopping preference from physical stores to online. this, along with other factors, has resulted in many retailers, including certain of our large wholesale customers, becoming highly promotional and aggressively marking down their merchandise in an attempt to offset declines in physical store traffic. the retail industry, particularly in the u.s., has also experienced numerous bankruptcies, restructurings, and ownership changes in recent years. certain of our operations, including our north america wholesale business, have been negatively impacted by these dynamics. the continuation of these industry trends could further impact consumer spending and consumption behavior in our industry, which could have a material adverse effect on our business or operating results. additionally, changes in economic conditions, including those that may result from the tcja, can further impact consumer discretionary income levels and spending. while we are optimistic that the tcja will stimulate economic growth, it is still too early to determine the resulting impact on consumer spending and consumption behavior.
39
we have implemented various operating strategies globally to help address many of these current challenges, and continue to build a foundation for long-term profitable growth centered around strengthening our consumer-facing areas of product, stores, and marketing across channels and driving a more efficient operating model. in connection with these strategies, we are taking deliberate actions to ensure promotional consistency across channels and enhance the overall brand and shopping experience, including reducing shipments to better align with underlying demand and lower inventory levels. additionally, we are optimizing our wholesale distribution channel, and closed approximately 25% of our underperforming u.s. department store points of distribution during fiscal 2018. further, in october 2017, we began to shift to a more cost-effective and flexible platform for our directly operated digital businesses, which is expected to deliver a more brand-enhancing and consistent customer experience across our global digital ecosystem. see our restructuring activities as described within "recent developments" below for further discussion. although the investments that we are making in our business and our quality of sales initiatives may create operating profit pressure in the near-term, we expect that these initiatives will create longer-term shareholder value.
we will continue to monitor these conditions and trends and evaluate and adjust our operating strategies and foreign currency and cost management opportunities to help mitigate the related impact on our results of operations, while remaining focused on the long-term growth of our business and protecting the value of our brand.
for a detailed discussion of significant risk factors that have the potential to cause our actual results to differ materially from our expectations, see part i, item 1a - "risk factors" included in this annual report on form 10-k.
summary of financial performance operating results in fiscal 2018, we reported net revenues of $6.182 billion, net income of $162.8 million, and net income per diluted share of $1.97, as compared to net revenues of $6.653 billion, a net loss of $99.3 million, and net loss per diluted share of $1.20 in fiscal 2017. the comparability of our operating results has been affected by tcja enactment-related charges recorded during fiscal 2018, as well as restructuring-related charges, impairment of assets, and certain other charges recorded during both fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017, as discussed further below.
during fiscal 2018, net revenues declined 7.1% on a reported basis and 8.4% on a constant currency basis, as defined within "transactions and trends affecting comparability of results of operations and financial condition" below. the decline in reported net revenues during fiscal 2018 was primarily due to lower sales from our north america segment driven by the impact of our quality of distribution and sales initiatives, including lower levels of promotional activity and a strategic reduction in shipments, as well as brand discontinuances and lower consumer demand.
our gross profit as a percentage of net revenues increased by 580 basis points to 60.7% during fiscal 2018, primarily driven by lower non-cash inventory-related charges recorded in connection with the way forward plan, lower levels of promotional activity in connection with our long-term growth strategy, favorable geographic and channel mix, and lower sourcing costs.
selling, general, and administrative ("sg&a") expenses as a percentage of net revenues increased by 240 basis points to 50.1% during fiscal 2018, primarily due to operating deleverage on lower net revenues and the unfavorable impact attributable to geographic and channel mix, as a greater portion of our revenue was generated by our international retail businesses (which typically carry higher operating expense margins). these increases were largely offset by our operational discipline and cost savings associated with our restructuring activities.
net income increased by $262.1 million to $162.8 million in fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017, primarily due to a $590.5 million increase in operating income, partially offset by a $332.0 million increase in our income tax provision largely driven by tcja enactment-related charges.
net income per diluted share increased by $3.17 to $1.97 per share in fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017, due to higher net income and lower weighted-average diluted shares outstanding during fiscal 2018.
net income during fiscal 2018 reflected tcja enactment-related charges of $221.4 million, or $2.68 per diluted share. our operating results during fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017 were also negatively impacted by restructuring-related charges, impairment of assets, and certain other charges totaling $165.6 million and $770.3 million, respectively, which had an after-tax effect of reducing net income by $113.3 million, or $1.38 per diluted share, and $592.1 million, or $7.10 per diluted share, respectively. in addition, our net loss during fiscal 2017 reflected the favorable impact of $15.9 million, or $0.19 per diluted share, related to the reversal of an income tax reserve resulting from a change in tax law that impacted an interest assessment on a prior year withholding tax.

financial condition and liquidity we ended fiscal 2018 in a net cash and investments position (cash and cash equivalents plus short-term and non-current investments, less total debt) of $1.494 billion, compared to $786.2 million as of the end of fiscal 2017. the increase in our net cash and investments position was primarily due to our operating cash flows of $975.1 million, partially offset by our use of cash to invest in our business through $161.6 million in capital expenditures and to make cash dividend payments of $162.4 million.
we generated $975.1 million of cash from operations during fiscal 2018, compared to $952.6 million during fiscal 2017. the increase in our operating cash flows was due to a net favorable change related to our operating assets and liabilities, including our working capital, as compared to the prior fiscal year, partially offset by a decline in net income before non-cash charges.
our equity increased to $3.457 billion as of march 31, 2018, compared to $3.300 billion as of april 1, 2017, primarily due to our comprehensive income and the net impact of stock-based compensation arrangements, partially offset by our dividends declared during fiscal 2018.
recent developments u.s. tax reform on december 22, 2017, president trump signed into law new tax legislation commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act (the "tcja"), which became effective january 1, 2018. the tcja significantly revised u.s. tax law by, among other provisions, lowering the u.s. federal statutory income tax rate from 35% to 21%, creating a territorial tax system that includes a one-time mandatory transition tax on previously deferred foreign earnings, and eliminating or reducing certain income tax deductions.
during fiscal 2018, we recorded net charges of $221.4 million within our income tax provision in connection with the tcja, of which $209.3 million related to the mandatory transition tax, which we expect to pay over an eight-year period. these charges, which were recorded on a provisional basis as permitted by sec staff accounting bulletin no. 118 ("sab 118"), negatively impacted our effective tax rate by 4,520 basis points and lowered our diluted earnings per share by $2.68 during fiscal 2018. the provisional amounts were based on our present interpretations of the tcja, current available information, and assumptions about future events, and are subject to further refinement as additional information becomes available and further analyses are completed.
despite these enactment-related charges, we expect the tcja will ultimately benefit our results of operations and financial condition in future periods, primarily due to the lower u.s. federal statutory income tax rate.
additionally, we reevaluated our permanent reinvestment assertion and determined that undistributed foreign earnings that were subject to the one-time mandatory transition tax were no longer considered to be permanently reinvested, effective december 31, 2017. in connection with this decision, we repatriated $252.0 million of cash to the u.s. from certain of our foreign subsidiaries during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, and we repatriated an additional $400.0 million during the first quarter of fiscal 2019.
see note 10 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional discussion regarding the tcja.
change in chief executive officer effective may 2017, mr. stefan larsson departed as the company's president and chief executive officer and as a member of our board of directors. in connection with mr. larsson's departure, we recorded cumulative other charges of $17.0 million, of which $5.6 million and $11.4 million were recorded during fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017, respectively. we do not expect to incur additional charges related to mr. larsson's departure. see note 9 to our accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the charges recorded in connection with mr. larsson's departure.
subsequent to mr. larsson's departure, mr. patrice louvet was appointed as the company's new president and chief executive officer and as a member of our board of directors, effective july 2017.

way forward plan on june 2, 2016, our board of directors approved a restructuring plan with the objective of delivering sustainable, profitable sales growth and long-term value creation for shareholders (the "way forward plan"). we are refocusing on our core brands and evolving our product, marketing, and shopping experience to increase desirability and relevance. we are also evolving our operating model to enable sustainable, profitable sales growth by significantly improving quality of sales, reducing supply chain lead times, improving our sourcing, and executing a disciplined multi-channel distribution and expansion strategy. as part of the way forward plan, we are rightsizing our cost structure and implementing a return on investment-driven financial model to free up resources to invest in the brand and drive high-quality sales. the way forward plan includes strengthening our leadership team and creating a more nimble organization by moving from an average of nine to six layers of management. the way forward plan also includes the discontinuance of our denim & supply brand and the integration of our denim product offerings into our polo ralph lauren brand. collectively, these actions, which were substantially completed during fiscal 2017, resulted in a reduction in workforce and the closure of certain stores and shop-within-shops, as well as gross annualized expense savings of approximately $200 million.
on march 30, 2017, our board of directors approved the following additional restructuring-related activities associated with the way forward plan: (i) the restructuring of our in-house global digital commerce platform which was in development and shifting to a more cost-effective, flexible platform through a new agreement with salesforce's commerce cloud, formerly known as demandware; (ii) the closure of our polo store at 711 fifth avenue in new york city; and (iii) the further streamlining of the organization and the execution of other key corporate actions in line with the way forward plan. these actions, which are expected to result in additional expense savings of approximately $140 million, are an important part of our efforts to achieve our stated objective to return to sustainable, profitable growth and invest in the future. these additional restructuring-related activities were largely completed during fiscal 2018 and resulted in a further reduction in workforce and the closure of certain corporate office and store locations. the remaining activities, which are primarily lease-related, are expected to be completed during fiscal 2019.
in connection with the way forward plan, we currently expect to incur total estimated charges of approximately $770 million, comprised of cash-related restructuring charges of approximately $450 million and non-cash charges of approximately $320 million. cumulative charges incurred since inception were $669.2 million, of which $102.8 million and $566.4 million were incurred during fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017, respectively, and we expect to incur the remaining charges of approximately $100 million during fiscal 2019. in addition to these charges, we also incurred an additional non-cash charge of $155.2 million during fiscal 2017 associated with the destruction of inventory out of current liquidation channels in line with our way forward plan. see notes 8 and 9 to our accompanying consolidated financial statements for detailed discussions of the charges recorded in connection with the way forward plan.
global reorganization plan on may 12, 2015, our board of directors approved a reorganization and restructuring plan comprised of the following major actions: (i) the reorganization of the company's operating structure in order to streamline our business processes to better align our cost structure with our long-term growth strategy; (ii) a strategic store and shop-within-shop performance review conducted by region and brand; (iii) a targeted corporate functional area review; and (iv) the consolidation of certain of our luxury lines (collectively, the "global reorganization plan"). the global reorganization plan has resulted in a reduction in workforce and the closure of certain stores and shop-within-shops. actions associated with the global reorganization plan were substantially completed during fiscal 2016 and resulted in improved operational efficiencies by reducing annual operating expenses by approximately $125 million.
since its inception, we have recorded total cumulative charges of $147.4 million in connection with the global reorganization plan, of which $4.9 million and $142.5 million were recorded during fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016, respectively. actions associated with the global reorganization plan were completed by the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2017 and no additional charges are expected to be incurred in relation to this plan. see notes 8 and 9 to our accompanying consolidated financial statements for detailed discussions of the charges recorded in connection with the global reorganization plan.

transactions and trends affecting comparability of results of operations and financial condition the comparability of our operating results for the three fiscal years presented herein has been affected by certain events, including:
•   charges incurred in connection with our restructuring plans, as well as certain other asset impairments and other charges, as summarized below (references to "notes" are to the notes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements):

(a)   non-cash restructuring-related inventory charges are recorded within cost of goods sold in the consolidated statements of operations.
•   tcja enactment-related charges of $221.4 million recorded within the income tax provision in the consolidated statements of operations during fiscal 2018;
•   the reversal of an income tax reserve resulting from a change in tax law that impacted an interest assessment on a prior year withholding tax, which favorably impacted our income tax benefit by $15.9 million during fiscal 2017; and
•   the inclusion of the 53rd week in fiscal 2016, which resulted in incremental net revenues of $72.2 million and net income of $8.3 million.
since we are a global company, the comparability of our operating results reported in u.s. dollars is also affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations because the underlying currencies in which we transact change in value over time compared to the u.s. dollar. these rate fluctuations can have a significant effect on our reported results. as such, in addition to financial measures prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the u.s. ("u.s. gaap"), our discussions often contain references to constant currency measures, which are calculated by translating the current-year and prior-year reported amounts into comparable amounts using a single foreign exchange rate for each currency. we present constant currency financial information, which is a non-u.s. gaap financial measure, as a supplement to our reported operating results. we use constant currency information to provide a framework to assess how our businesses performed excluding the effects of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. we believe this information is useful to investors to facilitate comparisons of operating results and better identify trends in our businesses. the constant currency performance measures should be viewed in addition to, and not in lieu of or superior to, our operating performance measures calculated in accordance with u.s. gaap. reconciliations between this non-u.s. gaap financial measure and the most directly comparable u.s. gaap measure are included in the "results of operations" section where applicable.
our discussion also includes reference to comparable store sales. comparable store sales refer to the growth of sales in stores that are open for at least one full fiscal year. sales for stores that are closed during a fiscal year are excluded from the calculation of comparable store sales. sales for stores that are either relocated, enlarged (as defined by gross square footage expansion of 25% or greater), or generally closed for 30 or more consecutive days for renovation are also excluded from the calculation of comparable store sales until such stores have been in their new location or in their newly renovated state for at least one full fiscal year. sales from our digital commerce sites are included within comparable store sales for those geographies that have been serviced by the related site for at least one full fiscal year. sales for digital commerce sites that are shut down during a fiscal year are excluded from the calculation of comparable store sales. we use an integrated omni-channel strategy to operate our retail business, in which our digital commerce operations are interdependent with our physical stores. all comparable store sales metrics were calculated on a 52-week basis.
our "results of operations" discussion that follows includes the significant changes in operating results arising from these items affecting comparability. however, unusual items or transactions may occur in any period. accordingly, investors and other financial statement users should consider the types of events and transactions that have affected operating trends.

•   a $435.0 million net decrease related to our north america wholesale business, largely driven by a strategic reduction of shipments (including within the off-price channel) and points of distribution in connection with our long-term growth strategy, the impact of brand discontinuances, and the continued challenging department store traffic trends;
•   a $115.0 million net decrease in comparable store sales, primarily driven by lower sales from our ralph lauren digital commerce operations and certain of our retail stores due in part to a decline in traffic, as well as lower levels of promotional activity and a planned reduction in inventory in connection with our long-term growth strategy. the following table summarizes the percentage change in comparable store sales related to our north america retail business on both a reported and constant currency basis:

europe net revenues - net revenues increased by $41.6 million, or 2.7%, during fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017, including net favorable foreign currency effects of $81.2 million. on a constant currency basis, net revenues decreased by $39.6 million, or 2.6%.
the $41.6 million net increase in europe net revenues was driven by:
•   a $43.5 million net increase in non-comparable store sales, primarily driven by new store openings and net favorable foreign currency effects of $10.1 million; and
•   a $15.2 million net increase related to our europe wholesale business, largely driven by net favorable foreign currency effects of $45.1 million, partially offset by the impact of brand discontinuances and a strategic reduction of shipments within the off-price channel in connection with our long-term growth strategy.
these increases were partially offset by:
•   a $17.1 million net decrease in comparable store sales, including net favorable foreign currency effects of $26.0 million. our comparable store sales decreased by $43.1 million on a constant currency basis, primarily driven by lower sales from certain of our retail stores due in part to lower levels of promotional activity and a planned reduction in inventory in connection with our long-term growth strategy. the following table summarizes the percentage change in comparable store sales related to our europe retail business on both a reported and constant currency basis:

asia net revenues - net revenues increased by $51.2 million, or 5.8%, during fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017, including net favorable foreign currency effects of $1.9 million. on a constant currency basis, net revenues increased by $49.3 million, or 5.6%.
the $51.2 million net increase in asia net revenues was driven by:
•   a $21.4 million net increase in non-comparable store sales, primarily driven by new store openings;
•   an $18.3 million net increase in comparable store sales, including net favorable foreign currency effects of $1.0 million. our comparable store sales increased by $17.3 million on a constant currency basis, primarily driven by higher sales from certain of our retail locations due in part to improved conversion, partially offset by the impact of lower levels of promotional activity in connection with our long-term growth strategy. the following table summarizes the percentage change in comparable store sales related to our asia retail business on both a reported and constant currency basis:

gross profit.    gross profit increased by $100.6 million, or 2.8%, to $3.752 billion in fiscal 2018. gross profit during fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017 reflected non-cash inventory-related charges of $7.6 million and $197.9 million, respectively, recorded in connection with the way forward plan. the increase in gross profit also included a net favorable foreign currency effect of $64.2 million. gross profit as a percentage of net revenues increased to 60.7% in fiscal 2018 from 54.9% in fiscal 2017. the 580 basis point increase was primarily driven by the lower non-cash inventory-related charges recorded in connection with the way forward plan during fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017, lower levels of promotional activity in connection with our long-term growth strategy, favorable geographic and channel mix, and lower sourcing costs.
gross profit as a percentage of net revenues is dependent upon a variety of factors, including changes in the relative sales mix among distribution channels, changes in the mix of products sold, the timing and level of promotional activities, foreign currency exchange rates, and fluctuations in material costs. these factors, among others, may cause gross profit as a percentage of net revenues to fluctuate from year to year.
selling, general, and administrative expenses.    sg&a expenses include compensation and benefits, advertising and marketing, rent and occupancy, distribution, information technology, legal, depreciation and amortization, bad debt, and other selling and administrative costs. sg&a expenses decreased by $75.5 million, or 2.4%, to $3.096 billion in fiscal 2018. this decrease included a net unfavorable foreign currency effect of $31.8 million. sg&a expenses as a percentage of net revenues increased to 50.1% in fiscal 2018 from 47.7% in fiscal 2017. the 240 basis point increase was primarily due to operating deleverage on lower net revenues, as previously discussed, and the unfavorable impact attributable to geographic and channel mix, as a greater portion of our revenue was generated by our international retail businesses (which typically carry higher operating expense margins). these increases were partially offset by our operational discipline and cost savings associated with our restructuring activities.

in fiscal 2019, we remain committed to spending on key strategic initiatives including marketing, digital, expanding and renovating our global retail stores and concession shops, and investing in productivity-enhancing infrastructure. we expect to make these investments while continuing to manage our cost base with discipline.
impairment of assets.  during fiscal 2018, we recorded non-cash impairment charges of $41.2 million to write off certain fixed assets related to our domestic and international stores, shop-within-shops, and corporate offices. additionally, as a result of a change in the planned usage of a certain intangible asset, we recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $8.8 million during fiscal 2018 to reduce the value of the intangible asset to its estimated fair value. during fiscal 2017, we recorded non-cash impairment charges of $248.6 million to write off certain fixed assets related to our domestic and international stores, shop-within-shops, and corporate offices, as well as our in-house global digital commerce platform which was in development. additionally, as a result of the realignment of our segment reporting structure, we recorded a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $5.2 million during fiscal 2017. see note 8 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
restructuring and other charges.  during fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017, we recorded restructuring charges of $79.2 million and $294.0 million, respectively, in connection with our restructuring plans, consisting of severance and benefits costs, lease termination and store closure costs, other cash charges, and non-cash accelerated stock-based compensation expense. in addition, during fiscal 2018, we recorded net other charges of $28.8 million primarily related to depreciation expense associated with our

former polo store at 711 fifth avenue in new york city, our pending customs audit, the departure of mr. stefan larsson, and the reversal of reserves associated with the settlement of certain non-income tax issues. during fiscal 2017, we recorded other charges of $24.6 million related to the anticipated settlement of certain non-income tax issues and the departure of mr. stefan larsson. see note 9 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
operating income (loss).    during fiscal 2018, we reported operating income of $498.2 million, as compared to an operating loss of $92.3 million during fiscal 2017. our operating results during fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017 were negatively impacted by restructuring-related charges, impairment of assets, and certain other charges totaling $165.6 million and $770.3 million, respectively, as previously discussed. the $590.5 million increase in operating income also included a net favorable foreign currency effect of $32.4 million. operating income as a percentage of net revenues was 8.1% during fiscal 2018, reflecting a 950 basis point increase from the prior fiscal year. the overall increase in operating income as a percentage of net revenues was primarily driven by the net decline in restructuring-related charges, impairment of assets, and certain other charges and the increase in our gross profit margin, partially offset by the increase in sg&a expenses as a percentage of net revenues, all as previously discussed.

europe operating margin improved by 270 basis points, primarily due to the favorable impact of 130 basis points related to lower non-cash charges recorded in connection with the way forward plan during fiscal 2018 as compared to the prior fiscal year, as well as the favorable impact of 120 basis points related to our retail business, largely driven by the increase in our gross profit margin, partially offset by an increase in sg&a expenses as a percentage of net revenues. the increase also reflected favorable foreign currency effects of 20 basis points. our wholesale business did not have a meaningful impact on the change in our europe operating margin.
asia operating margin improved by 2,450 basis points, primarily due to the favorable impact of 2,000 basis points related to lower non-cash charges recorded in connection with the way forward plan during fiscal 2018 as compared to the prior fiscal year. the increase also reflected the favorable impact of 350 basis points related to our retail business, largely driven by the increase in our gross profit margin and a decline in sg&a expenses as a percentage of net revenues. the improvement also reflected favorable foreign currency effects of 140 basis points. these increases in operating margin were partially offset by a 40 basis point decline related to our wholesale business.
48
unallocated corporate expenses decreased by $67.6 million to $672.8 million in fiscal 2018, primarily due to lower impairment of asset charges of $96.3 million, lower non-income tax related expenses of $9.4 million, and lower other expenses of $10.7 million, partially offset by lower intercompany sourcing commission income of $31.9 million (which is offset at the segment level and eliminates in consolidation), higher consulting fees of $8.7 million, and higher compensation-related expenses of $8.2 million.
unallocated restructuring and other charges decreased by $210.6 million to $108.0 million in fiscal 2018, as previously discussed above and in note 9 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
non-operating expense, net.    non-operating expense, net is comprised of interest expense, interest income, and other expense, net, which includes foreign currency gains (losses), equity in losses from our equity-method investees, and other non-operating expenses. non-operating expense, net, decreased by $3.6 million to $9.0 million in fiscal 2018 from $12.6 million in fiscal 2017. the decline in non-operating expense, net, was driven by:
•   a $5.0 million increase in interest income driven by the increase in our cash, cash equivalents, and investments as compared to the prior fiscal year; and
•   a $3.4 million increase in foreign currency gains, largely related to the net favorable revaluation and settlement of foreign currency-denominated intercompany receivables and payables, inclusive of the impact of forward foreign currency exchange contracts, as compared to the prior fiscal year (foreign currency gains (losses) do not result from the translation of the operating results of our foreign subsidiaries to u.s. dollars).
these declines in non-operating expense were partially offset by:
•   a $5.8 million increase in interest expense driven by the less favorable impact of our swap contracts during fiscal 2018 as compared to the prior fiscal year. see note 13 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our swap contracts.
income tax benefit (provision).    the income tax benefit (provision) represents federal, foreign, state and local income taxes. during fiscal 2018, we reported an income tax provision of $326.4 million and an effective tax rate of 66.7%, as compared to an income tax benefit of $5.6 million and an effective tax rate of 5.3% during fiscal 2017. the $332.0 million increase in the income tax provision was primarily due to enactment-related charges of $221.4 million recorded during fiscal 2018 in connection with the tcja (as discussed within "recent developments"), which negatively impacted our effective tax rate by 4,520 basis points, as well as the increase in pretax income. the 66.7% effective tax rate for fiscal 2018 was higher than our blended statutory tax rate of 31.5% primarily due to tcja enactment-related charges, the adoption of accounting standards update no. 2016-09, "improvements to employee share-based payment accounting" ("asu 2016-09"), and the unfavorable impact of additional income tax reserves associated with certain income tax audits, partially offset by the tax impacts of earnings in lower taxed foreign jurisdictions versus the u.s. and tax benefits associated with adjustments recorded on deferred tax assets and provision to tax return adjustments. see note 4 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information relating to our adoption of asu 2016-09. the 5.3% effective tax rate for fiscal 2017 was lower than the statutory tax rate of 35.0% primarily due to the tax impact of earnings in lower taxed foreign jurisdictions versus the u.s., valuation allowances and adjustments recorded on deferred tax assets, and income tax reserves largely associated with an income tax settlement and certain income tax audits, partially offset by the reversal of an income tax reserve resulting from a change in tax law that impacted an interest assessment on a prior year withholding tax. our effective tax rate will change from period to period based on various factors including, but not limited to, the geographic mix of earnings, the timing and amount of foreign dividends, enacted tax legislation, state and local taxes, tax audit findings and settlements, and the interaction of various global tax strategies.
net income (loss).    during fiscal 2018, we reported net income of $162.8 million, as compared to a net loss of $99.3 million during fiscal 2017. the $262.1 million increase in net income was primarily due to the $590.5 million increase in operating income, partially offset by the $332.0 million increase in our income tax provision, as previously discussed. net income in fiscal 2018 reflected tcja enactment-related charges of $221.4 million. our operating results during fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017 were also negatively impacted by restructuring-related charges, impairment of assets, and certain other charges totaling $165.6 million and $770.3 million, respectively, which had an after-tax effect of reducing net income by $113.3 million and $592.1 million, respectively. in addition, our net loss during fiscal 2017 reflected the favorable impact of $15.9 million related to the reversal of an income tax reserve resulting from a change in tax law that impacted an interest assessment on a prior year withholding tax.
49
net income (loss) per diluted share.    during fiscal 2018, we reported net income per diluted share of $1.97, as compared to a net loss per diluted share of $1.20 during fiscal 2017. the $3.17 per share increase was due to the higher level of net income, as previously discussed, and lower weighted-average diluted shares outstanding during fiscal 2018, driven by the weighted-average impact of our share repurchases during fiscal 2017. net income per diluted share during fiscal 2018 was negatively impacted by $2.68 per share as a result of tcja enactment-related charges. net income (loss) per diluted share during fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017 were also negatively impacted by $1.38 per share and $7.10 per share, respectively, as a result of restructuring-related charges, impairment of assets, and certain other charges. in addition, our net loss per diluted share during fiscal 2017 reflected the favorable impact of $0.19 per share related to the reversal of an income tax reserve resulting from a change in tax law that impacted an interest assessment on a prior year withholding tax.

north america net revenues - net revenues decreased by $696.6 million, or 15.6%, during fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016. this decrease reflected net unfavorable foreign currency effects of $0.4 million, as well as the absence of the 53rd week, which resulted in incremental net revenues of $38.2 million during the prior fiscal year. on a constant currency basis, net revenues decreased by $696.2 million, or 15.5%.
51
the $696.6 million net decline in north america net revenues was driven by:
•   a $510.3 million net decrease related to our north america wholesale business, reflecting lower sales across all of our major apparel and accessories businesses, due in part to a strategic reduction of shipments in connection with our long-term growth strategy and a decline in department store traffic, which contributed to a more competitive retail environment. this decrease also reflected the absence of the 53rd week, which resulted in incremental net revenues of $10.0 million during the prior fiscal year;
•   a $165.5 million net decrease in comparable store sales, primarily driven by lower sales from certain of our retail stores and ralph lauren digital commerce operations due in part to a decline in traffic. the following table summarizes our comparable store sales percentages on both a reported and constant currency basis related to our north america retail business:

•   a $20.8 million net decrease in non-comparable store sales, primarily driven by the absence of the 53rd week, which resulted in incremental net revenues of $28.2 million during the prior fiscal year, partially offset by new store openings during fiscal 2017.
europe net revenues - net revenues decreased by $18.3 million, or 1.2%, during fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016. this decrease reflected net unfavorable foreign currency effects of $64.3 million, as well as the absence of the 53rd week, which resulted in incremental net revenues of $14.3 million during the prior fiscal year. on a constant currency basis, net revenues increased by $46.0 million, or 2.9%.
the $18.3 million net decline in europe net revenues was driven by:
•   a $57.1 million net decrease in comparable store sales, including net unfavorable foreign currency effects of $26.9 million. our comparable store sales decreased by $30.2 million on a constant currency basis, primarily driven by lower sales from certain retail stores due in part to a decline in traffic, as well as lower levels of promotional activity in connection with our long-term growth strategy, partially offset by higher sales from our ralph lauren digital commerce operations. the following table summarizes our comparable store sales percentages on both a reported and constant currency basis related to our europe retail business:

this decline was partially offset by:
•   a $25.4 million net increase related to our europe wholesale business, reflecting increased sales across all of our major apparel and accessories businesses. this increase was net of unfavorable foreign currency effects of $23.0 million; and
•   a $13.4 million net increase in non-comparable store sales, primarily driven by new store openings during fiscal 2017, partially offset by net unfavorable foreign currency effects of $14.4 million and the absence of the 53rd week, which resulted in incremental net revenues of $14.3 million during the prior fiscal year.
asia net revenues - net revenues decreased by $9.9 million, or 1.1%, during fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016, reflecting the absence of the 53rd week, which resulted in incremental net revenues of $15.4 million during the prior fiscal year. this decrease is inclusive of net favorable foreign currency effects of $43.6 million. on a constant currency basis, net revenues decreased by $53.5 million, or 6.0%.

the $9.9 million net decline in asia net revenues was driven by:
•   a $17.1 million net decrease in non-comparable store sales, primarily driven by the absence of the 53rd week, which resulted in incremental net revenues of $15.4 million during the prior fiscal year, as well as lower sales from certain of our stores and concession shops due in part to a decline in traffic, lower levels of promotional activity in connection with our long-term growth strategy, and the strategic closure of certain of our locations, partially offset by net favorable foreign currency effects of $11.1 million and new store openings during fiscal 2017; and
•   a $5.1 million net decrease related to our asia wholesale business, primarily driven by lower sales in greater china and southeast asia, partially offset by net favorable foreign currency effects of $3.4 million.
these declines were partially offset by:
•   a $12.3 million net increase in comparable store sales, including net favorable foreign currency effects of $29.1 million. our comparable store sales decreased by $16.8 million on a constant currency basis, primarily driven by lower sales from certain of our stores and concession shops due in part to a decline in traffic, and lower levels of promotional activity in connection with our long-term growth strategy. the following table summarizes our comparable store sales percentage on both a reported and constant currency basis related to our asia retail business:

gross profit.    gross profit decreased by $535.6 million, or 12.8%, to $3.651 billion in fiscal 2017. gross profit during fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016 reflected non-cash inventory-related charges of $197.9 million and $20.4 million, respectively, recorded in connection with our restructuring plans. gross profit as a percentage of net revenues declined by 160 basis points to 54.9% in fiscal 2017 from 56.5% in fiscal 2016. this decline was primarily driven by the higher non-cash inventory-related charges recorded in connection with our restructuring plans during fiscal 2017 as compared to the comparable prior year period and net unfavorable foreign currency effects, partially offset by increased profitability driven by favorable geographic and channel mix and our quality of sales initiatives, including lower levels of promotional activity within our international businesses.
selling, general, and administrative expenses.    sg&a expenses decreased by $241.5 million, or 7.1%, to $3.171 billion in fiscal 2017. this decrease included a net unfavorable foreign currency effect of $5.3 million. sg&a expenses as a percentage of net revenues increased by 160 basis points to 47.7% in fiscal 2017 from 46.1% in fiscal 2016. this increase was primarily due to operating deleverage on lower net revenues, as previously discussed, and the continued investment in, and expansion of, our retail businesses (which typically carry higher operating expense margins) through new store and concession shop openings (as previously discussed); investments in our facilities and infrastructure; and investments in new business initiatives. these increases were partially offset by our operational discipline and cost savings associated with our restructuring activities.

operating income (loss).    during fiscal 2017, we reported an operating loss of $92.3 million, as compared to operating income of $582.8 million during fiscal 2016. our operating results during fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016 were negatively impacted by restructuring-related charges, impairment of assets, and certain other charges totaling $770.3 million and $211.8 million, respectively, as previously discussed. the $675.1 million decline in operating income also included a net unfavorable foreign currency effect of $67.4 million. operating loss as a percentage of net revenues was 1.4% during fiscal 2017, reflecting a 930 basis point decline from the prior fiscal year. the overall decline in operating income as a percentage of net revenues was primarily driven by the decline in our gross profit margin and the increase in restructuring-related charges, impairment of assets, and certain other charges, as well as the increase in sg&a expenses as a percentage of net revenues, all as previously discussed.

north america operating margin declined by 340 basis points, primarily due to the unfavorable impact of 200 basis points related to higher non-cash charges recorded in connection with our restructuring plans during fiscal 2017 as compared to the prior fiscal year. our lower operating margin also reflected a 70 basis point decline related to our wholesale business, largely driven by the impact of a more competitive retail environment, and a 40 basis point decline related to our retail business, largely driven by an increase in sg&a expenses as a percentage of net revenues. the remaining 30 basis point decline was attributable to other factors, including unfavorable channel mix.
europe operating margin increased by 180 basis points, primarily due to the favorable impact of 360 basis points and 240 basis points related to our wholesale and retail businesses, respectively, largely driven by the increase in our gross margin attributable to lower levels of promotional activity in connection with our long-term growth strategy. our wholesale business also benefited from a decline in sg&a expenses as a percentage of net revenues. these increases in operating margin were partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency effects of 340 basis points, as well as an 80 basis point decline attributable to higher non-cash charges recorded in connection with our restructuring plans during fiscal 2017 as compared to the prior fiscal year.
54
asia operating margin declined by 970 basis points, primarily due to the unfavorable impact of 1,720 basis points related to higher non-cash charges recorded in connection with our restructuring plans during fiscal 2017 as compared to the prior fiscal year. this decline in operating margin was partially offset by the favorable impact of 690 basis points related to our retail business, largely driven by a decline in sg&a expenses as a percentage of net revenues, lower levels of promotional activity in connection with our long-term growth strategy, and the strategic closure of certain of our locations. our operating margin also reflected the favorable impact of 60 basis points related to our wholesale business.
unallocated corporate expenses increased by $125.4 million, primarily due to higher non-cash impairment charges of $117.0 million, higher depreciation and amortization expense of $13.5 million, higher non-income tax related charges of $9.3 million, and higher other operating expenses of $37.4 million. these increases were partially offset by a decline in compensation-related expenses of $33.4 million and a decline in consulting fees of $18.4 million.
unallocated restructuring and other charges increased by $176.0 million to $318.6 million in fiscal 2017, as previously discussed above and in note 9 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
non-operating expense, net.    non-operating expense, net, decreased by $18.4 million to $12.6 million in fiscal 2017 from $31.0 million in fiscal 2016. the decline in non-operating expense was driven by:
•   an $8.6 million decrease in interest expense driven by the net favorable impact of our swap contracts entered into during fiscal 2016, partially offset by the inclusion of twelve months of interest expense during fiscal 2017 related to the 2.625% unsecured senior notes issued in august 2015, as compared to approximately seven months of interest expense during the prior year period. see note 13 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our swap contracts;
•   a $5.7 million decrease in equity in losses of equity-method investees, primarily related to our share in losses from our joint venture, the ralph lauren watch and jewelry company sárl, which is accounted for under the equity method of accounting; and
•   a $4.9 million decrease in foreign currency losses, largely related to the net favorable revaluation and settlement of foreign currency-denominated intercompany receivables and payables, inclusive of the impact of forward foreign currency exchange contracts, as compared to the prior fiscal year (foreign currency gains (losses) do not result from the translation of the operating results of our foreign subsidiaries to u.s. dollars).
income tax benefit (provision).    during fiscal 2017, we reported an income tax benefit of $5.6 million, as compared to an income tax provision of $155.4 million during fiscal 2016. the $161.0 million decrease in the income tax provision was largely driven by lower pretax income resulting in a pretax loss in fiscal 2017. the 5.3% effective tax rate for fiscal 2017 was lower than the statutory tax rate primarily due to the tax impact of earnings in lower taxed foreign jurisdictions versus the u.s., valuation allowances and adjustments recorded on deferred tax assets, and income tax reserves largely associated with an income tax settlement and certain income tax audits, partially offset by the reversal of an income tax reserve resulting from a change in tax law that impacted an interest assessment on a prior year withholding tax. the 28.2% effective tax rate for fiscal 2016 was lower than the statutory tax rate primarily due to the tax impact of earnings in lower taxed foreign jurisdictions versus the u.s. and a change to the assessment period associated with certain tax liabilities, partially offset by the reversal of certain deferred tax assets that were determined to not be realizable.
net income (loss).    during fiscal 2017, we reported a net loss of $99.3 million, as compared to net income of $396.4 million during fiscal 2016. the $495.7 million decrease in net income was primarily due to the decline in operating income, partially offset by the reduction in our income tax provision, as previously discussed. our operating results during fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016 were negatively impacted by restructuring-related charges, impairment of assets, and certain other charges totaling $770.3 million and $211.8 million, respectively, which had an after-tax effect of reducing net income by $592.1 million and $150.1 million, respectively. in addition, our net loss during fiscal 2017 reflected unfavorable foreign currency impacts of $63.6 million, partially offset by the favorable impact of $15.9 million related to the reversal of an income tax reserve resulting from a change in tax law that impacted an interest assessment on a prior year withholding tax, as previously discussed. our net income during fiscal 2016 reflected the favorable impact of the inclusion of the 53rd week, which increased net income by $8.3 million.
net income (loss) per diluted share.    during fiscal 2017, we reported a net loss per diluted share of $1.20, as compared to net income per diluted share of $4.62 during fiscal 2016. the $5.82 per share decline was due to lower net income, as previously discussed, and lower weighted-average diluted shares outstanding during fiscal 2017, driven by our share repurchases during fiscal 2017. net income (loss) per diluted share during fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016 was negatively impacted by $7.10 per share and $1.74 per share, respectively, as a result of restructuring-related charges, impairment of assets, and certain other charges, as
55
previously discussed. in addition, our net loss per diluted share during fiscal 2017 reflected unfavorable foreign currency impacts of $0.77 per share, partially offset by the favorable impact of $0.19 per share related to the reversal of an income tax reserve resulting from a change in tax law that impacted an interest assessment on a prior year withholding tax, as previously discussed. net income per diluted share during fiscal 2016 reflected the favorable impact of the inclusion of the 53rd week, which increased net income per diluted share by $0.10 per share.

the increase in our net cash and investments position at march 31, 2018 as compared to april 1, 2017 was primarily due to our operating cash flows of $975.1 million, partially offset by our use of cash to invest in our business through $161.6 million in capital expenditures and to make dividend payments of $162.4 million.
the increase in equity was primarily attributable to our comprehensive income and the net impact of stock-based compensation arrangements, partially offset by our dividends declared during fiscal 2018.

net cash provided by operating activities.    net cash provided by operating activities increased to $975.1 million during fiscal 2018, from $952.6 million during fiscal 2017. the $22.5 million net increase in cash provided by operating activities was due to a net favorable change related to our operating assets and liabilities, including our working capital, as compared to the prior fiscal year, partially offset by a decline in net income before non-cash charges. the decline in net income before non-cash charges reflected a net charge of $209.3 million recorded during fiscal 2018 in connection with the tcja's one-time mandatory transition tax. this charge, which is expected to be paid over an eight-year period net of foreign tax credits and other federal income tax activity (see "contractual and other obligations" below), did not impact our cash flows from operating activities during fiscal 2018 as reflected in the offsetting net favorable change in our income taxes payable and deferred taxes. excluding the impact of this enactment-related charge, the net increase related to our operating assets and liabilities, including working capital, was primarily due to:
•   favorable changes in our (i) other income tax receivables and payables (excluding the impact of the one-time mandatory transition tax) and (ii) deferred income, both largely driven by the timing of cash collections and payments.
these increases related to our operating assets and liabilities were partially offset by:
•   a less favorable change related to our inventory in fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017, largely driven by the timing of our inventory management initiatives and the timing of inventory receipts; and
•   unfavorable changes in our (i) accounts payable and accrued liabilities and (ii) accounts receivable, largely driven by the timing of cash payments and collections, respectively.
net cash used in investing activities.    net cash used in investing activities was $189.1 million during fiscal 2018, as compared to $208.1 million during fiscal 2017. the $19.0 million net decrease in cash used in investing activities was primarily driven by:
•   a $122.4 million decline in capital expenditures. during fiscal 2018, we spent $161.6 million on capital expenditures, as compared to $284.0 million during fiscal 2017. our capital expenditures during fiscal 2018 primarily related to our global retail and department store renovations, new store openings, and the continued enhancements to our global information technology systems.
this decrease in cash used in investing activities was partially offset by:
•   a $104.9 million increase in purchases of investments, less proceeds from sales and maturities of investments. during fiscal 2018, we made net investment purchases of $22.9 million, as compared to receiving net proceeds from sales and maturities of investments of $82.0 million during fiscal 2017.
in fiscal 2019, we expect to spend approximately $275 million in capital expenditures, primarily on consumer-facing initiatives that have demonstrated a proof of concept and healthy rates of return, including our global store fleet and digital ecosystem.
net cash used in financing activities.    net cash used in financing activities was $197.5 million during fiscal 2018, as compared to $518.4 million during fiscal 2017. the $320.9 million net decrease in cash used in financing activities was primarily driven by:
•   a $198.1 million decline in cash used to repurchase shares of our class a common stock. during fiscal 2018, $17.1 million in shares of class a common stock were surrendered or withheld in satisfaction of withholding taxes in connection with the vesting of awards under our long-term stock incentive plans. on a comparative basis, during fiscal 2017, we used $200.0 million to repurchase shares of class a common stock pursuant to our common stock repurchase program, and an additional $15.2 million in shares of class a common stock were surrendered or withheld for taxes; and
•   a $126.2 million decline in cash used to repay debt, less proceeds from debt issuances. during fiscal 2018, we received $10.1 million in borrowings under our credit facilities. during fiscal 2017, we made $90.0 million in net repayments related to our commercial paper note issuances and repayments and repaid $26.1 million of borrowings previously outstanding under our credit facilities.

net cash provided by operating activities.    net cash provided by operating activities decreased to $952.6 million during fiscal 2017, from $1.017 billion during fiscal 2016. the $64.1 million net decrease in cash provided by operating activities was due to a decline in net income before non-cash charges, partially offset by a net favorable change related to our operating assets and liabilities, including our working capital. the net increase related to our working capital was primarily driven by:
•   a decline in our inventory levels, largely driven by our inventory management initiatives, lower sourcing costs, and the timing of inventory receipts.
this increase related to our working capital was partially offset by:
•   an unfavorable change in our accounts receivable, largely driven by the timing of cash collections; and
•   an unfavorable change in our prepaid expenses and other current assets, largely driven by the timing of payments.
net cash used in investing activities.    net cash used in investing activities was $208.1 million during fiscal 2017, as compared to $576.3 million during fiscal 2016. the $368.2 million net decrease in cash used in investing activities was primarily driven by:
•   a $224.3 million increase in proceeds from sales and maturities of investments, less cash used to purchase investments. during fiscal 2017, we received net proceeds from sales and maturities of investments of $82.0 million, as compared to making net investment purchases of $142.3 million during fiscal 2016; and
•   a $133.7 million decline in capital expenditures. during fiscal 2017, we spent $284.0 million on capital expenditures, as compared to $417.7 million during fiscal 2016. our capital expenditures during fiscal 2017 primarily related to our global retail store openings, department store renovations, enhancements to our global information technology systems, and further development of our infrastructure.
net cash used in financing activities.    net cash used in financing activities was $518.4 million during fiscal 2017, as compared to $483.0 million during fiscal 2016. the $35.4 million net increase in cash used in financing activities was primarily driven by:
•   a $296.8 million increase in cash used to repay debt, less proceeds from debt issuances. during fiscal 2017, we made $90.0 million in net repayments related to our commercial paper note issuances and repayments and repaid $26.1 million of borrowings previously outstanding under our credit facilities. during fiscal 2016, we received net proceeds of $299.4 million from the issuance of our 2.625% unsecured senior notes and $26.1 million in borrowings under our credit facilities, which were partially offset by net repayments of $144.8 million related to our commercial paper note issuances and repayments; and
•   a $28.2 million decline in proceeds from the exercise of stock options.
these increases in cash used in financing activities were partially offset by:
•   a $285.2 million decrease in cash used to repurchase shares of our class a common stock. during fiscal 2017, we used $200.0 million to repurchase shares of class a common stock pursuant to our common stock repurchase program, and an additional $15.2 million in shares of class a common stock were surrendered or withheld in satisfaction of
58
withholding taxes in connection with the vesting of awards under our long-term stock incentive plans. on a comparative basis, during fiscal 2016, we used $479.9 million to repurchase shares of class a common stock pursuant to our common stock repurchase program, and an additional $20.5 million in shares of class a common stock were surrendered or withheld for taxes.
sources of liquidity our primary sources of liquidity are the cash flows generated from our operations, our available cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments, availability under our credit facilities, our issuances of commercial paper notes, and other available financing options.
during fiscal 2018, we generated $975.1 million of net cash flows from our operations. as of march 31, 2018, we had $2.004 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments, of which $1.064 billion were held by our subsidiaries domiciled outside the u.s. we are not dependent on foreign cash to fund our domestic operations. given recent changes to the taxation of undistributed foreign earnings in connection with the tcja (as discussed within "recent developments"), we have reevaluated our permanent reinvestment assertion and determined that undistributed foreign earnings that were subject to the tcja's one-time mandatory transition tax were no longer considered to be permanently reinvested, effective december 31, 2017. in connection with this decision, we repatriated $252.0 million of cash to the u.s. from certain of our foreign subsidiaries during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, and we repatriated an additional $400.0 million during the first quarter of fiscal 2019. in addition, we recorded a deferred tax liability of $7.1 million for the expected future remittance of previously taxed foreign earnings. the mandatory transition tax does not apply to undistributed foreign earnings generated after december 31, 2017, and therefore we intend to permanently reinvest any such earnings. however, if our plans change and we choose to repatriate post-2017 earnings to the u.s. in the future, we would be subject to applicable u.s. and foreign taxes.
the following table presents our total availability, borrowings outstanding, and remaining availability under our credit facilities and commercial paper program as of march 31, 2018:

(b)   borrowings under the commercial paper program are supported by the global credit facility. accordingly, we do not expect combined borrowings outstanding under the commercial paper program and the global credit facility to exceed $500 million.
(c)   represents outstanding letters of credit for which we were contingently liable under the global credit facility as of march 31, 2018.
we believe that the global credit facility is adequately diversified with no undue concentration in any one financial institution. in particular, as of march 31, 2018, there were nine financial institutions participating in the global credit facility, with no one participant maintaining a maximum commitment percentage in excess of 20%. borrowings under the pan-asia credit facilities are guaranteed by the parent company and are granted at the sole discretion of the participating regional branches of jpmorgan chase (the "banks"), subject to availability of the banks' funds and satisfaction of certain regulatory requirements. we have no reason to believe that the participating institutions will be unable to fulfill their obligations to provide financing in accordance with the terms of the global credit facility and the pan-asia credit facilities in the event of our election to draw funds in the foreseeable future.
our sources of liquidity are used to fund our ongoing cash requirements, including working capital requirements, global retail store and digital commerce expansion, construction and renovation of shop-within-shops, investment in infrastructure, including technology, acquisitions, joint ventures, payment of dividends, debt repayments, class a common stock repurchases, settlement of contingent liabilities (including uncertain tax positions), and other corporate activities, including our restructuring actions. we believe that our existing sources of cash, the availability under our credit facilities, and our ability to access capital markets will be sufficient to support our operating, capital, and debt service requirements for the foreseeable future, the ongoing development of our businesses, and our plans for further business expansion.

see note 11 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information relating to our credit facilities.
common stock repurchase program as of march 31, 2018, the remaining availability under our class a common stock repurchase program was approximately $100 million. repurchases of shares of class a common stock are subject to overall business and market conditions.
see note 15 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information relating to our class a common stock repurchase program.
dividends since 2003, we have maintained, and intend to continue to maintain, a regular quarterly cash dividend program on our common stock. however, any decision to declare and pay dividends in the future will be made at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our results of operations, cash requirements, financial condition, and other factors that the board of directors may deem relevant.
see note 15 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information relating to our quarterly cash dividend program.
debt and covenant compliance in september 2013, we completed a registered public debt offering and issued $300 million aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior notes due september 26, 2018, which bear interest at a fixed rate of 2.125%, payable semi-annually (the "2.125% senior notes"). in august 2015, we completed a second registered public debt offering and issued an additional $300 million aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior notes due august 18, 2020, which bear interest at a fixed rate of 2.625%, payable semi-annually (the "2.625% senior notes").
the indenture and supplemental indentures governing the 2.125% senior notes and 2.625% senior notes (as supplemented, the "indenture") contain certain covenants that restrict our ability, subject to specified exceptions, to incur certain liens; enter into sale and leaseback transactions; consolidate or merge with another party; or sell, lease, or convey all or substantially all of our property or assets to another party. however, the indenture does not contain any financial covenants.
the global credit facility contains a number of covenants, as described in note 11 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. as of march 31, 2018, no event of default (as such term is defined pursuant to the global credit facility) has occurred under our global credit facility. the pan-asia credit facilities do not contain any financial covenants.

contractual and other obligations firm commitments the following table summarizes certain of our aggregate contractual obligations as of march 31, 2018, and the estimated timing and effect that such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods. we expect to fund these firm commitments with operating cash flows generated in the normal course of business and, if necessary, through availability under our credit facilities or other accessible sources of financing.

the following is a description of our material, firmly committed obligations as of march 31, 2018:
•   senior notes represent the principal amount of our outstanding 2.125% senior notes and 2.625% senior notes. amounts do not include any fair value adjustments, call premiums, unamortized debt issuance costs, or interest payments (see below);
•   interest payments on senior notes represent the semi-annual contractual interest payments due on our 2.125% senior notes and 2.625% senior notes. amounts do not include the impact of potential cash flows underlying our swap contracts entered into during fiscal 2016 (see note 13 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for discussion of our swap contracts);
•   lease obligations represent the minimum rental payments due under noncancelable leases for our real estate and operating equipment. in addition to such amounts, we are normally required to pay taxes, insurance, and certain occupancy costs relating to our leased real estate properties, which are not included in the table above. approximately 75% of these lease obligations relate to our retail operations. information has been presented separately for operating and capital leases;
•   inventory purchase commitments represent our legally-binding agreements to purchase fixed or minimum quantities of goods at determinable prices;
•   mandatory transition tax payments represent our tax obligation incurred in connection with the deemed repatriation of previously deferred foreign earnings pursuant to the tcja (see note 10 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for discussion of the tcja). the expected mandatory transition tax payments have been presented net of foreign tax credits and other federal income tax activity of $61.5 million, which we expect to utilize to partially reduce this tax obligation; and
•   other commitments primarily represent our legally-binding obligations under sponsorship, licensing, and other marketing and advertising agreements; distribution-related agreements; information technology-related service agreements; and pension-related obligations.
excluded from the above contractual obligations table is the non-current liability for unrecognized tax benefits of $79.2 million as of march 31, 2018, as we cannot make a reliable estimate of the period in which the liability will be settled, if ever. the above table also excludes the following: (i) other than the current portion of long-term debt, capital lease obligations, and mandatory transition tax payments, amounts recorded in current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet as of march 31, 2018, including $10.1 million in borrowings outstanding under our pan-asia credit facilities, which will be paid within one year; and (ii) non-current liabilities that have no cash outflows associated with them (e.g., deferred revenue), or the cash outflows associated with
61
them are uncertain or do not represent a "purchase obligation" as the term is used herein (e.g., deferred taxes, derivative financial instruments, and other miscellaneous items).
we also have certain contractual arrangements that would require us to make payments if certain events or circumstances occur. see note 14 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a description of our contingent commitments not included in the above table.
off-balance sheet arrangements in addition to the commitments included in the above table, our other off-balance sheet firm commitments relating to our outstanding letters of credit amounted to $9.3 million as of march 31, 2018. we do not maintain any other off-balance sheet arrangements, transactions, obligations, or other relationships with unconsolidated entities that would be expected to have a material current or future effect on our consolidated financial statements.
market risk management as discussed in note 13 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements, we are exposed to a variety of risks, including changes in foreign currency exchange rates relating to foreign currency-denominated balances, certain anticipated cash flows from our international operations, and possible declines in the value of reported net assets of our foreign operations, as well as changes in the fair value of our fixed-rate debt relating to changes in interest rates. consequently, at times, in the normal course of business, we employ established policies and procedures, including the use of derivative financial instruments, to manage such risks. we do not enter into derivative transactions for speculative or trading purposes.
as a result of the use of derivative instruments, we are exposed to the risk that counterparties to our contracts will fail to meet their contractual obligations. to mitigate this counterparty credit risk, we have a policy of only entering into contracts with carefully selected financial institutions based upon an evaluation of their credit ratings and certain other factors, adhering to established limits for credit exposure. our established policies and procedures for mitigating credit risk from derivative transactions include ongoing review and assessment of the creditworthiness of our counterparties. we also enter into master netting arrangements with counterparties, when possible, to mitigate credit risk associated with our derivative instruments. as a result of the above considerations, we do not believe that we are exposed to any undue concentration of counterparty risk with respect to our derivative contracts as of march 31, 2018. however, we do have in aggregate $1.6 million of derivative instruments in net asset positions with two creditworthy financial institutions.
foreign currency risk management we manage our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates through the use of forward foreign currency exchange and cross-currency swap contracts. refer to note 13 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a summary of the notional amounts and fair values of our forward foreign currency exchange and cross-currency swap contracts outstanding as of march 31, 2018.
forward foreign currency exchange contracts we enter into forward foreign currency exchange contracts as hedges to reduce our risk related to exchange rate fluctuations on inventory transactions made in an entity's non-functional currency, intercompany royalty payments made by certain of our international operations, the settlement of foreign currency-denominated balances, and the translation of certain foreign operations' net assets into u.s. dollars. as part of our overall strategy to manage the level of exposure to the risk of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, primarily to changes in the value of the euro, the japanese yen, the south korean won, the australian dollar, the canadian dollar, the british pound sterling, the swiss franc, the swedish krona, the chinese renminbi, the new taiwan dollar, and the hong kong dollar, we hedge a portion of our foreign currency exposures anticipated over a two-year period. in doing so, we use forward foreign currency exchange contracts that generally have maturities of two months to two years to provide continuing coverage throughout the hedging period of the respective exposure.
our foreign exchange risk management activities are governed by our company's established policies and procedures. these policies and procedures provide a framework that allows for the management of currency exposures while ensuring the activities are conducted within our established guidelines. our policies include guidelines for the organizational structure of our risk management function and for internal controls over foreign exchange risk management activities, including, but not limited to, authorization levels, transaction limits, and credit quality controls, as well as various measurements for monitoring compliance. we monitor foreign exchange risk using different techniques, including a periodic review of market values and sensitivity analyses.
62
we record our forward foreign currency exchange contracts at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets. to the extent forward foreign currency exchange contracts are designated as cash flow hedges and are highly effective in offsetting changes in the value of the hedged items, the related gains or losses are initially deferred in equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income ("aoci") and are subsequently recognized in our consolidated statements of operations as follows:
•   forecasted inventory transactions - recognized as part of the cost of the inventory being hedged within cost of goods sold when the related inventory is sold to a third party.
•   intercompany royalties/settlement of foreign currency balances - recognized within other expense, net, during the period that the hedged balance is remeasured through earnings, generally through its settlement when the related payment occurs.
we recognized in earnings net losses on forward foreign currency exchange contracts of $8.7 million and $2.6 million during fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017, respectively, and a net gain of $32.4 million during fiscal 2016.
cross-currency swap contracts during fiscal 2016, we entered into two pay-floating rate, receive-floating rate cross-currency swaps, with notional amounts of €280 million and €274 million, which we designated as hedges of our net investment in certain of our european subsidiaries (the "cross-currency swaps"). the cross-currency swaps, which mature on september 26, 2018 and august 18, 2020, respectively, swap the u.s. dollar-denominated variable interest rate payments based on the 3-month london interbank offered rate ("libor") plus a fixed spread for euro-denominated variable interest rate payments based on the 3-month euro interbank offered rate plus a fixed spread. as a result, the cross-currency swaps, in conjunction with the interest rate swaps (as defined below), economically convert our $300 million fixed-rate 2.125% and $300 million fixed-rate 2.625% obligations to €280 million and €274 million floating-rate euro-denominated liabilities, respectively.
sensitivity we perform a sensitivity analysis to determine the effects that market risk exposures may have on the fair values of our forward foreign currency exchange and cross-currency swap contracts. to perform the analysis, we assess the risk of loss in these contracts' fair values that would result from hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates. this analysis assumes a like movement by the foreign currencies in our hedge portfolio against the u.s. dollar. as of march 31, 2018, a 10% appreciation or depreciation of the u.s. dollar against the exchange rates for foreign currencies under contract would result in a net increase or decrease, respectively, in the fair value of our derivative portfolio of approximately $141 million. this hypothetical net change in fair value should ultimately be largely offset by the net change in the fair values of the underlying hedged items.
interest rate risk management during fiscal 2016, we entered into two pay-floating rate, receive-fixed rate interest rate swap contracts which we designated as hedges against changes in the respective fair values of our fixed-rate 2.125% senior notes and our fixed-rate 2.625% senior notes attributed to changes in the benchmark interest rate (the "interest rate swaps"). the interest rate swaps, which mature on september 26, 2018 and august 18, 2020, respectively, both have notional amounts of $300 million and swap the fixed interest rates on our 2.125% senior notes and 2.625% senior notes for variable interest rates based on 3-month libor plus a fixed spread.
sensitivity as of march 31, 2018, notwithstanding the aforementioned interest rate swaps, we had no variable-rate debt outstanding. as such, our exposure to changes in interest rates primarily relates to a change in the fair value of our fixed-rate senior notes and borrowings outstanding under our credit facilities. as of march 31, 2018, the fair values of our senior notes and borrowings outstanding under our credit facilities were $598.1 million and $10.1 million, respectively. a 25 basis point increase or decrease in the level of interest rates would decrease or increase, respectively, the aggregate fair value of our senior notes and borrowings outstanding under our credit facilities by approximately $2 million. such potential increases or decreases in the fair value of our debt would only be relevant if we were to retire all or a portion of the debt prior to its maturity, and are based on certain simplifying assumptions, including an immediate across-the-board increase or decrease in the level of interest rates with no other subsequent changes for the remainder of the period.
63
investment risk management as of march 31, 2018, we had cash and cash equivalents on-hand of $1.305 billion, consisting of deposits in interest bearing accounts, investments in money market deposit accounts, and investments in time deposits and commercial paper with original maturities of 90 days or less. our other significant investments included $699.4 million of short-term investments, consisting of investments in time deposits and commercial paper with original maturities greater than 90 days; $50.9 million of restricted cash placed in escrow with certain banks as collateral, primarily to secure guarantees in connection with certain international tax matters; and $86.2 million of investments with maturities greater than one year, consisting of time deposits.
we actively monitor our exposure to changes in the fair value of our global investment portfolio in accordance with our established policies and procedures, which include monitoring both general and issuer-specific economic conditions, as discussed further below. our investment objectives include capital preservation, maintaining adequate liquidity, diversification to minimize liquidity and credit risk, and achievement of maximum returns within the guidelines set forth in our investment policy. see note 13 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further detail of the composition of our investment portfolio as of march 31, 2018.
we evaluate investments held in unrealized loss positions, if any, for other-than-temporary impairment on a quarterly basis. this evaluation involves a variety of considerations, including assessments of risks and uncertainties associated with general economic conditions and distinct conditions affecting specific issuers. we consider the following factors: (i) the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been below cost, (ii) the financial condition, credit worthiness, and near-term prospects of the issuer, (iii) the length of time to maturity, (iv) anticipated future economic conditions and market forecasts, (v) our intent and ability to retain our investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for recovery of market value, and (vi) an assessment of whether it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell our investment before recovery of market value. no material realized or unrealized gains or losses on available-for-sale investments or other-than-temporary impairment charges were recorded in any of the fiscal years presented.
critical accounting policies an accounting policy is considered to be critical if it is important to our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows, and requires significant judgment and estimates on the part of management in its application. our estimates are often based on complex judgments, assessments of probability, and assumptions that management believes to be reasonable, but that are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. it is also possible that other professionals, applying reasonable judgment to the same set of facts and circumstances, could develop and support a range of alternative estimated amounts. we believe that the following list represents our critical accounting policies. for a discussion of all of our significant accounting policies, including our critical accounting policies, see note 3 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
sales reserves and uncollectible accounts a significant area of judgment affecting reported revenue and net income involves estimating sales reserves, which represent the portion of gross revenues not expected to be realized. in particular, revenue related to our wholesale business is reduced by estimates of returns, discounts, end-of-season markdowns, and operational chargebacks. revenue related to our retail business, including digital commerce sales, is also reduced by an estimate of returns.
in determining estimates of returns, discounts, end-of-season markdowns, and operational chargebacks, we analyze historical trends, seasonal results, current economic and market conditions, and retailer performance. we review and refine these estimates on a quarterly basis. our historical estimates of these costs have not differed materially from actual results. a hypothetical 1% increase in our reserves for returns, discounts, end-of-season markdowns, and operational chargebacks as of march 31, 2018 would have decreased our fiscal 2018 net revenues by approximately $2 million.
similarly, we evaluate our accounts receivable balances to determine if they will ultimately be collected. significant judgments and estimates are involved in this evaluation, including an analysis of specific risks on a customer-by-customer basis for larger accounts and customers, and a receivables aging analysis that determines the percentage of receivables that has historically been uncollected by aged category. based on this information, we provide a reserve for the estimated amounts believed to be uncollectible. although we believe that we have adequately provided for those risks as part of our bad debt reserve, a severe and prolonged adverse impact on our major customers' business operations could have a corresponding material adverse effect on our net sales, cash flows, and/or financial condition.
64
see "accounts receivable" in note 3 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for an analysis of the activity in our sales reserves and allowance for doubtful accounts for each of the three fiscal years presented.
inventories we hold inventory that is sold through wholesale distribution channels to major department stores and specialty retail stores. we also hold retail inventory that is sold in our own stores and digital commerce sites directly to consumers. substantially all of our inventories are comprised of finished goods, which are stated at the lower of cost or estimated realizable value, with cost determined on a weighted-average cost basis.
the estimated net realizable value of inventory is determined based on an analysis of historical sales trends of our individual product lines, the impact of market trends and economic conditions, and a forecast of future demand, giving consideration to the value of current orders in-house for future sales of inventory, as well as plans to sell inventory through our factory stores, among other liquidation channels. actual results may differ from estimates due to the quantity, quality, and mix of products in inventory, consumer and retailer preferences, and market conditions. reserves for inventory shrinkage, representing the risk of physical loss of inventory, are estimated based on historical experience and are adjusted based upon physical inventory counts. our historical estimates of these costs and the related provisions have not differed materially from actual results.
a hypothetical 1% increase in the level of our inventory reserves as of march 31, 2018 would have decreased our fiscal 2018 gross profit by approximately $1 million.
impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill and certain other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite useful lives are not amortized. rather, goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are assessed for impairment at least annually. finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their respective estimated useful lives and, along with other long-lived assets, are evaluated for impairment periodically whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying values may not be fully recoverable.
we generally perform our annual goodwill impairment assessment using a qualitative approach to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its respective carrying value. however, in order to reassess the fair values of our reporting units, we periodically perform a quantitative impairment analysis in lieu of using the qualitative approach.
performance of the qualitative goodwill impairment assessment requires judgment in identifying and considering the significance of relevant key factors, events, and circumstances that affect the fair values of our reporting units. this requires consideration and assessment of external factors such as macroeconomic, industry, and market conditions, as well as entity-specific factors, such as our actual and planned financial performance. we also give consideration to the difference between each reporting unit's fair value and carrying value as of the most recent date that a fair value measurement was performed. if the results of the qualitative assessment conclude that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, additional quantitative impairment testing is performed.
the quantitative goodwill impairment test involves comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying value, including goodwill. if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, the reporting unit's goodwill is considered not to be impaired. however, if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recorded in an amount equal to that excess. any impairment charge recognized is limited to the amount of the respective reporting unit's allocated goodwill.
determining the fair value of a reporting unit under the quantitative goodwill impairment test requires judgment and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. similarly, estimates and assumptions are used when determining the fair values of other indefinite-lived intangible assets. these estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on whether or not an impairment charge is recognized and the magnitude of any such charge. to assist management in the process of determining any potential goodwill impairment, we may review and consider appraisals from accredited independent valuation firms. estimates of fair value are primarily determined using discounted cash flows, market comparisons, and recent transactions. these approaches use significant estimates and assumptions, including projected future cash flows (including timing), discount rates reflecting the risks inherent in future cash flows, perpetual growth rates, and determination of appropriate market comparables.
we performed our annual goodwill impairment assessment as of the beginning of the second quarter of fiscal 2018 using the qualitative approach discussed above, while giving consideration to our most recent quantitative goodwill impairment test (the results of which indicated that the fair values of our reporting units with allocated goodwill significantly exceeded their respective
65
carrying values). based on the results of the qualitative impairment assessment performed, we concluded that it is more likely than not that the fair values of these reporting units significantly exceeded their respective carrying values and there were no reporting units at risk of impairment. additionally, no goodwill impairment charges were recorded during any of the three fiscal years presented in connection with the company's annual goodwill impairment assessments.
subsequent to our fiscal 2017 annual goodwill impairment assessment, we realigned our segment reporting structure during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 as a result of significant organizational changes implemented in connection with the way forward plan. as a result of the realignment of our segment reporting structure, we reallocated the carrying amount of goodwill to our new reporting units based upon each reporting unit's relative fair value as of the first day of our fourth quarter of fiscal 2017. in connection with this reallocation, we performed an interim assessment of the recoverability of goodwill assigned to our new reporting units using the quantitative approach described above. based on the results of the quantitative impairment assessment performed, we concluded that the fair value of one of our new reporting units was less than its carrying value. as a result, a goodwill impairment charge of $5.2 million was recorded during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 to fully write off the carrying value of the reporting unit's reallocated goodwill. the fair values of the remaining new reporting units significantly exceeded their respective carrying values and were not at risk of impairment.
in evaluating finite-lived intangible assets for recoverability, we use our best estimate of future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition where probable. to the extent that estimated future undiscounted net cash flows attributable to the asset are less than its carrying value, an impairment loss is recognized equal to the difference between the carrying value of such asset and its fair value, considering external market participant assumptions.
during fiscal 2018, we recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $8.8 million as a result of a change in the planned usage of a certain intangible asset to reduce the value of the intangible asset to its estimated fair value. there were no other finite-lived intangible asset impairment charges recorded during any of the fiscal periods presented. see note 8 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion.
it is possible that our conclusions regarding impairment or recoverability of goodwill or other intangible assets could change in future periods if, for example, (i) our businesses do not perform as projected, (ii) overall economic conditions in future years vary from current assumptions, (iii) business conditions or strategies change from our current assumptions, or (iv) the identification of our reporting units change, among other factors. such changes could result in a future impairment charge of goodwill or other intangible assets, which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.
impairment of other long-lived assets property and equipment, along with other long-lived assets, are evaluated for impairment periodically whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their related carrying values may not be fully recoverable. in evaluating long-lived assets for recoverability, we use our best estimate of future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition, where applicable. to the extent that estimated future undiscounted net cash flows attributable to the asset are less than its carrying value, an impairment loss is recognized equal to the difference between the carrying value of such asset and its fair value, considering external market participant assumptions. assets to be disposed of and for which there is a committed plan of disposal are reported at the lower of carrying value or fair value, less costs to sell.
in determining future cash flows, we take various factors into account, including changes in merchandising strategy, the emphasis on retail store cost controls, the effects of macroeconomic trends such as consumer spending, and the impacts of more experienced retail store managers and increased local advertising. since the determination of future cash flows is an estimate of future performance, future impairments may arise in the event that future cash flows do not meet expectations.
during fiscal 2018, fiscal 2017, and fiscal 2016, we recorded non-cash impairment charges of $41.2 million, $248.6 million, and $48.8 million, respectively, to fully write off the carrying values of certain long-lived assets based upon their assumed fair values of zero. see note 8 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion.
income taxes in determining our income tax provision for financial reporting purposes, we establish a reserve for uncertain tax positions. if we consider that a tax position is more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, based solely on the technical merits of the position, we recognize the tax benefit. we measure the tax benefit by determining the largest amount that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement, presuming that the tax position is examined by the appropriate taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. these assessments can be complex and require significant judgment, and we often obtain assistance from external advisors. to the extent that our estimates change or the final tax outcome of these matters is different
66
from the amounts recorded, such differences will impact the income tax provision in the period in which such determinations are made. if the initial assessment of a position fails to result in the recognition of a tax benefit, we will recognize the tax benefit if (i) there are changes in tax law or analogous case law that sufficiently raise the likelihood of prevailing on the technical merits of the position to more likely than not; (ii) the statute of limitations expires; or (iii) there is a completion of an audit resulting in a settlement of that tax year with the appropriate agency.
deferred income taxes reflect the tax effect of certain net operating losses, capital losses, general business credit carryforwards, and the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial statement and income tax purposes, as determined under enacted tax laws and rates. valuation allowances are established when management determines that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. tax valuation allowances are analyzed periodically by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income, which typically involves the use of significant estimates. such allowances are adjusted as events occur, or circumstances change, that warrant adjustments to those balances.
during fiscal 2018, we recorded net charges of $221.4 million within our income tax provision in connection with the tcja. these charges were recorded on a provisional basis, as permitted by sab 118, based on our present interpretations of the tcja, current available information, and assumptions about future events. although we believe these provisional amounts represent a reasonable estimate of the ultimate enactment-related impact the tcja will have on our consolidated financial statements, the amounts could be adjusted materially as additional information becomes available, including potential new or interpretative guidance issued by the financial accounting standards board or the internal revenue service and other tax agencies, and as further analyses are completed.
see note 10 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion of income taxes.
contingencies we are periodically exposed to various contingencies in the ordinary course of conducting our business, including certain litigation, alleged information system security breaches, contractual disputes, employee relation matters, various tax or other governmental audits, and trademark and intellectual property matters and disputes. we record a liability for such contingencies to the extent that we conclude their occurrence is probable and the related losses are estimable. in addition, if it is reasonably possible that an unfavorable settlement of a contingency could exceed the established liability, we disclose the estimated impact on our liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations, if practicable. management considers many factors in making these assessments. as the ultimate resolution of contingencies is inherently unpredictable, these assessments can involve a series of complex judgments about future events including, but not limited to, court rulings, negotiations between affected parties, and governmental actions. as a result, the accounting for loss contingencies relies heavily on management's judgment in developing the related estimates and assumptions.
stock-based compensation we expense all stock-based compensation awarded to employees and non-employee directors based on the grant date fair value of the awards over the requisite service period, adjusted for forfeitures which are estimated based on an analysis of historical experience and expected future trends.
stock options stock options have been granted to employees and non-employee directors with exercise prices equal to the fair market value of our class a common stock on the date of grant. we use the black-scholes option-pricing model to estimate the grant date fair value of stock options, which requires the use of both subjective and objective assumptions. certain key assumptions involve estimating future uncertain events. the key factors influencing the estimation process include the expected term of the option, expected volatility of our stock price, our expected dividend yield, and the risk-free interest rate, among others. generally, once stock option values are determined, accounting practices do not permit them to be changed, even if the estimates used are different from actual results.
no stock options were granted during any of the three fiscal years presented. see note 17 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion.
67
restricted stock and restricted stock units ("rsus")
we grant restricted shares of our class a common stock to our non-employee directors and service-based rsus to certain of our senior executives and other employees. in addition, we grant performance-based rsus to such senior executives and other key executives. the fair values of restricted stock shares and rsus are based on the fair value of our class a common stock on the date of grant, adjusted to reflect the absence of dividends for any awards not entitled to accrue dividend equivalents while outstanding. compensation expense for performance-based rsus is recognized over the employees' requisite service period when attainment of the performance goals is deemed probable, which involves judgment as to achievement of certain performance metrics.
our performance-based rsu awards with a market condition in the form of a total shareholder return ("tsr") modifier are valued based on the expected attainment of performance at the end of a three-year performance period and tsr achieved relative to the s&p 500 index over the performance period. the fair value of these awards is estimated using a monte carlo simulation valuation model prepared by an independent third party. this pricing model utilizes multiple input variables that determine the probability of satisfying each market condition stipulated in the terms of the award to estimate its grant date fair value. compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures, is updated for the company's expected net income performance level against the related goal at the end of each reporting period. no performance-based rsus with a tsr modifier were granted during any of the three fiscal years presented. see note 17 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion.
sensitivity the assumptions used in calculating the grant date fair values of stock-based compensation awards represent our best estimates. in addition, judgment is required in estimating the number of stock-based awards that are expected to be forfeited. if actual results differ significantly from our estimates and assumptions, if we change the assumptions used to estimate the grant date fair value for future stock-based award grants, or if there are changes in market conditions, stock-based compensation expense and, therefore, our results of operations could be materially impacted. a hypothetical 10% change in our stock-based compensation expense would have affected our fiscal 2018 net income by approximately $5 million.
recently issued accounting standards see note 4 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a description of certain recently issued or proposed accounting standards which have impacted our consolidated financial statements, or may impact our consolidated financial statements in future reporting periods.

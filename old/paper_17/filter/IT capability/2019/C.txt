management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive summary as described further throughout this executive summary, citi's 2019 results reflected steady progress toward improving its profitability and returns, despite an uncertain revenue environment, as strong client engagement drove balanced growth across businesses and geographies:
•   citi had solid underlying revenue growth in every region in global consumer banking (gcb), excluding the impact of foreign currency translation into u.s. dollars for reporting purposes (fx translation), as well as pretax gains on sale in 2018 of approximately $150 million on the hilton portfolio in north america gcb and approximately $250 million on an asset management business in latin america gcb.
•   citi had balanced performance across the institutional clients group (icg), with solid results in fixed income markets, treasury and trade solutions, investment banking and the private bank, while equity markets revenues were negatively impacted by a challenging environment.
•   citi demonstrated strong expense discipline, resulting in expenses that were largely unchanged from the prior year, as well as positive operating leverage, even as citi continued to make investments in the franchise. citi's positive operating leverage and continued credit discipline resulted in an improvement in pretax earnings.
•   citi reported broad-based loan and deposit growth across gcb and icg.
•   citi returned $22.3 billion of capital to its shareholders in the form of common stock repurchases and dividends; citi repurchased approximately 264 million common shares, contributing to a 9% reduction in average outstanding common shares from the prior year.
•   despite continued progress in capital returns to shareholders, citi's key regulatory capital metrics remained strong.
while global growth has continued and the underlying macroeconomic environment remains largely positive, economic forecasts for 2020 have been lowered and various economic, political and other risks and uncertainties could create a more volatile operating environment and impact citi's businesses and future results. for a discussion of risks and uncertainties that could impact citi's businesses, results of operations and financial condition during 2020, see each respective business's results of operations, "risk factors" and "managing global risk" below. despite these risks and uncertainties, citi intends to continue to build on the progress made during 2019 with a focus on further optimizing its performance to benefit shareholders, while remaining flexible and adapting to market and economic conditions as they develop.
2019 results summary citigroup citigroup reported net income of $19.4 billion, or $8.04 per share, compared to net income of $18.0 billion, or $6.68 per share, in the prior year. net income increased 8%, primarily driven by a lower effective tax rate and higher revenues, partially offset by higher cost of credit, while expenses were largely unchanged. earnings per share increased 20%, driven by higher net income and the 9% reduction in average shares outstanding due to the common stock repurchases. results in 2019 included a net tax benefit of approximately $0.35 per share related to discrete tax items, including an approximate $0.6 billion benefit from reductions in citi's valuation allowance related to its deferred tax assets, primarily recorded in corporate/other (see "significant accounting policies and significant estimates-income taxes" below).
citigroup revenues of $74.3 billion increased 2%, or 4% excluding the impact of fx translation and the gains on sale in the prior year (see "executive summary" above), reflecting higher revenues across gcb and icg, partially offset by lower revenues in corporate/other.
citigroup's end-of-period loans increased 2% to $699 billion. excluding the impact of fx translation, citigroup end-of-period loans also grew 2%, as 3% aggregate growth in gcb and icg was partially offset by the continued wind-down of legacy assets in corporate/other. citigroup's end-of-period deposits increased 6% to $1.1 trillion. excluding the impact of fx translation, citigroup's end-of-period deposits also grew 6%, primarily driven by 7% growth in gcb and 6% growth in icg, excluding the impact of fx translation. (citi's results of operations excluding the gains on sale as well as the impact of fx translation are non-gaap financial measures. citi believes the presentation of its results of operations excluding the impact of fx translation and gains on sale provides a meaningful depiction for investors of the underlying fundamentals of its businesses.)
expenses citigroup operating expenses of $42.0 billion were largely unchanged, as efficiency savings and the wind-down of legacy assets offset volume-driven growth and continued investments in the franchise. operating expenses in gcb and corporate/other were down 1% and 5%, respectively, while icg operating expenses increased 2%.
cost of credit citi's total provisions for credit losses and for benefits and claims of $8.4 billion increased 11%. the increase was primarily driven by higher net credit losses in both citi-branded cards and citi retail services in north america gcb, as well as higher overall cost of credit in icg.
net credit losses of $7.8 billion increased 9%. consumer net credit losses of $7.4 billion increased 7%, primarily reflecting volume growth and seasoning in the north america cards portfolios. corporate net credit losses increased to $392
million from $205 million in the prior year, reflecting a normalization in credit trends.

capital citigroup's common equity tier 1 (cet1) capital ratio was 11.8% as of december 31, 2019, compared to 11.9% as of december 31, 2018, based on the basel iii standardized approach for determining risk-weighted assets. the decline in the ratio primarily reflected the return of capital to common shareholders, partially offset by net income and a reduction in risk-weighted assets. citigroup's supplementary leverage ratio as of december 31, 2019 was 6.2%, compared to 6.4% as of december 31, 2018. for additional information on citi's capital ratios and related components, see "capital resources" below.
global consumer banking gcb net income of $5.7 billion increased 7%. excluding the impact of fx translation, net income increased 8%, driven by higher revenues, partially offset by higher cost of credit. gcb operating expenses of $17.6 billion decreased 1%. excluding the impact of fx translation, expenses were largely unchanged, as efficiency savings offset continued investments in the franchise and volume-driven growth.
gcb revenues of $33.0 billion increased 2%. excluding the impact of fx translation and the gains on sale in both north america gcb and latin america gcb in the prior year, revenues increased 4%, driven by growth in all three regions. north america gcb revenues of $20.4 billion increased 3%, and 4% excluding the gain on sale in the prior year, primarily driven by growth in citi-branded cards and citi retail services, partially offset by lower retail banking revenues. in north america gcb, citi-branded cards revenues of $9.2 billion increased 6%, and 8% excluding the gain on sale in the prior year, primarily reflecting volume growth and spread expansion. citi retail services revenues of $6.7 billion increased 2%, primarily driven by organic loan growth and the full-year benefit of the l.l.bean acquisition. retail banking revenues of $4.5 billion decreased 2%, as the benefit of stronger deposit volumes was more than offset by lower deposit spreads.
north america gcb average deposits of $153 billion increased 3%, average retail banking loans of $49 billion increased 3% and assets under management of $72 billion grew 20% (including the benefit of market movements). average citi-branded card loans of $90 billion increased 3%, while citi-branded card purchase sales of $368 billion increased 7%. average citi retail services loans of $50 billion increased 3%, while citi retail services purchase sales of $88 billion increased 2%. for additional information on the results of operations of north america gcb in 2019, see "global consumer banking-north america gcb" below.
excluding the impact of fx translation and the gain on sale in latin america gcb in the prior year, international gcb revenues increased 4%. on this basis, latin america gcb revenues increased 4%, primarily driven by an increase in cards revenues and improved deposit spreads. asia gcb revenues increased 4%, primarily reflecting higher deposit, investment and cards revenues. for additional information on the results of operations of latin america gcb and asia gcb in 2019, including the impact of fx translation, see "global consumer banking-latin america gcb" and "global consumer banking-asia gcb" below.
year-over-year, excluding the impact of fx translation, international gcb average deposits of $124 billion increased 5%, average retail banking loans of $71 billion increased 4%, assets under management of $104 billion increased 16%(including the benefit of market movements), average card loans of $25 billion increased 3% and card purchase sales of $108 billion increased 6%.
institutional clients group icg net income of $12.9 billion increased 3%, primarily driven by higher revenues and a lower effective tax rate, partially offset by higher expenses and cost of credit. icg operating expenses increased 2% to $22.2 billion, primarily driven by higher compensation costs, investments and volume-driven growth, partially offset by efficiency savings.
icg revenues of $39.3 billion increased 3%, reflecting a 1% increase in banking revenues and a 5% increase in markets and securities services revenues. the increase in banking revenues included the impact of $432 million of losses on loan hedges within corporate lending, compared to gains of $45 million in the prior year.
banking revenues of $21.9 billion (excluding the impact of gains (losses) on loan hedges within corporate lending) increased 3%, driven by solid growth in treasury and trade solutions, investment banking and the private bank. investment banking revenues of $5.2 billion increased 4%, as strength in debt underwriting was partially offset by lower revenues in both equity underwriting and advisory. advisory revenues decreased 3% to $1.3 billion, equity underwriting revenues decreased 2% to $973 million and debt underwriting revenues increased 10% to $3.0 billion.
treasury and trade solutions revenues of $10.3 billion increased 4%, and 6% excluding the impact of fx translation, reflecting strong client engagement and volume growth, partially offset by the impact of lower interest rates. private bank revenues of $3.5 billion increased 2%, driven by higher lending and deposit volumes as well as higher investment activity, partially offset by spread compression. corporate lending revenues declined 16% to $2.5 billion. excluding the impact of gains (losses) on loan hedges, corporate lending revenues were largely unchanged, as growth in the commercial loan portfolio was offset by lower volumes in the rest of the portfolio.
markets and securities services revenues of $17.8 billion increased 5%, including a pretax gain of approximately $350 million on citi's investment in tradeweb in the second quarter of 2019, recorded in fixed income markets. fixed income markets revenues of $12.9 billion increased 10%, reflecting growth across rates and currencies as well as spread products, including the tradeweb gain. equity markets revenues of $2.9 billion decreased 15%, primarily driven by lower revenues across cash equities, derivatives and prime finance. securities services revenues of $2.6 billion were largely unchanged, but increased 4% excluding the impact of fx translation, reflecting higher net interest revenue due to higher deposits and higher interest rates, particularly in emerging markets, as well as higher client volumes. for additional information on the results of operations of icg in 2019, see "institutional clients group" below.
corporate/other corporate/other net income was $801 million, compared to $186 million in the prior year, primarily reflecting the benefit of discrete tax items. operating expenses of $2.2 billion decreased 5%, as the continued wind-down of legacy assets more than offset higher infrastructure costs. corporate/other revenues of $2.0 billion decreased 8%, primarily driven by the continued wind-down of legacy assets, partially offset by gains on investments. for additional information on the results of operations of corporate/other in 2019, see "corporate/other" below.

(1)   2018 includes an approximate $150 million gain on the hilton portfolio sale.
net income increased 4%, as higher revenues and lower expenses were partially offset by higher cost of credit.
revenues increased 3%. excluding the impact of the $150 million gain on the hilton portfolio sale in the prior year, revenues increased 4%, reflecting higher revenues in citi-branded cards and citi retail services, partially offset by lower retail banking revenues.
retail banking revenues decreased 2%, as the benefit of stronger deposit volumes was more than offset by lower deposit spreads. average deposits increased 3%. assets under management increased 20%, including the benefit of market movements. citi expects that retail banking revenues will likely be impacted by the lower interest rate environment in the near term.
cards revenues increased 4% (5% excluding the hilton gain). in citi-branded cards, revenues increased 6% (8% excluding the hilton gain), primarily driven by volume growth and spread expansion. average loans increased 3% and purchase sales increased 7%.
citi retail services revenues increased 2%, primarily driven by organic loan growth and the full-year benefit of the l.l.bean portfolio acquisition. average loans increased 3% and purchase sales increased 2%.
expenses decreased 1%, as efficiency savings more than offset ongoing investments and higher volume-related expenses.
provisions increased 9%, primarily driven by higher net credit losses. net credit losses increased 10%, driven by higher net credit losses in citi-branded cards (up 10% to $2.9 billion) and citi retail services (up 9% to $2.6 billion). the increase in net credit losses reflected volume growth and seasoning in both cards portfolios. the net loan loss reserve build increased 2%, reflecting volume growth and seasoning in both cards portfolios.

net income increased 12%, primarily driven by higher revenues, partially offset by modestly higher cost of credit.
retail banking revenues increased 5%, primarily driven by higher investment revenues due to improved market sentiment and higher deposit revenues. investment sales increased 8%, assets under management grew 17%, including the benefit of market movements, average deposits increased 6% and average loans increased 5%. retail lending revenues declined 1%, as continued growth in personal loans was more than offset by lower mortgage revenues due to spread compression.
expenses were largely unchanged, as efficiency savings were offset by ongoing investment spending and volume-driven growth.
provisions increased 4%, as higher net credit losses reflecting volume growth and seasoning were partially offset by a lower net loan loss reserve build in the current year. overall credit quality remained stable in the region.

institutional clients group institutional clients group (icg) includes banking and markets and securities services (for additional information on these businesses, see "citigroup segments" above). icg provides corporate, institutional, public sector and high-net-worth clients around the world with a full range of wholesale banking products and services, including fixed income and equity sales and trading, foreign exchange, prime brokerage, derivative services, equity and fixed income research, corporate lending, investment banking and advisory services, private banking, cash management, trade finance and securities services. icg transacts with clients in both cash instruments and derivatives, including fixed income, foreign currency, equity and commodity products.
icg revenue is generated primarily from fees and spreads associated with these activities. icg earns fee income for assisting clients with transactional services and clearing and providing brokerage and investment banking services and other such activities. such fees are recognized at the point in time when citigroup's performance under the terms of a contractual arrangement is completed, which is typically at the trade/execution date or closing of a transaction. revenue generated from these activities is recorded in commissions and fees and investment banking. revenue is also generated from assets under custody and administration, which is recognized as/when the associated promised service is satisfied, which normally occurs at the point in time the service is requested by the customer and provided by citi. revenue generated from these activities is primarily recorded in administration and other fiduciary fees. for additional information on these various types of revenues, see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements.
in addition, as a market maker, icg facilitates transactions, including holding product inventory to meet client demand, and earns the differential between the price at which it buys and sells the products. these price differentials and the unrealized gains and losses on the inventory are recorded in principal transactions. mark-to-market gains and losses on certain credit derivatives (used to hedge the corporate loan portfolio) are also recorded in principal transactions, (for additional information on principal transactions revenue, see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements). other primarily includes realized gains and losses on available-for-sale (afs) debt securities, gains and losses on equity securities not held in trading accounts and other non-recurring gains and losses. interest income earned on assets held, less interest paid on long- and short-term debt and to customers on deposits, is recorded as net interest revenue.
the amount and types of markets revenues are impacted by a variety of interrelated factors, including market liquidity; changes in market variables such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices, commodity prices and credit spreads, as well as their implied volatilities; investor confidence and other macroeconomic conditions. assuming all other market conditions do not change, increases in client activity levels or bid/offer spreads generally result in increases in revenues. however, changes in market conditions can significantly impact client activity levels, bid/offer spreads and the fair value of product inventory. for example, a decrease in market liquidity may increase bid/offer spreads, decrease client activity levels and widen credit spreads on product inventory positions.
icg's management of the markets businesses involves daily monitoring and evaluation of the above factors at the trading desk as well as the country level. icg does not separately track the impact on total markets revenues of the volume of transactions, bid/offer spreads, fair value changes of product inventory positions and economic hedges because, as noted above, these components are interrelated and are not deemed useful or necessary individually to manage the markets businesses at an aggregate level.
in the markets businesses, client revenues are those revenues directly attributable to client transactions at the time of inception, including commissions, interest or fees earned. client revenues do not include the results of client facilitation activities (e.g., holding product inventory in anticipation of client demand) or the results of certain economic hedging activities.
icg's international presence is supported by trading floors in approximately 80 countries and a proprietary network in 98 countries and jurisdictions. at december 31, 2019, icg had approximately $1.4 trillion in assets and $768 billion in deposits, while two of its businesses-securities services and issuer services-managed approximately $20.3 trillion and $17.5 trillion in assets under custody as of december 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.

(1)   credit derivatives are used to economically hedge a portion of the corporate loan portfolio that includes both accrual loans and loans at fair value. gains (losses) on loan hedges include the mark-to-market on the credit derivatives and the mark-to-market on the loans in the portfolio that are at fair value. the fixed premium costs of these hedges are netted against the corporate lending revenues to reflect the cost of credit protection. citigroup's results of operations excluding the impact of gains (losses) on loan hedges are non-gaap financial measures.
(2)   2019 includes an approximate $350 million gain on citi's investment in tradeweb in the second quarter.
(3)   2017 includes the approximate $580 million gain on the sale of a fixed income analytics business.
(4)   excludes principal transactions revenues of icg businesses other than markets, primarily treasury and trade solutions and the private bank.
(5)   citi assesses its markets business performance on a total revenue basis, as offsets may occur across revenue line items. for example, securities that generate net interest revenue may be risk managed by derivatives that are recorded in principal transactions revenue. for a description of the composition of these revenue line items, see notes 4, 5 and 6 to the consolidated financial statements.
nm not meaningful the discussion of the results of operations for icg below excludes (where noted) the impact of gains (losses) on hedges of accrual loans, which are non-gaap financial measures. for a reconciliation of these metrics to the reported results, see the table above.
net income increased 3%, driven primarily by higher revenues and a lower effective tax rate, partially offset by higher expenses and higher cost of credit.
revenues increased 3%, reflecting higher banking revenues (increase of 1% including the gains (losses) on loan hedges) and higher markets and securities services revenues (increase of 5%). excluding the impact of the gains (losses) on loan hedges, banking revenues were up 3%, driven by higher revenues in treasury and trade solutions, investment banking and the private bank, as corporate lending was largely unchanged. markets and securities services revenues were up 5%, including a gain in the second quarter of 2019 from citi's investment in tradeweb, as higher revenues in fixed income markets were partially offset by lower equity markets revenues.
citi expects that icg's revenues will likely be impacted by the lower interest rate environment in the near term.
within banking:
•   investment banking revenues increased 4%, reflecting gains in wallet share despite a decline in the overall market wallet. debt underwriting increased 10%, reflecting gains in wallet share, primarily in investment grade underwriting, across north america, emea and asia. equity underwriting revenues decreased 2%, reflecting a decline in market wallet, particularly in asia and emea, partially offset by gains in wallet share. advisory revenues decreased 3%, largely due to a comparison to a strong prior year as well as a decline in market wallet, partially offset by gains in wallet share.
•   treasury and trade solutions revenues increased 4%. excluding the impact of fx translation, revenues increased 6%, reflecting strength in all regions, driven by growth across both net interest and fee income. revenues increased in the cash business, primarily driven by strong client engagement and solid growth in deposit and transaction volumes, partially offset by spread compression in the second half of 2019 due to the impact of lower interest rates. revenue growth in the trade business was driven by improved spreads, due to growth in structured loans as well as the ability to continue to utilize distribution capabilities to optimize the balance sheet and drive returns, while supporting clients. average deposits increased 10%, reflecting growth across regions. average trade loans declined 3%, driven by north america, emea and asia (for additional information, see "liquidity risk-loans" below).
•   corporate lending revenues decreased 16%. excluding the impact of gains (losses) on loan hedges, revenues were largely unchanged versus the prior year, as growth in the commercial loan portfolio was offset by lower volumes in the rest of the portfolio.
•   private bank revenues increased 2%, driven primarily by north america and asia, partially offset by latin america. the increase in revenues reflected strong client activity, driving higher lending and deposit volumes, as well as higher capital markets revenues, partially offset by lower deposit spreads.
within markets and securities services:
•   fixed income markets revenues increased 10%, including the tradeweb gain, reflecting higher revenues across all regions. non-interest revenues increased due to higher corporate and investor client activity as well as improved market activity, particularly in rates and spread products. the increase in non-interest revenues was partially offset by a decline in net interest revenues, reflecting a change in the mix of trading positions in support of client activity as well as higher funding costs, given the higher interest rate environment in the first half of the year.
rates and currencies revenues increased 9%, primarily driven by higher g10 rates and currencies revenues in north america, asia and emea, reflecting a more favorable operating environment in the second half of 2019, with higher corporate and investor client activity. local markets rates and currencies revenues increased modestly despite declining currency volatility.
spread products and other fixed income revenues increased 15%, including the tradeweb gain, reflecting higher revenues in both north america and emea. the increase in revenues was driven by higher client activity as well as an improved trading environment, particularly in flow trading and financing products. this increase in revenues was partially offset by lower structured products revenues, reflecting a challenging trading environment.
•   equity markets revenues decreased 15%, driven by lower revenues across cash equities, equity derivatives and prime finance, particularly in north america and asia. cash equities revenues decreased largely due to lower client volumes. despite strong corporate and investor client activity, equity derivatives revenues decreased due to the impact of a less favorable trading environment, given lower market volatility, as well as a comparison to a strong prior year. the decline in prime finance revenues was primarily driven by lower client activity and lower financing balances. non-interest revenues decreased, primarily driven by lower principal transaction and commissions and fee revenues, due to lower client activity and a less favorable trading environment, as well as a change in the mix of trading positions in support of client activity.
•   securities services revenues were largely unchanged versus the prior year. excluding the impact of fx translation, revenues increased 4%, reflecting higher revenues in asia and latin america. the increase in revenues was driven by higher net interest revenue due to higher deposit volumes and higher interest rates, particularly in emerging markets, as well as higher client activity.
expenses increased 2%, as higher compensation, volume-related expenses and continued investments were partially offset by efficiency savings and a benefit from fx translation.
provisions increased $348 million, driven by an increase in net credit losses of $186 million, and an increase in the net loan loss reserve build of $162 million. both the increase in net credit losses and the higher loan loss reserve build largely reflected a normalization of credit trends.

corporate/other corporate/other includes certain unallocated costs of global staff functions (including finance, risk, human resources, legal and compliance), other corporate expenses and unallocated global operations and technology expenses and income taxes, as well as corporate treasury, certain north america legacy consumer loan portfolios, other legacy assets and discontinued operations (for additional information on corporate/other, see "citigroup segments" above). at december 31, 2019, corporate/other had $97 billion in assets.

net income was $801 million, compared to net income of $186 million in the prior year. net income was largely driven by an income tax benefit of $886 million, compared to an income tax benefit of $88 million in the prior year. the increase in the income tax benefit primarily reflected the reduction in the valuation allowance related to citi's deferred tax assets and a pretax loss in the current year (see "significant accounting policies and significant estimates-income taxes" below). the pretax loss was largely driven by lower revenues from legacy assets, partially offset by higher gains on investments. the pretax loss also reflected higher cost of credit, partially offset by lower expenses.
revenues decreased 8%, driven by the continued wind-down of legacy assets, partially offset by gains on investments.
expenses decreased 5%, as the continued wind-down of legacy assets was partially offset by higher infrastructure costs.
provisions increased $127 million to a net benefit of $75 million, primarily due to a lower net loan loss reserve release, partially offset by lower net credit losses.
citi expects that corporate/other results will likely be impacted by ongoing investments in infrastructure and controls as well as lower interest rates and lower investment gains during 2020.
off-balance sheet arrangements citigroup enters into various types of off-balance sheet arrangements in the ordinary course of business. citi's involvement in these arrangements can take many different forms, including without limitation:
•   purchasing or retaining residual and other interests in unconsolidated special purpose entities, such as mortgage-backed and other asset-backed securitization entities;
•   holding senior and subordinated debt, interests in limited and general partnerships and equity interests in other unconsolidated special purpose entities; and
•   providing guarantees, indemnifications, loan commitments, letters of credit and representations and warranties.
citi enters into these arrangements for a variety of business purposes. for example, securitization arrangements offer investors access to specific cash flows and risks created through the securitization process. securitization arrangements also assist citi and its customers in monetizing their financial assets and securing financing at more favorable rates than citi or the customers could otherwise obtain.
the table below shows where a discussion of citi's various off-balance sheet arrangements may be found in this form 10-k. in addition, see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements.

(4)   purchase obligations consist of obligations to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on citi. for presentation purposes, purchase obligations are included in the table above through the termination date of the respective agreements, even if the contract is renewable. many of the purchase agreements for goods or services include clauses that would allow citi to cancel the agreement with specified notice; however, that impact is not included in the table above (unless citi has already notified the counterparty of its intention to terminate the agreement).
(5)   other liabilities reflected on citigroup's consolidated balance sheet includes accounts payable, accrued expenses, uncertain tax positions and other liabilities that have been incurred and will ultimately be paid in cash; legal reserve accruals are not included in the table above. also includes discretionary contributions in 2018 for citi's employee-defined benefit obligations for the pension, postretirement and post employment plans and defined contribution plans.
capital resources management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive summary as described further throughout this executive summary, citi's 2019 results reflected steady progress toward improving its profitability and returns, despite an uncertain revenue environment, as strong client engagement drove balanced growth across businesses and geographies:
•   citi had solid underlying revenue growth in every region in global consumer banking (gcb), excluding the impact of foreign currency translation into u.s. dollars for reporting purposes (fx translation), as well as pretax gains on sale in 2018 of approximately $150 million on the hilton portfolio in north america gcb and approximately $250 million on an asset management business in latin america gcb.
•   citi had balanced performance across the institutional clients group (icg), with solid results in fixed income markets, treasury and trade solutions, investment banking and the private bank, while equity markets revenues were negatively impacted by a challenging environment.
•   citi demonstrated strong expense discipline, resulting in expenses that were largely unchanged from the prior year, as well as positive operating leverage, even as citi continued to make investments in the franchise. citi's positive operating leverage and continued credit discipline resulted in an improvement in pretax earnings.
•   citi reported broad-based loan and deposit growth across gcb and icg.
•   citi returned $22.3 billion of capital to its shareholders in the form of common stock repurchases and dividends; citi repurchased approximately 264 million common shares, contributing to a 9% reduction in average outstanding common shares from the prior year.
•   despite continued progress in capital returns to shareholders, citi's key regulatory capital metrics remained strong.
while global growth has continued and the underlying macroeconomic environment remains largely positive, economic forecasts for 2020 have been lowered and various economic, political and other risks and uncertainties could create a more volatile operating environment and impact citi's businesses and future results. for a discussion of risks and uncertainties that could impact citi's businesses, results of operations and financial condition during 2020, see each respective business's results of operations, "risk factors" and "managing global risk" below. despite these risks and uncertainties, citi intends to continue to build on the progress made during 2019 with a focus on further optimizing its performance to benefit shareholders, while remaining flexible and adapting to market and economic conditions as they develop.
2019 results summary citigroup citigroup reported net income of $19.4 billion, or $8.04 per share, compared to net income of $18.0 billion, or $6.68 per share, in the prior year. net income increased 8%, primarily driven by a lower effective tax rate and higher revenues, partially offset by higher cost of credit, while expenses were largely unchanged. earnings per share increased 20%, driven by higher net income and the 9% reduction in average shares outstanding due to the common stock repurchases. results in 2019 included a net tax benefit of approximately $0.35 per share related to discrete tax items, including an approximate $0.6 billion benefit from reductions in citi's valuation allowance related to its deferred tax assets, primarily recorded in corporate/other (see "significant accounting policies and significant estimates-income taxes" below).
citigroup revenues of $74.3 billion increased 2%, or 4% excluding the impact of fx translation and the gains on sale in the prior year (see "executive summary" above), reflecting higher revenues across gcb and icg, partially offset by lower revenues in corporate/other.
citigroup's end-of-period loans increased 2% to $699 billion. excluding the impact of fx translation, citigroup end-of-period loans also grew 2%, as 3% aggregate growth in gcb and icg was partially offset by the continued wind-down of legacy assets in corporate/other. citigroup's end-of-period deposits increased 6% to $1.1 trillion. excluding the impact of fx translation, citigroup's end-of-period deposits also grew 6%, primarily driven by 7% growth in gcb and 6% growth in icg, excluding the impact of fx translation. (citi's results of operations excluding the gains on sale as well as the impact of fx translation are non-gaap financial measures. citi believes the presentation of its results of operations excluding the impact of fx translation and gains on sale provides a meaningful depiction for investors of the underlying fundamentals of its businesses.)
expenses citigroup operating expenses of $42.0 billion were largely unchanged, as efficiency savings and the wind-down of legacy assets offset volume-driven growth and continued investments in the franchise. operating expenses in gcb and corporate/other were down 1% and 5%, respectively, while icg operating expenses increased 2%.
cost of credit citi's total provisions for credit losses and for benefits and claims of $8.4 billion increased 11%. the increase was primarily driven by higher net credit losses in both citi-branded cards and citi retail services in north america gcb, as well as higher overall cost of credit in icg.
net credit losses of $7.8 billion increased 9%. consumer net credit losses of $7.4 billion increased 7%, primarily reflecting volume growth and seasoning in the north america cards portfolios. corporate net credit losses increased to $392
million from $205 million in the prior year, reflecting a normalization in credit trends.
for additional information on citi's consumer and corporate credit costs and allowance for loan losses, see each respective business's results of operations and "credit risk" below.
capital citigroup's common equity tier 1 (cet1) capital ratio was 11.8% as of december 31, 2019, compared to 11.9% as of december 31, 2018, based on the basel iii standardized approach for determining risk-weighted assets. the decline in the ratio primarily reflected the return of capital to common shareholders, partially offset by net income and a reduction in risk-weighted assets. citigroup's supplementary leverage ratio as of december 31, 2019 was 6.2%, compared to 6.4% as of december 31, 2018. for additional information on citi's capital ratios and related components, see "capital resources" below.
global consumer banking gcb net income of $5.7 billion increased 7%. excluding the impact of fx translation, net income increased 8%, driven by higher revenues, partially offset by higher cost of credit. gcb operating expenses of $17.6 billion decreased 1%. excluding the impact of fx translation, expenses were largely unchanged, as efficiency savings offset continued investments in the franchise and volume-driven growth.
gcb revenues of $33.0 billion increased 2%. excluding the impact of fx translation and the gains on sale in both north america gcb and latin america gcb in the prior year, revenues increased 4%, driven by growth in all three regions. north america gcb revenues of $20.4 billion increased 3%, and 4% excluding the gain on sale in the prior year, primarily driven by growth in citi-branded cards and citi retail services, partially offset by lower retail banking revenues. in north america gcb, citi-branded cards revenues of $9.2 billion increased 6%, and 8% excluding the gain on sale in the prior year, primarily reflecting volume growth and spread expansion. citi retail services revenues of $6.7 billion increased 2%, primarily driven by organic loan growth and the full-year benefit of the l.l.bean acquisition. retail banking revenues of $4.5 billion decreased 2%, as the benefit of stronger deposit volumes was more than offset by lower deposit spreads.
north america gcb average deposits of $153 billion increased 3%, average retail banking loans of $49 billion increased 3% and assets under management of $72 billion grew 20% (including the benefit of market movements). average citi-branded card loans of $90 billion increased 3%, while citi-branded card purchase sales of $368 billion increased 7%. average citi retail services loans of $50 billion increased 3%, while citi retail services purchase sales of $88 billion increased 2%. for additional information on the results of operations of north america gcb in 2019, see "global consumer banking-north america gcb" below.
excluding the impact of fx translation and the gain on sale in latin america gcb in the prior year, international gcb revenues increased 4%. on this basis, latin america gcb revenues increased 4%, primarily driven by an increase in cards revenues and improved deposit spreads. asia gcb revenues increased 4%, primarily reflecting higher deposit, investment and cards revenues. for additional information on the results of operations of latin america gcb and asia gcb in 2019, including the impact of fx translation, see "global consumer banking-latin america gcb" and "global consumer banking-asia gcb" below.
year-over-year, excluding the impact of fx translation, international gcb average deposits of $124 billion increased 5%, average retail banking loans of $71 billion increased 4%, assets under management of $104 billion increased 16%(including the benefit of market movements), average card loans of $25 billion increased 3% and card purchase sales of $108 billion increased 6%.
institutional clients group icg net income of $12.9 billion increased 3%, primarily driven by higher revenues and a lower effective tax rate, partially offset by higher expenses and cost of credit. icg operating expenses increased 2% to $22.2 billion, primarily driven by higher compensation costs, investments and volume-driven growth, partially offset by efficiency savings.
icg revenues of $39.3 billion increased 3%, reflecting a 1% increase in banking revenues and a 5% increase in markets and securities services revenues. the increase in banking revenues included the impact of $432 million of losses on loan hedges within corporate lending, compared to gains of $45 million in the prior year.
banking revenues of $21.9 billion (excluding the impact of gains (losses) on loan hedges within corporate lending) increased 3%, driven by solid growth in treasury and trade solutions, investment banking and the private bank. investment banking revenues of $5.2 billion increased 4%, as strength in debt underwriting was partially offset by lower revenues in both equity underwriting and advisory. advisory revenues decreased 3% to $1.3 billion, equity underwriting revenues decreased 2% to $973 million and debt underwriting revenues increased 10% to $3.0 billion.
treasury and trade solutions revenues of $10.3 billion increased 4%, and 6% excluding the impact of fx translation, reflecting strong client engagement and volume growth, partially offset by the impact of lower interest rates. private bank revenues of $3.5 billion increased 2%, driven by higher lending and deposit volumes as well as higher investment activity, partially offset by spread compression. corporate lending revenues declined 16% to $2.5 billion. excluding the impact of gains (losses) on loan hedges, corporate lending revenues were largely unchanged, as growth in the commercial loan portfolio was offset by lower volumes in the rest of the portfolio.
markets and securities services revenues of $17.8 billion increased 5%, including a pretax gain of approximately $350 million on citi's investment in tradeweb in the second quarter of 2019, recorded in fixed income markets. fixed income markets revenues of $12.9 billion increased 10%, reflecting growth across rates and currencies as well as spread products, including the tradeweb gain. equity markets revenues of $2.9 billion decreased 15%, primarily driven by lower revenues across cash equities, derivatives and prime finance. securities services revenues of $2.6 billion were largely unchanged, but increased 4% excluding the impact of fx translation, reflecting higher net interest revenue due to higher deposits and higher interest rates, particularly in emerging markets, as well as higher client volumes. for additional information on the results of operations of icg in 2019, see "institutional clients group" below.
corporate/other corporate/other net income was $801 million, compared to $186 million in the prior year, primarily reflecting the benefit of discrete tax items. operating expenses of $2.2 billion decreased 5%, as the continued wind-down of legacy assets more than offset higher infrastructure costs. corporate/other revenues of $2.0 billion decreased 8%, primarily driven by the continued wind-down of legacy assets, partially offset by gains on investments. for additional information on the results of operations of corporate/other in 2019, see "corporate/other" below.

(1)   2018 includes an approximate $150 million gain on the hilton portfolio sale.
net income increased 4%, as higher revenues and lower expenses were partially offset by higher cost of credit.
revenues increased 3%. excluding the impact of the $150 million gain on the hilton portfolio sale in the prior year, revenues increased 4%, reflecting higher revenues in citi-branded cards and citi retail services, partially offset by lower retail banking revenues.
retail banking revenues decreased 2%, as the benefit of stronger deposit volumes was more than offset by lower deposit spreads. average deposits increased 3%. assets under management increased 20%, including the benefit of market movements. citi expects that retail banking revenues will likely be impacted by the lower interest rate environment in the near term.
cards revenues increased 4% (5% excluding the hilton gain). in citi-branded cards, revenues increased 6% (8% excluding the hilton gain), primarily driven by volume growth and spread expansion. average loans increased 3% and purchase sales increased 7%.
citi retail services revenues increased 2%, primarily driven by organic loan growth and the full-year benefit of the l.l.bean portfolio acquisition. average loans increased 3% and purchase sales increased 2%.
expenses decreased 1%, as efficiency savings more than offset ongoing investments and higher volume-related expenses.
provisions increased 9%, primarily driven by higher net credit losses. net credit losses increased 10%, driven by higher net credit losses in citi-branded cards (up 10% to $2.9 billion) and citi retail services (up 9% to $2.6 billion). the increase in net credit losses reflected volume growth and seasoning in both cards portfolios. the net loan loss reserve build increased 2%, reflecting volume growth and seasoning in both cards portfolios.

net income increased 12%, primarily driven by higher revenues, partially offset by modestly higher cost of credit.
retail banking revenues increased 5%, primarily driven by higher investment revenues due to improved market sentiment and higher deposit revenues. investment sales increased 8%, assets under management grew 17%, including the benefit of market movements, average deposits increased 6% and average loans increased 5%. retail lending revenues declined 1%, as continued growth in personal loans was more than offset by lower mortgage revenues due to spread compression.
expenses were largely unchanged, as efficiency savings were offset by ongoing investment spending and volume-driven growth.
provisions increased 4%, as higher net credit losses reflecting volume growth and seasoning were partially offset by a lower net loan loss reserve build in the current year. overall credit quality remained stable in the region.

institutional clients group institutional clients group (icg) includes banking and markets and securities services (for additional information on these businesses, see "citigroup segments" above). icg provides corporate, institutional, public sector and high-net-worth clients around the world with a full range of wholesale banking products and services, including fixed income and equity sales and trading, foreign exchange, prime brokerage, derivative services, equity and fixed income research, corporate lending, investment banking and advisory services, private banking, cash management, trade finance and securities services. icg transacts with clients in both cash instruments and derivatives, including fixed income, foreign currency, equity and commodity products.
icg revenue is generated primarily from fees and spreads associated with these activities. icg earns fee income for assisting clients with transactional services and clearing and providing brokerage and investment banking services and other such activities. such fees are recognized at the point in time when citigroup's performance under the terms of a contractual arrangement is completed, which is typically at the trade/execution date or closing of a transaction. revenue generated from these activities is recorded in commissions and fees and investment banking. revenue is also generated from assets under custody and administration, which is recognized as/when the associated promised service is satisfied, which normally occurs at the point in time the service is requested by the customer and provided by citi. revenue generated from these activities is primarily recorded in administration and other fiduciary fees. for additional information on these various types of revenues, see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements.
in addition, as a market maker, icg facilitates transactions, including holding product inventory to meet client demand, and earns the differential between the price at which it buys and sells the products. these price differentials and the unrealized gains and losses on the inventory are recorded in principal transactions. mark-to-market gains and losses on certain credit derivatives (used to hedge the corporate loan portfolio) are also recorded in principal transactions, (for additional information on principal transactions revenue, see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements). other primarily includes realized gains and losses on available-for-sale (afs) debt securities, gains and losses on equity securities not held in trading accounts and other non-recurring gains and losses. interest income earned on assets held, less interest paid on long- and short-term debt and to customers on deposits, is recorded as net interest revenue.
the amount and types of markets revenues are impacted by a variety of interrelated factors, including market liquidity; changes in market variables such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices, commodity prices and credit spreads, as well as their implied volatilities; investor confidence and other macroeconomic conditions. assuming all other market conditions do not change, increases in client activity levels or bid/offer spreads generally result in increases in revenues. however, changes in market conditions can significantly impact client activity levels, bid/offer spreads and the fair value of product inventory. for example, a decrease in market liquidity may increase bid/offer spreads, decrease client activity levels and widen credit spreads on product inventory positions.
icg's management of the markets businesses involves daily monitoring and evaluation of the above factors at the trading desk as well as the country level. icg does not separately track the impact on total markets revenues of the volume of transactions, bid/offer spreads, fair value changes of product inventory positions and economic hedges because, as noted above, these components are interrelated and are not deemed useful or necessary individually to manage the markets businesses at an aggregate level.
in the markets businesses, client revenues are those revenues directly attributable to client transactions at the time of inception, including commissions, interest or fees earned. client revenues do not include the results of client facilitation activities (e.g., holding product inventory in anticipation of client demand) or the results of certain economic hedging activities.
icg's international presence is supported by trading floors in approximately 80 countries and a proprietary network in 98 countries and jurisdictions. at december 31, 2019, icg had approximately $1.4 trillion in assets and $768 billion in deposits, while two of its businesses-securities services and issuer services-managed approximately $20.3 trillion and $17.5 trillion in assets under custody as of december 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.

(1)   credit derivatives are used to economically hedge a portion of the corporate loan portfolio that includes both accrual loans and loans at fair value. gains (losses) on loan hedges include the mark-to-market on the credit derivatives and the mark-to-market on the loans in the portfolio that are at fair value. the fixed premium costs of these hedges are netted against the corporate lending revenues to reflect the cost of credit protection. citigroup's results of operations excluding the impact of gains (losses) on loan hedges are non-gaap financial measures.
(2)   2019 includes an approximate $350 million gain on citi's investment in tradeweb in the second quarter.
(3)   2017 includes the approximate $580 million gain on the sale of a fixed income analytics business.
(4)   excludes principal transactions revenues of icg businesses other than markets, primarily treasury and trade solutions and the private bank.
(5)   citi assesses its markets business performance on a total revenue basis, as offsets may occur across revenue line items. for example, securities that generate net interest revenue may be risk managed by derivatives that are recorded in principal transactions revenue. for a description of the composition of these revenue line items, see notes 4, 5 and 6 to the consolidated financial statements.
nm not meaningful the discussion of the results of operations for icg below excludes (where noted) the impact of gains (losses) on hedges of accrual loans, which are non-gaap financial measures. for a reconciliation of these metrics to the reported results, see the table above.
net income increased 3%, driven primarily by higher revenues and a lower effective tax rate, partially offset by higher expenses and higher cost of credit.
revenues increased 3%, reflecting higher banking revenues (increase of 1% including the gains (losses) on loan hedges) and higher markets and securities services revenues (increase of 5%). excluding the impact of the gains (losses) on loan hedges, banking revenues were up 3%, driven by higher revenues in treasury and trade solutions, investment banking and the private bank, as corporate lending was largely unchanged. markets and securities services revenues were up 5%, including a gain in the second quarter of 2019 from citi's investment in tradeweb, as higher revenues in fixed income markets were partially offset by lower equity markets revenues.
citi expects that icg's revenues will likely be impacted by the lower interest rate environment in the near term.
within banking:
•   investment banking revenues increased 4%, reflecting gains in wallet share despite a decline in the overall market wallet. debt underwriting increased 10%, reflecting gains in wallet share, primarily in investment grade underwriting, across north america, emea and asia. equity underwriting revenues decreased 2%, reflecting a decline in market wallet, particularly in asia and emea, partially offset by gains in wallet share. advisory revenues decreased 3%, largely due to a comparison to a strong prior year as well as a decline in market wallet, partially offset by gains in wallet share.
•   treasury and trade solutions revenues increased 4%. excluding the impact of fx translation, revenues increased 6%, reflecting strength in all regions, driven by growth across both net interest and fee income. revenues increased in the cash business, primarily driven by strong client engagement and solid growth in deposit and transaction volumes, partially offset by spread compression in the second half of 2019 due to the impact of lower interest rates. revenue growth in the trade business was driven by improved spreads, due to growth in structured loans as well as the ability to continue to utilize distribution capabilities to optimize the balance sheet and drive returns, while supporting clients. average deposits increased 10%, reflecting growth across regions. average trade loans declined 3%, driven by north america, emea and asia (for additional information, see "liquidity risk-loans" below).
•   corporate lending revenues decreased 16%. excluding the impact of gains (losses) on loan hedges, revenues were largely unchanged versus the prior year, as growth in the commercial loan portfolio was offset by lower volumes in the rest of the portfolio.
•   private bank revenues increased 2%, driven primarily by north america and asia, partially offset by latin america. the increase in revenues reflected strong client activity, driving higher lending and deposit volumes, as well as higher capital markets revenues, partially offset by lower deposit spreads.
within markets and securities services:
•   fixed income markets revenues increased 10%, including the tradeweb gain, reflecting higher revenues across all regions. non-interest revenues increased due to higher corporate and investor client activity as well as improved market activity, particularly in rates and spread products. the increase in non-interest revenues was partially offset by a decline in net interest revenues, reflecting a change in the mix of trading positions in support of client activity as well as higher funding costs, given the higher interest rate environment in the first half of the year.
rates and currencies revenues increased 9%, primarily driven by higher g10 rates and currencies revenues in north america, asia and emea, reflecting a more favorable operating environment in the second half of 2019, with higher corporate and investor client activity. local markets rates and currencies revenues increased modestly despite declining currency volatility.
spread products and other fixed income revenues increased 15%, including the tradeweb gain, reflecting higher revenues in both north america and emea. the increase in revenues was driven by higher client activity as well as an improved trading environment, particularly in flow trading and financing products. this increase in revenues was partially offset by lower structured products revenues, reflecting a challenging trading environment.
•   equity markets revenues decreased 15%, driven by lower revenues across cash equities, equity derivatives and prime finance, particularly in north america and asia. cash equities revenues decreased largely due to lower client volumes. despite strong corporate and investor client activity, equity derivatives revenues decreased due to the impact of a less favorable trading environment, given lower market volatility, as well as a comparison to a strong prior year. the decline in prime finance revenues was primarily driven by lower client activity and lower financing balances. non-interest revenues decreased, primarily driven by lower principal transaction and commissions and fee revenues, due to lower client activity and a less favorable trading environment, as well as a change in the mix of trading positions in support of client activity.
•   securities services revenues were largely unchanged versus the prior year. excluding the impact of fx translation, revenues increased 4%, reflecting higher revenues in asia and latin america. the increase in revenues was driven by higher net interest revenue due to higher deposit volumes and higher interest rates, particularly in emerging markets, as well as higher client activity.
expenses increased 2%, as higher compensation, volume-related expenses and continued investments were partially offset by efficiency savings and a benefit from fx translation.
provisions increased $348 million, driven by an increase in net credit losses of $186 million, and an increase in the net loan loss reserve build of $162 million. both the increase in net credit losses and the higher loan loss reserve build largely reflected a normalization of credit trends.

corporate/other corporate/other includes certain unallocated costs of global staff functions (including finance, risk, human resources, legal and compliance), other corporate expenses and unallocated global operations and technology expenses and income taxes, as well as corporate treasury, certain north america legacy consumer loan portfolios, other legacy assets and discontinued operations (for additional information on corporate/other, see "citigroup segments" above). at december 31, 2019, corporate/other had $97 billion in assets.

net income was $801 million, compared to net income of $186 million in the prior year. net income was largely driven by an income tax benefit of $886 million, compared to an income tax benefit of $88 million in the prior year. the increase in the income tax benefit primarily reflected the reduction in the valuation allowance related to citi's deferred tax assets and a pretax loss in the current year (see "significant accounting policies and significant estimates-income taxes" below). the pretax loss was largely driven by lower revenues from legacy assets, partially offset by higher gains on investments. the pretax loss also reflected higher cost of credit, partially offset by lower expenses.
revenues decreased 8%, driven by the continued wind-down of legacy assets, partially offset by gains on investments.
expenses decreased 5%, as the continued wind-down of legacy assets was partially offset by higher infrastructure costs.
provisions increased $127 million to a net benefit of $75 million, primarily due to a lower net loan loss reserve release, partially offset by lower net credit losses.
citi expects that corporate/other results will likely be impacted by ongoing investments in infrastructure and controls as well as lower interest rates and lower investment gains during 2020.
off-balance sheet arrangements citigroup enters into various types of off-balance sheet arrangements in the ordinary course of business. citi's involvement in these arrangements can take many different forms, including without limitation:
•   purchasing or retaining residual and other interests in unconsolidated special purpose entities, such as mortgage-backed and other asset-backed securitization entities;
•   holding senior and subordinated debt, interests in limited and general partnerships and equity interests in other unconsolidated special purpose entities; and
•   providing guarantees, indemnifications, loan commitments, letters of credit and representations and warranties.
citi enters into these arrangements for a variety of business purposes. for example, securitization arrangements offer investors access to specific cash flows and risks created through the securitization process. securitization arrangements also assist citi and its customers in monetizing their financial assets and securing financing at more favorable rates than citi or the customers could otherwise obtain.
the table below shows where a discussion of citi's various off-balance sheet arrangements may be found in this form 10-k. in addition, see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements.

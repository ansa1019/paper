item 1a.   risk factors this report and other documents we file with the sec contain forward-looking statements that are based on current expectations, estimates, forecasts and projections about us, our future performance, our business, our beliefs and our management's assumptions. these statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties our business faces. the risks described below are not the only ones we face. our business is also subject to the risks that affect many other companies, such as employment relations, general economic conditions, geopolitical events and international operations. further, additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may in the future materially and adversely affect our business, operations, liquidity and stock price.
our sales depend on coverage and reimbursement from third-party payers, and pricing and reimbursement pressures may affect our profitability.
sales of our products depend on the availability and extent of coverage and reimbursement from third-party payers, including government healthcare programs and private insurance plans. governments and private payers continue to pursue initiatives to manage drug utilization and contain costs. these payers are increasingly focused on the effectiveness, benefits and costs of similar treatments, which could result for our products in lower reimbursement rates or narrower populations for whom payers will reimburse. continued intense public scrutiny of the price of drugs and other healthcare costs, together with payer dynamics, may limit our ability to set or adjust the price of our products based on their value, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. in the united states, a number of legislative and regulatory proposals have been introduced in an attempt to lower drug prices. these include proposals that would, for example, allow the u.s. government to negotiate directly on drug prices, limit drug prices based on prices abroad or permit importation of drugs from canada. proposals addressing drug pricing are likely to continue to be introduced and may be adopted and implemented in some form.
-changing u.s. federal coverage and reimbursement policies and practices have affected and may continue to affect access to and sales of our products a substantial portion of our u.s. business relies on reimbursement from federal government healthcare programs and commercial insurance plans regulated by federal and state governments. see item 1. business-reimbursement. our business has and will continue to be affected by legislative actions changing u.s. federal reimbursement policy. for example, beginning in 2019, legislation requiring biopharmaceutical manufacturers to provide greater discounts on products dispensed to patients in the coverage gap between the initial coverage limit of medicare part d and the program's catastrophic-coverage threshold has, and will continue to, reduce our net product sales relating to such patients. further, following the change of party control of the u.s. house of representatives in november 2018, congressional focus on drug pricing has increased, placing our industry under greater congressional scrutiny. for example, in january 2019, the chair of the house oversight and reform committee sent letters to twelve different biopharmaceutical manufacturers, including amgen, seeking documents and detailed information about such companies' drug-pricing practices. a number of other congressional committees have also held hearings and evaluated proposed legislation on drug-pricing and payment policy. for example, in july 2019, the senate finance committee advanced a bill that would, among other things, penalize pharmaceutical manufacturers for raising prices on drugs covered by medicare parts b and d faster than the rate of inflation, cap out-of-pocket expenses for medicare part d beneficiaries and require higher/additional manufacturer discounts in medicare part d. in december 2019, a drug-pricing bill, h.r. 3, passed the house of representatives, which would, among other things, enable direct price negotiations by the federal government on certain drugs (with the maximum price paid by medicare capped based on an international index), include a penalty for failing to reach agreement with the government and require that manufacturers offer these negotiated prices to other payers. additional legislative or regulatory proposals have been introduced by members of congress or the administration that, if enacted and implemented, could also affect access to and sales of our products, including but not limited to proposals to overhaul provisions of the aca, to allow importation of prescription medications from canada or other countries and to base medicare payment rates on an international index price. we expect continued significant focus on health care and drug-pricing legislation through 2020 leading up to the november u.s. presidential election and beyond.
also, our business has been, and is expected to continue to be, affected by changes in u.s. federal reimbursement policy resulting from executive actions, federal regulations and federal demonstration projects. for example, the administration's drug-pricing blueprint released in may 2018 contains an array of policy ideas intended to increase competition, improve the negotiating power of the federal government, reduce drug prices and lower patient out-of-pocket costs with the potential to significantly affect, whether individually or collectively, our industry. such policy ideas include, but are not limited to, moving coverage and reimbursement for medicare part b drugs into medicare part d and instituting a competitive acquisition program for part b drugs in which competing third-party vendors take on the financial risk of acquiring drugs and billing medicare.
since the release of the administration's drug-pricing blueprint, the administration and federal agencies, including the cms, have announced a number of demonstration projects, recommendations, policies and proposals to implement various elements of the blueprint. cms is the federal agency responsible for administering medicare and overseeing state medicaid programs and health insurance marketplaces and has substantial power to implement policy changes or demonstration projects that can quickly and significantly affect how drugs, including our products, are covered and reimbursed. for example, in late 2018, cms began evaluating a pilot program that would initially, among other things, include fifty percent of medicare part b single source drugs and set payment amounts to more closely align with international drug prices, and in june 2019, administration officials announced that the office of management and budget was in the process of reviewing a draft proposed rule to implement this model. cms has also issued guidance to allow certain medicare plans offered by private insurance companies to require that patients receiving medicare part b drugs first try a drug preferred by the plan before covering another therapy (step therapy) and lowered reimbursement rates for new medicare part b drugs. congress is also interested in exploring solutions that may move biopharmaceutical manufacturers from back-end rebate agreements with pbms to front-end discounts. in december 2019, the administration released a proposed rule to allow states (or other non-federal government entities) to submit proposals to the fda allowing for the importation of certain prescription drugs from canada. such a rule could subject some of our product to importation.
separate from the drug-pricing blueprint, cms policy changes and demonstration projects to test new care, delivery and payment models can significantly affect how drugs, including our products, are covered and reimbursed. in esrd, cms uses a bundled payment system. since 2018, sensipar® and parsabiv®, which are used in dialysis clinics and are curently outside of the bundled payment system, have been eligible for temporary drug add-on payment adjustments (tdapa) and will continue to be eligible in 2020. cms is expected to release details in 2020 on the rate setting analysis that it will conduct to determine whether and how cms would adjust esrd prospective payment system base rates to account for calcimimetics after the tdapa for calcimimetics ends, which is expected in 2021. additionally, in july 2019, cms released a proposed rule creating a new mandatory payment model focused on encouraging greater use of home dialysis and kidney transplants for esrd patients that, if finalized as proposed, could result in changes to treatment of dialysis patients, including reduction of the use of our esas. in november 2019, cms announced additional voluntary payment models for nephrologists and dialysis facility partners that also seek to encourage home dialysis and preemptive transplantation through increased risk sharing beginning in 2021. cms has also solicited suggestions regarding other potential care models. cms initiated in 2016 the oncology care model demonstration, which provides participating physician practices with performance-based financial incentives that aim to manage or reduce medicare costs without negatively affecting the efficacy of care. we believe the oncology care model has reduced utilization of certain of our oncology products by participating physician practices and expect it to continue to do so in the future. additionally, in november 2019, cms announced a request for information on the oncology care first model, a new voluntary model that builds on the oncology care model that would be slated to begin in january 2021.
in this dynamic environment, we are unable to predict which or how many of these various federal policy, legislative, regulatory, executive or administrative changes may ultimately be enacted and implemented. however, to the extent that these or other federal government initiatives further decrease or modify the coverage or reimbursement available for our products, require that we pay increased rebates or shift other costs to us, limit or affect our decisions regarding the pricing of or otherwise reduce the use of our u.s. products, or limit our ability to offer co-pay payment assistance to commercial patients, such actions could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
we also face risks relating to the reporting of pricing data that affects the reimbursement of and discounts provided for our products. u.s. government price reporting regulations are complex and may require a biopharmaceutical manufacturer to update certain previously submitted data. if our submitted pricing data are incorrect, we may become subject to substantial fines and penalties or other government enforcement actions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. in addition, as a result of restating previously reported price data, we also may be required to pay additional rebates and provide additional discounts.
-changing reimbursement and pricing actions in various states may negatively affect access to and have affected and may continue to affect sales of our products at the state level, government actions or ballot initiatives can also affect how our products are covered and reimbursed and/or create additional pressure on our pricing decisions. a number of states have adopted, and many other states are considering, drug importation programs or other new pricing actions, including proposals designed to require biopharmaceutical manufacturers publicly to report proprietary pricing information, limit price increases or to place a maximum price ceiling or cap on biopharmaceutical products. existing and proposed state pricing laws have added complexity to the pricing of drugs and may already be affecting industry pricing decisions. for example, in late 2017, california enacted a drug-pricing transparency bill that requires biopharmaceutical manufacturers to notify health insurers and government health plans at least 60 days before scheduled prescription drug price increases that exceed certain thresholds. similar laws in oregon and washington were passed in 2019. states are also seeking to change the way they pay for drugs for patients covered by state programs. in january 2019, california's governor issued an executive order expanding state medicaid coverage and directing its agencies and programs to develop a plan to consolidate drug purchases and to negotiate drug prices with biopharmaceutical manufacturers. additionally, new york, massachusetts and ohio have established medicaid drug spending caps. additionally, colorado, florida, maine and vermont, have enacted laws, and several other states have proposed laws, to facilitate the importation of drugs from canada. other states could adopt similar approaches or could pursue different policy changes in a continuing effort to reduce their costs. ultimately, as with u.s. federal government actions, existing or future state government actions or ballot initiatives may also have a material adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations.
-u.s. commercial payer actions have affected and may continue to affect access to and sales of our products payers, including healthcare insurers, pbms, integrated healthcare delivery systems (vertically-integrated organizations built from the consolidation of healthcare insurers and pbms) and group purchasing organizations, increasingly seek ways to reduce their costs. with increasing frequency, payers are adopting benefit plan changes that shift a greater portion of drug costs to patients. such measures include more limited benefit plan designs, high deductible plans, higher patient co-pay or coinsurance obligations and more significant limitations on patients' use of manufacturer commercial co-pay payment assistance programs (including through co-pay accumulator adjustment or maximization programs). payers have sought and will likely continue to seek price discounts or rebates in connection with the placement of our products on their formularies or those they manage, particularly in treatment areas where the payer has taken the position that multiple branded products are therapeutically comparable. payers also control costs by imposing restrictions on access to or usage of our products, such as step therapy or requiring that patients receive the payer's prior authorization before covering the product or that patients use a mail-order pharmacy or a limited network of payer fully-owned mail-order or specialty pharmacies; payers may also choose to exclude certain indications for which our products are approved or even choose to exclude coverage entirely. for example, some payers require physicians to demonstrate or document that the patients for whom repatha® has been prescribed meet payer utilization management criteria, and these requirements have limited, and may continue to limit, patient access to repatha® treatment. in an effort to reduce barriers to access, we reduced the net price of repatha® by providing greater discounts and rebates to payers, including pbms that administer medicare part d prescription drug plans. however, affordability of patient out-of-pocket co-pay cost has and may continue to limit patient use. for example, a very high percentage of medicare patients abandoned their repatha® prescriptions rather than pay their co-pay payment. in late 2018 and early 2019, we introduced a set of new national drug codes to make repatha® available at a lower list price to attempt to address affordability for patients, particularly those on medicare and on december 31, 2019 we discontinued the higher list price option for repatha®. despite these net and list price reductions, some payers have restricted and may continue to restrict patient access and may change formulary coverage for repatha®, seek further discounts or rebates or take other actions that could reduce our sales of repatha®. these factors have limited, and may continue to limit, patient affordability and use and negatively affect repatha® sales.
further, significant consolidation in the health insurance industry has resulted in a few large insurers and pbms which places greater pressure on pricing and usage negotiations with biopharmaceutical manufacturers, significantly increasing discounts and rebates requirements and limiting patient access and usage. for example, in the united states, in 2018, the top three pbms oversaw greater than two-thirds of prescription claims as well as government and commercial covered lives. the consolidation among insurers, pbms and other payers, including through integrated healthcare delivery systems and/or with specialty or mail-order pharmacies and pharmacy retailers, has increased the negotiating leverage such entities have over us and other biopharmaceutical manufacturers and has resulted in greater price discounts, rebates and service fees realized by those payers. also in 2018, two of the nation's largest pbms, express scripts and cvs health, completed their combinations with major insurance companies cigna and aetna, respectively. additional consolidation would further increase the leverage of such entities. ultimately, additional discounts, rebates, fees, coverage or plan changes, restrictions or exclusions imposed by these commercial payers could have a material adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations. policy reforms advanced by congress or the administration that refine the role of pbms in the u.s. marketplace could have downstream implications or consequences for our business and how we interact with these entities.
-government and commercial payer actions outside the united states have affected and will continue to affect access to and sales of our products outside the united states, we expect countries will continue to take actions to reduce their drug expenditures. see item 1. business-reimbursement. international reference pricing (irp) has been widely used by many countries outside the united states to control costs based on an external benchmark of a product's price in other countries. irp policies can change quickly and frequently and may not reflect differences in the burden of disease, indications, market structures, or affordability differences across countries or regions. in addition, countries may refuse to reimburse or may restrict the reimbursed population for a product when their national health technology assessments do not consider a medicine to demonstrate sufficient clinical benefit beyond existing therapies or to meet certain cost effectiveness thresholds. for example, despite the ema's approval of repatha® for the treatment of patients with established atherosclerotic disease, the reimbursement for repatha® in france is limited to a narrower patient population (such as those with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia) following a national health technology assessment. while the pricing and reimbursement process in that country remains ongoing, the assessment currently limits our efforts in france to expand repatha® access to the broader patient population covered by the approved label. some countries decide on reimbursement between potentially competing products through national or regional tenders that often result in one product receiving most or all of the sales in that country or region. failure to obtain coverage and reimbursement for our products, a deterioration in their existing coverage and reimbursement, or a decline in the timeliness or certainty of payment by payers to physicians and other providers has affected and may further negatively affect the ability or willingness of healthcare providers to prescribe our products for their patients and otherwise negatively affect the use of our products or the prices we realize for them. such changes have had, and could in the future have, a material adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations.
we currently face competition from biosimilars and expect to face increasing competition from biosimilars and generics in the future.
we currently face competition from biosimilars in europe, the united states and canada and from generics in the united states, and we expect to face increasing biosimilar and/or generics competition this year and beyond. expiration or successful challenge of applicable patent rights or expiration of an applicable exclusivity period has accelerated such competition, and we expect to face more litigation regarding the validity and/or scope of our patents. our products have also experienced greater competition from lower cost biosimilars or generics that come to market when branded products that compete with our products lose their own patent protection. to the extent that governments adopt more permissive regulatory approval standards and competitors are able to obtain broader or expedited marketing approval for biosimilars and generics, the rate of increased competition for our products could accelerate.
in the eu, biosimilars are evaluated for marketing authorization pursuant to a set of general and product class-specific guidelines. in addition, in an effort to spur biosimilar utilization and/or increase potential healthcare savings, some eu countries and some canadian provinces have adopted or are considering the adoption of biosimilar uptake measures such as physician prescribing quotas or automatic pharmacy substitution of biosimilars for the corresponding reference products. some eu countries impose automatic price reductions upon market entry of one or more biosimilar competitors. while the degree of competitive effects of biosimilar competition differs between eu countries and between products, in the eu the overall use of biosimilars and the rate at which product sales of innovative products are being affected by biosimilar competition is increasing.
in the united states, the biologics price competition and innovation act of 2009 authorized the fda to approve biosimilars via a separate, abbreviated pathway. see item 1. business-government regulation-regulation in the united states-approval of biosimilars. the first biosimilar entrant into the u.s. market was sandoz's zarxio®, a biosimilar version of neupogen®, in 2015. since then, the fda has approved additional biosimilars, including biosimilar versions of enbrel, neulasta® and epogen®, and a growing number of companies have announced that they are also developing biosimilar versions of our products. three biosimilar versions of neulasta® are now marketed in the united states and we expect other biosimilar versions of neulasta® to receive approval in 2020. impact to our neulasta® sales has accelerated as additional competitors have launched. see item 1. business-marketing, distribution and selected marketed products-competition. an approved biosimilar version of epogen® has also launched in the united states, and we are currently involved in patent litigations with the manufacturers of the approved biosimilar versions of enbrel. manufacturers of biosimilars have attempted, and may in the future attempt, to compete with our products by offering lower list prices, greater discounts or rebates, or contracts that offer longer-term pricing or a broader portfolio of other products. companies pursuing development of biosimilar versions of our products have challenged and may continue to challenge our patents well in advance of the expiration of our material patents. for information related to our biosimilars and generics patent litigation, see part iv-note 19, contingencies and commitments, to the consolidated financial statements. see our intellectual property positions may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, or we may fail to prevail in current and future intellectual property litigation.
the u.s. pathway includes the option for biosimilar products that meet certain criteria to be approved as interchangeable with their reference products. some companies currently developing or already marketing biosimilars may seek to obtain interchangeable status from the fda, which could potentially allow pharmacists to substitute those biosimilars for our reference products without prior approval from the prescriber in some states. in november 2019, the fda issued draft guidance that provides that comparative immunogenicity studies will not generally be expected for biosimilar and interchangeable insulin products. this may open the door for other product-specific guidance development and the removal of the expectation for certain studies, which may contribute to increased biosimilar competition for our innovative products.
in addition, critics of the 12-year exclusivity period in the biosimilar pathway law will likely continue to seek to shorten the data exclusivity period and/or to encourage the fda to interpret narrowly the law's provisions regarding which new products receive data exclusivity. in december 2019, the administration agreed to remove from the united states-mexico-canada agreement a requirement for at least 10 years of data exclusivity for biologic products. also, the fda is considering whether subsequent changes to a licensed biologic would be protected by the remainder of the reference product's original 12-year exclusivity period (a concept known in the generic drug context as "umbrella exclusivity"). if the fda were to decide that umbrella exclusivity does not apply to biological reference products or were to make other changes to the exclusivity period, this could expose us to biosimilar competition at an earlier time. there also have been, and may continue to be, legislative and regulatory efforts to promote competition through policies enabling easier generic and biosimilar approval and commercialization, including efforts to lower standards for demonstrating biosimilarity or interchangeability, limit patents that may be litigated and/or patent settlements and implement preferential reimbursement policies for biosimilars.
upon the expiration or loss of patent protection for one of our small molecule products, we can lose the majority of revenues for that product in a very short period of time. see item 1. business-marketing, distribution and selected marketed products-competition. additionally, if one of our small molecule products is the subject of an fda written request for pediatric studies and we are unable to adequately complete these studies, we may not obtain the pediatric exclusivity award that extends existing patents for the product by an additional six months. our u.s. composition-of-matter patent for sensipar®, a small molecule product, expired in march 2018. we are engaged in litigation with a number of companies seeking to market generic cinacalcet products surrounding our u.s. formulation patent that expires in september 2026. several of these generic products have been approved by the fda, and the manufacturer of one of the approved generic products began selling its product in late 2018 before reaching a settlement agreement with us in early january 2019. our current litigation also includes disputes with a number of other manufacturers that began selling their approved generic cinacalcet products in the united states in early 2019. see part iv-note 19, contingencies and commitments, to the consolidated financial statements. if we do not prevail in these matters, these manufacturers and other companies may be able to launch their approved generic products into the u.s. market. in addition, even before the resolution of our ongoing litigation, a number of other companies have elected to launch their approved generic products at risk or have sought and obtained a judicial declaration that they are permitted to launch their generic products. as a result of the product already introduced and/or that could further be introduced into the u.s. market, our product sales for sensipar® have been adversely affected and could be further materially and adversely affected.
california is the first state to have passed legislation, effective on january 1, 2020, against "pay for delay" settlements of patent infringement claims filed by manufacturers of generics or biosimilars where anything of value is given in exchange for settlement. under this newly-passed legislation, such settlement agreements are presumptively anticompetitive. the legislation may result in prolonged litigation and fewer settlements.
while we are unable to predict the precise effects of biosimilars and generics on our products, we are currently facing and expect to face greater competition in the united states, europe and elsewhere this year and beyond as a result of biosimilar and generic competition and downward pressure on our product prices and sales. this competition has had and could increasingly have a material adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations.
our products face substantial competition.
we operate in a highly competitive environment. see item 1. business-marketing, distribution and selected marketed products-competition. we expect that our products will compete with new drugs currently in development, drugs currently approved for other indications that may later be approved for the same indications as those of our products and drugs approved for other indications that are used off-label. large pharmaceutical companies and generics manufacturers of pharmaceutical products are expanding into the biotechnology field, and some pharmaceutical companies and generics manufacturers have formed partnerships to pursue biosimilars. in addition, some of our competitors may have technical, competitive or other advantages over us for the development of technologies and processes or greater experience in particular therapeutic areas, and consolidation among pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies can enhance such advantages. these advantages may make it difficult for us to compete with them successfully to discover, develop and market new products and for our current products to compete with new products or new product indications they may bring to market. as a result, our products have been competing and may continue to compete against products that offer higher rebates or discounts, lower prices, equivalent or superior efficacy, better safety profiles, easier administration, earlier market availability or other competitive features. if we are unable to compete effectively, this could reduce sales, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
our intellectual property positions may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, or we may fail to prevail in current and future intellectual property litigation.
our success depends in part on our ability to obtain and defend patent rights and other intellectual property rights that are important to the commercialization of our products and product candidates. the patent positions of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies can be highly uncertain and often involve complex legal, scientific and factual questions. driven by cost pressures, efforts to limit or weaken patent protection for our industry are increasing. third parties have challenged and may continue to challenge, invalidate or circumvent our patents and patent applications relating to our products, product candidates and technologies. challenges to patents may come from potential competitors or from parties other than those who seek to market a potentially-infringing product. in addition, our patent positions might not protect us against competitors with similar products or technologies because competing products or technologies may not infringe our patents. for certain of our product candidates, there are third parties who have patents or pending patent applications that they may claim necessitate payment of a royalty or prevent us from commercializing these product candidates in certain territories. patent disputes are frequent, costly and can preclude, delay or increase the cost of commercialization of products. we have been in the past, are currently and expect to be in the future, involved in patent litigation. these matters have included, and may in the future include, litigation with manufacturers of products that purport to be biosimilars of certain of our products for patent infringement and for failure to comply with certain provisions of the biologics price competition and innovation act. a determination made by a court, agency or tribunal concerning infringement, validity, enforceability, injunctive or economic remedy, or the right to patent protection, for example, are typically subject to appellate or administrative review. upon review, such initial determinations may be afforded little or no deference by the reviewing tribunal and may be affirmed, reversed or made the subject of reconsideration through further proceedings. a patent dispute or litigation has not discouraged, and may not in the future discourage, a potential violator from bringing the allegedly-infringing product to market prior to a final resolution of the dispute or litigation. the period from inception until resolution of a patent dispute or litigation is subject to the availability and schedule of the court, agency or tribunal before which the dispute or litigation is pending. we have been, and may in the future be, subject to competition during this period and may not be able to recover fully from the losses, damages and harms we incur from infringement by the competitor product even if we prevail. moreover, if we lose or settle current or future litigations at certain stages or entirely, we could be subject to competition and/or significant liabilities, be required to enter into third-party licenses for the infringed product or technology or be required to cease using the technology or product in dispute. in addition, we cannot guarantee that such licenses will be available on terms acceptable to us, or at all.
further, under the hatch-waxman act, our products approved by the fda under the fdca have been, and may in the future be, the subject of patent litigation with generics competitors before expiry of the five-year period of data exclusivity provided for under the hatch-waxman act and prior to the expiration of the patents listed for the product. likewise, our innovative biologic products have been, and may in the future be, the subject of patent litigation prior to the expiration of our patents and, with respect to competitors seeking approval as a biosimilar or interchangeable version of our products, prior to the 12-year exclusivity period provided under the aca. in addition, we are facing patent litigation involving claims that the biosimilar product candidates we are working to develop infringe the patents of other companies, including those that manufacture, market or sell the applicable reference products or who are developing or have developed other biosimilar versions of such products. for example, we are currently engaged in litigation in the united states regarding mvasitm and kanjintitm. while we have attempted, and may continue to attempt, to challenge the patents held by other companies, our efforts may be unsuccessful. alternatively, such patents have contributed, and may in the future contribute, to a decision by us to not pursue all of the same labeled indications as are held by these companies. for information related to our patent litigation, see part iv-note 19, contingencies and commitments, to the consolidated financial statements.
certain of the existing patents on our products have expired. see item 1. business-marketing, distribution and selected marketed products-patents. as our patents expire, competitors are able to legally produce and market similar products or technologies, including biosimilars, which has had, and may continue to have, a material adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations. in addition, competitors have been, and may continue to be, able to invalidate, design around or otherwise circumvent our patents and sell competing products.
government agencies promulgate regulations and guidelines directly applicable to us and to our products. professional societies, practice management groups, insurance carriers, physicians' groups, private health and science foundations and organizations involved in various diseases also publish guidelines and recommendations to healthcare providers, administrators and payers, as well as patient communities. recommendations by government agencies or other groups and organizations may relate to such matters as usage, dosage, route of administration and use of related therapies. in addition, a growing number of organizations are providing assessments of the value and pricing of biopharmaceutical products, and even organizations whose guidelines have historically been focused on clinical matters have begun to incorporate analyses of the cost effectiveness of various treatments into their treatment guidelines and recommendations. value assessments may come from private organizations that publish their findings and offer recommendations relating to the products' reimbursement by government and private payers. some companies and payers have announced pricing and payment decisions based in part on the assessments of private organizations. for example, cvs caremark indicated in august 2018 that it will begin utilizing third-party cost effectiveness analyses to make formulary and coverage determinations for newly-approved drugs. in addition, government health technology assessment organizations in many countries make reimbursement recommendations to payers in their jurisdictions based on the clinical effectiveness, cost-effectiveness and service effects of new, emerging and existing medicines and treatments. such health technology assessment organizations have recommended, and may in the future recommend, reimbursement for certain of our products for a narrower indication than was approved by applicable regulatory agencies or may recommend against reimbursement entirely. such recommendations or guidelines may affect our reputation, and any recommendations or guidelines that result in decreased use, dosage or reimbursement of our products could have a material adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations. in addition, the perception by the investment community or stockholders that such recommendations or guidelines will result in decreased use and dosage of our products could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.
our current products and products in development cannot be sold without regulatory approval.
our business is subject to extensive regulation by numerous state and federal government authorities in the united states, including the fda, and by foreign regulatory authorities, including the ema. we are required in the united states and in foreign countries to obtain approval from regulatory authorities before we manufacture, market and sell our products. once our products are approved, the fda and other u.s. and foreign regulatory agencies have substantial authority to require additional testing and reporting, perform inspections, change product labeling or mandate withdrawals of our products. failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements may subject us to administrative and/or judicially imposed sanctions or monetary penalties as well as reputational and other harms. the sanctions could include the fda's or foreign regulatory authorities' refusals to approve pending applications, delays in obtaining or withdrawals of approvals, delays or suspensions of clinical trials, warning letters, product recalls or seizures, total or partial suspensions of our operations, injunctions, fines, civil penalties and/or criminal prosecutions.
obtaining and maintaining regulatory approvals have been, and will continue to be, increasingly difficult, time-consuming and costly. legislative bodies or regulatory agencies could enact new laws or regulations, change existing laws or regulations, or change their interpretations of laws or regulations at any time, which could affect our ability to obtain or maintain approval of our products or product candidates. the rate and degree of change in existing laws and regulations and regulatory expectations have accelerated in established markets, and regulatory expectations continue to evolve in emerging markets. we are unable to predict whether and when any further changes to laws or regulatory policies affecting our business could occur, such as changes to laws or regulations governing manufacturer communications concerning drug products and drug product candidates and whether such changes could have a material adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations. in the united states, a partial federal government shutdown halted the work of many federal agencies and their employees from late december 2018 through late january 2019. a subsequent extended shutdown could result in reductions or delays of fda's activities, including with respect to our ongoing clinical programs, our manufacturing of our products and product candidates and our product approvals.
regulatory authorities have questioned, and may in the future question, the sufficiency for approval of the endpoints we select for our clinical trials. a number of our products and product candidates have been evaluated in clinical trials using surrogate endpoints that measure an effect that is known to correlate with an ultimate clinical benefit. for example, a therapeutic oncology product candidate may be evaluated for its ability to reduce or eliminate minimal residual disease (mrd), or to extend the length of time during and after the treatment that a patient lives without the disease worsening, measured by pfs. demonstrating that the product candidate induces mrd-negative responses or produces a statistically significant improvement in pfs does not necessarily mean that the product candidate will show a statistically significant improvement in overall survival or the time that the patients remain alive. in the cardiovascular setting, a heart disease therapeutic candidate may be evaluated for its ability to reduce low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (ldl-c) levels, as an elevated ldl-c level has been a surrogate endpoint for cardiovascular events such as death, heart attack and stroke. the use of surrogate endpoints such as pfs and ldl-c reduction, in the absence of other measures of clinical benefit, may not be sufficient for broad usage or approval even when such results are statistically significant. regulatory authorities could also add new requirements, such as the completion of enrollment in a confirmatory study or the completion of an outcomes study or a meaningful portion of an outcomes study, as conditions for obtaining approval or obtaining an indication. for example, despite demonstrating that repatha® reduced ldl-c levels in a broad patient population, only after our large phase 3 outcomes study evaluating the ability of repatha® to prevent cardiovascular events met certain of its primary composite endpoint and key secondary composite endpoint did the fda grant a broader approval of repatha® to reduce the risk of certain cardiovascular events, and also to be used, alone or in combination with other lipid-lowering therapies, for the treatment of adults with primary hyperlipidemia to reduce ldl-c. there may also be situations in which demonstrating the efficacy and safety of a product candidate may not be sufficient to gain regulatory approval unless superiority to other existing treatment options can be shown. the imposition of additional requirements or our inability to meet them in a timely fashion or at all has delayed, and may in the future delay, our clinical development and regulatory filing efforts, delay or prevent us from obtaining regulatory approval for new product candidates or new indications for existing products, or prevent us from maintaining our current labels.
some of our products have been approved by u.s. and foreign regulatory authorities on an accelerated or conditional basis with full approval conditioned upon fulfilling the requirements of regulators. for example, in march 2018, we announced that the fda approved blincyto® under accelerated approval for the treatment of adults and children with b-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia in first or second complete remission with mrd greater than or equal to 0.1 percent. continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in confirmatory trials. regulatory authorities are placing greater focus on monitoring products originally approved on an accelerated or conditional basis and on whether the sponsors of such products have met the conditions of the accelerated or conditional approvals. if we are unable to fulfill the regulators' requirements that were conditions of a product's accelerated or conditional approval and/or if regulators re-evaluate the data or risk-benefit profile of our product, the conditional approval may not result in full approval or may be revoked or not renewed. alternatively, we may be required to change the product's labeled indications or even withdraw the product from the market.
regulatory authorities can also impose post-marketing pediatric study requirements. failure to fulfill such requirements may result in regulatory or enforcement action, including financial penalties or the invalidation of a product's marketing authorization.
safety problems or signals can arise as our products and product candidates are evaluated in clinical trials, including investigator sponsored studies, or as our marketed products are used in clinical practice. we are required continuously to collect and assess adverse events reported to us and to communicate to regulatory agencies these adverse events and safety signals regarding our products. regulatory agencies periodically perform inspections of our pharmacovigilance processes, including our adverse event reporting. in the united states, for our products with approved rems (see item 1. business-government regulation-postapproval phase), we are required to submit periodic assessment reports to the fda to demonstrate that the goals of the rems are being met. rems and other risk management programs are designed to ensure that a drug's benefits outweigh the risks and vary in the elements they contain. if the fda is not satisfied with the results of the periodic assessment reports we submit for any of our rems, the fda may also modify our rems or take other regulatory actions, such as implementing revised or restrictive labeling. the drug delivery devices approved for use in combination with our products are also subject to regulatory oversight and review for safety and malfunctions. if regulatory agencies determine that we or other parties (including our clinical trial investigators, those operating our patient support programs or licensees of our products) have not complied with the applicable reporting, other pharmacovigilance or other safety or quality assessment requirements, we may become subject to additional inspections, warning letters or other enforcement actions, including fines, marketing authorization withdrawal and other penalties. our product candidates and marketed products can also be affected by safety problems or signals occurring with respect to products that are similar to ours or that implicate an entire class of products. further, as a result of clinical trials, including sub-analyses or meta-analyses of earlier clinical trials (a meta-analysis involves the use of various statistical methods to combine results from previous separate but related studies) performed by us or others, concerns may arise about the sufficiency of the data or studies underlying a product's approved label. such actual or perceived safety problems or concerns can lead to:
•   revised or restrictive labeling for our products, or the potential for restrictive labeling that has resulted, and may in the future result, in our decision not to commercialize a product candidate;
•   requirement of risk management or minimization activities or other regulatory agency compliance actions related to the promotion and sale of our products;
•   post-marketing commitments, mandated post-marketing requirements or pharmacovigilance programs for our approved products;
•   required changes to the processes used in the manufacture of our products, which could increase our manufacturing costs and affect the availability of contract manufacturers we may utilize to assist in such manufacturing;
•   revocation of approval for our products from the market completely, or within particular therapeutic areas or patient types;
•   increased timelines or delays in being approved by the fda or other regulatory bodies; and/or
•   treatments or product candidates not being approved by regulatory bodies.
for example, after an imbalance in positively adjudicated cardiovascular serious adverse events was observed in one of the phase 3 clinical trials for evenity® but not in another, larger phase 3 study, in april 2019 the fda approved evenity® for the treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women at high risk for fracture, along with a post-marketing requirement. the requirement includes a five-year observational feasibility study that could be followed by a comparative safety study or trial.
in addition to our innovative products, we are working to develop and commercialize biosimilar versions of a number of products currently manufactured, marketed and sold by other pharmaceutical companies. in some markets, there is not yet a legislative or regulatory pathway for the approval of biosimilars. in the united states, the aca provided for such a pathway; while the fda continues to implement it, discussions continue as to the evidence needed to demonstrate biosimilarity or interchangeability for specific products. see we currently face competition from biosimilars and expect to face increasing competition from biosimilars and generics in the future. delays or uncertainties in the development or implementation of such pathways could result in delays or difficulties in getting our biosimilar products approved by regulatory authorities, subject us to unanticipated development costs or otherwise reduce the value of the investments we have made in the biosimilars area. further, we cannot predict whether any repeal or reform of the aca or other legislation or policy initiatives would affect the biosimilar pathway or have a material adverse effect on our development of biosimilars or on our marketed biosimilars. in addition, if we are unable to bring our biosimilar products to market on a timely basis and secure "first-to-market" or other advantageous positions, our future biosimilar sales, business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.
we may not be able to develop commercial products despite significant investments in r&d.
amgen invests heavily in r&d. successful product development in the biotechnology industry is highly uncertain, and very few r&d projects produce commercial products. product candidates, including biosimilar product candidates, or new indications for existing products (collectively, product candidates) that appear promising in the early phases of development may fail to reach the market for a number of reasons, such as:
•   the product candidate did not demonstrate acceptable clinical trial results even though it demonstrated positive preclinical trial results, for reasons that could include changes in the standard of care of medicine;
•   the product candidate was not effective or not more effective than currently available therapies in treating a specified condition or illness;
•   the product candidate had harmful side effects in animals or humans;
•   the necessary regulatory bodies, such as the fda or ema, did not approve the product candidate for an intended use;
•   the product candidate was not economical for us to manufacture and commercialize;
•   other parties had or may have had proprietary rights relating to our product candidate, such as patent rights, and did not let us sell it on reasonable terms, or at all;
•   we and certain of our licensees, partners, contracted organizations or independent investigators may have failed to effectively conduct clinical development or clinical manufacturing activities;
•   the pathway to regulatory approval or reimbursement for product candidates was uncertain or not well-defined;
•   the biosimilar product candidate failed to demonstrate the requisite biosimilarity to the applicable reference product, or was otherwise determined by a regulatory authority to not meet applicable standards for approval; and
•   a companion diagnostic device that is required with the use of a product candidate is not approved by the necessary regulatory authority.
we have spent considerable time, energy and resources developing our expertise in human genetics and acquiring access to libraries of genetic information with the belief that genetics could meaningfully aid our search for new medicines and help guide our r&d decisions and investments. we have focused our r&d strategy on drug targets validated by genetic or other compelling human evidence. however, product candidates based on genetically validated targets remain subject to the uncertainties of the drug development process and may not reach the market for a number of reasons, including the factors listed above.
a number of our product candidates have failed or been discontinued at various stages in the product development process. for example, in may 2015, we terminated our participation in the co-development and commercialization of brodalumab, a product candidate in phase 3, with astrazeneca. the decision was based on events of suicidal ideation and behavior in the brodalumab program that occurred late in the development program, which we believed likely would necessitate restrictive labeling that would limit the appropriate patient population. inability to bring a product to market or a significant delay in the expected approval and related launch date of a new product for any of the reasons discussed could potentially have a negative effect on our product sales and earnings and could result in a significant impairment of in-process research and development (ipr&d) or other intangible assets.
we must conduct clinical trials in humans before we commercialize and sell any of our product candidates or existing products for new indications.
before we sell any products, we must conduct clinical trials to demonstrate that our product candidates are safe and effective for use in humans. the results of those clinical trials are used as the basis to obtain approval from regulatory authorities such as the fda and ema. see our current products and products in development cannot be sold without regulatory approval. we are required to conduct clinical trials using an appropriate number of trial sites and patients to support the product label claims. the length of time, number of trial sites and number of patients required for clinical trials vary substantially, and we may spend several years and incur substantial expense in completing certain clinical trials. in addition, we may have difficulty finding a sufficient number of clinical trial sites and patients to participate in our clinical trials, particularly if competitors are conducting clinical trials in similar patient populations. patients may withdraw from clinical trials at any time, and privacy laws and/or other restrictions in certain countries may restrict the ability of clinical trial investigators to conduct further follow-up on such patients, which may adversely affect the interpretation of study results. delays and complications in planned clinical trials can result in increased development costs, associated delays in regulatory approvals and in product candidates reaching the market and revisions to existing product labels.
further, to increase the number of patients available for enrollment in our clinical trials, we have opened, and will continue to open, clinical sites and enroll patients in a number of locations where our experience conducting clinical trials is more limited, including russia, india, china, south korea, the philippines, singapore and some central and south american countries, either through utilization of third-party contract clinical trial providers entirely or in combination with local staff. conducting clinical trials in locations where we have limited experience requires substantial time and resources to understand the unique regulatory environments of individual countries. further, we must ensure the timely production, distribution and delivery of the clinical supply of our product candidates to numerous and varied clinical trial sites. additionally, regional disruptions, including natural disasters or health emergencies (such as novel viruses or pandemics), could significantly disrupt the timing of clinical trials. if we fail to adequately manage the design, execution and diverse regulatory aspects of our large and complex clinical trials or to manage the production or distribution of our clinical supply, or such sites experience disruptions as a result of a natural disaster or health emergency, corresponding regulatory approvals may be delayed or we may fail to gain approval for our product candidates or could lose our ability to market existing products in certain therapeutic areas or altogether. if we are unable to market and sell our products or product candidates or to obtain approvals in the timeframe needed to execute our product strategies, our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.
we rely on independent third-party clinical investigators to recruit patients and conduct clinical trials on our behalf in accordance with applicable study protocols, laws and regulations. further, we rely on unaffiliated third-party vendors to perform certain aspects of our clinical trial operations. in some circumstances, we enter into co-development arrangements with other pharmaceutical and medical devices companies that provide for the other company to conduct certain clinical trials for the product we are co-developing or to develop a diagnostic test used in screening or monitoring patients in our clinical trials. see some of our pharmaceutical pipeline and of our commercial product sales relies on collaborations with third parties, which may adversely affect the development and sale of our products. we also may acquire companies that have past or ongoing clinical trials or rights to products or product candidates for which clinical trials have been or are being conducted. these trials may not have been conducted to the same standards as ours; however, once an acquisition has been completed we assume responsibility for the conduct of these trials, including any potential risks and liabilities associated with the past and prospective conduct of those trials. if regulatory authorities determine that we or others, including our licensees or co-development partners, or the independent investigators or vendors selected by us, our co-development partners or by a company we have acquired or from which we have acquired rights to a product or product candidate, have not complied with regulations applicable to the clinical trials, those authorities may refuse or reject some or all of the clinical trial data or take other actions that could delay or otherwise negatively affect our ability to obtain or maintain marketing approval of the product or indication. in addition, delays or failures to develop diagnostic tests for our clinical trials can affect the timely enrollment of such trials and lead to delays or inability to obtain marketing approval. if we were unable to market and sell our products or product candidates, our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.
in addition, some of our clinical trials utilize drugs manufactured and marketed by other pharmaceutical companies. these drugs may be administered in clinical trials in combination with one of our products or product candidates or in a head-to-head study comparing the products' or product candidates' relative efficacy and safety. in the event that any of these vendors or pharmaceutical companies have unforeseen issues that negatively affect the quality of their work product or create a shortage of supply, or if we are otherwise unable to obtain an adequate supply of these other drugs, our ability to complete our applicable clinical trials and/or evaluate clinical results may also be negatively affected. as a result, such quality or supply problems could adversely affect our ability to timely file for, gain or maintain regulatory approvals worldwide.
clinical trials must generally be designed based on the current standard of medical care. however, in certain diseases, such as cancer, the standard of care is evolving rapidly. in some cases, we may design a clinical trial based on the standard of care we anticipate will exist at the time our study is completed. the duration of time needed to complete certain clinical trials may result in the design of such clinical trials being based on standards of medical care that are no longer or that have not become the current standards by the time such trials are completed, limiting the utility and application of such trials. additionally, the views of regulatory agencies relating to the requirements for accelerated approval may change over time, and trial designs that were sufficient to support accelerated approvals for some oncology products may not be considered sufficient for later candidates. we may not obtain favorable clinical trial results and therefore may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for new product candidates or new indications for existing products and/or maintain our current product labels. participants in clinical trials of our products and product candidates may also suffer adverse medical events or side effects that could, among other factors, delay or terminate clinical trial programs and/or require additional or longer trials to gain approval.
even after a product is on the market, safety concerns may require additional or more extensive clinical trials as part of a risk management plan for our product or for approval of a new indication. for example, in connection with the june 2011 esa label changes, we agreed to and conducted additional clinical trials examining the use of esas in ckd. additional clinical trials we initiate, including those required by the fda, could result in substantial additional expense and the outcomes could result in further label restrictions or the loss of regulatory approval for an approved indication, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations. additionally, any negative results from such trials could materially affect the extent of approvals, the use, reimbursement and sales of our products, our business and results of operations.
some of our products are used with drug delivery or companion diagnostic devices that have their own regulatory, manufacturing and other risks.
many of our products and product candidates may be used in combination with a drug delivery device, such as an injector or other delivery system. for example, neulasta® is available as part of the neulasta® onpro® kit, and our autotouch® reusable autoinjector is used with enbrel mini® single-dose prefilled cartridges. in addition, some of our products or product candidates, including many of our oncology products in early stage development, may also require the use of a companion or other diagnostic device such as a device that determines whether the patient is eligible to use our drug or that helps ensure its safe and effective use. in some regions, including the united states, regulatory authorities may require contemporaneous approval of the companion diagnostic device and the therapeutic product; in others the regulatory authorities may require a separate study of the companion diagnostic device. our product candidates or expanded indications of our products used with such devices may not be approved or may be substantially delayed in receiving regulatory approval if development or approval of such devices is delayed, such devices do not also gain or maintain regulatory approval or clearance, or if such devices do not remain commercially available. when approval of the product and device is sought under a single marketing drug application, the increased complexity of the review process may delay receipt of regulatory approval. in addition, some of these devices may be provided by single-source unaffiliated third-party companies. we are dependent on the sustained cooperation and effort of those third-party companies to supply and/or market the devices and, in some cases, to conduct the studies required for approval or clearance by the applicable regulatory agencies. we are also dependent on those third-party companies continuing to meet applicable regulatory or other requirements. failure to successfully develop, modify, or supply the devices, delays in or failures of the amgen or third-party studies, or failure of us or the third-party companies to obtain or maintain regulatory approval or clearance of the devices could result in increased development costs; delays in, or failure to obtain or maintain, regulatory approval; and/or associated delays in a product candidate reaching the market or in the addition of new indications for existing products. we are also required to collect and assess user complaints, adverse events and malfunctions regarding our devices, and actual or perceived safety problems or concerns with a device used with our product can lead to regulatory actions and adverse effects on our products. see our current products and products in development cannot be sold without regulatory approval. additionally, regulatory agencies conduct routine monitoring and conduct inspections to identify and evaluate potential issues with our devices. for example, in 2017, the fda reported on its adverse event reporting system that it is evaluating our neulasta® onpro® kit. loss of regulatory approval or clearance of a device that is used with our product may also result in the removal of our product from the market. further, failure to successfully develop, supply, or gain or maintain approval for these devices could adversely affect sales of the related, approved products.
some of our pharmaceutical pipeline and our commercial product sales relies on collaborations with third parties, which may adversely affect the development and sale of our products.
we depend on alliances with other companies, including pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, vendors and service providers, for the development of a portion of the products in our pharmaceutical pipeline and for the commercialization and sales of certain of our commercial products. for example, we have collaborations with third parties under which we share development rights, obligations and costs and/or commercial rights and obligations. see item 1. business-significant developments-collaboration with beigene, ltd., and item 1. business-business relationships.
failures by these parties to meet their contractual, regulatory, or other obligations to us or any disruption in the relationships between us and these third parties, could have a material adverse effect on our pharmaceutical pipeline and business. in addition, our collaborative relationships for r&d and/or commercialization and sales often extend for many years and have given, and may in the future give, rise to disputes regarding the relative rights, obligations and revenues of us and our collaboration partners, including the ownership or prosecution of intellectual property and associated rights and obligations. this could result in the loss of intellectual property rights or protection, delay the development and sale of potential pharmaceutical products, affect the effective sale and delivery of our commercialized products and lead to lengthy and expensive litigation, administrative proceedings or arbitration. for example, we are currently involved in litigation with novartis over our collaboration agreements for the development and commercialization of aimovig®. see part iv-note 19, contingencies and commitments, to the consolidated financial statements. while our collaboration remains in place until the litigation is resolved and we remain committed to continuing to work with novartis to sell and deliver aimovig®, it is possible that the dispute may nevertheless affect the efficiency of operation and future growth of the collaboration. the litigation may also affect or delay, or lead to a termination of, other projects with novartis.
the adoption and interpretation of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities could affect our profitability.
we are subject to income and other taxes in the united states and other jurisdictions in which we do business. as a result, our provision for income taxes is derived from a combination of applicable tax rates in the various places we operate. significant judgment is required for determining our provision for income tax.
our tax returns are routinely examined by tax authorities in the united states and other jurisdictions in which we do business, and a number of audits are currently underway. tax authorities, including the internal revenue service (irs), are becoming more aggressive in their audits and are particularly focused on the allocations of income and expense among tax jurisdictions. as previously disclosed, we received a revenue agent report (rar) from the irs for the years 2010, 2011 and 2012. the rar proposes to make significant adjustments that relate primarily to the allocation of profits between certain of our entities in the united states and the u.s. territory of puerto rico. in november 2017, we received a modified rar that revised the irs's calculation but continued to propose substantial adjustments. we disagree with the proposed adjustments and are pursuing resolution with the irs administrative appeals office, which currently has jurisdiction over the matter. if we deem necessary, we will vigorously contest the proposed adjustments through the judicial process. although final resolution of this complex matter is not likely within the next 12 months, such resolution could have a material negative effect on our consolidated financial statements. we believe our accrual for income tax liabilities is appropriate based on past experience, interpretations of tax law and judgments about potential actions by tax authorities; however, due to the complexity of the provision for income taxes, the ultimate resolution of any tax matters may result in payments substantially greater or less than amounts accrued.
our provision for income taxes and results of operations in the future could be adversely affected by changes to our operating structure, changes in the mix of income and expenses in countries with differing tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and changes in applicable tax laws, regulations or administrative interpretations thereof. the tax cuts and jobs act (the 2017 tax act) is complex and further regulations and interpretations are still being issued. we could face audit challenges to our application of the new law that could have a negative effect on our provision for income taxes. a change to the u.s. tax system, such as a repeal or modification of the 2017 tax act, a change to the tax system in a jurisdiction where we have significant operations, such as the u.s. territory of puerto rico, or changes in tax law in the united states or other jurisdictions where we do business, could have a material and adverse effect on our business and on the results of our operations.
we perform a substantial majority of our commercial manufacturing activities at our facility in the u.s. territory of puerto rico and a substantial majority of our clinical manufacturing activities at our facility in thousand oaks, california; significant disruptions or production failures at these facilities could significantly impair our ability to supply our products or continue our clinical trials.
the global supply of our products and product candidates for commercial sales and for use in our clinical trials is significantly dependent on the uninterrupted and efficient operation of our manufacturing facilities, in particular those in the u.s. territory of puerto rico and thousand oaks, california. see manufacturing difficulties, disruptions or delays could limit supply of our products and limit our product sales.
we currently perform a substantial majority of our clinical manufacturing that supports our product candidates at our facility in thousand oaks, california. a substantial disruption in our ability to operate our thousand oaks manufacturing facility could materially and adversely affect our ability to supply our product candidates for use in our clinical trials, leading to delays in development of our product candidates.
in addition, we currently perform a substantial majority of our commercial manufacturing activities at our facility in the u.s. territory of puerto rico. in recent years, puerto rico has been affected by natural disasters, including earthquakes in early 2020 and hurricane maria in 2017. these natural disasters have affected public and private properties and puerto rico's electric grid and communications networks. while the critical manufacturing areas of our commercial manufacturing facility were not significantly affected by these natural disasters, the restoration of electrical service on the island after hurricane maria was a slow process, and our facility operated with electrical power from backup diesel powered generators for some time. we are also operating on backup generators since the early 2020 earthquakes. further instability of the electric grid could require us to increase the use of our generators or to continue using them exclusively. in addition, future storms or other natural disasters or events could cause a more significant effect on our manufacturing operations. also, during the summer of 2019 political instability in the puerto rico government led to civil unrest and the resignation and replacement of the governor. although our ability to manufacture and supply our products has not, to date, been affected by these natural disasters or the political instability, any substantial disruption to our ability to operate our puerto rico manufacturing facility or get supplies and manufactured products transported to and from that location could materially and adversely affect our ability to supply our products and affect our product sales. see manufacturing difficulties, disruptions or delays could limit supply of our products and limit our product sales.
hurricane maria, the earthquakes of early 2020 and the political situation in puerto rico have placed greater stress on the island's already challenged economy. beginning in 2016, the government of puerto rico defaulted on its roughly $72 billion in debt. in response, the u.s. congress passed the puerto rico oversight, management, and economic stability act (promesa), which established a financial oversight and management board (oversight board) to provide fiscal oversight. title iii of promesa provides puerto rico with a judicial process for restructuring its debt similar to, but not identical to, chapter 9 of the u.s. bankruptcy code, including a stay of debtholder litigation. in may 2017, the oversight board approved and certified the filing in the u.s. district court for the district of puerto rico of a voluntary petition under title iii of promesa for the government of puerto rico and certain of its governmental entities, including the puerto rico electric power authority. certain creditors and labor unions have brought suit claiming the appointment process of the oversight board was unconstitutional, and as of october 2019, the u.s. supreme court heard oral arguments on these claims. if the u.s. supreme court were to hold that promesa has a constitutional infirmity and that actions taken by the oversight board are invalid, the commencement of all title iii proceedings could be invalid and the current debt restructuring process and the debtholder litigation stay under title iii of promesa could be in jeopardy.
each year since 2017, the oversight board has prepared and updated puerto rico's fiscal plan and has certified its budget, imposing significant expense reductions across the government, considering federal disaster funding related to hurricane maria and projecting material deficits once the stimulus effects of the disaster recovery dissipate. each plan has stressed the need for fiscal and structural reforms to address puerto rico's challenging economic and demographic trends. the government of puerto rico challenged several budget measures imposed by the oversight board; these challenges have been dismissed by the title iii court and affirmed by the u.s. court of appeals for the first circuit.
in addition, the 2017 tax act no longer permits deferral of u.s. taxation on puerto rico earnings, although these earnings generally will be taxed in the united states at a reduced 10.5% rate. given puerto rico's challenged economy and disaster recovery needs, it may be difficult for puerto rico to sustain or grow its manufacturing base, which contributes significantly to puerto rico's economy, due to competition from other locations subject to similar levels of taxation.
while promesa and the actions above continue to be important factors in moving puerto rico toward economic stability, puerto rico's ongoing economic and demographic trend challenges and political situation, the effects of natural disasters and the effects of the 2017 tax act or other potential tax law changes have negatively affected, and may in the future negatively affect, the territorial government's provision of utilities or other services in puerto rico that we use in the operation of our business and could create the potential for increased taxes or fees to operate in puerto rico, result in a migration of workers from puerto rico to the mainland united states, or make it more expensive or difficult for us to operate in puerto rico. these factors could have a material adverse effect on our ability to supply our products, on our business and on our product sales.
we rely on third-party suppliers for certain of our raw materials, medical devices and components.
we rely on unaffiliated third-party suppliers for certain raw materials, medical devices and components necessary for the manufacturing of our commercial and clinical products. certain of those raw materials, medical devices and components are proprietary products of those unaffiliated third-party suppliers and are specifically cited in our drug applications with regulatory agencies so that they must be obtained from that specific sole source or sources and could not be obtained from another supplier unless and until the regulatory agency approved such supplier. for example, scandinavian health limited group is our single source of sureclick® autoinjectors for repatha®, enbrel, aimovig®, amgevitatm and aranesp®. also, certain of the raw materials required in the commercial and clinical manufacturing of our products are sourced from other countries and/or derived from biological sources, including mammalian tissues, bovine serum and human serum albumin.
•   regulatory requirements or action by regulatory agencies or others;
•   adverse financial or other strategic developments at or affecting the supplier, including bankruptcy;
•   unexpected demand for or shortage of raw materials, medical devices or components;
•   failure to comply with our quality standards which results in quality and product failures, product contamination and/or recall;
•   cyber-attacks on supplier systems; and
for example, in prior years we have experienced shortages in certain components necessary for the formulation, fill and finish of certain of our products in our puerto rico facility. further quality issues that result in unexpected additional demand for certain components may lead to shortages of required raw materials or components (such as we have experienced with epogen® glass vials). we may experience similar or other shortages in the future resulting in delayed shipments, supply constraints, clinical trial delays, contract disputes and/or stock-outs of our products. these or other similar events could negatively affect our ability to satisfy demand for our products or conduct clinical trials, which could have a material adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations.
manufacturing difficulties, disruptions or delays could limit supply of our products and limit our product sales.
manufacturing biologic and small molecule human therapeutic products is difficult, complex and highly regulated. we manufacture many of our commercial products and product candidates internally. in addition, we currently use third-party contract manufacturers to produce, or assist in the production of, a number of our products, and we currently use contract manufacturers to produce, or assist in the production of, a number of our late-stage product candidates and drug delivery devices. see item 1. business-manufacturing, distribution and raw materials-manufacturing. our ability to adequately and timely manufacture and supply our products (and product candidates to support our clinical trials) is dependent on the uninterrupted and efficient operation of our facilities and those of our third-party contract manufacturers, which may be affected by:
•   capacity of manufacturing facilities;
•   contamination by microorganisms or viruses, or foreign particles from the manufacturing process;
•   compliance with regulatory requirements;
•   changes in forecasts of future demand;
•   updates of manufacturing specifications;
•   contractual disputes with our suppliers and contract manufacturers;
•   timing and outcome of product quality testing;
•   power failures and/or other utility failures;
•   cyber-attacks on supplier systems;
•   breakdown, failure, substandard performance or improper installation or operation of equipment (including our information technology systems and network-connected control systems or those of our contract manufacturers or third-party service providers); and/or
•   delays in the ability of the fda or foreign regulatory agencies to provide us necessary reviews, inspections and approvals, including as a result of a subsequent extended u.s. federal government shutdown.
if any of these or other problems affect production in one or more of our facilities or those of our third-party contract manufacturers, or if we do not accurately forecast demand for our products or the amount of our product candidates required in clinical trials, we may be unable to start or increase production in our unaffected facilities to meet demand. if the efficient manufacture and supply of our products or product candidates is interrupted, we may experience delayed shipments, delays in our clinical trials, supply constraints, stock-outs, adverse event trends, contract disputes and/or recalls of our products. from time to time we have initiated recalls of certain lots of our products. for example, in july 2014 we initiated a voluntary recall of an aranesp® lot distributed in the eu after particles were detected in a quality control sample following distribution of that lot, and in april 2018 we initiated a precautionary recall of two batches of vectibix® distributed in switzerland after potential crimping defects were discovered in the metal seals on some product vials. if we are at any time unable to provide an uninterrupted supply of our products to patients, we may lose patients and physicians may elect to prescribe competing therapeutics instead of our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations.
our manufacturing processes, those of our third-party contract manufacturers and those of certain of our third-party service providers must undergo regulatory approval processes and are subject to continued review by the fda and other regulatory authorities. it can take longer than five years to build, validate and license another manufacturing plant and it can take longer than three years to qualify and license a new contract manufacturer or service provider. if we elect or are required to make changes to our manufacturing processes because of new regulatory requirements, new interpretations of existing requirements or other reasons, this could increase our manufacturing costs and result in delayed shipments, delays in our clinical trials, supply constraints, stock-outs, adverse event trends or contract negotiations or disputes. such manufacturing challenges may also occur if our existing contract manufacturers are unable or unwilling to timely implement such changes, or at all.
in addition, regulatory agencies conduct routine monitoring and conduct inspections of our manufacturing facilities and processes as well as those of our third-party contract manufacturers and service providers. if regulatory authorities determine that we or our third-party contract manufacturers or certain of our third-party service providers have violated regulations, they may mandate corrective actions and/or issue warning letters, or even restrict, suspend or revoke our prior approvals, prohibiting us from manufacturing our products or conducting clinical trials or selling our marketed products until we or the affected third-party contract manufacturers or third-party service providers comply, or indefinitely. see also our current products and products in development cannot be sold without regulatory approval. such issues may also delay the approval of product candidates we have submitted for regulatory review, even if such product candidates are not directly related to the products, devices or processes at issue with regulators. because our third-party contract manufacturers and certain of our third-party service providers are subject to the fda and foreign regulatory authorities, alternative qualified third-party contract manufacturers and third-party service providers may not be available on a timely basis or at all. see a breakdown, cyberattack or information security breach could compromise the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our information technology systems and network-connected control systems and our data, interrupt the operation of our business and affect our reputation. if we or our third-party contract manufacturers or third-party service providers cease or interrupt production or if our third-party contract manufacturers and third-party service providers fail to supply materials, products or services to us, we may experience delayed shipments, delays in our clinical trials, supply constraints, contract disputes, stock-outs and/or recalls of our products. additionally, we distribute a substantial volume of our commercial products through our primary distribution centers in louisville, kentucky for the united states and in breda, netherlands for europe and much of the rest of the world. we also conduct most of the labeling and packaging of our products distributed in europe and much of the rest of the world in breda. our ability to timely supply products is dependent on the uninterrupted and efficient operations of our distribution and logistics centers, our third-party logistics providers and our labeling and packaging facility in breda. further, we rely on commercial transportation, including air and sea freight, for the distribution of our products to our customers, which may be negatively affected by natural disasters or security threats.
concentration of sales at certain of our wholesaler distributors and at one free-standing dialysis clinic business and consolidation of private payers may negatively affect our business.
certain of our distributors, customers and payers have substantial purchasing leverage, due to the volume of our products they purchase or the number of patient lives for which they provide coverage. the substantial majority of our u.s. product sales is made to three pharmaceutical product wholesaler distributors: amerisourcebergen corporation, mckesson corporation and cardinal health, inc. these distributors, in turn, sell our products to their customers, which include physicians or their clinics, dialysis centers, hospitals and pharmacies. one of our products, epogen®, is sold primarily to free-standing dialysis clinics. davita owns or manages a large number of the outpatient dialysis facilities located in the united states and accounts for approximately 80% of all epogen® sales. similarly, as discussed above, there has been significant consolidation in the health insurance industry, including that a small number of pbms now oversee a substantial percentage of total covered lives in the united states. see our sales depend on coverage and reimbursement from third-party payers, and pricing and reimbursement pressures may affect our profitability. the three largest pbms in the united states are now part of major health insurance providers. the growing concentration of purchasing and negotiating power by these entities may put pressure on our pricing due to their ability to extract price discounts on our products, fees for other services or rebates, negatively affecting our bargaining position, sales and/or profit margins. in addition, decisions by these entities to purchase or cover less or none of our products in favor of competitive products could have a material adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations due to their purchasing volume. further, if one of our significant wholesale distributors encounters financial or other difficulties and becomes unable or unwilling to pay us all amounts that such distributor owes us on a timely basis or at all, it could negatively affect our business and results of operations. in addition, if one of our significant wholesale distributors becomes insolvent or otherwise unable to continue its commercial relationship with us in its present form, it could significantly disrupt our business and adversely affect our product sales, our business and results of operations unless suitable alternatives are timely found or lost sales are absorbed by another distributor.
our efforts to collaborate with or acquire other companies, products, or technology, and to integrate the operations of companies or to support the products or technology we have acquired, may not be successful, and may result in unanticipated costs, delays or failures to realize the benefits of the transactions.
we seek innovation through significant investment in both internal r&d and external transactions including collaborations, partnering, alliances, licenses, joint ventures, mergers and acquisitions (collectively, acquisition activity). acquisition activities may be subject to regulatory approvals or other requirements that are not within our control. there can be no assurance that such regulatory or other approvals will be obtained or that all closing conditions required in connection with our acquisition activities will be satisfied or waived, which could result in us being unable to complete the planned acquisition activities.
acquisition activities are complex, time consuming and expensive and may result in unanticipated costs, delays or other operational or financial problems related to integrating the acquired company and business with our company, which may divert our management's attention from other business issues and opportunities and restrict the full realization of the anticipated benefits of such transactions within the expected timeframe or at all. we may pay substantial amounts of cash, incur debt or issue equity securities to pay for acquisition activities, which could adversely affect our liquidity or result in dilution to our stockholders, respectively. further, failures or difficulties in integrating or retaining new personnel or in integrating the operations of the businesses, products or assets we acquire (including related technology, commercial operations, compliance programs, manufacturing, distribution and general business operations and procedures) may affect our ability to realize the benefits of the transaction and grow our business and may result in us incurring asset impairment or restructuring charges. these and other challenges may arise in connection with our recent acquisition of otezla® and/or collaboration with beigene, or with other acquisition activities, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and stock price.
our sales and operations are subject to the risks of doing business internationally, including in emerging markets.
as we continue our expansion efforts in emerging markets around the world, through acquisitions and licensing transactions as well as through the development and introduction of our products in new markets, we face numerous risks to our business. there is no guarantee that our efforts and strategies to expand sales in emerging markets will succeed. emerging market countries, including china, may be especially vulnerable to periods of global and local political, legal, regulatory and financial instability, including sovereign debt issues and/or the imposition of international sanctions in response to certain state actions. we may also be required to increase our reliance on third-party agents and unfamiliar operations and arrangements previously utilized by companies we partner with or acquire in emerging markets. see we must conduct clinical trials in humans before we commercialize and sell any of our product candidates or existing products for new indications. as we expand internationally, we are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the u.s. dollar. while we have a program in place that is designed to reduce our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations through foreign currency hedging arrangements, our hedging efforts do not completely offset the effect of these fluctuations on our revenues and earnings. in addition, we have a number of financial instruments referencing the london interbank offered rate (libor). on july 27, 2017, the u.k financial conduct authority, which regulates libor, announced that it will no longer require banks to submit rates for the calculation of libor to the libor administrator after 2021, and it is anticipated that libor will be phased out and replaced by 2022. while various replacement reference rates have been proposed, an alternative reference rate to libor has not yet been widely adopted and the specific mechanisms to replace libor in our existing libor-linked financial instruments have not been finalized. as such, the replacement of libor could have an adverse effect on the market for, or value of, our libor-linked financial instruments.
our international operations and business may also be subject to less protective intellectual property or other applicable laws, diverse data privacy and protection requirements, changing tax laws and tariffs, trade restrictions or other barriers designed to protect industry in the home country against foreign competition, far-reaching anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws and regulations and/or evolving legal and regulatory environments. our expansion efforts in emerging markets around the world, including china, is dependent upon the establishment of an environment that is supportive of biopharmaceutical innovation, sustained access for our products and limited pricing controls. we are also subject to the economic and political uncertainties stemming from the united kingdom's exit from the eu, commonly referred to as "brexit," which occurred on january 31, 2020. while our manufacturing and packaging activities take place largely outside the united kingdom, minimizing the need to make costly and significant changes to those operations, we have nevertheless been working to put in place contingency plans to attempt to mitigate the effects of brexit on us. overall, the legal and operational challenges of our international business operations, along with government controls, the challenges of attracting and retaining qualified personnel and obtaining and/or maintaining necessary regulatory or pricing approvals of our products, may result in a material adverse effect on our international product sales, business and results of operations.
our business may be affected by litigation and government investigations.
we and certain of our subsidiaries are involved in legal proceedings. see part iv-note 19, contingencies and commitments, to the consolidated financial statements. civil and criminal litigation is inherently unpredictable, and the outcome can result in costly verdicts, fines and penalties, exclusion from federal healthcare programs and/or injunctive relief that affect how we operate our business. defense of litigation claims can be expensive, time consuming and distracting, and it is possible that we could incur judgments or enter into settlements of claims for monetary damages or change the way we operate our business, which could have a material adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations. in addition, product liability is a major risk in testing and marketing biotechnology and pharmaceutical products. we may face substantial product liability exposure in human clinical trials and for products we sell after regulatory approval. product liability claims, regardless of their merits, could be costly and divert management's attention and could adversely affect our reputation and the demand for our products. we and certain of our subsidiaries have previously been named as defendants in product liability actions for certain of our products.
we are also involved in government investigations that arise in the ordinary course of our business. in recent years, there has been a trend of increasing government investigations and litigations against companies operating in our industry, both in the united states and around the world. see our sales depend on coverage and reimbursement from third-party payers, and pricing and reimbursement pressures may affect our profitability. our business activities outside of the united states are subject to the fcpa and similar anti-bribery or anti-corruption laws, regulations or rules of other countries in which we operate, including the uk bribery act. we cannot ensure that all our employees, agents, contractors, vendors, licensees, partners or collaborators will comply with all applicable laws and regulations. on april 25, 2019, we entered into a settlement agreement with the doj and the oig of the hhs to settle certain allegations relating to our support of independent charitable organizations that provide patients with financial assistance to access their medicines. as a result, we entered into a corporate integrity agreement that requires us to maintain a corporate compliance program and to undertake a set of defined corporate integrity obligations for a period of five years. while we expect to fully comply with all of our obligations under the corporate integrity agreement, failure to do so could result in substantial penalties and our being excluded from government healthcare programs. we may also see new government investigations of or actions against us citing novel theories of recovery. for example, prosecutors are placing greater scrutiny on commercial co-pay support programs, and further enforcement actions and investigations regarding such programs could limit our ability to provide co-pay assistance to commercial patients. any of these results could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
a breakdown, cyberattack or information security breach could compromise the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our information technology systems and network-connected control systems and our data, interrupt the operation of our business and affect our reputation.
to achieve our business objectives, we rely to a large extent upon sophisticated information technology systems, including cloud services and network-connected control systems, some of which are managed, hosted, provided or serviced by third parties. internal or external events that compromise the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our systems and data may significantly interrupt the operation of our business, result in significant costs and/or affect our reputation.
our information technology systems are highly integrated into our business, including our r&d efforts, our clinical and commercial manufacturing processes and our product sales and distribution processes. the complexity and interconnected nature of our systems makes them potentially vulnerable to breakdown or other service interruptions. our systems are also subject to frequent cyberattacks. as the cyber-threat landscape evolves, these attacks are growing in frequency, sophistication and intensity and are becoming increasingly difficult to detect. such attacks could include the use of harmful and virulent malware, including ransomware or other denials of service, and can be deployed through various means including the software supply chain, e-mail, malicious websites and the use of social engineering. attacks such as those seen with other multi-national companies, including some of our peers, could leave us unable to utilize key business systems or access important data needed to operate our business, including developing, gaining regulatory approval for, manufacturing, selling and/or distributing our products. for example, in 2017, a pharmaceutical company experienced a cyberattack involving virulent malware that significantly disrupted its operations, including its research and sales operations and the production of some of its medicines and vaccines. as a result of the cyberattack, its orders and sales for certain products in certain markets were negatively affected. our systems also contain and utilize a high volume of sensitive data, including intellectual property, trade secrets, financial information, regulatory information, strategic plans, sales trends and forecasts, litigation materials and/or personal information belonging to us, our staff, our patients, customers and/or other parties. in some cases, we utilize third-party service providers to process, store, manage or transmit such data, which may increase our risk. intentional or inadvertent data privacy or security breaches (including cyberattacks) or lapses by employees, service providers (including providers of information technology-specific services), nation states, organized crime organizations, "hacktivists" or others, create risks that our sensitive data may be exposed to unauthorized persons, our competitors, or the public. finally, domestic and global government regulators, our business partners, suppliers with whom we do business, companies that provide us or our partners with business services and companies we may acquire may face similar risks, and security breaches of their systems could adversely affect our security, leave us without access to important systems, products, raw materials, components, services or information or expose our confidential data. for example, in 2019, two vendors that perform testing and analytical services that we use in developing and manufacturing our products have experienced cyberattacks requiring us to disconnect our systems from the vendors' systems. while we were able to reconnect our systems following restoration of the vendor's capabilities without significantly affecting product availability, a more extended service outage affecting this or other vendors, particularly where such vendor is the single source from which we obtain the services, could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations. in addition, we distribute our products in the united states primarily through three pharmaceutical wholesalers, and a security breach that impairs the distribution operations of our wholesalers could significantly impair our ability to deliver our products to healthcare providers.
although we have experienced system breakdowns, attacks and information security breaches, we do not believe such breakdowns, attacks and breaches have had a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations. we continue to invest in the monitoring, protection and resilience of our critical or sensitive data and systems. however, there can be no assurance that our efforts will detect, prevent or fully recover systems or data from all breakdowns, service interruptions, attacks, or breaches of our systems that could adversely affect our business and operations and/or result in the loss or exposure of critical, proprietary, private, confidential or otherwise sensitive data, which could result in financial, legal, business or reputational harm to us or negatively affect our stock price. while we maintain cyber-liability insurance, our insurance is not sufficient to cover us against all losses that could potentially result from a service interruption, breach of our systems or loss of our critical or sensitive data.
we are also subject to various laws and regulations globally regarding privacy and data protection, including laws and regulations relating to the collection, storage, handling, use, disclosure, transfer and security of personal data. the legislative and regulatory environment regarding privacy and data protection is continuously evolving and developing and the subject of significant attention globally. for example, we are subject to the eu's gdpr, which became effective in may 2018, and the california consumer privacy act of 2018, which became effective in january 2020, each of which contemplate substantial penalties (penalties for noncompliance could be 4% of an organization's annual global revenues under the gdpr. other jurisdictions where we operate have enacted or proposed similar legislation and/or regulations. failure to comply with these current and future laws could result in significant penalties and could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
global economic conditions may negatively affect us and may magnify certain risks that affect our business.
our operations and performance have been, and may continue to be, affected by global economic conditions. financial pressures may cause government or other third-party payers to more aggressively seek cost containment measures. see our sales depend on coverage and reimbursement from third-party payers, and pricing and reimbursement pressures may affect our profitability. as a result of global economic conditions, some third-party payers may delay or be unable to satisfy their reimbursement obligations. job losses or other economic hardships may also affect patients' ability to afford health care as a result of increased co-pay or deductible obligations, greater cost sensitivity to existing co-pay or deductible obligations, lost healthcare insurance coverage or for other reasons. we believe such conditions have led and could continue to lead to reduced demand for our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations. economic conditions may also adversely affect the ability of our distributors, customers and suppliers to obtain the liquidity required to buy inventory or raw materials and to perform their obligations under agreements with us, which could disrupt our operations. although we monitor our distributors', customers' and suppliers' financial condition and their liquidity to mitigate our business risks, some of our distributors, customers and suppliers may become insolvent, which could have a material adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations. a significant worsening of global economic conditions could materially increase these risks facing us.
we maintain a significant portfolio of investments disclosed as cash equivalents and marketable securities on our consolidated balance sheets. the value of our investments may be adversely affected by interest rate fluctuations, downgrades in credit ratings, illiquidity in the capital markets and other factors that may result in other-than-temporary declines in the value of our investments. any of those events could cause us to record impairment charges with respect to our investment portfolio or to realize losses on sales of investments.
our stock price, like that of our peers in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, is volatile. our revenues and operating results may fluctuate from period to period for a number of reasons. events such as a delay in product development, changes to our expectations or strategy or even a relatively small revenue shortfall may cause financial results for a period to be below our expectations or projections. as a result, our revenues and operating results and, in turn, our stock price may be subject to significant fluctuations. announcements or discussions, including via social media channels, of possible restrictive actions by government or private payers that would negatively affect our business or industry if ultimately enacted or adopted may also cause our stock price to fluctuate, whether or not such restrictive actions ever actually occur. similarly, actual or perceived safety issues with our products or similar products or unexpected clinical trial results can have an immediate and rapid effect on our stock price, whether or not our operating results are materially affected.
we may not be able to access the capital and credit markets on terms that are favorable to us, or at all.
the capital and credit markets may experience extreme volatility and disruption, which may lead to uncertainty and liquidity issues for both borrowers and investors. we expect to access the capital markets to supplement our existing funds and cash generated from operations in satisfying our needs for working capital; capital expenditure and debt service requirements; our plans to pay dividends and repurchase stock; and other business initiatives we strategically plan to pursue, including acquisitions and licensing activities. in the event of adverse capital and credit market conditions, we may be unable to obtain capital market financing on similar favorable terms, or at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. changes in credit ratings issued by nationally recognized credit-rating agencies could adversely affect our ability to obtain capital market financing and the cost of such financing and have an adverse effect on the market price of our securities.
item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following management's discussion and analysis (md&a) is intended to assist the reader in understanding amgen's business. md&a is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. our results of operations discussed in md&a are presented in conformity with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles (gaap). amgen operates in one business segment: human therapeutics. therefore, our results of operations are discussed on a consolidated basis.
forward-looking statements this report and other documents we file with the sec contain forward-looking statements that are based on current expectations, estimates, forecasts and projections about us, our future performance, our business, our beliefs and our management's assumptions. in addition, we, or others on our behalf, may make forward-looking statements in press releases, written statements or our communications and discussions with investors and analysts in the normal course of business through meetings, webcasts, phone calls and conference calls. such words as "expect," "anticipate," "outlook," "could," "target," "project," "intend," "plan," "believe," "seek," "estimate," "should," "may," "assume" and "continue" as well as variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. these statements are not guarantees of future performance and they involve certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. we describe our respective risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could affect the outcome or results of operations in part i, item 1a. risk factors. we have based our forward-looking statements on our management's beliefs and assumptions based on information available to our management at the time the statements are made. we caution you that actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed, implied or forecasted by our forward-looking statements. reference is made in particular to forward-looking statements regarding product sales, regulatory activities, clinical trial results, reimbursement, expenses, earnings per share (eps), liquidity and capital resources, trends, planned dividends, stock repurchases and restructuring plans. except as required under the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations of the sec, we do not have any intention or obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements after the distribution of this report, whether as a result of new information, future events, changes in assumptions or otherwise.
overview amgen is a biotechnology company committed to unlocking the potential of biology for patients suffering from serious illnesses. a biotechnology pioneer since 1980, amgen has grown to be one of the world's leading independent biotechnology companies, has reached millions of patients around the world and is developing a pipeline of medicines with breakaway potential. in 2020, we celebrate our 40th anniversary, continuing our history of focusing on innovative medicines that have the potential to be first-in-class molecules and that have a large-effect size on serious diseases.
our principal products-those with the most significant annual commercial sales-are enbrel, neulasta®, prolia®, xgeva®, aranesp®, kyprolis®, epogen® and our recently acquired product otezla®. we also market a number of other products, including nplate®, vectibix®, repatha®, parsabiv®, sensipar®/mimpara®, blincyto®, aimovig®, neupogen®, kanjintitm, amgevitatm, evenity®, mvasitm, imlygic® and corlanor®. for additional information about our products, see part i, item 1. business-marketing, distribution and selected marketed products.
our strategy includes integrated activities intended to maintain and strengthen our competitive position in the industry. we focus on six commercial areas: inflammation, oncology/hematology, bone health, cardiovascular disease, nephrology and neuroscience and conduct discovery research primarily in three therapeutic areas: inflammation, oncology/hematology and cardiovascular/metabolic diseases. in 2019, we advanced our innovative pipeline, launched branded biosimilar programs, built our global geographic reach and expanded our next generation manufacturing capabilities, while returning capital to shareholders.
during the year we delivered strong financial results while facing competition from biosimilars and generics. total product sales decreased 1% as lower net selling prices were offset partially by volume growth. product sales decreased 5% in the united states and grew 11% in the rest of the world. total operating expenses increased 2% as we invested in our innovative r&d pipeline, including our early oncology assets.
we continued to advance our pipeline, including amg 510, which was granted fast track designation from the fda for the treatment of patients with previously treated metastatic nsclc with kras g12c mutation. we launched evenity® in the united states and japan, and it was granted marketing authorization in europe; and the united states label for kyprolis® was expanded. we also continued to advance our biosimilar program with the launches of kanjintitm and mvasitm in the united states and the approval of avsolatm for all approved indications of the reference product remicade® (infliximab) in the united states. lastly, we made a regulatory submission for abp 798 in the united states.
we have also continued to invest in external opportunities to augment our internal programs and products. we completed our acquisition of worldwide rights to otezla®, the only oral, non-biologic treatment for psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. we strengthened our international footprint with the announcement of a strategic collaboration with beigene to expand our oncology presence in china. in addition, we expanded our human genetics capabilities, by entering into a collaboration with a regional healthcare system in the united states and joining a consortium to perform whole genome sequencing of approximately 500,000 participants from the united kingdom. our human genetics capabilities allow us to identify new development targets in our chosen areas of therapeutic focus.
cash flows from operating activities were $9.2 billion, enabling us to invest in our business while returning capital to shareholders through the payment of cash dividends and stock repurchases. for 2019, we increased our quarterly cash dividend by 10% to $1.45 per share of common stock. in december 2019, we declared a cash dividend of $1.60 per share of common stock for the first quarter of 2020, an increase of 10% for this period, to be paid in march 2020. we also repurchased 40.2 million shares of our common stock throughout 2019 at an aggregate cost of $7.6 billion.
our long-term success depends, to a great extent, on our ability to continue to discover, develop and commercialize innovative products and acquire or collaborate on therapies currently in development by other companies. we must develop new products to achieve revenue growth and to offset revenue losses when products lose their exclusivity or when competing products are launched. certain of our products face increasing pressure from competition, including biosimilars and generics. for additional information, including information on the expirations of patents for various products, see part i, item 1. business-marketing, distribution and selected marketed products-patents, and part i, item 1. business-marketing, distribution and selected marketed products-competition. we devote considerable resources to r&d activities, but successful product development in the biotechnology industry is highly uncertain and we also are facing increasing regulatory scrutiny of safety and efficacy both before and after products launch.
rising healthcare costs and economic conditions also continue to pose challenges to our business, including continued pressure by third-party payers, such as governments and private payers, to reduce healthcare expenditures. as a result of public and private healthcare-provider focus, the industry continues to experience significant pricing pressures and other cost containment measures. finally, wholesale and end-user buying patterns can affect our product sales. these effects can cause fluctuations in quarterly product sales and have generally not been significant when comparing full-year product performance to the prior year.
see part i, item 1. business-marketing, distribution and selected marketed products and part i, item 1a. risk factors for further discussion of certain of the factors that could impact our future product sales.
selected financial information the following is an overview of our results of operations (in millions, except percentages and per-share data):
year ended december 31, 2019          change            year ended december 31, 2018
in the following discussion of changes in product sales, any reference to unit demand growth or decline refers to changes in the purchases of our products by healthcare providers such as physicians or their clinics, dialysis centers, hospitals and pharmacies. in addition, any reference to increases or decreases in inventory refers to changes in inventory held at wholesaler customers and end users such as pharmacies.
total product sales decreased for 2019, driven primarily by a decline in net selling price, offset partially by higher unit demand. for 2020, we expect net selling price to continue to decline.
other revenues decreased for 2019, driven primarily by lower milestone payments, offset partially by higher royalties.
operating expenses increased for 2019, driven primarily by higher spending in research and early pipeline in support of our oncology programs, offset partially by an impairment charge associated with an ipr&d asset in 2018.
although changes in foreign currency exchange rates result in increases or decreases in our reported international product sales, the benefit or detriment that such movements have on our international product sales is offset partially by corresponding increases or decreases in our international operating expenses and our related foreign currency hedging activities. our hedging activities seek to offset the impacts, both positive and negative, that foreign currency exchange rate changes may have on our net income by hedging our net foreign currency exposure, primarily with respect to product sales denominated in euros. the net impact from changes in foreign currency exchange rates was not material in 2019, 2018 or 2017.
year ended december 31, 2019          change            year ended december 31, 2018          change            year ended december 31, 2017
future sales of our products will depend in part on the factors discussed in the overview, part i, item 1. business-marketing, distribution and selected marketed products-competition, in part i, item 1a. risk factors, and any additional factors discussed in the individual product sections below. in addition, for a list of our products' significant competitors, see part i, item 1. business-marketing, distribution and selected marketed products-competition.
year ended december 31, 2019         change            year ended december 31, 2018      change            year ended december 31, 2017
the increase in enbrel sales for 2019 was driven primarily by favorable impacts from changes in accounting estimates of sales deductions and an increase in net selling price, offset partially by lower unit demand. for 2020, we expect the trend of lower unit demand to continue.
the decrease in enbrel sales for 2018 was driven primarily by lower unit demand and net selling price.
in april 2019, the fda approved a second biosimilar version of enbrel, and we are involved in patent litigations with the two companies seeking to market their fda-approved biosimilar versions of enbrel. see part iv-note 19, contingencies and commitments, to the consolidated financial statements. other companies are also developing proposed biosimilar versions of enbrel. companies with approved biosimilar versions of enbrel may seek to enter the u.s. market if we are not successful in our litigations, or even earlier.
year ended december 31, 2019      change            year ended december 31, 2018         change            year ended december 31, 2017
the decrease in global neulasta® sales for 2019 was driven by the impact of biosimilar competition on net selling price and unit demand. neulasta® sales for 2019 included a $98 million order in the first quarter from the u.s. government.
the decrease in global neulasta® sales for 2018 was driven primarily by favorable changes in accounting estimates of product returns in 2017, offset partially by favorable changes in inventory. neulasta® sales for 2018 included a $55 million order in the fourth quarter from the u.s. government.
biosimilar versions of neulasta® have been approved and launched, and other biosimilar versions may also receive approval in the near future. therefore, we face increased competition in the united states and europe, which has had and will continue to have a material adverse impact on sales of neulasta®. for a discussion of ongoing patent litigations related to these and other biosimilars, see part iv-note 19, contingencies and commitments, to the consolidated financial statements.
year ended december 31, 2019          change            year ended december 31, 2018          change            year ended december 31, 2017
the increases in global prolia® sales for 2019 and 2018 were driven by higher unit demand. prolia®, which has a six-month dosing interval, has exhibited a historical sales pattern, with the first and third quarters of a year representing lower sales than the second and fourth quarters of a year.

the decreases in global aranesp® sales for 2019 and 2018 were driven primarily by the impact of competition on unit demand in the united states.
aranesp® faces competition from a long-acting esa. aranesp® also faces competition from a biosimilar version of epogen®. other biosimilar versions of epogen® may also receive approval in the future. in 2019, sales in the united states declined, and we expect them to continue to decline at a faster rate in 2020 due to short- and long-acting competition.

the increase in global kyprolis® sales for 2019 was driven primarily by higher unit demand.
the increase in global kyprolis® sales for 2018 was driven primarily by higher unit demand, offset partially by lower net selling price.
we are engaged in litigation with two related companies that are challenging our material patents related to kyprolis® and that are seeking to market generic carfilzomib products. separately, we have entered into confidential settlement agreements with other companies developing generic carfilzomib products, and the court has entered consent judgments enjoining those companies from infringing certain of our patents, subject to terms of the confidential settlement agreements. see part iv-note 19, contingencies and commitments, to the consolidated financial statements. the fda has reported that it has tentatively approved abbreviated new drug applications (andas) filed by two companies for generic carfilzomib products. the date of final approval of those andas is governed by the hatch-waxman act and any applicable settlement agreements between the parties.

the decreases in epogen® sales for 2019 and 2018 were driven primarily by a decline in net selling price due to our contract with davita. see part i, item i. business-business relationships. in 2020, we expect a lower net selling price compared with 2019 due to our contract with davita.
a biosimilar version of epogen® has been approved and launched, and other biosimilar versions may also receive approval in the future. therefore, we face increased competition in the united states, which has had and will continue to have a material adverse impact on sales of epogen®. for a discussion of ongoing patent litigation related to one of these biosimilars, see part iv-note 19, contingencies and commitments, to the consolidated financial statements.

the decrease in global sensipar®/mimpara® sales for 2019 was driven by the impact of generic competitors on unit demand.
the increase in global sensipar®/mimpara® sales for 2018 was driven primarily by an increase in net selling price in the united states, offset partially by lower unit demand.
our u.s. composition-of-matter patent related to sensipar®, a small molecule, expired in march 2018. we are involved in litigation with a number of companies seeking to market generic cinacalcet products surrounding our u.s. formulation patent, which expires in september 2026. during the course of the patent litigation, we have entered into confidential settlement agreements with several of these companies. the court has entered consent judgments enjoining certain of those companies from infringing certain of our patents, subject to terms of the confidential settlement agreements. see part iv-note 19, contingencies and commitments, to the consolidated financial statements. companies manufacturing generics began selling their generic cinacalcet products in the united states in late 2018 and 2019. sensipar® sales have been and, we believe, may continue to be adversely impacted as a result of generic-product sales in the u.s. market.

cost of sales cost of sales increased to 18.6% of total revenues for 2019, driven primarily by unfavorable product mix and amortization of intangible assets as a result of our acquisition of otezla®, offset partially by lower royalties and lower manufacturing costs.
cost of sales decreased to 17.3% of total revenues for 2018, driven primarily by lower royalty costs, expenses related to hurricane maria in 2017 and lower acquisition-related amortization of intangible assets, offset partially by higher manufacturing costs.
research and development the company groups all of its r&d activities and related expenditures into three categories: (i) research and early pipeline, (ii) later-stage clinical programs and (iii) marketed products. these categories are described below:
category                        description research and early pipeline     r&amp;d expenses incurred in activities substantially in support of early research through the completion of phase 1 clinical trials, including drug discovery, toxicology, pharmacokinetics and drug metabolism, and process development later-stage clinical programs   r&amp;d expenses incurred in or related to phase 2 and phase 3 clinical programs intended to result in registration of a new product or a new indication for an existing product primarily in the united states or the eu marketed products               r&amp;d expenses incurred in support of the company's marketed products that are authorized to be sold primarily in the united states or the eu. includes clinical trials designed to gather information on product safety (certain of which may be required by regulatory authorities) and their product characteristics after regulatory approval has been obtained, as well as the costs of obtaining regulatory approval of a product in a new market after approval in either the united states or the eu has been obtained r&d expense by category was as follows (in millions):
research and early pipeline        $1,649                $1,201                  $972
marketed products                   1,405                 1,502                 1,711
the increase in r&d expense for 2019 was driven primarily by higher spend in research and early pipeline in support of our oncology programs, offset partially by lower marketed-product support.
the increase in r&d expense for 2018 was driven by higher spend on our early pipeline and later-stage clinical programs as well as external business development expense in research and early pipeline, offset partially by lower marketed-product support.
selling, general and administrative the decrease in selling, general and administrative (sg&a) expenses for 2019 was driven primarily by lower general and administrative expenses, the end of certain amortization charges in 2018 and lower spend for launched and marketed products, offset partially by spending for otezla® commercial-related expenses.
the increase in sg&a expense for 2018 was driven primarily by investments in product launches and marketed-product support.
other other operating expenses for 2019 included $47 million in restructuring costs.
other operating expenses for 2018 included a $330 million impairment charge associated with an ipr&d asset and a $42 million favorable net change in the fair values of contingent consideration liabilities. see part iv-note 17, fair value measurement, to the consolidated financial statements.
other operating expenses for 2017 included $284 million of impairment-related charges associated with an intangible asset acquired in a business combination and $83 million of certain net charges related to a restructuring plan.

interest expense, net the decrease in interest expense, net, for 2019 was due primarily to a reduction in outstanding long-term debt as a result of maturities in the current year.
the increase in interest expense, net, for 2018 was due primarily to the impact of rising interest rates on variable-rate debt.
interest and other income, net the increase in interest and other income, net, for 2019 was due primarily to net gains on sales of investments in interest-bearing securities liquidated to fund our acquisition of otezla® and our investment in beigene compared with losses in the prior year, offset partially by reduced interest income as a result of lower average cash balances and a gain recognized in connection with our acquisition of kirin-amgen, inc. (k-a), in the first quarter of 2018. see part iv-note 2, acquisitions, and note 21, subsequent events, to the consolidated financial statements.
the decrease in interest and other income, net, for 2018 was due primarily to higher investment losses and lower interest income as a result of the liquidation of a portion of our portfolio, offset partially by gains on our equity investments and a net gain recognized in connection with our acquisition of k-a.
income taxes the increase in our effective tax rate for 2019 compared with 2018 was due primarily to a prior-year tax benefit associated with intercompany sales under u.s. corporate tax reform.
the decrease in our effective tax rate for 2018 compared with 2017 was due primarily to impacts of u.s. corporate tax reform.
as previously disclosed, we received an rar from the irs for the years 2010, 2011 and 2012. the rar proposes to make significant adjustments that relate primarily to the allocation of profits between certain of our entities in the united states and the u.s. territory of puerto rico. in november 2017, we received a modified rar that revised the irs's calculation but continued to propose substantial adjustments. we disagree with the proposed adjustments and are pursuing resolution with the irs administrative appeals office, which currently has jurisdiction over the matter. if we deem necessary, we will vigorously contest the proposed adjustments through the judicial process. final resolution of this complex matter is not likely within the next 12 months and could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. we believe our accrual for income tax liabilities is appropriate based on past experience, interpretations of tax law and judgments about potential actions by tax authorities; however, due to the complexity of the provision for income taxes, the ultimate resolution of any tax matters may result in payments substantially greater or less than amounts accrued.
see summary of critical accounting policies-income taxes, and part iv-note 6, income taxes, to the consolidated financial statements.
financial condition, liquidity and capital resources selected financial data was as follows (in millions):
cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities      $8,911             $29,304
total assets                                         $59,707             $66,416
stockholders' equity                                  $9,673             $12,500
cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities we have global access to our $8.9 billion balance of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. the primary objective of our investment portfolio is to maintain safety of principal, prudent levels of liquidity and acceptable levels of risk. our investment policy limits interest-bearing security investments to certain types of debt and money market instruments issued by institutions with primarily investment-grade credit ratings, and it places restrictions on maturities and concentration by asset class and issuer.
capital allocation consistent with the objective to optimize our capital structure, we seek to deploy our accumulated cash balances in an efficient manner, and we consider several alternatives such as payment of dividends, stock repurchases, repayment of debt and strategic transactions that expand our portfolio of products in areas of therapeutic interest.
we intend to continue to invest in our business while returning capital to stockholders through the payment of cash dividends and stock repurchases, thereby reflecting our confidence in the future cash flows of our business. the timing and amount of future dividends and stock repurchases will vary based on a number of factors, including future capital requirements for strategic transactions, availability of financing on acceptable terms, debt service requirements, our credit rating, changes to applicable tax laws or corporate laws, changes to our business model and periodic determination by our board of directors that cash dividends and/or stock repurchases are in the best interests of stockholders and are in compliance with applicable laws and the company's agreements. in addition, the timing and amount of stock repurchases may also be affected by stock price and blackout periods, during which we are restricted from repurchasing stock. the manner of stock repurchases may include private block purchases, tender offers and market transactions.
the board of directors declared quarterly cash dividends of $1.15 per share of common stock paid in 2017, increased our quarterly cash dividend by 15% to $1.32 per share of common stock paid in 2018 and increased our quarterly cash dividend by 10% to $1.45 per share of common stock paid in 2019. in december 2019, the board of directors declared a cash dividend of $1.60 per share of common stock for the first quarter of 2020, an increase of 10% for this period, to be paid in march 2020.
we also returned capital to stockholders through our stock repurchase program. during 2019, we repurchased $7.6 billion of common stock and had cash settlements of $7.7 billion. in 2018, we repurchased $17.9 billion of common stock and had cash settlements of $17.8 billion, which included 52.1 million shares of common stock repurchased through a $10.0 billion tender offer. in 2017, we repurchased $3.1 billion of common stock and had cash settlements of $3.2 billion. in may 2019 and december 2019, our board of directors increased the amount authorized under our stock repurchase program by an additional $5.0 billion and $4.0 billion, respectively. as of december 31, 2019, $6.5 billion remained available under the stock repurchase program.
as a result of stock repurchases and quarterly dividend payments, we have an accumulated deficit as of december 31, 2019 and 2018. our accumulated deficit is not expected to affect our future ability to operate, repurchase stock, pay dividends or repay our debt given our continuing profitability and strong financial position.
we believe that existing funds, cash generated from operations and existing sources of and access to financing are adequate to satisfy our needs for working capital, capital expenditure and debt service requirements, our plans to pay dividends and repurchase stock and other business initiatives we plan to strategically pursue, including acquisitions and licensing activities. we anticipate that our liquidity needs can be met through a variety of sources, including cash provided by operating activities, sales of marketable securities, borrowings through commercial paper and/or syndicated credit facilities and access to other domestic and foreign debt markets and equity markets. see part i, item 1a. risk factors-global economic conditions may negatively affect us and may magnify certain risks that affect our business.
financing arrangements the current and noncurrent portions of our long-term borrowings as of december 31, 2019, were $3.0 billion and $27.0 billion, respectively. the current and noncurrent portions of our long-term borrowings as of december 31, 2018, were $4.4 billion and $29.5 billion, respectively. as of december 31, 2019, standard & poor's financial services llc (s&p), moody's investors service, inc. (moody's), and fitch ratings, inc. (fitch), assigned credit ratings to our outstanding senior notes of a- with a stable outlook, baa1 with a stable outlook and bbb+ with a stable outlook, respectively, which are considered investment grade. unfavorable changes to these ratings may have an adverse impact on future financings.
during 2019 and 2018, we did not issue any debt or debt securities. during 2017, we issued debt with an aggregate principal amount of $4.5 billion. during 2019, 2018 and 2017, we repaid debt of $4.5 billion, $1.1 billion and $4.4 billion, respectively.
to achieve a desired mix of fixed-rate and floating-rate debt, we entered into interest rate swap contracts that effectively converted a fixed-rate interest coupon for certain of our debt issuances to a floating libor-based coupon over the life of the respective note. these interest rate swap contracts qualify and are designated as fair value hedges. as of december 31, 2019 and 2018, we had interest rate swap contracts with aggregate notional amounts of $9.6 billion and $11.0 billion, respectively.
to hedge our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with certain of our long-term notes denominated in foreign currencies, we entered into cross-currency swap contracts, which effectively convert the interest payments and principal repayment of the respective notes from euros, pounds sterling and swiss francs to u.s. dollars. these cross-currency swap contracts qualify and are designated as cash flow hedges. as of december 31, 2019 and 2018, we had cross-currency swap contracts with aggregate notional amounts of $4.8 billion and $5.6 billion, respectively.
as of december 31, 2019, we had a commercial paper program that allows us to issue up to $2.5 billion of unsecured commercial paper to fund our working-capital needs. during 2017, we issued and repaid an aggregate of $12.3 billion of commercial paper and had a maximum outstanding balance of $1.5 billion under our commercial paper program. during 2019 and 2018, we did not issue any commercial paper. no commercial paper was outstanding as of december 31, 2019 or 2018.
in 2019, we amended and restated our $2.5 billion syndicated, unsecured, revolving credit agreement, which is available for general corporate purposes or as a liquidity backstop to our commercial paper program. the commitments under the revolving credit agreement may be increased by up to $750 million with the agreement of the banks. each bank that is a party to the agreement has an initial commitment term of five years. this term may be extended for up to two additional one-year periods with the agreement of the banks. annual commitment fees for this agreement are 0.09% of the unused portion of the facility based on our current credit rating. generally, we would be charged interest for any amounts borrowed under this facility, based on our current credit rating, at (i) libor plus 1% or (ii) the highest of (a) the syndication agent bank base commercial lending rate, (b) the overnight federal funds rate plus 0.50% or (c) one-month libor plus 1%. the agreement contains provisions relating to the determination of successor rates to address the possible phase-out or unavailability of designated reference rates. as of december 31, 2019 and 2018, no amounts were outstanding under this facility.
it is anticipated that libor will be phased out and replaced by 2022. while various replacement reference rates have been discussed, an alternative reference rate to libor has not yet been widely adopted. therefore, the mechanics to modify existing contracts that reference libor have not been finalized. however, we do not expect that a change in the reference rate of our contracts will be material. see part 1, item 1a. risk factors-our sales and operations are subject to the risks of doing business internationally, including in emerging markets.
in february 2020, we filed a shelf registration statement with the sec that allows us to issue unspecified amounts of debt securities; common stock; preferred stock; warrants to purchase debt securities, common stock, preferred stock or depositary shares; rights to purchase common stock or preferred stock; securities purchase contracts; securities purchase units; and depositary shares. under this shelf registration statement, all of the securities available for issuance may be offered from time to time with terms to be determined at the time of issuance. this shelf registration statement expires in february 2023.
certain of our financing arrangements contain nonfinancial covenants. in addition, our revolving credit agreement includes a financial covenant, which requires that we maintain a specified minimum interest coverage ratio of (i) the sum of consolidated net income, interest expense, provision for income taxes, depreciation expense, amortization expense, unusual or nonrecurring charges and other noncash items (consolidated ebitda) to (ii) consolidated interest expense, each as defined and described in the credit agreement. we were in compliance with all applicable covenants under these arrangements as of december 31, 2019.
see part iv-note 15, financing arrangements, and note 18, derivative instruments, to the consolidated financial statements.
cash flows our summarized cash flow activity was as follows (in millions):
net cash provided by operating activities                  $9,150                 $11,296             $11,177
net cash provided by (used in) investing activities        $5,709                 $14,339             $(4,024     )
net cash used in financing activities                    $(15,767    )           $(22,490    )        $(6,594     )
operating cash provided by operating activities has been and is expected to continue to be our primary recurring source of funds. cash provided by operating activities decreased during 2019 due primarily to changes in working capital, an increase in payments to the irs related to an advance deposit and lower net income. cash provided by operating activities increased during 2018 due primarily to improvements in working capital, offset partially by higher payments to tax authorities.
investing cash provided by investing activities during 2019 and 2018 was due primarily to net cash inflows related to marketable securities of $20.0 billion and $15.0 billion, respectively. the liquidation of portions of our marketable securities portfolio in 2019 was due primarily to fund the acquisition of otezla® and our investment in beigene and, in 2018, to fund the tender offer to repurchase our common stock. cash used in investing activities during 2017 was due primarily to net cash outflows related to marketable securities of $3.2 billion. capital expenditures were $618 million, $738 million and $664 million in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. we currently estimate 2020 spending on capital projects to be approximately $700 million.
financing cash used in financing activities during 2019 was due primarily to repurchases of our common stock of $7.7 billion, repayments of debt of $4.5 billion and payments of dividends of $3.5 billion. cash used in financing activities during 2018 was due primarily to repurchases of our common stock of $17.8 billion, payments of dividends of $3.5 billion and repayments of debt of $1.1 billion. cash used in financing activities during 2017 was due primarily to payments of dividends of $3.4 billion and repurchases of common stock of $3.2 billion, offset partially by proceeds from issuances of debt, net of repayments, of $71 million.
see part iv-note 15, financing arrangements, and note 16, stockholders' equity, to the consolidated financial statements.
off-balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that are material or reasonably likely to become material to our consolidated financial position or consolidated results of operations.
contractual obligations contractual obligations represent future cash commitments and liabilities under agreements with third parties and exclude contingent liabilities for which we cannot reasonably predict future payment. additionally, the expected timing of payment of the obligations presented below is estimated based on current information. timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the timing of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreed-upon terms or amounts for some obligations.

(1)   long-term debt obligations include future interest payments on our fixed-rate obligations at the contractual coupon rates. to achieve a desired mix of fixed-rate and floating-rate debt, we enter into interest rate swap contracts that effectively convert a fixed-rate interest coupon for certain of our debt issuances to a floating libor-based coupon over the terms of the related hedge contracts. we used an interest rate forward curve as of december 31, 2019, in computing net amounts to be paid or received under our interest rate swap contracts, which resulted in an aggregate net decrease in future interest payments of $309 million. see part iv-note 15, financing arrangements, to the consolidated financial statements.
(2)   long-term debt obligations include future interest payments on our libor-based variable-rate obligations. we used an interest rate forward curve as of december 31, 2019, in computing the libor-based portion of interest payments on these debt obligations. see part iv-note 15, financing arrangements, to the consolidated financial statements.
(3)   long-term debt obligations include contractual interest payments and principal repayments of our foreign-denominated debt obligations. in order to hedge our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with certain of our euro-, pound-sterling- and swiss-franc-denominated long-term debt, we entered into cross-currency swap contracts that effectively converted interest payments and principal repayments on this debt from euros, pounds sterling and swiss francs to u.s. dollars. for purposes of this table, we used the contracted exchange rates in the cross-currency swap contracts to compute the net amounts of future interest payments and principal repayments on this debt. see part iv-note 18, derivative instruments, to the consolidated financial statements.
(4)   operating lease obligations includes payments for leases that have not yet commenced, net of lease incentives, and excludes $141 million of future receipts under noncancelable subleases of abandoned facilities.
(5)   purchase obligations relate primarily to (i) r&amp;d commitments (including those related to clinical trials) for new and existing products, (ii) capital expenditures and (iii) open purchase orders for the acquisition of goods and services in the ordinary course of business. our obligation to pay certain of these amounts may be reduced based on certain future events.
(6)   under the 2017 tax act, we elected to pay in eight annual installments the repatriation tax related primarily to our prior indefinitely invested earnings of our foreign operations. see part iv-note 19, contingencies and commitments-commitments - u.s. repatriation tax, to the consolidated financial statements.
(7)   liabilities for utbs are not included in the table above because due to their nature there is a high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash outflows and other events that extinguish these liabilities. see part iv-note 6, income taxes, to the consolidated financial statements.
in addition to amounts in the table above, we are contractually obligated to pay additional amounts, which in the aggregate are significant, upon the achievement of various development, regulatory and commercial milestones for agreements we have entered into with third parties, including contingent consideration incurred in the acquisitions of k-a and biovex group inc. (biovex). these payments are contingent upon the occurrence of various future events, substantially all of which have a high degree of uncertainty of occurring. these contingent payments have not been included in the table above, and except with respect to the fair value of the contingent consideration obligations, are not recorded on our consolidated balance sheets. as of december 31, 2019, the maximum amount that may be payable in the future for agreements we have entered into with third parties is $7.3 billion, including $325 million of contingent consideration payments in connection with the acquisition of biovex. contingent
consideration with respect to the acquisition of dezima pharma b.v. was excluded due to the discontinuation of the development of amg 899, upon which payments are based. see part iv-note 17, fair value measurement, to the consolidated financial statements.
summary of critical accounting policies the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the notes to the financial statements. some of those judgments can be subjective and complex, and therefore, actual results could differ materially from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
product sales and sales deductions revenue from product sales is recognized upon transfer of control of a product to a customer, generally upon delivery, based on an amount that reflects the consideration to which we expect to be entitled, net of accruals for estimated rebates, wholesaler chargebacks, discounts and other deductions (collectively, sales deductions) and returns established at the time of sale.
we analyze the adequacy of our accruals for sales deductions quarterly. amounts accrued for sales deductions are adjusted when trends or significant events indicate that adjustment is appropriate. accruals are also adjusted to reflect actual results. amounts recorded in accrued liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets for sales deductions were as follows (in millions):
amounts charged against product sales       4,909                6,098                       992              11,999
amounts charged against product sales       6,180                6,926                     1,180              14,286
amounts charged against product sales       6,825                7,090                     1,292              15,207
for the years ended december 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, total sales deductions were 41%, 39% and 35% of gross product sales, respectively. the increase in the total sales deductions balance as of december 31, 2019 compared to december 31, 2018, was driven primarily by the impact of increases in u.s. rebates and to a lesser extent, higher chargebacks. included in the amounts are immaterial net adjustments related to prior-year sales due to changes in estimates. such amounts represent less than 1% of the aggregate sales deductions charged against product sales in the years ended december 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017.
in the united states, we utilize wholesalers as the principal means of distributing our products to healthcare providers such as physicians or their clinics, dialysis centers, hospitals and pharmacies. products we sell in europe are distributed principally to hospitals and/or wholesalers depending on the distribution practice in each country where the products are sold. we monitor the inventory levels of our products at our wholesalers by using data from our wholesalers and other third parties, and we believe wholesaler inventories have been maintained at appropriate levels (generally two to three weeks) given end-user demand. accordingly, historical fluctuations in wholesaler inventory levels have not significantly affected our method of estimating sales deductions and returns.
accruals for sales deductions are based primarily on estimates of the amounts earned or to be claimed on the related sales. these estimates take into consideration current contractual and statutory requirements, specific known market events and trends, internal and external historical data and forecasted customer buying patterns. sales deductions are substantially product specific and therefore, for any given year, can be affected by the mix of products sold.
rebates include primarily amounts paid to payers and providers in the united states, including those paid to state medicaid programs, and are based on contractual arrangements or statutory requirements, which vary by product, by payer and by individual payer plans. as we sell products, we estimate the amount of rebate we will pay based on the product sold, contractual terms, estimated patient population, historical experience and wholesaler inventory levels; and we accrue these rebates in the period the related sales are recorded. we then adjust the rebate accruals as more information becomes available and to reflect actual claims experience. estimating such rebates is complicated, in part because of the time delay between the date of sale and the actual settlement of the liability. we believe the methodology we use to accrue for rebates is reasonable and appropriate given current facts and circumstances, but actual results may differ.
wholesaler chargebacks relate to our contractual agreements to sell products to healthcare providers in the united states at fixed prices that are lower than the prices we charge wholesalers. when healthcare providers purchase our products through wholesalers at these reduced prices, wholesalers charge us for the difference between their purchase prices and the contractual prices between amgen and the healthcare providers. the provision for chargebacks is based on the expected sales by our wholesaler customers to healthcare providers. accruals for wholesaler chargebacks are less difficult to estimate than rebates are, and they closely approximate actual results since chargeback amounts are fixed at the date of purchase by the healthcare providers and because we generally settle the liability for these deductions within a few weeks.
product returns returns are estimated through comparison of historical return data to their related sales on a production lot basis. historical rates of return are determined for each product and are adjusted for known or expected changes in the marketplace specific to each product, when appropriate. in each of the past three years, sales return provisions have amounted to less than 1% of gross product sales. changes in estimates for prior-year sales return provisions have historically been immaterial.
income taxes we provide for income taxes based on pretax income and applicable tax rates in the various jurisdictions in which we operate.
we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the tax authorities based on the technical merits of the position. the tax benefit recognized in the consolidated financial statements for a particular tax position is measured based on the largest benefit that is more likely than not to be realized. the amount of utbs is adjusted as appropriate for changes in facts and circumstances, such as significant amendments to existing tax law, new regulations or interpretations by the tax authorities, new information obtained during a tax examination or resolution of an examination. we believe our estimates for uncertain tax positions are appropriate and sufficient for any assessments that may result from examinations of our tax returns. we recognize both accrued interest and penalties, where appropriate, related to utbs in income tax expense.
certain items are included in our tax return at different times than they are reflected in the financial statements and cause temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts. such temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. deferred tax assets are generally items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years but for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the consolidated financial statements. we establish valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets when the amount of expected future taxable income is not likely to support the use of the deduction or credit. deferred tax liabilities are either (i) tax expenses recognized in the consolidated financial statements for which payment has been deferred, (ii) expenses for which we have already taken a deduction on the tax return but have not yet recognized in the consolidated financial statements or (iii) liabilities for the difference between the book basis and tax basis of the intangible assets acquired in many business combinations, as future expenses associated with these assets most often will not be tax deductible.
we are a vertically-integrated enterprise with operations in the united states and various foreign jurisdictions. we are subject to income tax in the foreign jurisdictions where we conduct operations based on the tax laws and principles of such jurisdictions and the functions, risks and activities performed therein. our pretax income is therefore attributed to domestic or foreign sources based on the operations performed and risks assumed in each location and the tax laws and principles of the respective taxing jurisdictions. for example, we conduct significant operations in puerto rico, a territory of the united states that is treated as a foreign jurisdiction for u.s. tax purposes, pertaining to manufacturing, distribution and other related functions to meet our worldwide product demand. income from our operations in puerto rico is subject to tax incentive grants through 2035.
as previously disclosed, we received an rar from the irs for the years 2010, 2011 and 2012. the rar proposes to make significant adjustments that relate primarily to the allocation of profits between certain of our entities in the united states and the u.s. territory of puerto rico. in november 2017, we received a modified rar that revised the irs's calculation but continued to propose substantial adjustments. we disagree with the proposed adjustments and are pursuing resolution with the irs administrative appeals office, which currently has jurisdiction over the matter. if we deem necessary, we will vigorously contest the proposed adjustments through the judicial process. final resolution of this complex matter is not likely within the next 12 months and could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. we believe our accrual for income tax liabilities is appropriate based on past experience, interpretations of tax law and judgments about potential actions by tax authorities; however, due to the complexity of the provision for income taxes, the ultimate resolution of any tax matters may result in payments substantially greater or less than amounts accrued. see part iv-note 6, income taxes, to the consolidated financial statements.
our operations are subject to the tax laws, regulations and administrative practices of the united states, u.s. state jurisdictions and other countries, including the u.s. territory of puerto rico, in which we do business. significant changes in these rules could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. see part i, item 1a. risk factors-the adoption and interpretation of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities could affect our profitability.
contingencies in the ordinary course of business, we are involved in various legal proceedings, government investigations and other matters such as intellectual property disputes, contractual disputes and class action suits which are complex in nature and have outcomes that are difficult to predict. we describe our legal proceedings and other matters that are significant or that we believe could become significant in part iv-note 19, contingencies and commitments, to the consolidated financial statements. we record accruals for loss contingencies to the extent that we conclude that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the related loss can be reasonably estimated. we evaluate, on a quarterly basis, developments in legal proceedings and other matters that could cause an increase or decrease in the amount of the liability that has been accrued previously.
while it is not possible to accurately predict or determine the eventual outcomes of these items, an adverse determination in one or more of these items currently pending could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.
valuation of assets and liabilities in connection with acquisitions we have acquired and continue to acquire intangible assets in connection with business combinations and asset acquisitions. these intangible assets consist primarily of technology associated with currently marketed human therapeutic products and ipr&d product candidates. discounted cash flow models are typically used to determine the fair values of these intangible assets for purposes of allocating consideration paid to the net assets acquired in an acquisition. see part iv-note 2, acquisitions, to the consolidated financial statements. these models require the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including but not limited to:
•   determining the timing and expected costs to complete in-process projects, taking into account the stage of completion at the acquisition date;
•   projecting the probability and timing of obtaining marketing approval from the fda and other regulatory agencies for product candidates;
•   estimating the timing of and future net cash flows from product sales resulting from completed products and in-process projects; and
•   developing appropriate discount rates to calculate the present values of the cash flows.
significant estimates and assumptions are also required to determine the business combination date fair values of any contingent consideration obligations incurred in connection with business combinations. in addition, we must revalue these obligations each subsequent reporting period until the related contingencies are resolved and record changes in their fair values in earnings. the acquisition date fair values of contingent consideration obligations incurred or assumed in the acquisitions were determined using a combination of valuation techniques. significant estimates and assumptions required for these valuations included but were not limited to the probability of achieving regulatory milestones, product sales projections under various scenarios and discount rates used to calculate the present value of the required payments. these estimates and assumptions are required to be updated in order to revalue these contingent consideration obligations each reporting period. accordingly, subsequent changes in underlying facts and circumstances could result in changes in these estimates and assumptions, which could have a material impact on the estimated future fair values of these obligations.
we believe the fair values used to record intangible assets acquired and contingent consideration obligations incurred in connection with business combinations and assets acquisitions are based on reasonable estimates and assumptions given the facts and circumstances as of the related valuation dates.
impairment of long-lived assets we review the carrying value of our property, plant and equipment and our finite-lived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. if such circumstances exist, an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows to be generated by the long-lived asset is compared to the carrying value to determine whether an impairment exists. if an asset is determined to be impaired, the loss is measured based on the difference between the asset's fair value and its carrying value.
indefinite-lived intangible assets, composed of ipr&d projects acquired in a business combination that have not reached technological feasibility or that lack regulatory approval at the time of acquisition, are reviewed for impairment annually, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable and upon establishment of technological feasibility or regulatory approval. we determine impairment by comparing the fair value of the asset to its carrying value. if the asset's carrying value exceeds its fair value, an impairment charge is recorded for the difference, and its carrying value is reduced accordingly.
estimating future cash flows of an ipr&d product candidate for purposes of an impairment analysis requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions regarding the amount and timing of costs to complete the project and the amount, timing and probability of achieving revenues from the completed product similar to how the acquisition date fair value of the project was determined, as described above. there are often major risks and uncertainties associated with ipr&d projects as we are required to obtain regulatory approvals in order to be able to market these products. such approvals require completing clinical trials that demonstrate a product candidate is safe and effective. consequently, the eventual realized value of the acquired ipr&d project may vary from its fair value at the date of acquisition, and ipr&d impairment charges may occur in future periods which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
we believe our estimations of future cash flows used for assessing impairment of long-lived assets are based on reasonable assumptions given the facts and circumstances as of the related dates of the assessments.

risk factors - "we rely on the value of our brands, and the cost of maintaining and enhancing our brand awareness are increasing" and "our international operations involve additional risks and our exposure to these risks will increase as our business expands globally." lodging lodging includes hotel accommodations and alternative accommodations. as a percentage of our total worldwide revenue in 2019, lodging accounted for 70%. our room night growth has been healthy, with room nights growing 16% in 2017, 13% in 2018, and 11% in 2019. adrs for rooms booked on expedia group websites increased
3% in 2017, 5% in 2018, and decreased 1% in 2019. the decrease in 2019 was primarily due to the negative impact of foreign exchange. more recently, we have seen pressure on a local currency basis on adrs, similar to the recent trends for hotel companies. hotel. we generate the majority of our revenue through the facilitation of hotel reservations (stand-alone and package bookings). although our relationships with our hotel supply partners remained broadly stable in the past few years, as part of the global rollout of etp, we reduced negotiated economics in certain instances to compensate for hotel supply partners absorbing expenses such as credit card fees and customer service costs, which has negatively impacted the margin of revenue we earn per booking. in addition, as we continue to expand the breadth and depth of our global hotel offering, in some cases we have reduced our economics in various geographies based on local market conditions. these impacts are due to specific initiatives intended to drive greater global size and scale through faster overall room night growth. additionally, increased promotional activities such as growing loyalty programs contribute to declines in revenue per room night and profitability.
since our hotel supplier agreements are generally negotiated on a percentage basis, any increase or decrease in adrs has an impact on the revenue we earn per room night. over the course of the last several years, occupancies and adrs in the lodging industry generally increased on a currency-neutral basis in a gradually improving overall travel environment. current occupancy rates for hotels in the united states remain high compared to historical levels; however, u.s. hotel supply has continued to grow, which may put additional pressure on adrs. in addition, macroeconomic factors could also influence adr trends. in some international markets, hotel supply is being added at a faster rate as hotel owners and operators try to take advantage of opportunities in faster growing regions. in addition, the increase in alternative accommodations space could pressure hotel adrs. further, while the global lodging industry remains very fragmented, there has been consolidation in the hotel space among chains as well as ownership groups. in the meantime, certain hotel chains have been focusing on driving direct bookings on their own websites and mobile applications by advertising lower rates than those available on third-party websites as well as incentives such as loyalty points, increased or exclusive product availability and complimentary wi-fi. we have continued to add supply to our global lodging marketplace with nearly 1.6 million properties on our global websites as of december 31, 2019, including over 765,000 integrated vrbo alternative accommodations listings. alternative accommodations. with our acquisition of vrbo (previously homeaway) and all of its brands in december 2015, we expanded into the fast growing alternative accommodations market. vrbo is a leader in this market and represents an attractive growth opportunity for expedia group. vrbo has been undergoing a transition from a listings-based classified advertising model to an online transactional model that optimizes for both travelers and homeowner and property manager partners, with a goal of increasing monetization and driving growth through investments in marketing as well as in product and technology. vrbo offers hosts subscription-based listing or pay-per-booking service models. it also generates revenue from a traveler service fee for bookings. as of december 31, 2019, there are over 2.1 million online bookable listings available on vrbo. in addition, we have actively moved to integrate vrbo listings into our global ota services, as well as directly add 38 table of contents alternative accommodation listings to our offerings, to position our key global brands to offer a full range of lodging options for consumers. air significant airline sector consolidation in the united states in recent years generally resulted in lower overall capacity and higher fares, which combined with the significant declines in fuel prices led to record levels of profitability for the u.s. air carriers, further strengthening their position. however, in 2017 and into
2018, there was evidence of discounting by the u.s. carriers while currency headwinds and weaker macroeconomic trends put pressure on international results. starting in the second half of 2018, there has been evidence of modest fare increases. the airline industry experienced more constrained supply, particularly in the second half of
2019, which was also a factor. it remains unclear if this trend will continue. ticket prices on expedia group websites declined 1% in 2017, increased 2% in 2018, and were flat in 2019. based on airline reports, demand for airline tickets seems to be strong, helping increase air revenue globally. there is significant correlation between airline revenue and fuel prices, and fluctuations in fuel prices generally take time to be reflected in air revenue. given current volatility, it is uncertain how fuel prices could impact airfares. we could encounter pressure on air remuneration as air carriers combine, certain supply agreements renew, and as we continue to add airlines to ensure local coverage in new markets. air ticket volumes increased 4% in 2017, 5% in 2018, and 7% in
2019. as a percentage of our total worldwide revenue in 2019, air accounted for 7%. advertising & media our advertising and media business is principally driven by revenue generated by trivago, a leading hotel metasearch website, in addition to expedia group media solutions, which is responsible for generating advertising revenue on our global online travel brands. in 2019, we generated a total of $1.1 billion of advertising and media revenue, a slight increase from 2018, representing 9% of our total worldwide revenue. in 2018, trivago shifted its operational focus, reducing marketing spend to better balance revenue and profit growth. the lower marketing spend negatively impacted revenue growth, while benefiting profitability. this trend continued in 2019. seasonality we generally experience seasonal fluctuations in the demand for our travel services. for example, traditional leisure travel bookings are generally the highest in the first three quarters as travelers plan and book their spring, summer and winter holiday travel. the number of bookings typically decreases in the fourth quarter. because revenue for most of our travel services, including merchant and agency hotel, is recognized as the travel takes place rather than when it is booked, revenue typically lags bookings by several weeks for our hotel business and can be several months or more for our alternative accommodations business. historically, vrbo has seen seasonally stronger bookings in the first quarter of the year, with the relevant stays occurring during the peak summer travel months.
the seasonal revenue impact is exacerbated with respect to income by the nature of our variable cost of revenue and direct sales and marketing costs, which we typically realize in closer alignment to booking volumes, and the more stable nature of our fixed costs. furthermore, operating profits for our primary advertising business, trivago, have typically been experienced in the second half of the year, particularly the fourth quarter, as selling and marketing costs offset revenue in the first half of the year as we typically increase marketing during the busy booking period for spring, summer and winter holiday travel. as a result on a consolidated basis, revenue and income are typically the lowest in the first quarter and highest in the third quarter. the continued growth of our international operations, advertising business or a change in our product mix, including the growth of vrbo, may influence the typical trend of the seasonality in the future, and there may also be business or market driven dynamics that result in short-term impacts to revenue or profitability that differ from the typical seasonal trends. as vrbo has further shifted to a predominately transaction-based business model for alternative accommodations listings and due to its elongated booking window, its seasonal trends are more pronounced than our other traditional leisure businesses. critical accounting policies and estimates critical accounting policies and estimates are those that we believe are important in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements because they require that we use judgment and estimates in applying those policies. we prepare our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states ("gaap"). preparation of the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements as well as revenue and expenses during the periods reported. we base our estimates on historical experience, where applicable, and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. actual results may differ from our estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 39 table of contents there are certain critical estimates that we believe require significant judgment in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. we consider an accounting estimate to be critical if:
•  it requires us to make an assumption because information was not available at the time or it included matters that were highly uncertain at the time we were making the estimate; and
•  changes in the estimate or different estimates that we could have selected may have had a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations.
for more information on each of these policies, see note 2 - significant accounting policies , in the notes to consolidated financial statements. we discuss information about the nature and rationale for our critical accounting estimates below. accounting for certain merchant revenue we accrue the cost of certain merchant revenue based on the amount we expect to be billed by suppliers. in certain instances when a supplier invoices us for less than the cost we accrued, we generally reduce our merchant accounts payable and the supplier costs within net revenue six months in arrears, net of an allowance, when we determine it is not probable that we will be required to pay the supplier, based on historical experience. actual revenue could be greater or less than the amounts estimated due to changes in hotel billing practices or changes in traveler behavior. deferred loyalty rewards we offer certain internally administered traveler loyalty programs to our customers, such as our hotels.com rewards program, our expedia rewards program and our orbitz rewards program. hotels.com rewards offers travelers one free night at any hotels.com partner property after that traveler stays 10 nights, subject to certain restrictions.
expedia rewards enables participating travelers to earn points on all hotel, flight, package and activities made on over 40 brand expedia websites. orbitz rewards allows travelers to earn orbucks, the currency of orbitz rewards, on flights, hotels and vacation packages and instantly redeem those orbucks on future bookings at various hotels worldwide. as travelers accumulate points towards free travel products, we defer the relative standalone selling price of earned points, net of expected breakage, as deferred loyalty rewards within deferred merchant bookings on the consolidated balance sheet. in order to estimate the standalone selling price of the underlying services on which points can be redeemed for all loyalty programs, we use an adjusted market assessment approach and consider the redemption values expected from the traveler. we then estimate the number of rewards that will not be redeemed based on historical activity in our members' accounts as well as statistical modeling techniques. revenue is recognized when we have satisfied our performance obligation relating to the points, that is when the travel service purchased with the loyalty award is satisfied. both the actual standalone selling price of the underlying services and ultimate redemption rates could differ materially from our estimates due to a number of factors, including fluctuations in reward value, product utilization and divergence from historical member behavior.
business combinations we assign the value of the consideration transferred to acquire a business to the tangible assets and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed on the basis of their fair values at the date of acquisition. any excess purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired is allocated to goodwill. when determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, management makes significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. critical estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from customer relationships and trade names, and discount rates. management's estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates. recoverability of goodwill and indefinite and definite-lived intangible assets goodwill . we assess goodwill for impairment annually as of october 1, or more frequently, if events and circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred. in the evaluation of goodwill for impairment, we typically perform a quantitative assessment and compare the fair value of the reporting unit to the carrying value and, if applicable, record an impairment charge based on the excess of the reporting unit's carrying amount over its fair value. periodically, we may choose to perform a qualitative assessment, prior to performing the quantitative analysis, to determine whether the fair value of the goodwill is more likely than not impaired. we generally base our measurement of fair value of reporting units on a blended analysis of the present value of future discounted cash flows and market valuation approach with the exception of our standalone publicly traded subsidiary, which is based on market valuation. the discounted cash flows model indicates the fair value of the reporting units based on the present 40 table of contents value of the cash flows that we expect the reporting units to generate in the future. our significant estimates in the discounted cash flows model include: our weighted average cost of capital;
long-term rate of growth and profitability of our business; and working capital effects. the market valuation approach indicates the fair value of the business based on a comparison of the company to comparable publicly traded firms in similar lines of business. our significant estimates in the market approach model include identifying similar companies with comparable business factors such as size, growth, profitability, risk and return on investment and assessing comparable revenue and operating income multiples in estimating the fair value of the reporting units. we believe the weighted use of discounted cash flows and market approach is the best method for determining the fair value of our reporting units because these are the most common valuation methodologies used within the travel and internet industries; and the blended use of both models compensates for the inherent risks associated with either model if used on a stand-alone basis. in addition to measuring the fair value of our reporting units as described above, we consider the combined carrying and fair values of our reporting units in relation to the company's total fair value of equity plus debt as of the assessment date. our equity value assumes our fully diluted market capitalization, using either the stock price on the valuation date or the average stock price over a range of dates around the valuation date, plus an estimated acquisition premium which is based on observable transactions of comparable companies. the debt value is based on the highest value expected to be paid to repurchase the debt, which can be fair value, principal or principal plus a premium depending on the terms of each debt instrument. indefinite-lived intangible assets . we base our measurement of fair value of indefinite-
lived intangible assets, which primarily consist of trade name and trademarks, using the relief-from-royalty method. this method assumes that the trade name and trademarks have value to the extent that their owner is relieved of the obligation to pay royalties for the benefits received from them. this method requires us to estimate the future revenue for the related brands, the appropriate royalty rate and the weighted average cost of capital. definite-lived intangible assets. we review the carrying value of long-lived assets or asset groups to be used in operations whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable. factors that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used, a significant adverse change in legal factors or the business climate that could affect the value of the asset, or a significant decline in the observable market value of an asset, among others. if such facts indicate a potential impairment, we would assess the recoverability of an asset group by determining if the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the sum of the projected undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the assets over the remaining economic life of the primary asset in the asset group. if the recoverability test indicates that the carrying value of the asset group is not recoverable, we will estimate the fair value of the asset group using appropriate valuation methodologies, which would typically include an estimate of discounted cash flows. any impairment would be measured as the difference between the asset groups carrying amount and its estimated fair value. the use of different estimates or assumptions in determining the fair value of our goodwill, indefinite-lived and definite-lived intangible assets may result in different values for these assets, which could result in an impairment or, in the period in which an impairment is recognized, could result in a materially different impairment charge. income taxes we record income taxes under the liability method. deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect our estimation of the future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for book and tax purposes. we determine deferred income taxes based on the differences in accounting methods and timing between financial statement and income tax reporting. accordingly, we determine the deferred tax asset or liability for each temporary difference based on the enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when we realize the underlying items of income and expense. we consider many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of our deferred tax assets, including our recent earnings experience by jurisdiction, expectations of future taxable income, and the carryforward periods available to us for tax reporting purposes, as well as other relevant factors. we may establish a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount we believe is more likely than not to be realized. due to inherent complexities arising from the nature of our businesses, future changes in income tax law, tax sharing agreements or variances between our actual and anticipated operating results, we make certain judgments and estimates. therefore, actual income taxes could materially vary from these estimates. we record liabilities to address uncertain tax positions we have taken in previously filed tax returns or that we expect to take in a future tax return. the determination for required liabilities is based upon an analysis of each individual tax position, taking into consideration whether it is more likely than not that our tax position, based on technical merits, will be sustained upon examination. for those positions for which we conclude it is more likely than not it will be sustained, we recognize the 41 table of contents largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the taxing authority. the difference between the amount recognized and the total tax position is recorded as a liability. the ultimate resolution of these tax positions may be greater or less than the liabilities recorded. other long-term liabilities various legal and tax contingencies . we record liabilities to address potential exposures related to business and tax positions we have taken that have been or could be challenged by taxing authorities. in addition, we record liabilities associated with legal proceedings and lawsuits. these liabilities are recorded when the likelihood of payment is probable and the amounts can be reasonably estimated. the determination for required liabilities is based upon analysis of each individual tax issue, or legal proceeding, taking into consideration the likelihood of adverse judgments and the range of possible loss. in addition, our analysis may be based on discussions with outside legal counsel. the ultimate resolution of these potential tax exposures and legal proceedings may be greater or less than the liabilities recorded. occupancy and other taxes . some states and localities impose taxes (e.g. transient occupancy, accommodation tax, sales tax and/or business privilege tax) on the use or occupancy of hotel accommodations or other traveler services. generally, hotels collect taxes based on the rate paid to the hotel and remit these taxes to the various tax authorities. when a customer books a room through one of our travel services, we collect a tax recovery charge from the customer which we pay to the hotel.
we calculate the tax recovery charge by applying the applicable tax rate supplied to us by the hotels to the amount that the hotel has agreed to receive for the rental of the room by the consumer. in most jurisdictions, we do not collect or remit taxes, nor do we pay taxes to the hotel operator, on the portion of the customer payment we retain. some jurisdictions have questioned our practice in this regard. while the applicable tax provisions vary among the jurisdictions, we generally believe that we are not required to pay such taxes. more recently, a limited number of taxing jurisdictions have made similar claims against vrbo for tax amounts due on the rental amounts charged by owners of alternative accommodations properties or for taxes on vrbo's services. vrbo is an intermediary between a traveler and a party renting an alternative accommodations property and we believe is similarly not liable for such taxes. we are engaged in discussions with tax authorities in various jurisdictions to resolve these issues. some tax authorities have brought lawsuits or have levied assessments asserting that we are required to collect and remit tax. the ultimate resolution in all jurisdictions cannot be determined at this time. certain jurisdictions may require us to pay tax assessments, including occupancy and other transactional tax assessments, prior to contesting any such assessments. we have established a reserve for the potential settlement of issues related to hotel occupancy and other tax litigation for prior and current periods, consistent with applicable accounting principles and in light of all current facts and circumstances. a variety of factors could affect the amount of the liability (both past and future), which factors include, but are not limited to, the number of, and amount of revenue represented by, jurisdictions that ultimately assert a claim and prevail in assessing such additional tax or negotiate a settlement and changes in relevant statutes. we note that there are more than 10,000
taxing jurisdictions in the united states, and it is not feasible to analyze the statutes, regulations and judicial and administrative rulings in every jurisdiction. rather, we have obtained the advice of state and local tax experts with respect to tax laws of certain states and local jurisdictions that represent a large portion of our hotel revenue. many of the statutes and regulations that impose these taxes were established before the emergence of the internet and ecommerce. certain jurisdictions have enacted, and others may enact, legislation regarding the imposition of taxes on businesses that arrange the booking of hotel or alternative accommodations. we continue to work with the relevant tax authorities and legislators to clarify our obligations under new and emerging laws and regulations. we will continue to monitor the issue closely and provide additional disclosure, as well as adjust the level of reserves, as developments warrant. additionally, certain of our businesses are involved in tax related litigation, which is discussed in part i, item 3, legal proceedings. recent occupancy tax developments are also discussed below under the caption "occupancy and other taxes." stock-based compensation historically, our primary form of employee stock-based compensation was stock option awards. our employee stock options consist of service based awards, some of which also have market-based vesting conditions. we measure the value of stock option awards on the date of grant at fair value using the appropriate valuation techniques, including the black-scholes and monte carlo option-pricing models, for awards that contain market-based vesting conditions. we amortize the fair value over the remaining explicit vesting term in the case of service-based awards and the longer of the derived service period or the explicit service period for awards with market conditions, on a straight-line basis. we account for forfeitures as they occur. the pricing models require various highly judgmental assumptions including volatility and expected option term. if any of the assumptions used in the models change significantly, stock-based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period. 42 table of contents new accounting pronouncements for a discussion of new accounting pronouncements, see note 2 - significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements. occupancy and other taxes we are currently involved in ten lawsuits brought by or against states, cities and counties over issues involving the payment of hotel occupancy and other taxes. we continue to defend these lawsuits vigorously. with respect to the principal claims in these matters, we believe that the statutes and/or ordinances at issue do not apply to us or the services we provide and, therefore, that we do not owe the taxes that are claimed to be owed. we believe that the statutes and ordinances at issue generally impose occupancy and other taxes on entities that own, operate or control hotels
(or similar businesses) or furnish or provide hotel rooms or other accommodations. recent developments include:

play payment or litigation loss could negatively impact our liquidity. for additional information, see note 17 -

the increase in worldwide gross bookings in 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily due to growth in the core ota segment, including growth at expedia partner solutions, which includes the benefit from enterprise deals launched in late 2018, and hotels.com. 44 table of contents results of operations revenue year ended december

lodging revenue increased 10% in 2019 on an 11% increase in room nights stayed driven by growth in hotels.com, expedia partner solutions and brand expedia, partially offset by a 1% decrease in revenue per room night. air revenue decreased 1% in 2019 on an 8% decrease in revenue per ticket, mostly offset by a 7% increase in air tickets sold. the decrease in revenue per ticket was primarily related to changes in classification of certain fees, a shift in product mix and a negative impact from foreign exchange. the increase in air tickets sold was driven by growth at expedia partner solutions, largely related to enterprise deals launched in late 2018. advertising and media revenue increased 1% in 2019 due to growth at expedia group media solutions, largely offset by declines in local currency revenue at trivago as well as negative impacts from foreign exchange. all other revenue, which includes car rental, insurance, destination services, fees related to our corporate travel business and revenue related to bodybuilding.com, increased by 6% in 2019 benefiting from the inorganic impact related to the acquisition of bodybuilding.com and the reclassification of certain partner fees from air revenue. in addition to the above segment and product revenue discussion, our revenue by business model is as follows:

rate our effective tax rate for 2019 was higher than the 21% federal statutory income tax rate due to state income taxes, foreign income taxed at higher than the federal statutory tax rate, as well as losses in foreign jurisdictions for which we do not record a tax benefit. our effective tax rate for 2018 was lower than the 21%
federal statutory rate primarily due to earnings in foreign jurisdictions outside of the united states, predominately switzerland, where our statutory income tax rate is lower, as well as excess tax benefits related to stock-based payments and foreign-derived intangible income ("fdii"). the increase in our effective tax rate for
2019 compared to 2018 was due to an increase in u.s. federal and state taxable income as a result of an internal reorganization. we are subject to taxation in the united states and various other state and foreign jurisdictions.
during 2017, the internal revenue service ("irs") issued proposed adjustments related to transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries for our 2009 to 49 table of contents 2010 audit cycle. on july 12, 2019, we settled the audit for an immaterial impact to the consolidated financial statements. in addition, we are under examination by the irs for our 2011 through 2013 tax years. during the fourth quarter of 2019, the irs issued final adjustments related to transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries for our 2011 to 2013 audit cycle. the proposed adjustments would increase our u.s. taxable income by $696 million, which would result in federal tax of approximately $244 million subject to interest. we do not agree with the position of the irs and are formally protesting the irs position.
subsequent years remain open to examination by the irs. we do not anticipate a significant impact to our gross unrecognized tax benefits within the next 12 months related to these years. for additional information including additional information on the impacts of the tax act, see note 11 - income taxes in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. definition and reconciliation of adjusted ebitda we report adjusted ebitda as a supplemental measure to u.s. generally accepted accounting principles ("gaap"). adjusted ebitda is among the primary metrics by which management evaluates the performance of the business and on which internal budgets are based. management believes that investors should have access to the same set of tools that management uses to analyze our results.
this non-gaap measure should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with gaap, but should not be considered a substitute for or superior to gaap. adjusted ebitda has certain limitations in that it does not take into account the impact of certain expenses to our consolidated statements of operations. we endeavor to compensate for the limitation of the non-gaap measure presented by also providing the most directly comparable gaap measure and a description of the reconciling items and adjustments to derive the non-gaap measure. adjusted ebitda also excludes certain items related to transactional tax matters, which may ultimately be settled in cash, and we urge investors to review the detailed disclosure regarding these matters included above, in the legal proceedings section, as well as the notes to the financial statements. the non-gaap financial measure used by the company may be calculated differently from, and therefore may not be comparable to, similarly titled measures used by other companies. adjusted ebitda is defined as net income (loss) attributable to expedia group, inc. adjusted for (1) net income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interests; (2) provision for income taxes; (3) total other expenses, net; (4) stock-based compensation expense, including compensation expense related to certain subsidiary equity plans; (5) acquisition-related impacts, including (i) amortization of intangible assets and goodwill and intangible asset impairment, (ii) gains (losses) recognized on changes in the value of contingent consideration arrangements, if any, and (iii) upfront consideration paid to settle employee compensation plans of the acquiree, if any; (6)
certain other items, including restructuring; (7) items included in legal reserves, occupancy tax and other; (8)
that portion of gains (losses) on revenue hedging activities that are included in other, net that relate to revenue recognized in the period; and (9) depreciation. the above items are excluded from our adjusted ebitda measure because these items are noncash in nature, or because the amount and timing of these items is unpredictable, not driven by core operating results and renders comparisons with prior periods and competitors less meaningful. we believe adjusted ebitda is a useful measure for analysts and investors to evaluate our future on-going performance as this measure allows a more meaningful comparison of our performance and projected cash earnings with our historical results from prior periods and to the results of our competitors. moreover, our management uses this measure internally to evaluate the performance of our business as a whole and our individual business segments. in addition, we believe that by excluding certain items, such as stock-based compensation and acquisition-related impacts, adjusted ebitda corresponds more closely to the cash operating income generated from our business and allows investors to gain an understanding of the factors and trends affecting the ongoing cash earnings capabilities of our business, from which capital investments are made and debt is serviced. 50 table of contents the reconciliation of net income attributable to expedia group, inc. to adjusted ebitda is as follows:

and bear interest at 3.25% (the "3.25% notes"). the 3.25% notes were issued at 99.225% of par resulting in a discount, which is being amortized over their life. interest is payable semi-annually in arrears in february and august of each year, beginning february 15, 2020. we used or expect to use the net proceeds of this offering for general corporate purposes, which may include, but are not limited to, the repayment, prepayment, redemption or repurchase of our indebtedness (including, but not limited to, our 5.95% senior notes due 2020) as well as working capital, capital expenditures and acquisitions. as of december 31, 2019 , we maintained a $2 billion revolving credit facility with a may 2023 maturity date. interest is payable under the facility based on the company's credit ratings with the applicable interest rate on drawn amounts at libor plus 112.5 basis points and the commitment fee on undrawn amounts at 15 basis points as of december 31, 2019 . the facility contains various restrictive covenants, including a maximum permissible leverage ratio and a minimum permissible interest coverage ratio. as of december 31, 2019 , the maximum permissible leverage ratio and the minimum interest coverage were 4.00 to 1.00 and
2.75 to 1.00, respectively. our credit ratings are periodically reviewed by rating agencies. as of december 31,
2019 , moody's rating was baa3 with an outlook of "positive," which was upgraded during the third quarter of 2019
from ba1 in connection with the closing of the liberty expedia transaction, s&p's rating was bbb with an outlook of
"watch negative" and fitch's rating was bbb with an outlook of "stable." changes in our operating results, cash flows, financial position, capital structure, financial policy or capital allocations to share repurchase, dividends, investments and acquisitions could impact the ratings assigned by the various rating agencies. should our credit ratings be adjusted downward, we may incur higher costs to borrow and/or limited to access to capital markets, which could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations. 51 table of contents as of december 31, 2019 , we were in compliance with the covenants and conditions in our revolving credit facility and outstanding debt, which was comprised of $750 million in registered senior unsecured notes due in august 2020 that bear interest at 5.95% (the "5.95% notes"), $500 million in registered senior unsecured notes due in august 2024 that bear interest at 4.5% (the "4.5% notes"), euro 650 million of registered senior unsecured notes due in june 2022 that bear interest at 2.5% (the "2.5% notes"), $750 million of registered senior unsecured notes due in february 2026 that bear interest at 5.0% ("the 5.0% notes") and the $1 billion of registered senior unsecured notes due in february 2028 that bear interest at 3.8% ("the 3.8% notes") and the 3.25% notes. under the merchant model, we receive cash from travelers at the time of booking and we record these amounts on our consolidated balance sheets as deferred merchant bookings. we pay our airline suppliers related to these merchant model bookings generally within a few weeks after completing the transaction, but we are liable for the full value of such transactions until the flights are completed. for most other merchant bookings, which is primarily our merchant lodging business, we generally pay after the travelers' use and, in some cases, subsequent to billing from the hotel suppliers. therefore, generally we receive cash from the traveler prior to paying our supplier, and this operating cycle represents a working capital source of cash to us. as long as the merchant hotel business grows, we expect that changes in working capital related to merchant hotel transactions will positively impact operating cash flows. however, we are using both the merchant model and the agency model in many of our markets. if the merchant hotel model declines relative to our other business models that generally consume working capital such as agency hotel, managed corporate travel, advertising or certain expedia partner solutions relationships, or if there are changes to the merchant model, supplier payment terms, including programs where we remit payment to suppliers in advance of the travelers stay, or booking patterns that compress the time period between our receipt of cash from travelers and our payment to suppliers, our overall working capital benefits could be reduced, eliminated or even reversed. our future working capital benefits could also be impacted by vrbo's continued shift to become the merchant of record on more of its transactions. seasonal fluctuations in our merchant hotel bookings affect the timing of our annual cash flows. during the first half of the year, hotel bookings have traditionally exceeded stays, resulting in much higher cash flow related to working capital. during the second half of the year, this pattern reverses and cash flows are typically negative. while we expect the impact of seasonal fluctuations to continue, merchant hotel growth rates, changes to the model or booking patterns, changes in the relative mix of merchant hotel transactions compared with transactions in our working capital consuming businesses, including etp, as well as the transformation of the vrbo's alternative accommodation listing business, may counteract or intensify the anticipated seasonal fluctuations. as of december 31, 2019 , we had a deficit in our working capital of $3.0
billion , compared to a deficit of $2.9 billion as of december 31, 2018 . we will continue to invest in capital at similar to increasing levels over time to improve our technology platforms, infrastructure, operational capabilities, and in the development of service offerings and expansion of our operations. in addition to the capital requirements in support of our business strategy, our future capital requirements may also include capital needs for acquisitions (including purchases of non-controlling interest), share repurchases, or dividend payments among others; thus reducing our cash balance and/or increasing our debt. for the new headquarters, we expect to spend approximately $900 million. of the total, approximately $290 million was spent between 2016 and 2018, and approximately $390 million was spent during 2019. during full year 2020, we expect to spend approximately $220

$186 million cash dividend payment, partially offset by $166 million of proceeds from the exercise of options and employee stock purchase plans. during 2019, 2012, 2010, and 2006, our board of directors, or the executive committee, acting on behalf of the board of directors, authorized a repurchase of up to 20 million outstanding shares of our common stock in each of the respective years, during 2018 authorized a repurchase of up to 15 million shares of our common stock and during 2015 authorized a repurchase of up to 10 million shares of our common stock for a total of 105 million shares. shares repurchased under the authorized programs were as follows:
(1)  amount excludes transaction costs.
as of december 31, 2019 , 26.7 million shares remain authorized for repurchase under the 2018 authorization with no fixed termination date for the repurchases. subsequent to december 31, 2019 , we repurchased an additional 3.4
million shares for a total cost of $370 million , excluding transaction costs, representing an average purchase price of $109.88 per share. our common stock dividend was $1.32 per share for 2019 , $1.24 per share for 2018 and
$1.16 per share for 2017 . see note 13 - stockholders' equity in the notes to consolidated financial statements for a detail of the quarterly dividend payments by year. in addition, in february 2020 , the executive committee, acting on behalf of the board of directors, declared a quarterly cash dividend of $ 0.34 per share of outstanding common stock payable on march 26, 2020 to the stockholders of record as of the close of business on march 10, 2020
. future declarations of dividends are subject to final determination by our board of directors. foreign exchange rate changes resulted in immaterial increases of our cash balances denominated in foreign currency in 2019 of $3
million . foreign exchange rate changes resulted in a reduction of our cash balances denominated in foreign currency in 2018 of $139 million reflecting net depreciations in foreign currencies during 2018 . in our opinion, available cash, funds from operations and available borrowings will provide sufficient capital resources to meet our foreseeable liquidity needs. there can be no assurance, however, that the cost of availability of future borrowings, including refinancing, if any, will be available on terms acceptable to us. 53 table of contents contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following table presents our material contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of december 31, 2019 :

(see "foreign exchange risk" below for further discussion or our 2.5% notes.) in december 2015, we issued $750 million of senior unsecured notes with a fixed rate of 5.0%. in september 2017, we issued $1 billion of senior unsecured notes with a fixed rate of 3.8%. in september 2019, we issued $1.25 billion of senior unsecured notes with a fixed rate of 3.25%. as a result, if market interest rates decline, our required payments will exceed those based on market rates. the fair values of our 5.95% notes, 2.5% notes, 4.5% notes, 5.0% notes, 3.8% notes, and 3.25% notes were approximately $767
million , $764 million , $536 million , $825 million , $1.02 billion , $1.21 billion and as of december 31, 2019 as calculated based on quoted market prices in less active markets at year end. a 50 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would decrease or increase the fair value of our 5.95% notes by approximately $2 million, our
million. we maintain a $2 billion revolving credit facility, which bears interest based on market rates plus a spread determined by our credit ratings. because our interest rate is tied to a market rate, we will be susceptible to fluctuations in interest rates if, consistent with our practice to date, we do not hedge the interest rate exposure arising from any borrowings under our revolving credit facility. as of december 31, 2019 and 2018 , we had no revolving credit facility borrowings outstanding. we did not experience any significant impact from changes in interest rates for the years ended december 31, 2019 , 2018 or 2017 . foreign exchange risk we conduct business in certain international markets, primarily in australia, canada, china and the european union. because we operate in international markets, we have exposure to different economic climates, political arenas, tax systems and regulations that could affect foreign exchange rates. our primary exposure to foreign currency risk relates to transacting in foreign currency and recording the activity in u.s. dollars. changes in exchange rates between the u.s. dollar and these other currencies will result in transaction gains or losses, which we recognize in our consolidated statements of operations. to the extent practicable, we minimize our foreign currency exposures by maintaining natural hedges between our current assets and current liabilities in similarly denominated foreign currencies. additionally, we use foreign currency forward contracts to economically hedge certain merchant revenue exposures, foreign denominated liabilities related to certain of our loyalty programs and our other foreign currency-denominated operating liabilities. these instruments are typically short-term and are recorded at fair value with gains and losses recorded in other, net. as of december 31, 2019 and 2018 , we had a net forward liability of $8 million included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities and a net forward asset of $22
million included in prepaid expenses and other current assets. we may enter into additional foreign exchange derivative contracts or other economic hedges in the future. our goal in managing our foreign exchange risk is to reduce to the extent practicable our potential exposure to the changes that exchange rates might have on our earnings, cash flows and financial position. we make a number of estimates in conducting hedging activities including in some cases the level of future bookings, cancellations, refunds, customer stay patterns and payments in foreign currencies. in the event those estimates differ significantly from actual results, we could experience greater volatility as a result of our hedges. in june 2015, we issued euro 650 million of registered senior unsecured notes that are due in june 2022 and bear interest at 2.5%. the aggregate principal value of the 2.5%
notes is designated as a hedge of our net investment in certain euro functional currency subsidiaries. the notes are measured at euro to u.s. dollar exchange rates at each balance sheet date and transaction gains or losses due to changes in rates are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). the euro-denominated net assets of these subsidiaries are translated into u.s. dollars at each balance sheet date, with effects of foreign currency changes also reported in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). since the notional amount of the recorded euro-denominated debt is less than the notional amount of our net investment, we do not expect to incur any ineffectiveness on this hedge. future net transaction gains and losses are inherently difficult to predict as they are reliant on how the multiple currencies in which we transact fluctuate in relation to the u.s. dollar, the relative composition and denomination of current assets and liabilities each period, and our effectiveness at forecasting and managing, through balance sheet netting or the use of derivative contracts, such exposures. as an example, if the foreign currencies in which we hold net asset balances were to all weaken 10% against the u.s.
dollar and foreign currencies in which we hold net liability balances were to all strengthen 10% against the u.s.
dollar, we would recognize foreign exchange losses of approximately $29 million based on our foreign currency forward positions (including the impact of forward positions economically hedging our merchant revenue exposures)
and the net asset or liability balances of our foreign denominated cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, deferred merchant bookings 55 table of contents and merchant accounts payable balances as of december 31, 2019 . as the net composition of these balances fluctuate frequently, even daily, as do foreign exchange rates, the example loss could be compounded or reduced significantly within a given period. during 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , we recorded net foreign exchange rate losses of approximately $34 million ( $34 million loss excluding the contracts economically hedging our forecasted merchant revenue), net foreign exchange rate gains of approximately $3 million
( $38 million loss excluding the contracts economically hedging our forecasted merchant revenue) and net foreign exchange rate losses of approximately $46 million ( $40 million loss excluding the contracts economically hedging our forecasted merchant revenue). as we increase our operations in international markets, our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates increases. the economic impact to us of foreign currency exchange rate movements is linked to variability in real growth, inflation, interest rates, governmental actions and other factors. these changes, if material, could cause us to adjust our financing and operating strategies. part ii. item

our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. we believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. critical audit matter the critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. the communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. f- 2 table of contents loyalty programs as discussed in note 2 of the financial statements, travelers enrolled in the expedia rewards and hotels.com rewards loyalty programs (collectively "loyalty programs") earn reward points with each eligible booking made which can be redeemed for free or discounted future bookings. member consideration is allocated between travel services and reward points earned in the loyalty programs. the company defers the relative standalone selling price of earned reward points, net of rewards not expected to be redeemed
(known as "breakage"), as deferred loyalty rewards within deferred merchant bookings on the consolidated balance sheet. in order to estimate the relative standalone selling price for reward points, the company considers the stated redemption value per point dictated by the terms of the loyalty programs and then estimates the future breakage of reward points based on statistical modeling description of the matter                   techniques using historical member activity. the deferred loyalty rewards balance, net of amounts paid to the travel suppler, is recognized as revenue when the travel service purchased with the loyalty reward is satisfied.
auditing the company's deferred loyalty rewards balance is especially complex and judgmental due to significant measurement uncertainty in determining the expected future breakage of reward points. management uses statistical modeling techniques to estimate future breakage based on historical member activity. the amount of member consideration allocated to the reward points earned is sensitive to the expected future breakage assumption. changes in loyalty program terms or the method or manner in which reward points can be redeemed by members can change member behavior which increases the measurement uncertainty as historical member activity may not be indicative of future behavior.
we obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over management's review of the statistical modeling techniques and resulting breakage estimates.
we also tested controls over the completeness and accuracy of member activity data used in the breakage estimate analyses. this included controls over the company's systems and the application controls involved in the process to track loyalty reward member activity.
how we addressed the matter in our audit    to test the deferred loyalty rewards balance, we performed audit procedures that included, among others, involving our actuarial specialists to assist us in assessing the methods used by management and to develop an independent actuarial estimate of a reasonable range of breakage rates. we then compared this reasonable range of breakage rates to the company's estimates.
additionally, we tested the completeness and accuracy of the member activity data used by our actuarial specialists in their breakage analyses.

f- 9 table of contents expedia group, inc. notes to consolidated financial statements note 1 - organization and basis of presentation description of business expedia group, inc. and its subsidiaries provide travel products and services to leisure and corporate travelers in the united states and abroad as well as various media and advertising offerings to travel and non-travel advertisers. these travel products and services are offered through a diversified portfolio of brands including: brand expedia®, hotels.com®, expedia® partner solutions, vrbo®, egencia®, trivago®, homeaway®, orbitz®, travelocity®, hotwire®, wotif®, ebookers®, cheaptickets®, expedia grouptm media solutions, expedia local expert®, carrentals.comtm, expedia® cruiseshipcenters®, classic vacations®, traveldoo®, vacationrentals.com and silverrailtm. in addition, many of these brands have related international points of sale. in the first quarter of 2019, we renamed the homeaway segment vrbo. we refer to expedia group, inc.
and its subsidiaries collectively as "expedia group," the "company," "us," "we" and "our" in these consolidated financial statements. basis of presentation the accompanying consolidated financial statements include expedia group, inc., our wholly-owned subsidiaries, and entities we control, or in which we have a variable interest and are the primary beneficiary of expected cash profits or losses. we record our investments in entities that we do not control, but over which we have the ability to exercise significant influence, using the equity method. we have eliminated significant intercompany transactions and accounts. we believe that the assumptions underlying our consolidated financial statements are reasonable. however, these consolidated financial statements do not present our future financial position, the results of our future operations and cash flows. seasonality we generally experience seasonal fluctuations in the demand for our travel services. for example, traditional leisure travel bookings are generally the highest in the first three quarters as travelers plan and book their spring, summer and winter holiday travel. the number of bookings typically decreases in the fourth quarter. because revenue for most of our travel services, including merchant and agency hotel, is recognized as the travel takes place rather than when it is booked, revenue typically lags bookings by several weeks for our hotel business and can be several months or more for our alternative accommodations business. historically, vrbo has seen seasonally stronger bookings in the first quarter of the year, with the relevant stays occurring during the peak summer travel months.
the seasonal revenue impact is exacerbated with respect to income by the nature of our variable cost of revenue and direct sales and marketing costs, which we typically realize in closer alignment to booking volumes, and the more stable nature of our fixed costs. furthermore, operating profits for our primary advertising business, trivago, have typically been experienced in the second half of the year, particularly the fourth quarter, as selling and marketing costs offset revenue in the first half of the year as we typically increase marketing during the busy booking period for spring, summer and winter holiday travel. as a result on a consolidated basis, revenue and income are typically the lowest in the first quarter and highest in the third quarter. the continued growth of our international operations, advertising business or a change in our product mix, including the growth of vrbo, may influence the typical trend of the seasonality in the future, and there may also be business or market driven dynamics that result in short-term impacts to revenue or profitability that differ from the typical seasonal trends. note 2 - significant accounting policies consolidation our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of expedia group, inc., our wholly-owned subsidiaries, and entities for which we control a majority of the entity's outstanding common stock. we record non-controlling interest in our consolidated financial statements to recognize the minority ownership interest in our consolidated subsidiaries. non-controlling interest in the earnings and losses of consolidated subsidiaries represent the share of net income or loss allocated to members or partners in our consolidated entities, which includes the non-controlling interest share of net income or loss from our redeemable and non-redeemable non-controlling interest entities. trivago is a separately listed company on the nasdaq global select market and, therefore, is subject to its own reporting and filing requirements, which could result in possible differences that are not expected to be material to expedia group, inc. we have eliminated significant intercompany transactions and accounts in our consolidated financial statements. f- 10 table of contents accounting estimates we use estimates and assumptions in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states ("gaap"). our estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of our consolidated financial statements. these estimates and assumptions also affect the reported amount of net income or loss during any period. our actual financial results could differ significantly from these estimates. the significant estimates underlying our consolidated financial statements include revenue recognition; recoverability of current and long-lived assets, intangible assets and goodwill;
income and transactional taxes, such as potential settlements related to occupancy and excise taxes; loss contingencies; deferred loyalty rewards; acquisition purchase price allocations; stock-based compensation and accounting for derivative instruments. reclassifications we have reclassified certain amounts related to our prior period results to conform to our current period presentation. revenue recognition we recognize revenue upon transfer of control of our promised services in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those services. for our primary transaction-based revenue sources, discussed below, we have determined net presentation (that is, the amount billed to a traveler less the amount paid to a supplier) is appropriate for the majority of our revenue transactions as the supplier is primarily responsible for providing the underlying travel services and we do not control the service provided by the supplier to the traveler. we exclude all taxes assessed by a government authority, if any, from the measurement of transaction prices that are imposed on our travel related services or collected by the company from customers (which are therefore excluded from revenue). we offer traditional travel services on a stand-alone and package basis generally either through the merchant or the agency business model. under the merchant model, we facilitate the booking of hotel rooms, alternative accommodations, airline seats, car rentals and destination services from our travel suppliers and we are the merchant of record for such bookings. under the agency model, we pass reservations booked by the traveler to the relevant travel supplier and the travel supplier serves as the merchant of record for such bookings. we receive commissions or ticketing fees from the travel supplier and/or traveler. for certain agency airline, hotel and car transactions, we also receive fees through global distribution systems ("gds") that provide the computer systems through which the travel supplier inventory is made available and through which reservations are booked.
under the advertising model, we offer travel and non-travel advertisers access to a potential source of incremental traffic and transactions through our various media and advertising offerings on trivago and our transaction-based websites. our vrbo business facilitates alternative accommodation bookings, earning per transaction commissions, traveler service fees or a combination, and provides subscription-based listing and other ancillary services to property owners and managers. the nature of our travel booking service performance obligations vary based on the travel service with differences primarily related to the degree to which we provide post booking services to the traveler and the timing when rights and obligations are triggered in our underlying supplier agreements. we consider both the traveler and travel supplier as our customers. refer to note 20 - segment information for revenue by business model and service type. lodging. our lodging revenue is comprised of revenue recognized under the merchant, agency and vrbo business models. merchant hotel. we provide travelers access to book hotel room reservations through our contracts with lodging suppliers, which provide us with rates and availability information for rooms but for which we have no control over the rooms and do not bear inventory risk. our travelers pay us for merchant hotel transactions prior to departing on their trip, generally when they book the reservation. we record the payment in deferred merchant bookings until the stayed night occurs, at which point we recognize the revenue, net of amounts paid to suppliers, as this is when our performance obligation is satisfied. in certain nonrefundable, nonchangeable transactions where we have no significant post booking services (primarily opaque hotel offerings), we record revenue when the traveler completes the transaction on our website, less a reserve for chargebacks and cancellations based on historical experience. payments to suppliers are generally due within 30
days of check-in or stay. in certain instances when a supplier invoices us for less than the cost we accrued, we generally reduce our merchant accounts payable and the supplier costs within net revenue six months in arrears, net of an allowance, when we determine it is not probable that we will be required to pay the supplier, based on historical experience. cancellation fees are collected and remitted to the supplier, if applicable. f- 11 table of contents agency hotel. we generally record agency revenue from the hotel when the stayed night occurs as we provide post booking services to the traveler and, thus consider the stay as when our performance obligation is satisfied.
we record an allowance for cancellations on this revenue based on historical experience. vrbo. vrbo's lodging revenue is generally earned on a pay-per-booking or pay-per-subscription basis. pay-per-booking arrangements are commission-based where rental property owners and managers bear the inventory risk, have latitude in setting the price and compensate vrbo for facilitating bookings with travelers. under pay-per-booking arrangements, each booking is a separate contract as listings are typically cancelable at any time and the related revenue, net of amounts paid to property owners, is recognized at check in, which is the point in time when our service to the traveler is complete. in pay-per-subscription contracts, property owners or managers purchase in advance online advertising services related to the listing of their properties for rent over a fixed term (typically one year). as the performance obligation is the listing service and is provided to the property owner or manager over the life of the listing period, the pay-per-subscription revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the listing period. vrbo also charges a traveler service fee at the time of booking. the service fee charged to travelers provides compensation for vrbo's services, including but not limited to the use of vrbo's website and a "book with confidence guarantee" providing travelers with comprehensive payment protection and 24/7 traveler support. the performance obligation is to facilitate the booking of a property and assist travelers up to their check in process and, as such, the traveler service fee revenue is recognized at check-in. revenue from other ancillary alternative accommodation services or products are recorded either upon delivery or when we provide the service. merchant and agency air. we record revenue on air transactions when the traveler books the transaction, as we do not provide significant post booking services to the traveler and payments due to and from air carriers are typically due at the time of ticketing. we record a reserve for chargebacks and cancellations at the time of the transaction based on historical experience. in certain transactions, the gds collects commissions from our suppliers and passes these commissions to us, net of their fees. therefore, we view payments through the gds as commissions from suppliers and record these commissions in net revenue. fees paid to the gds as compensation for their role in processing transactions are recorded as cost of revenue. advertising and media . we record revenue from click-through fees charged to our travel partners for leads sent to the travel partners' websites. we record revenue from click-
through fees after the traveler makes the click-through to the related travel partners' websites. we record revenue for advertising placements ratably over the advertising period or upon delivery of advertising impressions, depending on the terms of the contract. payments from advertisers are generally due within 30 days of invoicing.
other. other primarily includes transaction revenue for booking services related to products such as car, cruise and destination services under the agency business model. we generally record the related revenue when the travel occurs, as in most cases we provide post booking services and this is when our performance obligation is complete.
additionally, no rights or obligations are triggered in our supplier agreements until the travel occurs. we record an allowance for cancellations on this revenue based on historical experience. in addition, other also includes travel insurance products primarily under the merchant model, for which revenue is recorded at the time the transaction is booked. packages. packages assembled by travelers through the packaging functionality on our websites generally include a merchant hotel component and some combination of an air, car or destination services component. the individual package components are accounted for as separate performance obligations and recognized in accordance with our revenue recognition policies stated above. prepaid merchant bookings. we classify payments made to suppliers in advance of our performance obligations as prepaid merchant bookings included within prepaid and other current assets. prepaid merchant bookings was $ 226million as of december 31, 2019 and $ 26million as of december 31, 2018. deferred merchant bookings. we classify cash payments received in advance of our performance obligations as deferred merchant bookings. at december 31, 2018, $ 3.627billion of cash advance cash payments was reported within deferred merchant bookings, $ 3.309billion of which was recognized resulting in $ 488million of revenue during the year ended december 31, 2019 . at december 31, 2019 , the related balance was $ 4.898billion .
travelers enrolled in our internally administered traveler loyalty rewards programs earn points for each eligible booking made which can be redeemed for free or discounted future bookings. hotels.com rewards offers travelers one free night at any hotels.com partner property after that traveler stays 10 nights, subject to certain restrictions.
expedia rewards enables participating travelers to earn points on all hotel, flight, package and activities made on over 40 brand expedia websites. orbitz rewards allows travelers to earn orbuckssm, the currency of orbitz rewards, on flights, hotels and vacation packages and instantly redeem those orbucks on future bookings at various hotels worldwide. as travelers accumulate points towards free travel products, we defer the relative standalone selling price of earned points, net of expected breakage, as deferred loyalty rewards within deferred merchant bookings on the consolidated balance sheet. in order to estimate the standalone selling price of the underlying services on which points can be redeemed for all loyalty programs, we use an adjusted market assessment approach and consider the redemption values expected from the traveler. we then estimate the number of rewards that will not f- 12 table of contents be redeemed based on historical activity in our members' accounts as well as statistical modeling techniques.
revenue is recognized when we have satisfied our performance obligation relating to the points, that is when the travel service purchased with the loyalty award is satisfied. the majority of rewards expected to be redeemed are recognized within one to two years of being earned. at december 31, 2018, $ 700million of deferred loyalty rewards was reported within deferred merchant bookings, all of which was recognized as revenue during the year ended december 31, 2019 . at december 31, 2019 , the related balance was $ 781million .
deferred revenue. deferred revenue primarily consists of vrbo's traveler service fees received on bookings where we are not merchant of record due to the use of a third party payment processor, unearned subscription revenue as well as deferred advertising revenue. at december 31, 2018, $ 364million was recorded as deferred revenue, $ 326million of which was recognized as revenue during the year ended december 31, 2019 . at december 31, 2019 , the related balance was $ 321million .
practical expedients and exemptions. we have used the portfolio approach to account for our loyalty points as the rewards programs share similar characteristics within each program in relation to the value provided to the traveler and their breakage patterns. using this portfolio approach is not expected to differ materially from applying the guidance to individual contracts. however, we will continue to assess and refine, if necessary, how a portfolio within each rewards program is defined.
we do not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for (i) contracts with an original expected length of one year or less and (ii) contracts for which we recognize revenue at the amount to which we have the right to invoice for services performed.
cash, restricted cash, and cash equivalents our cash and cash equivalents include cash and liquid financial instruments, including money market funds and term deposit investments, with maturities of three months or less when purchased. restricted cash includes cash and cash equivalents that is restricted through legal contracts, regulations or our intention to use the cash for a specific purpose. our restricted cash primarily relates to certain traveler deposits and to a lesser extent collateral for office leases. the following table reconciles cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash reported in our consolidated balance sheets to the total amount presented in our consolidated statements of cash flows:
restricted cash included within                         3           3
long-term investments and other assets total cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash and cash equivalents in  $          4,097    $  2,705
the consolidated statement of cash flow short-term and long-term investments we determine the appropriate classification of our investments in marketable securities at the time of purchase and reevaluate such designation at each balance sheet date. investments, other than minority equity investments, classified as available- for-sale are recorded at fair value with unrealized holding gains and losses recorded, net of tax, as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income ("oci"). realized gains and losses from the sale of available for sale investments, if any, are determined on a specific identification basis. investments with remaining maturities of less than one year are classified within short-term investments. all other investments are classified within long-term investments and other assets.
we record investments using the equity method when we have the ability to exercise significant influence over the investee. as of january 1, 2018, minority equity investments with readily determinable fair values, such as our investment in despegar.com corp ("despegar"), are carried at fair value with changes in fair value recorded through net income. minority investments without readily determinable fair values are measured using the equity method, or measured at cost with observable price changes reflected through net income. we perform a qualitative assessment on a quarterly basis and recognize an impairment if there are sufficient indicators that the fair value of the investment is less than carrying value. changes in value are recorded in other income (expense), net.
accounts receivable accounts receivable are generally due within thirty days and are recorded net of an allowance for doubtful accounts. we consider accounts outstanding longer than the contractual payment terms as past due. we determine our allowance by considering a number of factors, including the length of time trade accounts receivable are past due, previous loss history, a specific customer's ability to pay its obligations to us, and the condition of the general economy and industry as a whole.
f- 13 table of contents property and equipment we record property and equipment at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and amortization. we also capitalize certain costs incurred related to the development of internal use software. we capitalize costs incurred during the application development stage related to the development of internal use software. we expense costs incurred related to the planning and post-implementation phases of development as incurred. we compute depreciation using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which is three to five years for computer equipment, capitalized software development and furniture and other equipment, 15years for land improvements, and 40years for buildings, which includes our new corporate headquarters. land is not depreciated. we amortize leasehold improvement using the straight-line method, over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the improvement or the remaining term of the lease. we establish assets and liabilities for the present value of estimated future costs to return certain of our leased facilities to their original condition under the authoritative accounting guidance for asset retirement obligations. such assets are depreciated over the lease period into operating expense, and the recorded liabilities are accreted to the future value of the estimated restoration costs. leases we determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception. operating leases are primarily for office space and data centers and, as of january 1, 2019 with the adoption of the new guidance for leasing arrangements, are included in operating lease right-of-use ("rou") assets, accrued expenses and other current liabilities, and operating lease liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. rou assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. operating lease rou assets and liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. as most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we use our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. the operating lease rou asset also includes any lease payments made and excludes lease incentives. our lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. lease expense for lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. for operating leases with a term of one year or less, we have elected to not recognize a lease liability or rou asset on our consolidated balance sheet. instead, we recognize the lease payments as expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. short-term lease costs are immaterial to our consolidated statements of operations and cash flows. we have office space and data center lease agreements with insignificant non-lease components and have elected the practical expedient to combine and account for lease and non-lease components as a single lease component. business combinations we assign the value of the consideration transferred to acquire a business to the tangible assets and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed on the basis of their fair values at the date of acquisition. any excess purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired is allocated to goodwill. when determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, management makes significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. critical estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from customer relationships and trade names, and discount rates.
management's estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates. any changes to provisional amounts identified during the measurement period are recognized in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined. recoverability of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets goodwill is assigned to reporting units that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the business combination as of the acquisition date. we assess goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, neither of which is amortized, for impairment annually as of october 1, or more frequently, if events and circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred. in the evaluation of goodwill for impairment, we typically perform a quantitative assessment and compare the fair value of the reporting unit to the carrying value. an impairment charge is recorded based on the excess of the reporting unit's carrying amount over its fair value. periodically, we may choose to perform a qualitative assessment, prior to performing the quantitative analysis, to determine whether the fair value of the goodwill is more likely than not impaired. we generally base our measurement of fair value of reporting units on a blended analysis of the present value of future discounted cash flows and market valuation approach with the exception of our standalone publicly traded subsidiary, which is based on market valuation. the discounted cash flows model indicates the fair value of the reporting units based on the present f- 14 table of contents value of the cash flows that we expect the reporting units to generate in the future. our significant estimates in the discounted cash flows model include: our weighted average cost of capital; long-term rate of growth and profitability of our business; and working capital effects. the market valuation approach indicates the fair value of the business based on a comparison of the company to comparable publicly traded firms in similar lines of business. our significant estimates in the market approach model include identifying similar companies with comparable business factors such as size, growth, profitability, risk and return on investment and assessing comparable revenue and operating income multiples in estimating the fair value of the reporting units. we believe the weighted use of discounted cash flows and market approach is the best method for determining the fair value of our reporting units because these are the most common valuation methodologies used within the travel and internet industries; and the blended use of both models compensates for the inherent risks associated with either model if used on a stand-alone basis. in addition to measuring the fair value of our reporting units as described above, we consider the combined carrying and fair values of our reporting units in relation to the company's total fair value of equity plus debt as of the assessment date. our equity value assumes our fully diluted market capitalization, using either the stock price on the valuation date or the average stock price over a range of dates around the valuation date, plus an estimated acquisition premium which is based on observable transactions of comparable companies. the debt value is based on the highest value expected to be paid to repurchase the debt, which can be fair value, principal or principal plus a premium depending on the terms of each debt instrument. in our evaluation of our indefinite-lived intangible assets, we typically first perform a quantitative assessment and an impairment charge is recorded for the excess of the carrying value of indefinite-lived intangible assets over their fair value, if necessary. we base our measurement of fair value of indefinite-lived intangible assets, which primarily consist of trade name and trademarks, using the relief-from-royalty method. this method assumes that the trade name and trademarks have value to the extent that their owner is relieved of the obligation to pay royalties for the benefits received from them.
as with goodwill, periodically, we may choose to perform a qualitative assessment, prior to performing the quantitative analysis, to determine whether the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset is more likely than not impaired. recoverability of intangible assets with definite lives and other long-lived assets intangible assets with definite lives and other long-lived assets are carried at cost and are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives of one to twelve years . we review the carrying value of long-lived assets or asset groups, including property and equipment, to be used in operations whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable. factors that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used, a significant adverse change in legal factors or the business climate that could affect the value of the asset, or a significant decline in the observable market value of an asset, among others. if such facts indicate a potential impairment, we would assess the recoverability of an asset group by determining if the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the sum of the projected undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the assets over the remaining economic life of the primary asset in the asset group. if the recoverability test indicates that the carrying value of the asset group is not recoverable, we will estimate the fair value of the asset group using appropriate valuation methodologies which would typically include an estimate of discounted cash flows. any impairment would be measured as the difference between the asset groups carrying amount and its estimated fair value. assets held for sale, to the extent we have any, are reported at the lower of cost or fair value less costs to sell. redeemable non-controlling interests we have non-controlling interests in majority owned entities, which were carried at fair value as the non-controlling interests contained certain rights, whereby we could acquire and the minority shareholders could sell to us the additional shares of the company. if the redeemable non-controlling interest is redeemable at an amount other than fair value, we adjust the non-controlling interest to redemption value through earnings each period. in circumstances where the non-
controlling interest is redeemable at fair value, changes in fair value of the shares for which the minority holders could sell to us were recorded to the non-controlling interest and as charges or credits to retained earnings (or additional paid-in capital in the absence of retained earnings). fair value determinations required high levels of judgment ("level 3" on the fair value hierarchy) and were based on various valuation techniques, including market comparables and discounted cash flow projections. income taxes we record income taxes under the liability method. deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect our estimation of the future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for book and tax purposes. we f- 15
table of contents determine deferred income taxes based on the differences in accounting methods and timing between financial statement and income tax reporting. accordingly, we determine the deferred tax asset or liability for each temporary difference based on the enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when we realize the underlying items of income and expense. we consider many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of our deferred tax assets, including our recent earnings experience by jurisdiction, expectations of future taxable income, and the carryforward periods available to us for tax reporting purposes, as well as other relevant factors.
we may establish a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount we believe is more likely than not to be realized. due to inherent complexities arising from the nature of our businesses, future changes in income tax law, tax sharing agreements or variances between our actual and anticipated operating results, we make certain judgments and estimates. therefore, actual income taxes could materially vary from these estimates. all deferred income taxes are classified as long-term on our consolidated balance sheets. we account for uncertain tax positions based on a two-step process of evaluating recognition and measurement criteria. the first step assesses whether the tax position is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the tax authority, including resolution of any appeals or litigation, based on the technical merits of the position. if the tax position meets the more likely than not criteria, the portion of the tax benefit greater than 50% likely to be realized upon settlement with the tax authority is recognized in the financial statements. we recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the income tax expense line in our consolidated statement of operations.
accrued interest and penalties are included in other long-term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. in relation to tax effects for accumulated oci, our policy is to release the tax effects of amounts reclassified from accumulated oci to pre-tax income (loss) from continuing operations. any remaining tax effect in accumulated oci is released following a portfolio approach. the tax cuts and jobs act ("the tax act"), enacted in december 2017, significantly changed u.s. tax law by, among other things, lowering u.s. corporate income tax rates, implementing a territorial tax system and imposing a one-time transition tax on deemed repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries. the tax act created a new requirement that global intangible low-tax income ("gilti") earned by our foreign subsidiaries must be included in gross u.s. taxable income, which we account for in the period incurred.
for additional information, including the impacts of the tax act, see note 11 - income taxes in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. derivative instruments derivative instruments are carried at fair value on our consolidated balance sheets. the fair values of the derivative financial instruments generally represent the estimated amounts we would expect to receive or pay upon termination of the contracts as of the reporting date. at december 31, 2019 and 2018 , our derivative instruments primarily consisted of foreign currency forward contracts.
we use foreign currency forward contracts to economically hedge certain merchant revenue exposures, foreign denominated liabilities related to certain of our loyalty programs and our other foreign currency-denominated operating liabilities. our goal in managing our foreign exchange risk is to reduce, to the extent practicable, our potential exposure to the changes that exchange rates might have on our earnings, cash flows and financial position. our foreign currency forward contracts are typically short-term and, as they do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment, we classify the changes in their fair value in other, net. we do not hold or issue financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes. in june 2015, we issued euro 650million of registered senior unsecured notes that are due in june 2022 and bear interest at 2.5% (the " 2.5% notes"). the aggregate principal value of the 2.5% notes is designated as a hedge of our net investment in certain euro functional currency subsidiaries. the notes are measured at euro to u.s. dollar exchange rates at each balance sheet date and transaction gains or losses due to changes in rates are recorded in accumulated oci. the euro-denominated net assets of these subsidiaries are translated into u.s. dollars at each balance sheet date, with effects of foreign currency changes also reported in accumulated oci. since the notional amount of the recorded euro-denominated debt is less than the notional amount of our net investment, we do not expect to incur any ineffectiveness on this hedge. foreign currency translation and transaction gains and losses certain of our operations outside of the united states use the related local currency as their functional currency. we translate revenue and expense at average rates of exchange during the period. we translate assets and liabilities at the rates of exchange as of the consolidated balance sheet dates and include foreign currency translation gains and losses as a component of accumulated oci. due to the nature of our operations and our corporate structure, we also have subsidiaries that have significant transactions in foreign currencies other than their functional currency. we record transaction gains and losses in our consolidated statements of operations related to the recurring remeasurement and settlement of such transactions. f- 16 table of contents to the extent practicable, we attempt to minimize this exposure by maintaining natural hedges between our current assets and current liabilities of similarly denominated foreign currencies. additionally, as discussed above, we use foreign currency forward contracts to economically hedge certain merchant revenue exposures and in lieu of holding certain foreign currency cash for the purpose of economically hedging our foreign currency-denominated operating liabilities. debt issuance costs we defer costs we incur to issue debt, which are presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the related debt liability, and amortize these costs to interest expense over the term of the debt or, in circumstances where the debt can be redeemed at the option of the holders, over the term of the redemption option. marketing promotions we periodically provide incentive offers to our customers to encourage booking of travel products and services. generally, our incentive offers are as follows: current discount offers. these promotions include dollar or percent off discounts to be applied against current purchases. we record the discounts as reduction in revenue at the date we record the corresponding revenue transaction. inducement offers. these promotions include discounts granted at the time of a current purchase to be applied against a future qualifying purchase. we treat inducement offers as a reduction to revenue based on estimated future redemption rates. we allocate the discount amount at the time of the offer between the current performance obligation and the potential future performance obligations based on our expected relative value of the transactions. we estimate our redemption rates using our historical experience for similar inducement offers. concession offers. these promotions include discounts to be applied against a future purchase to maintain customer satisfaction. upon issuance, we record these concession offers as a reduction to revenue based on estimated future redemption rates. we estimate our redemption rates using our historical experience for concession offers. advertising expense we incur advertising expense consisting of offline costs, including television and radio advertising, and online advertising expense to promote our brands. we expense the production costs associated with advertisements in the period in which the advertisement first takes place. we expense the costs of communicating the advertisement (e.g., television airtime) as incurred each time the advertisement is shown. for the years ended december 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, our advertising expense was $
3.5billion , $ 3.4billion and $ 3.3billion . stock-based compensation we measure and amortize the fair value of restricted stock units ("rsus") and stock options as follows: restricted stock units. rsus are stock awards that are granted to employees entitling the holder to shares of common stock as the award vests, typically over a four
-year period, but may accelerate in certain circumstances. during 2019, we started issuing rsus as our primary form of stock-based compensation, which vest 25% after one year and will then vest quarterly over the following three years . we measure the value of rsus at fair value based on the number of shares granted and the quoted price of our common stock at the date of grant. we amortize the fair value, net of actual forfeitures, as stock-based compensation expense over the vesting term on a straight-line basis. we record rsus that may be settled by the holder in cash, rather than shares, as a liability and we remeasure these instruments at fair value at the end of each reporting period. upon settlement of these awards, our total compensation expense recorded over the vesting period of the awards will equal the settlement amount, which is based on our stock price on the settlement date.
performance-based rsus vest upon achievement of certain company-based performance conditions and expense is recognized when it is probable the performance condition will be achieved. stock options. our employee stock options consist of service based awards, some of which also have market-based vesting conditions. we measure the value of stock options issued or modified, including unvested options assumed in acquisitions, on the grant date
(or modification or acquisition dates, if applicable) at fair value, using appropriate valuation techniques, including the black-scholes and monte carlo option pricing models, for awards that contain market-based vesting conditions. the black-scholes valuation models incorporate various assumptions including expected volatility, expected term and risk-free interest rates. the expected volatility is based on historical volatility of our common stock and other relevant factors. we base our expected term assumptions on our historical experience and on the terms and conditions of the stock awards granted to employees. we amortize the fair value, net of actual forfeitures, over the remaining explicit vesting term in f- 17 table of contents the case of service-based awards and the longer of the derived service period or the explicit service period for awards with market conditions on a straight-line basis. in addition, we classify certain employee option awards as liabilities when we deem it not probable that the employees holding the awards will bear the risk and rewards of stock ownership for a reasonable period of time. such options are revalued at the end of each reporting period and upon settlement our total compensation expense recorded from grant date to settlement date will equal the settlement amount. the majority of our stock options vest over four years . estimates of fair value are not intended to predict actual future events or the value ultimately realized by employees who receive these awards, and subsequent events are not indicative of the reasonableness of our original estimates of fair value. earnings per share we compute basic earnings per share by taking net income attributable to expedia group, inc. available to common stockholders divided by the weighted average number of common and class b common shares outstanding during the period excluding restricted stock and stock held in escrow. diluted earnings per share include the potential dilution that could occur from stock-based awards and other stock-based commitments using the treasury stock or the as if converted methods, as applicable.
for additional information on how we compute earnings per share, see note 14 - earnings per share . fair value recognition, measurement and disclosure the carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash and cash equivalents reported on our consolidated balance sheets approximate fair value as we maintain them with various high-quality financial institutions. the accounts receivable are short-term in nature and are generally settled shortly after the sale. we disclose the fair value of our financial instruments based on the fair value hierarchy using the following three categories: level 1 - valuations based on quoted prices for identical assets and liabilities in active markets. level 2 - valuations based on observable inputs other than quoted prices included in level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data. level 3 - valuations based on unobservable inputs reflecting the company's own assumptions, consistent with reasonably available assumptions made by other market participants.
these valuations require significant judgment. certain risks and concentrations our business is subject to certain risks and concentrations including dependence on relationships with travel suppliers, primarily airlines and hotels, dependence on third-party technology providers, exposure to risks associated with online commerce security and payment related fraud. we also rely on global distribution system partners and third-party service providers for certain fulfillment services . financial instruments, which potentially subject us to concentration of credit risk, consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents. we maintain some cash and cash equivalents balances with financial institutions that are in excess of federal deposit insurance corporation insurance limits. our cash and cash equivalents are primarily composed of term deposits as well as bank (both interest and non-interest bearing)
account balances denominated in u.s. dollars, euros, british pound sterling, canadian dollar, australian dollar, japanese yen and brazilian real. contingent liabilities we have a number of regulatory and legal matters outstanding, as discussed further in note 17 - commitments and contingencies . periodically, we review the status of all significant outstanding matters to assess the potential financial exposure. when (i) it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and (ii) the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated, we record the estimated loss in our consolidated statements of operations. we provide disclosure in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for loss contingencies that do not meet both of these conditions if there is a reasonable possibility that a loss may have been incurred that would be material to the financial statements. significant judgment is required to determine the probability that a liability has been incurred and whether such liability is reasonably estimable. we base accruals made on the best information available at the time which can be highly subjective. the final outcome of these matters could vary significantly from the amounts included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. f- 18 table of contents occupancy and other taxes some states and localities impose taxes (e.g. transient occupancy, accommodation tax, sales tax, and/or business privilege tax) on the use or occupancy of hotel accommodations or other traveler services. generally, hotels collect taxes based on the room rate paid to the hotel and remit these taxes to the various tax authorities. when a customer books a room through one of our travel services, we collect a tax recovery charge from the customer which we pay to the hotel. we calculate the tax recovery charge by applying the applicable tax rate supplied to us by the hotels to the amount that the hotel has agreed to receive for the rental of the room by the consumer. in most jurisdictions, we do not collect or remit taxes, nor do we pay taxes to the hotel operator on the portion of the customer payment we retain. some jurisdictions have questioned our practice in this regard. while the applicable tax provisions vary among the jurisdictions, we generally believe that we are not required to collect and remit such taxes. more recently, a limited number of taxing jurisdictions have made similar claims against vrbo for tax amounts due on the rental amounts charged by owners of alternative accommodations properties or for taxes on vrbo's services. vrbo is an intermediary between a traveler and a party renting a vacation property and we believe is similarly not liable for such taxes. we are engaged in discussions with tax authorities in various jurisdictions to resolve these issues. some tax authorities have brought lawsuits or have levied assessments asserting that we are required to collect and remit tax. the ultimate resolution in all jurisdictions cannot be determined at this time.
we have established a reserve for the potential settlement of issues related to hotel occupancy and other taxes when determined to be probable and estimable. see note 17 - commitments and contingencies for further discussion.
("asu") amending the guidance related to accounting and reporting guidelines for leasing arrangements using the optional transition method that allowed for a cumulative-effect adjustment in the period of adoption. results for reporting periods beginning after january 1, 2019 are presented under the new guidance, while prior period amounts were not adjusted and continue to be reported under the accounting standards in effect for those periods. the new guidance required entities that lease assets to recognize assets and liabilities on the balance sheet related to the rights and obligations created by those leases regardless of whether they are classified as finance or operating leases. in addition, new disclosures are required to meet the objective of enabling users of financial statements to better understand the amount, timing and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. we elected certain of the available transition practical expedients, including those that permit us to not reassess 1) whether any expired or existing contracts are or contain leases, 2) the lease classification for any expired or existing leases, and 3) any initial direct costs for any existing leases as of the effective date. we did not elect the hindsight practical expedient, which permits entities to use hindsight in determining the lease term and assessing impairment. the adoption of the standard on january 1, 2019 resulted in the recognition of rou assets of approximately $ 565million and lease liabilities for operating leases of approximately $ 615million . additionally, we removed the assets and liabilities previously recorded pursuant to build-to-suit lease guidance resulting in an increase to retained earnings of approximately $ 6million . the standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated statements of operations or statements of cash flows. hedge accounting. as of january 1, 2019, we adopted the new guidance amending the accounting guidance for hedge accounting. the new guidance requires expanded hedge accounting for both non-financial and financial risk components and refines the measurement of hedge results to better reflect an entity's hedging strategies. the new guidance also amends the presentation and disclosure requirements on a prospective basis as well as changes how entities assess hedge effectiveness. the adoption of this new guidance had no impact on our consolidated financial statements. recent accounting policies not yet adopted measurement of credit losses on financial instruments. in june 2016, the fasb issued new guidance on the measurement of credit losses for financial assets measured at amortized cost, which includes accounts receivable, and available-for-sale debt securities. the new guidance replaces the existing incurred loss impairment model with an expected loss methodology, which will result in more timely recognition of credit losses. this update is effective for annual periods beginning after december 15, 2019, including interim periods within those annual periods. the adoption of this new guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. cloud computing arrangements. in august 2018, the fasb issued new guidance on the accounting for implementation costs incurred for a cloud computing arrangement that is a service contract. the update conforms the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred in a cloud computing arrangement that is a service contract with the accounting guidance that provides for capitalization of costs incurred to develop or obtain internal-use-software. the new guidance is effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after december 15, 2019. the adoption of this new guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. f- 19 table of contents fair value measurements. in august 2018, the fasb issued new guidance related to the disclosure requirements on fair value measurements, which removes, modifies or adds certain disclosures. the guidance is effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after december 15, 2019.

note 3 - acquisitions and other investments
2019 acquisition activity we had nominal acquisition activity during the year ended december 31, 2019. refer to note 18 - liberty expedia holdings transaction for details of this transaction completed during 2019.
2018 acquisition and other investment activity during 2018, we completed two business combinations. the following summarizes the aggregate purchase price allocation for these acquisitions, in millions:
intangibles with definite lives(1)     24
deferred tax liabilities, net          (1  )
(1)  acquired intangible assets with definite lives have a weighted average useful life of2.9years.
the goodwill recorded for the business combinations is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes. the results of operations were immaterial from the transaction close dates through december 31, 2018. pro forma results have not been presented as such pro forma financial information would not be materially different from historical results.
other investments. in december 2018, we made an additional investment of $ 70million in traveloka holding limited
("traveloka"), a southeast asian online travel company, for which we made an initial investment during 2017. the initial investment in july 2017 of $ 350million expanded our partnership to include deeper cooperation on hotel supply between our two companies. the majority of our investments are accounted for as a minority equity investment and included within long-term investment and other assets on the consolidated balance sheets with a small portion of the initial investment allocated to intangible assets.
2017 acquisition activity during 2017, we completed several business combinations, one of which we made an initial investment in during 2015.
the following summarizes the aggregate purchase price allocation for these acquisitions, in millions:
intangibles with definite lives(1)            76
net assets and non-controlling interests      15
deferred tax liabilities                     (21  )
(1)  acquired intangible assets with definite lives have a weighted average useful life of3.8years.
(3)  minority investment upon our acquisition of a controlling interest as well as $8 million related to replacement stock awards attributable to pre-acquisition service, with the remainder paid in cash during the period.
the redeemable non-controlling interest in one of our acquisitions is redeemable at an amount other than fair value requiring that each period we adjust the non-controlling interest to redemption value through earnings. in addition, another of our acquisitions made during the period includes redeemable non-controlling interests, which are redeemable at fair value requiring that each period we adjust the changes in the fair value of the non-
controlling interest through retained earnings (or additional paid-in capital if there is no retained earnings).
fair value determinations are based on various valuation techniques, including market comparables and discounted cash flow projections.
f- 20 table of contents of the goodwill recorded for the business combinations, $ 12million is expected to be deductible for tax purposes with the remainder not expected to be deductible. the results of operations were immaterial from the transaction close dates through december 31, 2017. pro forma results have not been presented as such pro forma financial information would not be materially different from historical results.

we classify our cash equivalents and investments within level 1 and level 2 as we value our cash equivalents and investments using quoted market prices or alternative pricing sources and models utilizing market observable inputs. valuation of the foreign currency forward contracts is based on foreign currency exchange rates in active markets, a level 2 input.
we hold term deposit investments with financial institutions. term deposits with original maturities of less than three months are classified as cash equivalents and those with remaining maturities of less than one year are classified within short-term investments.
as of december 31, 2019 and 2018 , our cash and cash equivalents consisted primarily of term deposits with maturities of three months or less and bank account balances.
our marketable equity securities consist of our investment in despegar, a publicly traded company, which is included in long-term investments and other assets in our consolidated balance sheets. during the years ended december 31, 2019 and 2018 , we recognized a gain of approximately $ 10million and a loss of approximately $
145million , respectively, within other, net in our consolidated statements of operations related to the fair value changes of this equity investment. as of december 31, f- 21 table of contents 2017, prior to our adoption of the new guidance for recognition and measurement of financial instruments, the cost basis was $ 273million and related gross unrealized loss was $ 9million . we use foreign currency forward contracts to economically hedge certain merchant revenue exposures, foreign denominated liabilities related to certain of our loyalty programs and our other foreign currency-denominated operating liabilities. as of december 31, 2019 , we were party to outstanding forward contracts hedging our liability exposures with a total net notional value of $ 3.2billion . as of december 31, 2019 and 2018 , we had a net forward liability of $ 8million recorded in accrued expenses and other current liabilities and a net forward asset of $
22million recorded in prepaid expenses and other current assets. we recorded $( 8) million , $ 47million and $
17million in net gains (losses) from foreign currency forward contracts in 2019 , 2018 and 2017 . assets measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis our non-financial assets, such as goodwill, intangible assets and property and equipment, as well as equity method investments, are adjusted to fair value only when an impairment charge is recognized or the underlying investment is sold. such fair value measurements are based predominately on level 3
inputs. as of january 1, 2018, we measure our minority equity investments that do not have readily determinable fair values at cost less impairment, adjusted by observable price changes with changes recorded within other, net on our consolidated statements of operations. goodwill. during 2018, we recognized goodwill impairment charges of $
$ 25million was recorded during the fourth quarter of 2018 as a result of our annual evaluation of impairment of goodwill and intangible assets on october 1, 2018. these impairment charges resulted from sustained under-
performance and a less optimistic outlook related to one of our reporting units during the second quarter of 2018
and further deterioration of performance in the fourth quarter of 2018. as a result the under-performance early in the year, we concluded that sufficient indicators existed to require us to perform an interim quantitative assessment of goodwill for that reporting unit as of june 30, 2018 in which we compared the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value. the fair value estimates for both the interim and annual impairment tests were based on a blended analysis of the present value of future discounted cash flows and market value approach, level 3 inputs. the significant estimates used in the discounted cash flows model included our weighted average cost of capital, projected cash flows and the long-term rate of growth. our assumptions were based on the actual historical performance of the reporting unit and took into account a recent and continued weakening of operating results and implied risk premiums based on market prices of our equity and debt as of the assessment dates. our significant estimates in the market approach model included identifying similar companies with comparable business factors such as size, growth, profitability, risk and return on investment and assessing comparable revenue and earnings multiples in estimating the fair value of the reporting unit. the excess of the reporting unit's carrying value over our estimate of the fair value was recorded as the goodwill impairment charge in the respective periods.
as of december 31, 2018, the applicable reporting unit had no remaining goodwill. intangible assets. during 2018, we recognized an intangible impairment charge of $ 42million in conjunction with the annual impairment testing of goodwill and intangible assets on october 1, 2018. the impairment charge was related to an indefinite-lived trade name within our core ota segment and resulted from changes in estimated future revenues of the related brand. the asset, classified as level 3 measurement, was written down to $ 27million based on valuation using the relief-from-
royalty method, which includes unobservable inputs, including royalty rates and projected revenues. in conjunction with the impairment, we reclassified the remainder to a definite-lived asset to be amortized over eight years.
minority investments without readily determinable fair values. as of december 31, 2019 and 2018 , the carrying values of our minority investments without readily determinable fair values totaled $ 467million and $ 476million .
during 2019, we recorded $ 2million of losses related to these minority investments. during 2018, we recorded $
33million of gains related to these minority investments, which had recent observable and orderly transactions for similar investments, using an option pricing model that utilizes judgmental inputs such as discounts for lack of marketability and estimated exit event timing. as of december 31, 2019, total cumulative adjustments made to the initial cost basis of these investments included $ 33million in unrealized upward adjustments and $ 2million in unrealized downward adjustments (including impairment). during 2017, we recorded $ 14million in net losses related to certain minority equity investments, which included $ 6million in other-than-temporary impairments as well as a loss recognized on the liquidation of an investment of $ 9million . as a result of these 2017 impairments and subsequent liquidation, we have no remaining fair value related to these minority equity investments. f- 22 table of contents note 5 - property and equipment, net our property and equipment consists of the following:

note 11 - income taxes the tax act, enacted in december 2017, significantly changed u.s. tax law by, among other things, lowering u.s.
corporate income tax rates, implementing a territorial tax system, and imposing a one-time transition tax on deemed repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries. the tax act reduced the u.s. corporate income tax rate from 35% to
effective for tax years beginning after december 31, 2017, the tax act provides a foreign-derived intangible income
("fdii") deduction, which is derived from the taxpayer's foreign derived deduction eligible income ("fddei") among other factors. for tax years 2018 to 2025, the allowable deduction is 37.5% of the gross fdii after the taxable income limitation, and 21.875% thereafter. for tax years 2018 to 2025, this equates to a 13.125% effective tax rate on excess returns earned directly by a u.s. corporation from foreign derived sales (including licenses and leases)
or services, and 16.406% thereafter. the preferential rate is reflected on the u.s. tax return as a deduction for fdii.

as of december 31, 2019 , we had federal, state, and foreign net operating loss carryforwards ("nols") of approximately $ 77million , $ 80million and $ 538million . if not utilized, the federal and state nols will expire at various times between 2020 and 2039 . foreign nols of $ 176million may be carried forward indefinitely, and foreign nols of $ 362million expire at various times starting from 2020 .
as of december 31, 2019 , we had a valuation allowance of approximately $ 77million related to certain nol carryforwards for which it is more likely than not the tax benefits will not be realized. the valuation allowance decreased by $ 3million from the amount recorded as of december 31, 2018 primarily due to historic pre-acquisition losses that were surrendered during 2019. the amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable, however, could be adjusted if estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward period change, or if objective negative evidence in the form of cumulative losses is no longer present and additional weight may be given to subjective evidence such as our projections for growth.
due to the one-time transition tax on the deemed repatriation of post-1986 undistributed foreign subsidiary earnings and profits, the majority of previously unremitted earnings have now been subjected to u.s. federal income tax. to the extent that this repatriation resulted in differences between the book and tax carrying values of expedia group's investment in foreign subsidiaries whose offshore earnings are not indefinitely reinvested, or to the extent that future distributions from these subsidiaries will be taxable, a deferred tax liability has been accrued. the amount of undistributed earnings in foreign subsidiaries where the foreign subsidiary has or will invest undistributed earnings indefinitely outside of the united states, and for which future distributions could be taxable, was $ 85million as of december 31, 2019 . the unrecognized deferred tax liability related to the u.s.

our effective tax rate for 2019 was higher than the 21% federal statutory income tax rate due to state income taxes, foreign income taxed at higher than the federal statutory tax rate, as well as losses in foreign jurisdictions for which we do not record a tax benefit. our effective tax rate for 2018 was lower than the 21%
federal statutory income tax rate due to earnings in foreign jurisdictions outside of the united states, primarily switzerland, where the statutory income tax rate is lower as well as excess tax benefits relating to stock-based payments and fdii. our effective tax rate for 2017 was lower than the 35% federal statutory rate due to earnings in foreign jurisdictions outside of the united states well as excess tax benefits related to stock-based payments.
the increase in our effective tax rate for 2019 compared to 2018 was due to an increase in u.s. federal and state taxable income as a result of an internal reorganization.

as of december 31, 2019 , we had $ 305million of gross unrecognized tax benefits, $ 188million of which, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate. as of december 31, 2018 , we had $ 293million of gross unrecognized tax benefits, $ 180million of which, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate. as of december 31, 2017 , we had $ 261million of gross unrecognized tax benefits, $ 155million of which, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate.
37million and $ 30million , respectively. we recognized interest expense in 2019 and 2018 of $ 8million in both periods and $ 7million in 2017 in connection with our unrecognized tax benefits. the company is routinely under audit by federal, state, local and foreign income tax authorities. these audits include questioning the timing and the amount of income and deductions, and the allocation of income and deductions among various tax jurisdictions.
the internal revenue service ("irs") is currently examining expedia group's u.s. consolidated federal income tax returns for the periods ended december 31, 2011 through december 31, 2013. the company has consented to an extension of the statute of limitations, until march 31, 2021, related to these tax years. as of december 31, 2019
, for the expedia group, inc. & subsidiaries group, statute of limitations for tax years 2011 through 2018 remain open to examination in the federal jurisdiction and most state jurisdictions. for the homeaway and orbitz groups, statutes of limitations for tax years 2001 through 2015 remain open to examination in the federal and most state jurisdictions due to nol carryforwards. we are subject to taxation in the united states and various other state and foreign jurisdictions. during 2017, the internal revenue service ("irs") issued proposed adjustments related to transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries for our 2009 to 2010 audit cycle. on july 12, 2019, we settled the audit for an immaterial impact to the consolidated financial statements. in addition, we are under examination by the irs for our 2011 through 2013 tax years. during the fourth quarter of 2019, the irs issued final adjustments related to transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries for our 2011 to 2013 audit cycle. the proposed adjustments would increase our u.s. taxable income by $ 696million , which would result in federal tax of approximately $ 244million subject to interest. we do not agree with the position of the irs and are formally protesting the irs position. subsequent years remain open to examination by the irs. we do not anticipate a significant impact to our gross unrecognized tax benefits within the next 12 months related to these years.

outstanding stock awards that have been excluded from the calculations of diluted earnings per share attributable to common stockholders because their effect would have been antidilutive were approximately seven million for the year ended december 31, 2019 , nine million for 2018 , and four million for 2017 .
the earnings per share amounts are the same for common stock and class b common stock because the holders of each class are legally entitled to equal per share distributions whether through dividends or in liquidation.
note 15 - restructuring and related reorganization charges in connection with the centralization and migration of certain operational functions and systems as well as certain organizational alignment activities, we recognized $
24million and $ 17million in restructuring and related reorganization charges during 2019 and 2017 . the charges were primarily related to employee severance, benefits and professional fees and approximately $ 17million was unpaid as of december 31, 2019 . we had no restructuring charges in 2018. f- 35 table of contents note 16 - other income (expense)

note 17 - commitments and contingencies letters of credit, purchase obligations and guarantees we have commitments and obligations that include purchase obligations, guarantees and locs, which could potentially require our payment in the event of demands by third parties or contingent events. the following table presents these commitments and obligations as of december 31, 2019 :
letters of credit                   39              22           13            -               4
our purchase obligations represent the minimum obligations we have under agreements with certain of our vendors.
these minimum obligations are less than our projected use for those periods. payments may be more than the minimum obligations based on actual use.
we have guarantees which consist primarily of bonds relating to tax assessments that we are contesting as well as bonds required by certain foreign countries' aviation authorities for the potential non-delivery, by us, of packaged travel sold in those countries. the authorities also require that a portion of the total amount of packaged travel sold be bonded. our guarantees also include certain surety bonds related to various company performance obligations.
our locs consist of stand-by locs, underwritten by a group of lenders, which we primarily issue for certain regulatory purposes as well as to certain hotel properties to secure our payment for hotel room transactions. the contractual expiration dates of these locs are shown in the table above. there were no material claims made against any stand-by locs during the years ended december 31, 2019 , 2018 and 2017 .
legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business, we are a party to various lawsuits. management does not expect these lawsuits to have a material impact on the liquidity, results of operations, or financial condition of expedia group. we also evaluate other potential contingent matters, including value-added tax, excise tax, sales tax, transient occupancy or accommodation tax and similar matters. we do not believe that the aggregate amount of liability that could be reasonably possible with respect to these matters would have a material adverse effect on our financial results;
however, litigation is inherently uncertain and the actual losses incurred in the event that our legal proceedings were to result in unfavorable outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial performance.
litigation relating to occupancy taxes. one hundred one lawsuits have been filed by or against cities, counties and states involving hotel occupancy and other taxes. ten lawsuits are currently active. these lawsuits are in various stages and we continue to defend against the claims made in them vigorously. with respect to the principal claims in these matters, we believe that the statutes or ordinances at issue do not apply to us or the services we provide and, therefore, that we do not owe the taxes f- 36 table of contents that are claimed to be owed. we believe that the statutes or ordinances at issue generally impose occupancy and other taxes on entities that own, operate or control hotels (or similar businesses) or furnish or provide hotel rooms or similar accommodations. to date, forty-seven of these lawsuits have been dismissed. some of these dismissals have been without prejudice and, generally, allow the governmental entity or entities to seek administrative remedies prior to pursuing further litigation. thirty-three dismissals were based on a finding that we and the other defendants were not subject to the local tax ordinance or that the local government lacked standing to pursue its claims. as a result of this litigation and other attempts by certain jurisdictions to levy such taxes, we have established a reserve for the potential settlement of issues related to hotel occupancy and other taxes, consistent with applicable accounting principles and in light of all current facts and circumstances, in the amount of $ 48million and $ 46million as of december 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. our settlement reserve is based on our best estimate of probable losses and the ultimate resolution of these contingencies may be greater or less than the liabilities recorded. an estimate for a reasonably possible loss or range of loss in excess of the amount reserved cannot be made. changes to the settlement reserve are included within legal reserves, occupancy tax and other in the consolidated statements of operations. pay-to-play. certain jurisdictions may assert that we are required to pay any assessed taxes prior to being allowed to contest or litigate the applicability of the ordinances. this prepayment of contested taxes is referred to as "pay-to-play." payment of these amounts is not an admission that we believe we are subject to such taxes and, even when such payments are made, we continue to defend our position vigorously. if we prevail in the litigation, for which a pay-to-play payment was made, the jurisdiction collecting the payment will be required to repay such amounts and also may be required to pay interest. for example, on september 13, 2018, the city of san francisco refunded all pay-to-play payments previously made by expedia group companies, along with accumulated interest. the $ 78million refund was recorded as a gain within legal reserves, occupancy tax and other in the consolidated statements of operations and $ 19million of accumulated interest to interest income during 2018. we are in various stages of inquiry or audit with domestic and foreign tax authorities, some of which, including in the city of los angeles regarding hotel occupancy taxes and in the united kingdom regarding the application of value added tax ("vat") to our european union related transactions as discussed below, may impose a pay-to-play requirement to challenge an adverse inquiry or audit result in court. matters relating to international vat . we are in various stages of inquiry or audit in multiple european union jurisdictions, including in the united kingdom, regarding the application of vat to our european union related transactions. while we believe we comply with applicable vat laws, rules and regulations in the relevant jurisdictions, the tax authorities may determine that we owe additional taxes. in certain jurisdictions, including the united kingdom, we may be required to "pay-to-play" any vat assessment prior to contesting its validity. while we believe that we will be successful based on the merits of our positions with regard to the united kingdom and other vat audits in pay-to-play jurisdictions, it is nevertheless reasonably possible that we could be required to pay any assessed amounts in order to contest or litigate the applicability of any assessments and an estimate for a reasonably possible amount of any such payments cannot be made. competition and consumer matters . on august 23, 2018, the australian competition and consumer commission, or "accc", instituted proceedings in the australian federal court against trivago. the accc alleged breaches of australian consumer law, or "acl,"
relating to trivago's advertisements in australia concerning the hotel prices available on trivago's australian site, trivago's strike-through pricing practice and other aspects of the way offers for accommodation were displayed on trivago's australian website. the matter went to trial in september 2019 and, on january 20, 2020, the australian federal court issued a judgment finding trivago had engaged in conduct in breach of the acl. the court will set a date for a separate hearing regarding penalties and other orders. we recorded the estimated probable loss associated with the proceedings as of december 31, 2019. an estimate for the reasonable possible loss or range of loss in excess of the amount reserved cannot be made. note 18 - liberty expedia holdings transaction on july 26,
2019, expedia group acquired all of the outstanding shares of liberty expedia holdings, inc. ("liberty expedia holdings") in a merger transaction in which the outstanding shares of liberty expedia holdings' series a common stock and series b common stock were exchanged for newly issued shares of common stock of expedia group with a fair value of $ 2.9billion , assumption of $ 400million in debt and $ 15million of cash. we accounted for the acquired liberty expedia holdings assets and liabilities, except for the expedia group shares repurchased, as a business combination. we accounted for the acquired expedia group shares held by liberty expedia holdings as a share repurchase for consideration of $ 3.2billion . as a result of this transaction, expedia group's shares outstanding were reduced by approximately 3.1million shares. the fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired in the business combination was $ 96million , which was primarily comprised of $ 78million of cash and $ 10million of a trade name definite lived intangible asset related to bodybuilding.com. bodybuilding.com is primarily an internet retailer of dietary supplements, sports nutrition products, and other health and wellness products. no goodwill was recorded for the portion of the transaction accounted for as a business combination. f- 37 table of contents in connection with the liberty expedia holdings transaction, a wholly-owned subsidiary of expedia group, inc. ("merger llc") assumed the obligations of liberty expedia holdings with respect to the $ 400million aggregate outstanding principal amount of 1.0% exchangeable senior debentures due 2047 issued by liberty expedia holdings (the
"exchangeable debentures") and the indenture governing the exchangeable debentures. also in connection with the liberty expedia holdings transaction, liberty expedia holdings delivered a notice of redemption with respect to the exchangeable debentures, pursuant to which merger llc would redeem all of the exchangeable debentures at a redemption price, in cash, equal to the sum of (i) the adjusted principal amount of such exchangeable debentures,
(ii) any accrued and unpaid interest on such exchangeable debentures to the redemption date, and (iii) any final period distribution on such exchangeable debentures (subject to the right of holders of the exchangeable debentures to exchange such exchangeable debentures for equity of expedia group, inc. or, at merger llc's election, cash or a combination of such equity and cash). on august 26, 2019, merger llc redeemed all of the exchangeable debentures in exchange for a total payment of approximately $ 401million (with no holders of the exchangeable debentures electing to exchange). the purchase price allocation was based on preliminary valuations of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed and is subject to revision. bodybuilding.com was consolidated into our financial statements starting on the acquisition date and we have recognized a related $ 58million in revenue and $ 7million in operating losses for the year ended december 31, 2019 , which are included within corporate and eliminations in our segment footnote. pro forma financial information has not been presented as, absent liberty expedia holdings'
goodwill impairment related to bodybuilding.com during the year ended december 31, 2018, such pro forma information would not be materially different from historical results. for information related to the liberty expedia holdings transaction, see note 19 - related party transactions . note 19 - related party transactions mr. diller is the chairman and senior executive of expedia group. certain relationships between mr. diller and the company in connection with the liberty expedia transaction (as defined below) are described below. prior to the closing of the liberty expedia transaction on july 26, 2019, liberty expedia holdings and its subsidiaries held 11,076,672 shares of expedia group common stock and 12,799,999 shares of expedia group class b common stock, which shares represented approximately 53% of the total voting power of all shares of expedia group common stock and class b common stock, based on a total of 136,832,712 shares of expedia group common stock and 12,799,999 shares of class b common stock outstanding as of july 12, 2019. pursuant to an amended and restated stockholders agreement between liberty expedia and mr. diller (as amended as of november 4, 2016, the "stockholders agreement"), mr. diller generally had the right to vote all shares of expedia group common stock and class b common stock held by liberty expedia holdings and its subsidiaries (the "diller proxy"). as described below, the stockholders agreement, including the diller proxy, was terminated on july 26, 2019, upon the closing of the liberty expedia transaction. merger agreement on april 15, 2019, expedia group entered into an agreement and plan of merger (as amended by amendment no. 1 to agreement and plan of merger, dated as of june 5, 2019, the "merger agreement") with liberty expedia holdings, lems i llc, a delaware limited liability company and a wholly owned subsidiary of the company ("merger llc"), and lems ii inc., a delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of merger llc ("merger sub") and certain other related agreements (the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement and related agreements, the "liberty expedia transaction"). the merger agreement provided for, among other things, (i) the merger of merger sub with and into liberty expedia holdings (the "merger"), with liberty expedia holdings surviving the merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of merger llc, and (ii) immediately following the merger, the merger of liberty expedia holdings (as the surviving corporation in the merger) with and into merger llc (the "upstream merger", and together with the merger, the "combination"), with merger llc surviving the upstream merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of the company. on july 26, 2019, the combination was completed. at the effective time of the merger (the "effective time"), each share of series a common stock, par value $ 0.01 per share, of liberty expedia holdings (the "liberty expedia series a common stock") and each share of series b common stock, par value $ 0.01 per share, of liberty expedia holdings (the "liberty expedia series b common stock") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time (except for shares held by liberty expedia holdings as treasury stock or held directly by expedia group) was converted into the right to receive a number of shares of expedia group common stock such that each holder of record of shares of liberty expedia series a common stock or liberty expedia series b common stock had the right to receive, in the aggregate, a number of shares of expedia group common stock equal to the product of the total number of shares of such series of liberty expedia series a common stock and liberty expedia series b common stock held of record by such holder immediately prior to the merger multiplied by an exchange ratio equal to 0.36 , with such product rounded up to the next whole share of expedia group common stock. the aggregate consideration payable in the combination was approximately 20.7million shares of expedia group common stock. f- 38 table of contents voting agreement in connection with the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, john c. malone and leslie malone (together, the "malone group") entered into a voting agreement (the "voting agreement") with the company on april 15, 2019, pursuant to which, at the july 26, 2019 meeting of the liberty expedia holdings stockholders at which the merger was approved, the malone group voted shares of liberty expedia common stock representing approximately 32% of the total voting power of the issued and outstanding shares of liberty expedia holdings common stock as of april 30, 2019, as reported in liberty expedia holdings' definitive proxy statement on schedule 14a filed on june 26, 2019, in favor of the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby.
exchange agreement simultaneously with the entry into the merger agreement, mr. diller, the diller foundation d/b/a the diller - von furstenberg family foundation (the "family foundation"), liberty expedia holdings and the company entered into an exchange agreement (the "exchange agreement," the rights contemplated by which and by the new governance agreement (as defined below) were agreed by mr. diller to be deemed to be in recognition and in lieu of mr. diller's existing rights under the former governance agreement (as defined below) and the stockholders agreement), and pursuant to which on july 26, 2019, immediately prior to the closing of the combination, mr. diller and the family foundation exchanged with liberty expedia holdings 5,523,452 shares of expedia group common stock for the same number of shares of expedia group class b common stock held by liberty expedia holdings (the shares of class b common stock acquired by mr. diller and the family foundation pursuant to the exchange agreement, collectively referred to as the "original shares"). the original shares represent approximately 29% of the total voting power of all shares of expedia group common stock and class b common stock, based on approximately
137million shares of expedia group common stock and approximately 5.5million shares of class b common stock outstanding as of december 31, 2019. former governance agreement during 2018 through july 26, 2019, liberty expedia holdings (as assignee of qurate retail, inc. ("qurate")) was a party to the amended and restated governance agreement, dated as of december 20, 2011, as amended, among the company, liberty expedia holdings and mr. diller
(the "former governance agreement"), pursuant to which liberty expedia holdings had the right to nominate up to a number of directors equal to 20% of the total number of the directors on the board (rounded up to the next whole number if the number of directors on the board were not an even multiple of five) and had certain rights regarding committee participation, so long as liberty expedia holdings satisfied certain stock ownership requirements. the former governance agreement was terminated on july 26, 2019 upon the closing of the liberty expedia transaction, at which time, pursuant to the merger agreement, each of the three directors serving on the expedia group board of directors who were nominated by liberty expedia holdings resigned from the board. new governance agreement simultaneously with the entry into the merger agreement, the company and mr. diller entered into a second amended and restated governance agreement (the "new governance agreement," the rights contemplated by which and by the exchange agreement were agreed by mr. diller to be deemed to be in recognition and in lieu of mr. diller's existing rights under the former governance agreement and the stockholders agreement), which provides, among other things, that mr. diller may exercise a right (the "purchase/exchange right") during the nine month period following the closing of the combination, to acquire up to 7,276,547 shares of expedia group class b common stock by (1) exchange with the company (or its wholly owned subsidiary) for an equivalent number of shares of expedia group common stock, or (2) purchase from the company (or its wholly owned subsidiary) at a price per share equal to the average closing price of expedia group common stock for the five trading days immediately preceding notice of exercise (any shares acquired pursuant to the purchase/exchange right, the "additional shares"). the purchase/exchange right may be exercised from time to time in whole or in part. assuming the exercise in full by mr. diller of the purchase/exchange right, the original shares and additional shares would collectively represent approximately 50%
of the total voting power of all outstanding shares of expedia group common stock and class b common stock, assuming a total of approximately 130million shares of expedia group common stock and 12,799,999 shares of class b common stock outstanding immediately following the exercise of the purchase/exchange right. the foregoing assumes that mr. diller exercises his right to acquire the additional shares solely by exchanging shares of expedia group common stock acquired in the open market (or otherwise, other than from the company). if mr. diller were to acquire the additional shares through cash purchases directly from the company (or its wholly owned subsidiary), the original shares and additional shares would collectively represent approximately 48% of the total voting power of all outstanding shares of expedia group common stock and class b common stock (based on approximately 137million shares of expedia group common stock and 12,799,999 shares of class b common stock outstanding immediately following the exercise of the purchase/exchange right). prior to the transfer of any additional shares, a transferee must deliver a proxy granting mr. diller sole voting control over such shares and deliver a joinder agreement agreeing to be bound by certain terms of the new governance agreement. f- 39 table of contents subject to limited exceptions, any transferred additional shares over which mr. diller does not maintain sole voting control will be automatically converted into shares of expedia group common stock. all additional shares will be automatically converted into shares of expedia group common stock immediately following the earliest of (a) mr.
diller's death or disability; (b) such time as mr. diller no longer serves as chairman or senior executive of the company, other than as a result of his removal (other than for "cause" as defined in the new governance agreement)
or failure to be nominated or elected when he is willing to serve in such position; and (c) aggregate transfers by mr. diller (or certain limited permitted transferees of mr. diller) of original shares exceeding 5% of the outstanding voting power of the company. the automatic conversion features described above negotiated by the expedia group special committee and agreed to by mr. diller under the new governance agreement did not exist under the former governance agreement. additionally, subject to limited exception, no current or future holder of original shares or additional shares may participate in, or vote in favor of, or tender shares into, any change of control transaction involving at least 50% of the outstanding shares or voting power of capital stock of the company, unless such transaction provides for the same per share consideration and mix of consideration (or election right) and the same participation rights for shares of class b common stock and shares of expedia group common stock. these requirements negotiated by the expedia group special committee and agreed to by mr. diller under the new governance agreement did not exist under the former governance agreement. at the 2019 annual meeting of the company's stockholders, the company's stockholders approved a proposal to amend the company's certificate of incorporation to reflect the aforementioned transfer restrictions, automatic conversion provisions and change-of-
control restrictions reflected in the new governance agreement. the amendment was filed with the secretary of state of delaware on december 3, 2019, and became effective at 11:59 p.m., eastern time, on december 3, 2019. following the closing of the liberty expedia transaction, the company ceased to be a controlled company under the nasdaq stock market listing rules and is required to comply with all of nasdaq's corporate governance requirements on the phase-in schedule described below. on july 26, 2019, the company received notice from nasdaq confirming that the company no longer complied with nasdaq marketplace rule 5605(b)(1), which requires a majority of the company's board of directors to be composed of "independent directors" (as defined in nasdaq marketplace rule 5605(a)(2)).
within 12 months from ceasing to be a "controlled company," the company is required to have a majority of independent directors on the board of directors. additionally, the compensation committee is required to be composed of at least two members, one of whom is independent upon ceasing to be a "controlled company," a majority of whom is independent within 90 days of ceasing to be a "controlled company" and all members of which are independent within one year of ceasing to be a "controlled company." the nominating committee is required to include at least one member who is independent upon ceasing to be a "controlled company" and all members of which must be independent within one year of ceasing to be a "controlled company." currently, 7 of the 12 directors on the board of directors are independent (as defined in nasdaq marketplace rule 5605(a)(2)). the compensation committee currently consists of two members, each of whom is independent and the nominating committee currently consists of three members, two of whom are independent. the company is actively seeking to comply with the independent nominating committee rules, but is currently relying on the twelve-month phase-in period set forth in nasdaq's marketplace rule 5615(c)(3). while it is possible that mr. diller may at some point in the future beneficially own more than 50% of the outstanding voting power of the company, the provisions of the new governance agreement and the company's amended and restated certificate of incorporation provide that following one of the automatic conversion triggers mentioned above, the number of shares of class b common stock outstanding and acquired by mr. diller in the exchange or pursuant to the purchase/exchange right will not exceed approximately
5.5million shares of expedia group class b common stock, or approximately 29% of the total voting power of expedia group based on approximately 137million shares of expedia group common stock and approximately 5.5million shares of expedia group class b common stock outstanding as of december 31, 2019. further, as described above, the new governance agreement and the company's amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that, subject to limited exception, no current or future holder of original shares or additional shares may participate in, or vote or tender in favor of, any change of control transaction involving at least 50% of the outstanding shares of capital stock of the company, unless such transaction provides for the same per share consideration and mix of consideration (or election right) and the same participation rights for shares of expedia group class b common stock and shares of expedia group common stock. other agreements simultaneously with the company's entry into the merger agreement, certain additional related agreements were entered into, including: a stockholders agreement termination agreement by and among mr. diller, liberty expedia holdings and certain wholly owned subsidiaries of liberty expedia holdings, pursuant to which the stockholders agreement, including the diller proxy, terminated on july 26, 2019, upon the closing of the liberty expedia transaction; f- 40 table of contents a governance agreement termination agreement, by and among mr. diller, the company, liberty expedia holdings and certain wholly owned subsidiaries of liberty expedia holdings, pursuant to which the former governance agreement terminated on july 26,
2019, upon the closing of the liberty expedia transaction; an assumption and joinder agreement to tax sharing agreement by and among the company, liberty expedia holdings and qurate, pursuant to which the company agreed to assume, effective at the closing of the liberty expedia transaction, liberty expedia holdings' rights and obligations under the tax sharing agreement, dated as of november 4, 2016, by and between qurate and liberty expedia holdings; an assumption agreement concerning transaction agreement obligations by and among the company, liberty expedia holdings, qurate and the malone group, pursuant to which the company agreed to assume, effective at the closing of the liberty expedia transaction, certain of liberty expedia holdings' rights and obligations under the amended and restated transaction agreement, dated as of september 22, 2016, as amended by the letter agreement dated as of march 6, 2018, as further amended by amendment no. 2 to transaction agreement, dated as of april 15,
2019 (the "transaction agreement"), which survived the termination of the transaction agreement; and an assumption and joinder agreement to reorganization agreement by and among the company, liberty expedia holdings and qurate, pursuant to which the company agreed to assume, effective at the closing of the liberty expedia transaction, liberty expedia holdings' rights and obligations under the reorganization agreement, dated as of october 26, 2016, by and between qurate and liberty expedia holdings. iac/interactivecorp in addition to serving as our chairman and senior executive, mr. diller also serves as chairman of the board of directors and senior executive at iac. the company and iac are related parties, insofar as mr. diller serves as chairman and senior executive of both expedia group and iac. each of iac and expedia group has a 50% ownership interest in two aircraft that may be used by both companies. we share equally in fixed and nonrecurring costs for the planes; direct operating costs are pro-rated based on actual usage. in addition, in april 2019, expedia group and iac entered into an agreement to jointly acquire a new corporate aircraft for a total expected cost of approximately $ 72million (including purchase and related costs), which will be split evenly between the two companies. in 2019, we paid $ 23million (50% of the purchase price and refurbishment costs paid to date) for our interest. the respective share of the balance is due upon delivery of the new aircraft, which is expected to occur in early 2021. as of december 31, 2019 and 2018, the net basis in our ownership interest in the planes was $ 53million and $ 33million , respectively, recorded in long-
term investments and other assets. in 2019, 2018 and 2017, operating and maintenance costs paid directly to the jointly-owned subsidiary for the airplanes were nominal. note 20 - segment information we have four reportable segments: core ota, trivago, vrbo (previously referred to as our "homeaway" segment) and egencia. our core ota segment, which consists of the aggregation of operating segments, provides a full range of travel and advertising services to our worldwide customers through a variety of brands including: expedia.com and hotels.com in the united states and localized expedia and hotels.com websites throughout the world, expedia partner solutions, orbitz, travelocity, wotif group, ebookers, cheaptickets, hotwire.com, carrentals.com, classic vacations and silverrail technologies, inc. our trivago segment generates advertising revenue primarily from sending referrals to online travel companies and travel service providers from its hotel metasearch websites. our vrbo segment operates an online marketplace for the alternative accommodations industry. our egencia segment provides managed travel services to corporate customers worldwide. we determined our operating segments based on how our chief operating decision makers manage our business, make operating decisions and evaluate operating performance. our primary operating metric is adjusted ebitda. adjusted ebitda for our core ota and egencia segments includes allocations of certain expenses, primarily cost of revenue and facilities. our core ota segment includes the total costs of our global supply organizations and core ota and vrbo include the realized foreign currency gains or losses related to the forward contracts hedging a component of our net merchant lodging revenue. we base the allocations primarily on transaction volumes and other usage metrics. we do not allocate certain shared expenses such as accounting, human resources, information technology and legal to our reportable segments. we include these expenses in corporate and eliminations. our allocation methodology is periodically evaluated and may change. our segment disclosure includes intersegment revenues, which primarily consist of advertising and media services provided by our trivago segment to our core ota segment. these intersegment transactions are recorded by each segment at amounts that approximate fair value as if the transactions were between third parties, and therefore, impact segment performance. however, the revenue and corresponding expense are eliminated in consolidation. the elimination of such intersegment transactions is included within corporate and eliminations in the table below. in addition, when vrbo properties are booked through our core ota websites and vice versa, the segments split the third-party revenue for management and f- 41 table of contents segment reporting purposes with the majority of the third-party revenue residing with the website marketing the property or room.
corporate and eliminations also includes unallocated corporate functions and expenses as well as bodybuilding.com subsequent to our acquisition on july 26, 2019. in addition, we record amortization of intangible assets and any related impairment, as well as stock-based compensation expense, restructuring and related reorganization charges, legal reserves, occupancy tax and other, and other items excluded from segment operating performance in corporate and eliminations. such amounts are detailed in our segment reconciliation below.
the following tables present our segment information for 2019 , 2018 and 2017 . as a significant portion of our property and equipment is not allocated to our operating segments and depreciation is not included in our segment measure, we do not report the assets by segment as it would not be meaningful. we do not regularly provide such information to our chief operating decision makers.

management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" in part ii, item 7 of the company's annual report on form 10-k for the fiscal year ended december 31, 2018. all percentages within this section are calculated on actual, unrounded numbers. trends the travel industry, including offline agencies, online agencies and other suppliers of travel products and services, has historically been characterized by intense competition, as well as rapid and significant change. generally, 2017 and 2018 represented years of continuing growth for the travel industry. while 2019 has seen continued growth for the industry, it has been at a slower pace than in prior years.
additionally, political instability, geopolitical conflicts, acts of terrorism, significant fluctuations in currency values, sovereign debt issues, natural disasters, macroeconomic concerns and particularly the impact of the 2019 novel coronavirus outbreak are examples of events that contribute to a somewhat uncertain environment, which could have a negative impact on the travel industry in the future. with respect to the 2019 novel coronavirus outbreak specifically, we currently expect that our first quarter 2020 financial results will be negatively impacted, potentially to a material degree. in addition, as of the time of this annual report on form 10-k, we expect that the 2019 novel coronavirus will continue to negatively impact our businesses beyond the first quarter of 2020, but the extent and duration of such impacts over the longer term remain uncertain and dependent on future developments that cannot be accurately predicted at this time, such as the severity and transmission rate of the coronavirus, the extent and effectiveness of containment actions taken, including mobility restrictions, and the impact of these and other factors on travel behavior. for additional information about our growth strategy for expedia group, see the disclosure set forth in part i, item 1, business, under the caption "growth strategy."
online travel increased usage and familiarity with the internet are driving rapid growth in online penetration of travel expenditures. according to phocuswright, an independent travel, tourism and hospitality research firm, in
2020, approximately 50% of u.s. and european leisure and unmanaged corporate travel expenditures are expected to occur online. online penetration rates in the emerging markets, such as asia pacific and latin american regions, are lagging behind that of the united states and europe. these penetration rates increased over the past few years, and are expected to continue growing, which presents an attractive growth opportunity for our business, while also attracting many competitors to online travel. this competition intensified in recent years, and the industry is expected to remain highly competitive for the foreseeable future. in addition to the growth of online travel agencies, we see increased interest in the online travel industry from search engine companies such as google, evidenced by continued product enhancements, including new trip planning features for users and the integration of its various travel products into the google travel offering, as well as further prioritizing its own products in search results. competitive entrants such as "metasearch" companies, including kayak.com (owned by booking holdings), trivago (in which expedia group owns a majority interest) as well as tripadvisor, introduced differentiated features, pricing and content compared with the legacy online travel agency companies, as well as various forms of direct or assisted booking tools. further, airlines and lodging companies are aggressively pursuing direct online distribution of their products and services. in addition, the increasing popularity of the
businesses such as airbnb, vrbo (previously homeaway, which expedia group acquired in december 2015) and booking.com (owned by booking holdings) have emerged as the leaders, bringing incremental alternative accommodation and vacation rental inventory to the market. many other competitors, including vacation rental metasearch players, continue to emerge in this space, which is expected to continue to grow as a percentage of the global accommodation market. finally, traditional consumer ecommerce and group buying websites expanded their local offerings into the travel market by adding 37 table of contents hotel offers to their websites. for additional detail regarding the competitive trends and risks we face, see part i item 1 business - "competition," and part i, item 1a, risk factors
- "we operate in an increasingly competitive global environment." the online travel industry also saw the development of alternative business models and variations in the timing of payment by travelers and to suppliers, which in some cases place pressure on historical business models. in particular, the agency hotel model saw rapid adoption in europe. expedia group facilitates both merchant (expedia collect) and agency (hotel collect) hotel offerings with our hotel supply partners through both agency-only contracts as well as our hybrid etp program, which offers travelers the choice of whether to pay expedia group at the time of booking or pay the hotel at the time of stay. intense competition also historically led to aggressive marketing efforts by the travel suppliers and intermediaries, and a meaningful unfavorable impact on our overall marketing efficiencies and operating margins. we manage our marketing spending on a brand basis, making decisions in each applicable market that we think are appropriate based on the relative growth opportunity and the expected returns and the competitive environment. in certain cases, particularly in many international markets, we are pursuing and expect to continue to pursue long-
term growth opportunities for which our marketing efficiency is less favorable than that for our consolidated business, but for which we still believe the opportunity to be attractive. in addition, the crowded online travel environment is now driving certain secondary and tertiary online travel companies to establish marketing agreements with global players in order to leverage distribution and technology capabilities while focusing resources on capturing traveler mind share. for more detail, see part i, item 1a, risk factors - "we rely on the value of our brands, and the cost of maintaining and enhancing our brand awareness are increasing" and "our international operations involve additional risks and our exposure to these risks will increase as our business expands globally." lodging lodging includes hotel accommodations and alternative accommodations. as a percentage of our total worldwide revenue in 2019, lodging accounted for 70%. our room night growth has been healthy, with room nights growing 16% in 2017, 13% in 2018, and 11% in 2019. adrs for rooms booked on expedia group websites increased
3% in 2017, 5% in 2018, and decreased 1% in 2019. the decrease in 2019 was primarily due to the negative impact of foreign exchange. more recently, we have seen pressure on a local currency basis on adrs, similar to the recent trends for hotel companies. hotel. we generate the majority of our revenue through the facilitation of hotel reservations (stand-alone and package bookings). although our relationships with our hotel supply partners remained broadly stable in the past few years, as part of the global rollout of etp, we reduced negotiated economics in certain instances to compensate for hotel supply partners absorbing expenses such as credit card fees and customer service costs, which has negatively impacted the margin of revenue we earn per booking. in addition, as we continue to expand the breadth and depth of our global hotel offering, in some cases we have reduced our economics in various geographies based on local market conditions. these impacts are due to specific initiatives intended to drive greater global size and scale through faster overall room night growth. additionally, increased promotional activities such as growing loyalty programs contribute to declines in revenue per room night and profitability.
since our hotel supplier agreements are generally negotiated on a percentage basis, any increase or decrease in adrs has an impact on the revenue we earn per room night. over the course of the last several years, occupancies and adrs in the lodging industry generally increased on a currency-neutral basis in a gradually improving overall travel environment. current occupancy rates for hotels in the united states remain high compared to historical levels; however, u.s. hotel supply has continued to grow, which may put additional pressure on adrs. in addition, macroeconomic factors could also influence adr trends. in some international markets, hotel supply is being added at a faster rate as hotel owners and operators try to take advantage of opportunities in faster growing regions. in addition, the increase in alternative accommodations space could pressure hotel adrs. further, while the global lodging industry remains very fragmented, there has been consolidation in the hotel space among chains as well as ownership groups. in the meantime, certain hotel chains have been focusing on driving direct bookings on their own websites and mobile applications by advertising lower rates than those available on third-party websites as well as incentives such as loyalty points, increased or exclusive product availability and complimentary wi-fi. we have continued to add supply to our global lodging marketplace with nearly 1.6 million properties on our global websites as of december 31, 2019, including over 765,000 integrated vrbo alternative accommodations listings. alternative accommodations. with our acquisition of vrbo (previously homeaway) and all of its brands in december 2015, we expanded into the fast growing alternative accommodations market. vrbo is a leader in this market and represents an attractive growth opportunity for expedia group. vrbo has been undergoing a transition from a listings-based classified advertising model to an online transactional model that optimizes for both travelers and homeowner and property manager partners, with a goal of increasing monetization and driving growth through investments in marketing as well as in product and technology. vrbo offers hosts subscription-based listing or pay-per-booking service models. it also generates revenue from a traveler service fee for bookings. as of december 31, 2019, there are over 2.1 million online bookable listings available on vrbo. in addition, we have actively moved to integrate vrbo listings into our global ota services, as well as directly add 38 table of contents alternative accommodation listings to our offerings, to position our key global brands to offer a full range of lodging options for consumers. air significant airline sector consolidation in the united states in recent years generally resulted in lower overall capacity and higher fares, which combined with the significant declines in fuel prices led to record levels of profitability for the u.s. air carriers, further strengthening their position. however, in 2017 and into
2018, there was evidence of discounting by the u.s. carriers while currency headwinds and weaker macroeconomic trends put pressure on international results. starting in the second half of 2018, there has been evidence of modest fare increases. the airline industry experienced more constrained supply, particularly in the second half of
2019, which was also a factor. it remains unclear if this trend will continue. ticket prices on expedia group websites declined 1% in 2017, increased 2% in 2018, and were flat in 2019. based on airline reports, demand for airline tickets seems to be strong, helping increase air revenue globally. there is significant correlation between airline revenue and fuel prices, and fluctuations in fuel prices generally take time to be reflected in air revenue. given current volatility, it is uncertain how fuel prices could impact airfares. we could encounter pressure on air remuneration as air carriers combine, certain supply agreements renew, and as we continue to add airlines to ensure local coverage in new markets. air ticket volumes increased 4% in 2017, 5% in 2018, and 7% in
2019. as a percentage of our total worldwide revenue in 2019, air accounted for 7%. advertising & media our advertising and media business is principally driven by revenue generated by trivago, a leading hotel metasearch website, in addition to expedia group media solutions, which is responsible for generating advertising revenue on our global online travel brands. in 2019, we generated a total of $1.1 billion of advertising and media revenue, a slight increase from 2018, representing 9% of our total worldwide revenue. in 2018, trivago shifted its operational focus, reducing marketing spend to better balance revenue and profit growth. the lower marketing spend negatively impacted revenue growth, while benefiting profitability. this trend continued in 2019. seasonality we generally experience seasonal fluctuations in the demand for our travel services. for example, traditional leisure travel bookings are generally the highest in the first three quarters as travelers plan and book their spring, summer and winter holiday travel. the number of bookings typically decreases in the fourth quarter. because revenue for most of our travel services, including merchant and agency hotel, is recognized as the travel takes place rather than when it is booked, revenue typically lags bookings by several weeks for our hotel business and can be several months or more for our alternative accommodations business. historically, vrbo has seen seasonally stronger bookings in the first quarter of the year, with the relevant stays occurring during the peak summer travel months.
the seasonal revenue impact is exacerbated with respect to income by the nature of our variable cost of revenue and direct sales and marketing costs, which we typically realize in closer alignment to booking volumes, and the more stable nature of our fixed costs. furthermore, operating profits for our primary advertising business, trivago, have typically been experienced in the second half of the year, particularly the fourth quarter, as selling and marketing costs offset revenue in the first half of the year as we typically increase marketing during the busy booking period for spring, summer and winter holiday travel. as a result on a consolidated basis, revenue and income are typically the lowest in the first quarter and highest in the third quarter. the continued growth of our international operations, advertising business or a change in our product mix, including the growth of vrbo, may influence the typical trend of the seasonality in the future, and there may also be business or market driven dynamics that result in short-term impacts to revenue or profitability that differ from the typical seasonal trends. as vrbo has further shifted to a predominately transaction-based business model for alternative accommodations listings and due to its elongated booking window, its seasonal trends are more pronounced than our other traditional leisure businesses. critical accounting policies and estimates critical accounting policies and estimates are those that we believe are important in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements because they require that we use judgment and estimates in applying those policies. we prepare our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states ("gaap"). preparation of the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements as well as revenue and expenses during the periods reported. we base our estimates on historical experience, where applicable, and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. actual results may differ from our estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 39 table of contents there are certain critical estimates that we believe require significant judgment in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. we consider an accounting estimate to be critical if:
•  it requires us to make an assumption because information was not available at the time or it included matters that were highly uncertain at the time we were making the estimate; and
•  changes in the estimate or different estimates that we could have selected may have had a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations.
for more information on each of these policies, see note 2 - significant accounting policies , in the notes to consolidated financial statements. we discuss information about the nature and rationale for our critical accounting estimates below. accounting for certain merchant revenue we accrue the cost of certain merchant revenue based on the amount we expect to be billed by suppliers. in certain instances when a supplier invoices us for less than the cost we accrued, we generally reduce our merchant accounts payable and the supplier costs within net revenue six months in arrears, net of an allowance, when we determine it is not probable that we will be required to pay the supplier, based on historical experience. actual revenue could be greater or less than the amounts estimated due to changes in hotel billing practices or changes in traveler behavior. deferred loyalty rewards we offer certain internally administered traveler loyalty programs to our customers, such as our hotels.com rewards program, our expedia rewards program and our orbitz rewards program. hotels.com rewards offers travelers one free night at any hotels.com partner property after that traveler stays 10 nights, subject to certain restrictions.
expedia rewards enables participating travelers to earn points on all hotel, flight, package and activities made on over 40 brand expedia websites. orbitz rewards allows travelers to earn orbucks, the currency of orbitz rewards, on flights, hotels and vacation packages and instantly redeem those orbucks on future bookings at various hotels worldwide. as travelers accumulate points towards free travel products, we defer the relative standalone selling price of earned points, net of expected breakage, as deferred loyalty rewards within deferred merchant bookings on the consolidated balance sheet. in order to estimate the standalone selling price of the underlying services on which points can be redeemed for all loyalty programs, we use an adjusted market assessment approach and consider the redemption values expected from the traveler. we then estimate the number of rewards that will not be redeemed based on historical activity in our members' accounts as well as statistical modeling techniques. revenue is recognized when we have satisfied our performance obligation relating to the points, that is when the travel service purchased with the loyalty award is satisfied. both the actual standalone selling price of the underlying services and ultimate redemption rates could differ materially from our estimates due to a number of factors, including fluctuations in reward value, product utilization and divergence from historical member behavior.
business combinations we assign the value of the consideration transferred to acquire a business to the tangible assets and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed on the basis of their fair values at the date of acquisition. any excess purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired is allocated to goodwill. when determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, management makes significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. critical estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from customer relationships and trade names, and discount rates. management's estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates. recoverability of goodwill and indefinite and definite-lived intangible assets goodwill . we assess goodwill for impairment annually as of october 1, or more frequently, if events and circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred. in the evaluation of goodwill for impairment, we typically perform a quantitative assessment and compare the fair value of the reporting unit to the carrying value and, if applicable, record an impairment charge based on the excess of the reporting unit's carrying amount over its fair value. periodically, we may choose to perform a qualitative assessment, prior to performing the quantitative analysis, to determine whether the fair value of the goodwill is more likely than not impaired. we generally base our measurement of fair value of reporting units on a blended analysis of the present value of future discounted cash flows and market valuation approach with the exception of our standalone publicly traded subsidiary, which is based on market valuation. the discounted cash flows model indicates the fair value of the reporting units based on the present 40 table of contents value of the cash flows that we expect the reporting units to generate in the future. our significant estimates in the discounted cash flows model include: our weighted average cost of capital;
long-term rate of growth and profitability of our business; and working capital effects. the market valuation approach indicates the fair value of the business based on a comparison of the company to comparable publicly traded firms in similar lines of business. our significant estimates in the market approach model include identifying similar companies with comparable business factors such as size, growth, profitability, risk and return on investment and assessing comparable revenue and operating income multiples in estimating the fair value of the reporting units. we believe the weighted use of discounted cash flows and market approach is the best method for determining the fair value of our reporting units because these are the most common valuation methodologies used within the travel and internet industries; and the blended use of both models compensates for the inherent risks associated with either model if used on a stand-alone basis. in addition to measuring the fair value of our reporting units as described above, we consider the combined carrying and fair values of our reporting units in relation to the company's total fair value of equity plus debt as of the assessment date. our equity value assumes our fully diluted market capitalization, using either the stock price on the valuation date or the average stock price over a range of dates around the valuation date, plus an estimated acquisition premium which is based on observable transactions of comparable companies. the debt value is based on the highest value expected to be paid to repurchase the debt, which can be fair value, principal or principal plus a premium depending on the terms of each debt instrument. indefinite-lived intangible assets . we base our measurement of fair value of indefinite-
lived intangible assets, which primarily consist of trade name and trademarks, using the relief-from-royalty method. this method assumes that the trade name and trademarks have value to the extent that their owner is relieved of the obligation to pay royalties for the benefits received from them. this method requires us to estimate the future revenue for the related brands, the appropriate royalty rate and the weighted average cost of capital. definite-lived intangible assets. we review the carrying value of long-lived assets or asset groups to be used in operations whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable. factors that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used, a significant adverse change in legal factors or the business climate that could affect the value of the asset, or a significant decline in the observable market value of an asset, among others. if such facts indicate a potential impairment, we would assess the recoverability of an asset group by determining if the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the sum of the projected undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the assets over the remaining economic life of the primary asset in the asset group. if the recoverability test indicates that the carrying value of the asset group is not recoverable, we will estimate the fair value of the asset group using appropriate valuation methodologies, which would typically include an estimate of discounted cash flows. any impairment would be measured as the difference between the asset groups carrying amount and its estimated fair value. the use of different estimates or assumptions in determining the fair value of our goodwill, indefinite-lived and definite-lived intangible assets may result in different values for these assets, which could result in an impairment or, in the period in which an impairment is recognized, could result in a materially different impairment charge. income taxes we record income taxes under the liability method. deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect our estimation of the future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for book and tax purposes. we determine deferred income taxes based on the differences in accounting methods and timing between financial statement and income tax reporting. accordingly, we determine the deferred tax asset or liability for each temporary difference based on the enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when we realize the underlying items of income and expense. we consider many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of our deferred tax assets, including our recent earnings experience by jurisdiction, expectations of future taxable income, and the carryforward periods available to us for tax reporting purposes, as well as other relevant factors. we may establish a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount we believe is more likely than not to be realized. due to inherent complexities arising from the nature of our businesses, future changes in income tax law, tax sharing agreements or variances between our actual and anticipated operating results, we make certain judgments and estimates. therefore, actual income taxes could materially vary from these estimates. we record liabilities to address uncertain tax positions we have taken in previously filed tax returns or that we expect to take in a future tax return. the determination for required liabilities is based upon an analysis of each individual tax position, taking into consideration whether it is more likely than not that our tax position, based on technical merits, will be sustained upon examination. for those positions for which we conclude it is more likely than not it will be sustained, we recognize the 41 table of contents largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the taxing authority. the difference between the amount recognized and the total tax position is recorded as a liability. the ultimate resolution of these tax positions may be greater or less than the liabilities recorded. other long-term liabilities various legal and tax contingencies . we record liabilities to address potential exposures related to business and tax positions we have taken that have been or could be challenged by taxing authorities. in addition, we record liabilities associated with legal proceedings and lawsuits. these liabilities are recorded when the likelihood of payment is probable and the amounts can be reasonably estimated. the determination for required liabilities is based upon analysis of each individual tax issue, or legal proceeding, taking into consideration the likelihood of adverse judgments and the range of possible loss. in addition, our analysis may be based on discussions with outside legal counsel. the ultimate resolution of these potential tax exposures and legal proceedings may be greater or less than the liabilities recorded. occupancy and other taxes . some states and localities impose taxes (e.g. transient occupancy, accommodation tax, sales tax and/or business privilege tax) on the use or occupancy of hotel accommodations or other traveler services. generally, hotels collect taxes based on the rate paid to the hotel and remit these taxes to the various tax authorities. when a customer books a room through one of our travel services, we collect a tax recovery charge from the customer which we pay to the hotel.
we calculate the tax recovery charge by applying the applicable tax rate supplied to us by the hotels to the amount that the hotel has agreed to receive for the rental of the room by the consumer. in most jurisdictions, we do not collect or remit taxes, nor do we pay taxes to the hotel operator, on the portion of the customer payment we retain. some jurisdictions have questioned our practice in this regard. while the applicable tax provisions vary among the jurisdictions, we generally believe that we are not required to pay such taxes. more recently, a limited number of taxing jurisdictions have made similar claims against vrbo for tax amounts due on the rental amounts charged by owners of alternative accommodations properties or for taxes on vrbo's services. vrbo is an intermediary between a traveler and a party renting an alternative accommodations property and we believe is similarly not liable for such taxes. we are engaged in discussions with tax authorities in various jurisdictions to resolve these issues. some tax authorities have brought lawsuits or have levied assessments asserting that we are required to collect and remit tax. the ultimate resolution in all jurisdictions cannot be determined at this time. certain jurisdictions may require us to pay tax assessments, including occupancy and other transactional tax assessments, prior to contesting any such assessments. we have established a reserve for the potential settlement of issues related to hotel occupancy and other tax litigation for prior and current periods, consistent with applicable accounting principles and in light of all current facts and circumstances. a variety of factors could affect the amount of the liability (both past and future), which factors include, but are not limited to, the number of, and amount of revenue represented by, jurisdictions that ultimately assert a claim and prevail in assessing such additional tax or negotiate a settlement and changes in relevant statutes. we note that there are more than 10,000
taxing jurisdictions in the united states, and it is not feasible to analyze the statutes, regulations and judicial and administrative rulings in every jurisdiction. rather, we have obtained the advice of state and local tax experts with respect to tax laws of certain states and local jurisdictions that represent a large portion of our hotel revenue. many of the statutes and regulations that impose these taxes were established before the emergence of the internet and ecommerce. certain jurisdictions have enacted, and others may enact, legislation regarding the imposition of taxes on businesses that arrange the booking of hotel or alternative accommodations. we continue to work with the relevant tax authorities and legislators to clarify our obligations under new and emerging laws and regulations. we will continue to monitor the issue closely and provide additional disclosure, as well as adjust the level of reserves, as developments warrant. additionally, certain of our businesses are involved in tax related litigation, which is discussed in part i, item 3, legal proceedings. recent occupancy tax developments are also discussed below under the caption "occupancy and other taxes." stock-based compensation historically, our primary form of employee stock-based compensation was stock option awards. our employee stock options consist of service based awards, some of which also have market-based vesting conditions. we measure the value of stock option awards on the date of grant at fair value using the appropriate valuation techniques, including the black-scholes and monte carlo option-pricing models, for awards that contain market-based vesting conditions. we amortize the fair value over the remaining explicit vesting term in the case of service-based awards and the longer of the derived service period or the explicit service period for awards with market conditions, on a straight-line basis. we account for forfeitures as they occur. the pricing models require various highly judgmental assumptions including volatility and expected option term. if any of the assumptions used in the models change significantly, stock-based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period. 42 table of contents new accounting pronouncements for a discussion of new accounting pronouncements, see note 2 - significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements. occupancy and other taxes we are currently involved in ten lawsuits brought by or against states, cities and counties over issues involving the payment of hotel occupancy and other taxes. we continue to defend these lawsuits vigorously. with respect to the principal claims in these matters, we believe that the statutes and/or ordinances at issue do not apply to us or the services we provide and, therefore, that we do not owe the taxes that are claimed to be owed. we believe that the statutes and ordinances at issue generally impose occupancy and other taxes on entities that own, operate or control hotels
(or similar businesses) or furnish or provide hotel rooms or other accommodations. recent developments include:
pine bluff, arkansas litigation.on december 12, 2019, the arkansas supreme court dismissed the defendant online travel companies' appeal from the trial court's summary judgment decision as premature and remanded
•  for further proceedings in the trial court.

for additional information on these and other legal proceedings, see part i, item 3, legal proceedings. we have established a reserve for the potential settlement of issues related to hotel occupancy and other tax litigation, consistent with applicable accounting principles and in light of all current facts and circumstances, in the amount of $48 million as of december 31, 2019 and $46 million as of december 31, 2018 . certain jurisdictions, including without limitation the states of new york, new jersey, north carolina, minnesota, oregon, rhode island, maryland, pennsylvania, hawaii, iowa, massachusetts, arizona, wisconsin, idaho, the city of new york, and the district of columbia, have enacted legislation seeking to tax online travel company services as part of sales or other taxes for hotel and/or other accommodations and/or car rental. in addition, in certain jurisdictions, we have entered into voluntary collection agreements pursuant to which we have agreed to voluntarily collect and remit taxes to state and/or local taxing jurisdictions. we are currently remitting taxes to a number of jurisdictions, including without limitation the states of new york, new jersey, south carolina, north carolina, minnesota, georgia, wyoming, west virginia, oregon, rhode island, montana, maryland, kentucky, maine, new jersey, pennsylvania, hawaii, iowa, massachusetts, arizona, wisconsin, idaho, colorado, the city of new york and the district of columbia, as well as certain other jurisdictions. pay-to-play certain jurisdictions may assert that we are required to pay any assessed taxes prior to being allowed to contest or litigate the applicability of the ordinances. this prepayment of contested taxes is referred to as "pay-to-play." payment of these amounts is not an admission that we believe we are subject to such taxes and, even when such payments are made, we continue to defend our position vigorously. if we prevail in the litigation, for which a pay-to-play payment was made, the jurisdiction collecting the payment will be required to repay such amounts and also may be required to pay interest. however, any significant pay-to-
play payment or litigation loss could negatively impact our liquidity. for additional information, see note 17 -

trivago, which is comprised of a hotel metasearch business that differs from our transaction-based

the increase in worldwide gross bookings in 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily due to growth in the core ota segment, including growth at expedia partner solutions, which includes the benefit from enterprise deals launched in late 2018, and hotels.com. 44 table of contents results of operations revenue year ended december

lodging revenue increased 10% in 2019 on an 11% increase in room nights stayed driven by growth in hotels.com, expedia partner solutions and brand expedia, partially offset by a 1% decrease in revenue per room night. air revenue decreased 1% in 2019 on an 8% decrease in revenue per ticket, mostly offset by a 7% increase in air tickets sold. the decrease in revenue per ticket was primarily related to changes in classification of certain fees, a shift in product mix and a negative impact from foreign exchange. the increase in air tickets sold was driven by growth at expedia partner solutions, largely related to enterprise deals launched in late 2018. advertising and media revenue increased 1% in 2019 due to growth at expedia group media solutions, largely offset by declines in local currency revenue at trivago as well as negative impacts from foreign exchange. all other revenue, which includes car rental, insurance, destination services, fees related to our corporate travel business and revenue related to bodybuilding.com, increased by 6% in 2019 benefiting from the inorganic impact related to the acquisition of bodybuilding.com and the reclassification of certain partner fees from air revenue. in addition to the above segment and product revenue discussion, our revenue by business model is as follows:

rate our effective tax rate for 2019 was higher than the 21% federal statutory income tax rate due to state income taxes, foreign income taxed at higher than the federal statutory tax rate, as well as losses in foreign jurisdictions for which we do not record a tax benefit. our effective tax rate for 2018 was lower than the 21%
federal statutory rate primarily due to earnings in foreign jurisdictions outside of the united states, predominately switzerland, where our statutory income tax rate is lower, as well as excess tax benefits related to stock-based payments and foreign-derived intangible income ("fdii"). the increase in our effective tax rate for
2019 compared to 2018 was due to an increase in u.s. federal and state taxable income as a result of an internal reorganization. we are subject to taxation in the united states and various other state and foreign jurisdictions.
during 2017, the internal revenue service ("irs") issued proposed adjustments related to transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries for our 2009 to 49 table of contents 2010 audit cycle. on july 12, 2019, we settled the audit for an immaterial impact to the consolidated financial statements. in addition, we are under examination by the irs for our 2011 through 2013 tax years. during the fourth quarter of 2019, the irs issued final adjustments related to transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries for our 2011 to 2013 audit cycle. the proposed adjustments would increase our u.s. taxable income by $696 million, which would result in federal tax of approximately $244 million subject to interest. we do not agree with the position of the irs and are formally protesting the irs position.
subsequent years remain open to examination by the irs. we do not anticipate a significant impact to our gross unrecognized tax benefits within the next 12 months related to these years. for additional information including additional information on the impacts of the tax act, see note 11 - income taxes in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. definition and reconciliation of adjusted ebitda we report adjusted ebitda as a supplemental measure to u.s. generally accepted accounting principles ("gaap"). adjusted ebitda is among the primary metrics by which management evaluates the performance of the business and on which internal budgets are based. management believes that investors should have access to the same set of tools that management uses to analyze our results.
this non-gaap measure should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with gaap, but should not be considered a substitute for or superior to gaap. adjusted ebitda has certain limitations in that it does not take into account the impact of certain expenses to our consolidated statements of operations. we endeavor to compensate for the limitation of the non-gaap measure presented by also providing the most directly comparable gaap measure and a description of the reconciling items and adjustments to derive the non-gaap measure. adjusted ebitda also excludes certain items related to transactional tax matters, which may ultimately be settled in cash, and we urge investors to review the detailed disclosure regarding these matters included above, in the legal proceedings section, as well as the notes to the financial statements. the non-gaap financial measure used by the company may be calculated differently from, and therefore may not be comparable to, similarly titled measures used by other companies. adjusted ebitda is defined as net income (loss) attributable to expedia group, inc. adjusted for (1) net income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interests; (2) provision for income taxes; (3) total other expenses, net; (4) stock-based compensation expense, including compensation expense related to certain subsidiary equity plans; (5) acquisition-related impacts, including (i) amortization of intangible assets and goodwill and intangible asset impairment, (ii) gains (losses) recognized on changes in the value of contingent consideration arrangements, if any, and (iii) upfront consideration paid to settle employee compensation plans of the acquiree, if any; (6)
certain other items, including restructuring; (7) items included in legal reserves, occupancy tax and other; (8)
that portion of gains (losses) on revenue hedging activities that are included in other, net that relate to revenue recognized in the period; and (9) depreciation. the above items are excluded from our adjusted ebitda measure because these items are noncash in nature, or because the amount and timing of these items is unpredictable, not driven by core operating results and renders comparisons with prior periods and competitors less meaningful. we believe adjusted ebitda is a useful measure for analysts and investors to evaluate our future on-going performance as this measure allows a more meaningful comparison of our performance and projected cash earnings with our historical results from prior periods and to the results of our competitors. moreover, our management uses this measure internally to evaluate the performance of our business as a whole and our individual business segments. in addition, we believe that by excluding certain items, such as stock-based compensation and acquisition-related impacts, adjusted ebitda corresponds more closely to the cash operating income generated from our business and allows investors to gain an understanding of the factors and trends affecting the ongoing cash earnings capabilities of our business, from which capital investments are made and debt is serviced. 50 table of contents the reconciliation of net income attributable to expedia group, inc. to adjusted ebitda is as follows:

"watch negative" and fitch's rating was bbb with an outlook of "stable." changes in our operating results, cash flows, financial position, capital structure, financial policy or capital allocations to share repurchase, dividends, investments and acquisitions could impact the ratings assigned by the various rating agencies. should our credit ratings be adjusted downward, we may incur higher costs to borrow and/or limited to access to capital markets, which could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations. 51 table of contents as of december 31, 2019 , we were in compliance with the covenants and conditions in our revolving credit facility and outstanding debt, which was comprised of $750 million in registered senior unsecured notes due in august 2020 that bear interest at 5.95% (the "5.95% notes"), $500 million in registered senior unsecured notes due in august 2024 that bear interest at 4.5% (the "4.5% notes"), euro 650 million of registered senior unsecured notes due in june 2022 that bear interest at 2.5% (the "2.5% notes"), $750 million of registered senior unsecured notes due in february 2026 that bear interest at 5.0% ("the 5.0% notes") and the $1 billion of registered senior unsecured notes due in february 2028 that bear interest at 3.8% ("the 3.8% notes") and the 3.25% notes. under the merchant model, we receive cash from travelers at the time of booking and we record these amounts on our consolidated balance sheets as deferred merchant bookings. we pay our airline suppliers related to these merchant model bookings generally within a few weeks after completing the transaction, but we are liable for the full value of such transactions until the flights are completed. for most other merchant bookings, which is primarily our merchant lodging business, we generally pay after the travelers' use and, in some cases, subsequent to billing from the hotel suppliers. therefore, generally we receive cash from the traveler prior to paying our supplier, and this operating cycle represents a working capital source of cash to us. as long as the merchant hotel business grows, we expect that changes in working capital related to merchant hotel transactions will positively impact operating cash flows. however, we are using both the merchant model and the agency model in many of our markets. if the merchant hotel model declines relative to our other business models that generally consume working capital such as agency hotel, managed corporate travel, advertising or certain expedia partner solutions relationships, or if there are changes to the merchant model, supplier payment terms, including programs where we remit payment to suppliers in advance of the travelers stay, or booking patterns that compress the time period between our receipt of cash from travelers and our payment to suppliers, our overall working capital benefits could be reduced, eliminated or even reversed. our future working capital benefits could also be impacted by vrbo's continued shift to become the merchant of record on more of its transactions. seasonal fluctuations in our merchant hotel bookings affect the timing of our annual cash flows. during the first half of the year, hotel bookings have traditionally exceeded stays, resulting in much higher cash flow related to working capital. during the second half of the year, this pattern reverses and cash flows are typically negative. while we expect the impact of seasonal fluctuations to continue, merchant hotel growth rates, changes to the model or booking patterns, changes in the relative mix of merchant hotel transactions compared with transactions in our working capital consuming businesses, including etp, as well as the transformation of the vrbo's alternative accommodation listing business, may counteract or intensify the anticipated seasonal fluctuations. as of december 31, 2019 , we had a deficit in our working capital of $3.0
billion , compared to a deficit of $2.9 billion as of december 31, 2018 . we will continue to invest in capital at similar to increasing levels over time to improve our technology platforms, infrastructure, operational capabilities, and in the development of service offerings and expansion of our operations. in addition to the capital requirements in support of our business strategy, our future capital requirements may also include capital needs for acquisitions (including purchases of non-controlling interest), share repurchases, or dividend payments among others; thus reducing our cash balance and/or increasing our debt. for the new headquarters, we expect to spend approximately $900 million. of the total, approximately $290 million was spent between 2016 and 2018, and approximately $390 million was spent during 2019. during full year 2020, we expect to spend approximately $220

on cash and cash equivalents in 2019 , net cash provided by operating activities increased by $792 million primarily due to increase in benefits from working capital changes mainly due to higher deferred merchant bookings at vrbo as it transitioned to the expedia group payment platform. 52 table of contents in 2019 , $994 million more cash was used in investing activities primarily due to net purchases of investments of $494 million in 2019 compared to net sales of investments of $334 million in 2018 and higher current year capital expenditures, including amounts related to our new corporate headquarters. cash provided by financing activities in 2019 primarily included $1.231 billion of net proceeds for the issuance of the 3.25% notes in september 2019 as well as $301 million of proceeds from the exercise of options and employee stock purchase plans, partially offset by $400 million payment of debt assumed in the liberty expedia transaction, cash dividend payments of $195 million and cash paid to acquire shares of $743
million , including the repurchased shares under the authorization discussed below as well as $24 million for repurchases with respect to the liberty expedia holdings transaction. cash used in financing activities in 2018
$186 million cash dividend payment, partially offset by $166 million of proceeds from the exercise of options and employee stock purchase plans. during 2019, 2012, 2010, and 2006, our board of directors, or the executive committee, acting on behalf of the board of directors, authorized a repurchase of up to 20 million outstanding shares of our common stock in each of the respective years, during 2018 authorized a repurchase of up to 15 million shares of our common stock and during 2015 authorized a repurchase of up to 10 million shares of our common stock for a total of 105 million shares. shares repurchased under the authorized programs were as follows:
(1)  amount excludes transaction costs.
as of december 31, 2019 , 26.7 million shares remain authorized for repurchase under the 2018 authorization with no fixed termination date for the repurchases. subsequent to december 31, 2019 , we repurchased an additional 3.4
million shares for a total cost of $370 million , excluding transaction costs, representing an average purchase price of $109.88 per share. our common stock dividend was $1.32 per share for 2019 , $1.24 per share for 2018 and
$1.16 per share for 2017 . see note 13 - stockholders' equity in the notes to consolidated financial statements for a detail of the quarterly dividend payments by year. in addition, in february 2020 , the executive committee, acting on behalf of the board of directors, declared a quarterly cash dividend of $ 0.34 per share of outstanding common stock payable on march 26, 2020 to the stockholders of record as of the close of business on march 10, 2020
. future declarations of dividends are subject to final determination by our board of directors. foreign exchange rate changes resulted in immaterial increases of our cash balances denominated in foreign currency in 2019 of $3
million . foreign exchange rate changes resulted in a reduction of our cash balances denominated in foreign currency in 2018 of $139 million reflecting net depreciations in foreign currencies during 2018 . in our opinion, available cash, funds from operations and available borrowings will provide sufficient capital resources to meet our foreseeable liquidity needs. there can be no assurance, however, that the cost of availability of future borrowings, including refinancing, if any, will be available on terms acceptable to us. 53 table of contents contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following table presents our material contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of december 31, 2019 :

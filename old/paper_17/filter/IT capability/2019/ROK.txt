item 1a. risk factors in the ordinary course of our business, we face various strategic, operating, compliance and financial risks. these risks could have an impact on our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows. our most significant risks are set forth below and elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k.
our enterprise risk management (erm) process seeks to identify and address significant risks. our erm process assesses, manages, and monitors risks consistent with the integrated risk framework in the enterprise risk management - integrated framework (2017) issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission (coso). we believe that risk-taking is an inherent aspect of the pursuit of our strategy. our goal is to manage risks prudently rather than avoid risks. we can mitigate risks and their impact on the company only to a limited extent.
a team of senior executives prioritizes identified risks and assigns an executive to address each major identified risk area and lead action plans to manage risks. our board of directors provides oversight of the erm process and reviews significant identified risks. the audit committee of the board of directors also reviews significant financial risk exposures and the steps management has taken to monitor and manage them. our other board committees also play a role in risk management, as set forth in their respective charters.
our goal is to proactively manage risks in a structured approach in conjunction with strategic planning, with the intent to preserve and enhance shareowner value. however, the risks set forth below and elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k and other risks and uncertainties could adversely affect us and cause our results to vary materially from recent results or from our anticipated future results.
adverse changes in business or industry conditions and volatility and disruption of the capital and credit markets may result in decreases in our sales and profitability.
we are subject to macroeconomic cycles and when recessions occur, we may experience reduced, canceled or delayed orders, payment delays or defaults, supply chain disruptions or other factors as a result of the economic challenges faced by our customers, prospective customers and suppliers.
demand for our hardware and software products is sensitive to changes in levels of industrial production and the financial performance of major industries that we serve. as economic activity slows, credit markets tighten, or sovereign debt concerns arise, companies tend to reduce their levels of capital spending, which could result in decreased demand for our products.
our ability to access the credit markets and the costs of borrowing are affected by the strength of our credit rating and current market conditions. if our access to credit, including the commercial paper market, is adversely affected by a change in market conditions or otherwise, our cost of borrowings may increase or our ability to fund operations may be reduced.
the london interbank offered rate (libor) is the basis for determining the amount of our interest payments on borrowings under our $1.25 billion unsecured revolving credit facility. in addition, we have outstanding interest rate swaps that contain a variable element based on libor. the u.k. financial conduct authority, which regulates libor, has announced that it intends to phase out libor by the end of 2021. if libor ceases to exist, we may need to amend certain agreements that use libor as a benchmark and we cannot predict what alternative index or other amendments may be negotiated with our counterparties. as a result, our interest expense could increase and our available cash flow for general corporate requirements may be adversely affected. additionally, uncertainty as to the nature of a potential discontinuance or modification of libor, alternative reference rates or other reforms may materially adversely affect the trading market for securities linked to such benchmarks. for additional information, see financial condition in md&a.
we sell to customers around the world and are subject to the risks of doing business in many countries.
we do business in more than 100 countries around the world. approximately 46 percent of our sales in 2019 were to customers outside the u.s. in addition, many of our manufacturing operations, suppliers and employees are located in many places around the world. the future success of our business depends in large part on growth in our sales in non-u.s. markets. our global operations are subject to numerous financial, legal and operating risks, such as political and economic instability; prevalence of corruption in certain countries; enforcement of contract and intellectual property rights; and compliance with existing and future laws, regulations and policies, including those related to exports, imports, tariffs, embargoes and other trade restrictions, investments, taxation, product content and performance, employment and repatriation of earnings. in addition, we are affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates, inflation rates and interest rates. the occurrence or consequences of these risks may make it more difficult to operate our business and increase our costs, which could decrease our profitability and have an adverse effect on our financial condition.
our business requires that we buy equipment, components and services including finished products, electronic components and commodities. our reliance on suppliers involves certain risks, including:
•   poor quality or an insecure supply chain, which could adversely affect the reliability and reputation of our hardware and software products;
•   changes in the cost of these purchases due to inflation, exchange rate fluctuations, taxes, tariffs, commodity market volatility or other factors that affect our suppliers;
•   embargoes, sanctions and other trade restrictions that may affect our ability to purchase from various suppliers;
•   intellectual property risks such as challenges to ownership of rights or alleged infringement by suppliers; and
•   shortages of components, commodities or other materials, which could adversely affect our manufacturing efficiencies and ability to make timely delivery of our products, solutions and services.
any of these uncertainties could adversely affect our profitability and ability to compete. we also maintain several single-source supplier relationships, because either alternative sources are not available or the relationship is advantageous due to performance, quality, support, delivery, capacity, or price considerations. unavailability of, or delivery delays for single-source components or products could adversely affect our ability to ship the related products in a timely manner. the effect of unavailability or delivery delays would be more severe if associated with our higher volume and more profitable products. even where substitute sources of supply are available, qualifying alternative suppliers and establishing reliable supplies could cost more or result in delays and a loss of sales.
failures or security breaches of our products, connected services, manufacturing environment, supply chain, or information technology systems could have an adverse effect on our business.
we rely heavily on information technology (it) in our hardware and software products, solutions and services for customers, manufacturing environment, and in our enterprise infrastructure. despite the implementation of security measures, our it systems are vulnerable to unauthorized access by nation states, hackers, cyber-criminals, malicious insiders, and other actors who may engage in fraud, theft of confidential or proprietary information, or sabotage. our systems could be compromised by malware (including ransomware), cyber attacks, and other events, ranging from widespread, non-targeted, global cyber threats to targeted advanced persistent threats. given that our hardware and software products and services are used in critical infrastructure, these threats could indicate increased risk for our products, services, manufacturing, and it infrastructure. recent global cyber attacks have been perpetuated by compromising software updates in widely-used software products, increasing the risk that vulnerabilities or malicious content could be inserted into our products. in some cases, malware attacks were spread throughout the supply chain, moving from one company to the next via authorized network connections.
our hardware and software products, solutions, and services are used by our direct and indirect customers in applications that may be subject to information theft, tampering, or sabotage. careless or malicious actors could cause a customer's process to be disrupted or could cause equipment to operate in an improper manner that could result in harm to people or property. while we continue to improve the security attributes of our hardware and software products, solutions and services, we can reduce risk, not eliminate it. to a significant extent, the security of our customers' systems depends on how those systems are designed, installed, protected, configured, updated and monitored, much of which are typically outside our control.
our business uses it resources on a dispersed, global basis for a wide variety of functions including development, engineering, manufacturing, sales, accounting, and human resources. our vendors, partners, employees and customers have access to, and share, information across multiple locations via various digital technologies.  in addition, we rely on partners and vendors for a wide range of outsourced activities, including cloud providers, as part of our internal it infrastructure and our commercial offerings. secure connectivity is important to these ongoing operations. also, our partners and vendors frequently have access to our confidential information as well as confidential information about our customers, employees, and others. we design our security architecture to reduce the risk that a compromise of our partners' infrastructure, for example a cloud platform, could lead to a compromise of our internal systems or customer networks, but this risk cannot be eliminated and vulnerabilities at third parties could result in unknown risk exposure to our business.
the current cyber threat environment indicates increased risk for all companies, including those in industrial automation and information. like other global companies, we have experienced cyber threats and incidents, although none have been material or had a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition. our information security efforts, under the leadership of our chief information security officer and chief product security officer, with the support of the entire management team, include major programs designed to address security governance, product security, identification and protection of critical assets, insider risk, third-party risk, and cyber defense operations. we believe these measures reduce, but cannot eliminate, the risk of an information security incident. any significant security incidents could have an adverse impact on sales, harm our reputation and cause us to incur legal liability and increased costs to address such events and related security concerns.
an inability to respond to changes in customer preferences could result in decreased demand for our products.
our success depends in part on our ability to anticipate and offer hardware and software products that appeal to the changing needs and preferences of our customers in the various markets we serve. developing new hardware and software products requires high levels of innovation, and the development process is often lengthy and costly. if we are not able to anticipate, identify, develop and market products that respond to changes in customer preferences and emerging technological and broader industry trends, demand for our products could decline.
there are inherent risks in our solutions and services businesses.
risks inherent in the sale of solutions and services include assuming greater responsibility for successfully delivering projects that meet a particular customer specification, including defining and controlling contract scope, efficiently executing projects, and managing the performance and quality of our subcontractors and suppliers. if we are unable to manage and mitigate these risks, we could incur cost overruns, liabilities and other losses that would adversely affect our results of operations.
new legislative and regulatory actions could adversely affect our business.
legislative and regulatory action may be taken in the various countries and other jurisdictions where we operate that may affect our business activities in these countries or may otherwise increase our costs to do business. for example, we are increasingly required to comply with various environmental and other material, product, certification and labeling laws and regulations. our customers may also be required to comply with such legislative and regulatory requirements. these requirements could increase our costs and could potentially have an adverse effect on our ability to do business in certain jurisdictions. changes in these requirements could impact demand for our hardware and software products, solutions and services. compliance with state, federal and foreign privacy regulations, such as the european union's general data protection regulation (gdpr), could increase our operating costs as part of our efforts to protect and safeguard our sensitive data and personal information. failure to maintain information privacy could result in legal liability or reputational harm.
our industry is highly competitive.
we face strong competition in all of our market segments in several significant respects. we compete based on breadth and scope of our hardware and software product portfolio and solution and service offerings, technology differentiation, the domain expertise of our employees and partners, product performance, quality of our hardware and software products, solutions and services, knowledge of integrated systems and applications that address our customers' business challenges, pricing, delivery and customer service. the relative importance of these factors differs across the geographic markets and product areas that we serve and across our market segments. we seek to maintain acceptable pricing levels across and within geographic markets by continually developing advanced technologies for new hardware and software products and product enhancements and offering complete solutions for our customers' business problems. in addition, we continue to drive productivity to reduce our cost structure. if we fail to achieve our objectives, to keep pace with technological changes, or to provide high quality hardware and software products, solutions and services, we may lose business or experience price erosion and correspondingly lower sales and margins. we expect the level of competition to remain high in the future, which could limit our ability to maintain or increase our market share or profitability.
we rely on our distribution channel for a substantial portion of our sales.
in north america, a large percentage of our sales are through distributors. in certain other countries, the majority of our sales are also through a limited number of distributors. we depend on the capabilities and competencies of our distributors to sell our hardware and software products and services and deliver value to our customers. disruptions to our existing distribution channel or the failure of distributors to maintain and develop the appropriate capabilities to sell our hardware and software products and services could adversely affect our sales. a disruption could result from the sale of a distributor to a competitor, financial instability of a distributor or other events.
failure to identify, manage, complete, and integrate strategic transactions may adversely affect our business or we may not achieve the expected benefits of these transactions.
as part of our strategy, we may pursue strategic transactions, including acquisitions, joint ventures, investments, other business opportunities and purchases of technology from third parties. in order to be successful, we must identify attractive transaction opportunities, effectively complete the transaction, and manage post-closing matters, such as integration of the acquired business or technology (including related personnel) and cooperation with our joint venture and other strategic partners. we may not be able to identify or complete beneficial transaction opportunities given the intense competition for them. even if we successfully identify and complete such transactions, we may not achieve the expected benefits of such transactions and we may not be able to successfully address risks and uncertainties inherent in such transactions, including:
•   difficulties in integrating the purchased or new operations, technologies, products or services, retaining customers and achieving the expected benefits of the transaction, such as sales increases, access to technologies, cost savings and increases in geographic or product presence, in the desired time frames;
•   loss of key employees or difficulties integrating personnel;
•   legal and compliance issues;
•   difficulties implementing and maintaining consistent standards, financial systems, internal and other controls, procedures, policies and information systems;
•   difficulties maintaining relationships with our joint venture and other strategic partners (including as a result of such joint venture and other strategic partners having differing business objectives) and managing disputes with such joint venture and other strategic partners that may arise in connection with our relationships with them; and
•   diversion of management's attention from other business concerns.
future strategic transactions and technology investments could result in debt, dilution, liabilities, increased interest expense, restructuring charges, and impairment and amortization expenses related to intangible assets.
our business depends on the movement of people and goods around the world. natural disasters, pandemics, acts or threats of war or terrorism, international conflicts, power outages, fires, explosions, equipment failures, sabotage, political instability and the actions taken by governments could cause damage to or disrupt our business operations, our suppliers or our customers, and could create economic instability. disruptions to our it infrastructure from system failures, shutdowns, power outages, telecommunication or utility failures, and other events, including disruptions at third party it and other service providers, could also interfere with or disrupt our operations. although it is not possible to predict such events or their consequences, these events could decrease demand for our hardware and software products, solutions or services, increase our costs, or make it difficult or impossible for us to deliver products, solutions or services.
intellectual property infringement claims of others and the inability to protect our intellectual property rights could harm our business and our customers.
others may assert intellectual property infringement claims against us or our customers. we frequently provide a limited intellectual property indemnity in connection with our terms and conditions of sale to our customers and in other types of contracts with third parties. indemnification payments and legal expenses to defend claims could be costly.
in addition, we own the rights to many patents, trademarks, brand names and trade names that are important to our business. the inability to enforce our intellectual property rights may have an adverse effect on our results of operations. expenses related to enforcing our intellectual property rights could be significant.
claims from taxing authorities could have an adverse effect on our income tax expense and financial condition.
we conduct business in many countries, which requires us to interpret and comply with the income tax laws and rulings in each of those taxing jurisdictions. due to the ambiguity of tax laws among those jurisdictions as well as the uncertainty of how underlying facts may be construed, our estimates of income tax liabilities may differ from actual payments or assessments. we must successfully defend any claims from taxing authorities to avoid an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.
our business success depends on attracting, developing, and retaining highly qualified personnel.
our success depends in part on the efforts and abilities of our management team and key employees, and the effective implementation of processes and technology to increase employee engagement, productivity, and efficiency. the skills, experience and industry knowledge of our employees significantly benefit our operations and performance. difficulty attracting, developing, and retaining members of our management team and key employees with the necessary expertise, including by offering attractive compensation, benefits, and development opportunities, could have a negative effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. we continuously evaluate, modify, and enhance our internal processes and technologies to increase employee engagement, productivity, and efficiency, and to mitigate failure risks from older technologies currently in use. failure to identify and successfully implement new processes and technologies could add costs and complications to ongoing operations and negatively impact employee engagement, productivity, and efficiency.
potential liabilities and costs from litigation (including asbestos claims and environmental remediation) could reduce our profitability.
various lawsuits, claims and proceedings have been or may be asserted against us relating to the conduct of our business, including those pertaining to the safety and security of the hardware and software products, solutions and services we sell, employment, contract matters, and environmental remediation.
we have been named as a defendant in lawsuits alleging personal injury as a result of exposure to asbestos that was used in certain of our products many years ago. our products may also be used in hazardous industrial activities, which could result in product liability claims. the uncertainties of litigation (including asbestos claims) and the uncertainties related to the collection of insurance proceeds make it difficult to predict the ultimate resolution of these lawsuits.
our operations are subject to various environmental regulations concerning human health, the limitation and control of emissions and discharges into the air, ground, and water, the quality of air and bodies of water, and the handling, use and disposal of specified substances. our financial responsibility to clean up contaminated property or for natural resource damages may extend to previously owned or used properties, waterways and properties owned by unrelated companies or individuals, as well as properties that we currently own and use, regardless of whether the contamination is attributable to prior owners. we have been named as a potentially responsible party at cleanup sites and may be so named in the future, and the costs associated with these current and future sites may be significant.
we have, from time to time, divested certain of our businesses. in connection with these divestitures, certain lawsuits, claims and proceedings may be instituted or asserted against us related to the period that we owned the businesses, either because we agreed to retain certain liabilities related to these periods or because such liabilities fall upon us by operation of law. in some instances, the divested business has assumed the liabilities; however, it is possible that we might be responsible for satisfying those liabilities if the divested business is unable to do so.
we own common stock in ptc inc. and are exposed to the volatility, liquidity and other risks inherent in holding that stock.
we own common stock of ptc inc. (ptc), a nasdaq-listed company, that we acquired for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $1.0 billion. we present this investment on our consolidated balance sheet at its fair value at the end of each reporting period, less a valuation adjustment for periods ending prior to the registration of our shares of ptc common stock (shares) under the securities act of 1933, as amended, on november 28, 2018, per a registration rights agreement entered into with ptc. the fair value of the shares is subject to fluctuation in the future due to the volatility of the stock market, changes in general economic conditions, and the performance of ptc. we will recognize all changes in the fair value of the shares (whether realized or unrealized) as gains or losses in our consolidated statement of operations. accordingly, changes in the fair value of the shares can materially impact the earnings we report, which introduces volatility in our earnings that is not associated with the results of our business operations. in particular, significant declines in the fair value of the shares would produce significant declines in our reported earnings.
while there is an established trading market for shares of ptc common stock, there are limitations on our ability to dispose of some or all of the shares should we wish to reduce our investment. until july 19, 2021, we are subject to contractual restrictions on our ability to transfer the shares, subject to certain exceptions. in addition, we are subject to certain restrictions on our ability to transfer the shares under the securities laws. further, the reported value of the shares does not necessarily reflect their lowest current market price. if we were forced to sell some or all of the shares in the market, there can be no assurance that we would be able to sell them at prices equivalent to the value of the shares that we have reported on our consolidated balance sheet, and we may be forced to sell them at significantly lower prices.
finally, our equity position in ptc is a minority position which exposes us to further risk as we are not able to exert control over ptc.
increasing employee benefit costs could have a negative effect on our operating results and financial condition.
one important aspect of attracting and retaining qualified personnel is continuing to offer competitive employee retirement and health care benefits. the expenses we record for our pension and other postretirement benefit plans depend on factors such as changes in market interest rates, the value of plan assets, mortality assumptions and healthcare trend rates. significant unfavorable changes in these factors would increase our expenses. expenses related to employer-funded healthcare benefits depend on laws and regulations, which could change, as well as healthcare cost inflation. an inability to control costs related to employee and retiree benefits could negatively impact our operating results and financial condition.

domain expertise refers to the industry and application knowledge required to deliver solutions and services that support customers through the entire life cycle of their automation investment. the combination of industry-specific domain expertise of our people with our innovative technologies enables us to help our customers solve their manufacturing and business challenges.
global expansion as the manufacturing world continues to expand, we must be able to meet our customers' needs around the world. approximately 60 percent of our employees and 46 percent of our sales are outside the u.s. we continue to expand our footprint in emerging markets.
as we expand in markets with considerable growth potential and shift our global footprint, we expect to continue to broaden the portfolio of hardware and software products, solutions and services that we provide to our customers in these regions. we have made significant investments to globalize our manufacturing, product development and customer-facing resources in order to be closer to our customers throughout the world. the emerging markets of asia pacific, including china and india, latin america, central and eastern europe and africa are projected to be the fastest growing over the long term, due to higher levels of infrastructure investment and the growing middle-class population. we believe that increased demand for consumer products in these markets will lead to manufacturing investment and provide us with additional growth opportunities in the future.
enhanced market access over the past decade, our investments in technology and globalization have enabled us to expand our addressed market to over $90 billion. our process initiative has been the most important contributor to this expansion and remains our largest growth opportunity. i original equipment manufacturers (oems) represent another area of addressed market expansion and an important growth opportunity. to remain competitive, oems need to find the optimal balance of machine cost and performance while reducing their time to market. our scalable integrated architecture and intelligent motor control offerings, along with design productivity tools and our motion and safety products, can assist oems in addressing these business needs.
we have developed a powerful network of channel partners, technology partners and commercial partners that act as amplifiers to our internal capabilities and enable us to serve our customers' needs around the world.
broad range of industries served we apply our knowledge of manufacturing applications to help customers solve their business challenges. we serve customers in a wide range of industries, which we group into three broad categories: discrete, hybrid, and process.
discrete                      hybrid                          process automotive                    food &amp; beverage             oil &amp; gas semiconductor                 life sciences                   mining, aggregates &amp; cement general industries            household &amp; personal care   metals warehousing &amp; logistics   tire                            chemicals printing &amp; publishing     eco industrial                  pulp &amp; paper marine                        water / wastewater              traditional power glass                         mass transit                    other process fiber/textiles                renewable energy airports aerospace other discrete outsourcing and sustainability trends demand for our hardware and software products, solutions and services across all industries benefits from the outsourcing and sustainability needs of our customers. customers increasingly desire to outsource engineering services to achieve a more flexible cost base. our manufacturing application knowledge enables us to serve these customers globally.
we help our customers meet their sustainability needs pertaining to energy efficiency, environmental and safety goals. customers across all industries are investing in more energy-efficient manufacturing processes and technologies, such as intelligent motor control, and energy-efficient solutions and services. in addition, environmental and safety objectives often spur customers to invest to ensure compliance and implement sustainable business practices.
acquisitions and investments our acquisition and investment strategy focuses on hardware and software products, solutions and services that will be catalytic to the organic growth of our core offerings.
in january 2019, we acquired emulate3d, an innovative engineering software developer whose products digitally simulate and emulate industrial automation systems. this acquisition enables our customers to virtually test machine and system designs before incurring manufacturing and automation costs and committing to a final design.
in 2018, we made several investments, including in shares of ptc common stock (the "ptc shares"). ptc is the leader in the industrial internet of things and augmented reality. our investment in and alliance with ptc is accelerating growth for both companies and enabling us to be the partner of choice for customers around the world who want to transform their physical operations with digital technology. the result will be an unmatched integrated information solution that will enable customers to achieve increased productivity, heightened plant efficiency, reduced operational risk and better system interoperability.
in november 2017, we acquired odos imaging limited, a scottish technology company that provides three-dimensional, time-of-flight sensing systems for industrial imaging applications. this acquisition enables us to expand our existing capabilities by bringing 3-d time-of-flight sensor technology to industrial applications.
we believe these acquisitions and investments will help us expand our served market and deliver value to our customers.
continuous improvement productivity and continuous improvement are important components of our culture. we have programs in place that drive ongoing process improvement, functional streamlining, material cost savings and manufacturing productivity. these are intended to improve profitability that can be used to fund investments in growth and to offset inflation. our ongoing productivity initiatives target both cost reduction and improved asset utilization. charges for workforce reductions and facility rationalization may be required in order to effectively execute our productivity programs.
u. s. industrial economic trends in 2019, sales in the u.s. accounted for approximately 54 percent of our total sales. the various indicators we use to gauge the direction and momentum of our served u.s. markets include:
•   the industrial production (ip) index, published by the federal reserve, which measures the real output of manufacturing, mining, and electric and gas utilities. the ip index is expressed as a percentage of real output in a base year, currently 2012. historically there has been a meaningful correlation between the changes in the ip index and the level of automation investment made by our u.s. customers in their manufacturing base.
•   the manufacturing purchasing managers' index (pmi), published by the institute for supply management (ism), which indicates the current and near-term state of manufacturing activity in the u.s. according to the ism, a pmi measure above 50 indicates that the u.s. manufacturing economy is generally expanding while a measure below 50 indicates that it is generally contracting.
non-u.s. economic trends in 2019, sales outside the u.s. accounted for approximately 46 percent of our total sales. these customers include both indigenous companies and multinational companies with expanding global presence. in addition to the global factors previously mentioned in the "overview" section, international demand, particularly in emerging markets, has historically been driven by the strength of the industrial economy in each region, investments in infrastructure and expanding consumer markets. we use changes in the respective countries' gross domestic product and ip as indicators of the growth opportunities in each region where we do business.
macroeconomic indicators have slowed during 2019 and are projected to slow further in 2020, particularly in ip and gross domestic product growth rates. the economic outlook for europe and china has softened further amid slowing global growth, trade tension with the u.s., and continued brexit uncertainty. overall latin america ip is expected to increase.
summary of results of operations in 2019, sales were $6,694.8 million, an increase of 0.4 percent year over year. organic sales increased 2.8 percent. currency translation decreased sales by 2.4 percentage points. organic sales growth was broad-based across regions and was led by strength in process end markets.
the following is a summary of our results related to key growth initiatives:
•   process control initiative reported sales increased 1 percent year over year in 2019 compared to 2018. organic sales increased 4 percent, and currency translation decreased sales by 3 percentage points.

(1)   see note 17 in the consolidated financial statements for the definition of segment operating earnings. effective october 1, 2018, we realigned our reportable segments for a transfer of business activities between our segments. we also reclassified interest income from general corporate - net to interest (expense) income - net. as a result, the prior period presentation of reportable segments has been restated to conform to the current segment reporting structure.
(2)   total segment operating earnings and total segment operating margin are non-gaap financial measures. we exclude purchase accounting depreciation and amortization, general corporate - net, non-operating pension and postretirement benefit credit (cost), costs related to the unsolicited emerson proposals in the first quarter of fiscal 2018, gains and losses on investments, valuation adjustments related to the registration of ptc shares, gains and losses from the disposition of businesses, interest (expense) income - net and income tax provision because we do not consider these costs to be directly related to the operating performance of our segments. we believe that these measures are useful to investors as measures of operating performance. we use these measures to monitor and evaluate the profitability of our operating segments. our measures of total segment operating earnings and total segment operating margin may be different from measures used by other companies.
(3)   during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, we sold a product distribution business within our control products &amp; solutions segment. this business held no intellectual property and included products sold outside of our core channel and under different brands. we sold this business for approximately $94 million and recorded a pre-tax gain of $60.8 million, which is included within other income (expense) in the consolidated statement of operations.
(4)   during fiscal 2018, we recorded charges of $538.3 million associated with the enactment of the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 (the "tax act"). refer to note 15 in the consolidated financial statements for further information.
(5)   adjusted eps is a non-gaap earnings measure that excludes non-operating pension and postretirement benefit cost (credit), costs related to the unsolicited emerson proposals in the first quarter of fiscal 2018, gains and losses on investments, and valuation adjustments related to the registration of ptc shares, including their respective tax effects and the charges associated with the enactment of the tax act in fiscal 2018. see adjusted income, adjusted eps and adjusted effective tax rate reconciliation for more information on this non-gaap measure.
purchase accounting depreciation and amortization and non-operating pension and postretirement benefit (credit) cost are not allocated to our operating segments because these costs are excluded from our measurement of each segment's operating performance for internal purposes. if we were to allocate these costs, we would attribute them to each of our segments as follows (in millions):

adjusted income, adjusted eps and adjusted effective tax rate reconciliation adjusted income, adjusted eps and adjusted effective tax rate are non-gaap earnings measures that exclude non-operating pension and postretirement benefit (credit) cost, costs related to the unsolicited emerson proposals in the first quarter of fiscal 2018, gains and losses on investments, and valuation adjustments related to the registration of ptc shares, including their respective tax effects, and the adjustments related to the tax act in fiscal 2018.
we believe that adjusted income, adjusted eps and adjusted effective tax rate provide useful information to our investors about our operating performance and allow management and investors to compare our operating performance period over period. adjusted eps is also used as a financial measure of performance for our annual incentive compensation. our measures of adjusted income, adjusted eps and adjusted effective tax rate may be different from measures used by other companies. these non-gaap measures should not be considered a substitute for income from continuing operations, diluted eps and effective tax rate.
we have adopted asu 2017-07, which defines operating and non-operating pension and postretirement benefit cost. under this new standard, only the service cost component of pension and postretirement benefit cost is an operating cost. all other components of pension and postretirement benefit cost are considered to be non-operating costs. these components of net periodic pension and postretirement benefit cost primarily relate to changes in pension assets and liabilities that are the result of market performance; we consider these and other excluded costs to be unrelated to the operating performance of our business.

income before income taxes income before income taxes decreased 32 percent from $1,330.8 million in 2018 to $901.0 million in 2019, primarily due to gains and losses on investments and valuation adjustments related to the registration of ptc shares ("ptc adjustments"). total segment operating earnings increased 2 percent year over year from $1,441.8 million in 2018 to $1,473.6 million in 2019.
income taxes the effective tax rate in 2019 was 22.8 percent compared to 59.8 percent in 2018. the decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the prior year impact of tax expense related to the transition tax on the deemed repatriation of foreign earnings ($395.8 million or 29.8 percent), withholding taxes on previously taxed foreign earnings ($38.1 million or 2.8 percent), the revaluation of net deferred tax assets resulting from the tax act ($104.4 million or 7.9 percent), and the impact of the lower u.s. statutory tax rate under the tax act.

•   emea sales increased year over year, led by consumer industries.
income before income taxes income before income taxes increased 28 percent from $1,037.4 million in 2017 to $1,330.8 million in 2018, primarily due to ptc adjustments, higher sales, and lower restructuring charges, partially offset by the absence of the gain on the 2017 divestiture. total segment operating earnings increased 17 percent year over year from $1,228.1 million in 2017 to $1,441.8 million in 2018, primarily due to higher sales.
income taxes on december 22, 2017, the tax act was enacted. the tax act significantly changed u.s. tax law by, among other things, lowering the statutory corporate income tax rate, implementing a modified territorial tax system, and imposing a one-time transition tax on accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries that were previously deferred from u.s. tax ("transition tax"). as a fiscal year taxpayer, certain provisions of the tax act impacted us in fiscal year 2018, including the change in the federal statutory rate and the transition tax, while other provisions were effective in fiscal year 2019, including the tax on global intangible low-tax income ("gilti") of foreign subsidiaries, the deduction of foreign derived intangible income ("fdii"), and the elimination of the domestic manufacturing deduction.
the effective tax rate in 2018 was 59.8 percent compared to 20.4 percent in 2017. the increase in the effective tax rate was due to provisional expense related to the transition tax on deemed repatriation of foreign earnings ($395.8 million or 29.8 percent), withholding taxes on previously taxed foreign earnings ($38.1 million or 2.8 percent), and the revaluation of net deferred tax assets ($104.4 million or 7.9 percent).
the adjusted effective tax rate in 2018 was 19.3 percent compared to 21.5 percent in 2017. the decrease in the adjusted effective tax rate was primarily due to the lower u.s. statutory tax rate under the tax act partially offset by lower discrete tax items in 2018.

financial condition the following is a summary of our cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, as reflected in the consolidated statement of cash flows (in millions):
cash provided by (used for):
operating activities                                       $1,182.0                $1,300.0                $1,034.0

cash provided by (used for) continuing operations            $399.6                 $(792.1    )            $(115.5    )
the following table summarizes free cash flow, which is a non-gaap financial measure (in millions):
cash provided by continuing operating activities          $1,182.0                $1,300.0                $1,034.0
capital expenditures                                        (132.8    )             (125.5    )             (141.7    )
our definition of free cash flow takes into consideration capital investments required to maintain our businesses' operations and execute our strategy. cash provided by continuing operating activities adds back non-cash depreciation expense to earnings but does not reflect a charge for necessary capital expenditures. our definition of free cash flow excludes the operating cash flows and capital expenditures related to our discontinued operations, if any. operating, investing and financing cash flows of our discontinued operations, if any, are presented separately in our statement of cash flows. in our opinion, free cash flow provides useful information to investors regarding our ability to generate cash from business operations that is available for acquisitions and other investments, service of debt principal, dividends and share repurchases. we use free cash flow, as defined, as one measure to monitor and evaluate our performance, including as a financial measure for our annual incentive compensation. our definition of free cash flow may differ from definitions used by other companies.
cash provided by operating activities was $1,182.0 million for the year ended september 30, 2019, compared to $1,300.0 million for the year ended september 30, 2018. free cash flow was $1,049.2 million for the year ended september 30, 2019, compared to $1,174.5 million for the year ended september 30, 2018. the year-over-year decreases in cash provided by operating activities and free cash flow were primarily due to an increase in working capital, a payment due to settlement of treasury locks, and higher tax payments, including a payment for taxes under the tax act related to deemed repatriation of foreign earnings.
we repurchased approximately 6.1 million shares of our common stock under our share repurchase program in 2019 at a total cost of $1.0 billion. in 2018, we repurchased approximately 8.3 million shares of our common stock under our share repurchase program at a total cost of $1.5 billion. at september 30, 2019, there were $9.3 million of outstanding common stock share repurchases recorded in accounts payable that did not settle until 2020. at september 30, 2018, there were $18.3 million of outstanding common stock share repurchases recorded in accounts payable that did not settle until 2019. our decision to repurchase shares in 2020 will depend on business conditions, free cash flow generation, other cash requirements and stock price. on both september 6, 2018 and july 24, 2019, the board of directors authorized us to expend an additional $1.0 billion to repurchase shares of our common stock. at september 30, 2019, we had approximately $1,108.4 million remaining for share repurchases under our existing board authorizations. see part ii, item 5. market for the company's common equity, related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities, for additional information regarding share repurchases.
we expect future uses of cash to include working capital requirements, capital expenditures, additional contributions to our retirement plans, acquisitions of businesses and other inorganic investments, dividends to shareowners, repurchases of common stock and repayments of debt. we expect capital expenditures in 2020 to be about $160 million. we expect to fund future uses of cash with a combination of existing cash balances and short-term investments, cash generated by operating activities, commercial paper borrowings or a new issuance of debt or other securities.
at september 30, 2019, approximately half of our cash and cash equivalents were held by non-u.s. subsidiaries. as a result of the broad changes to the u.s. international tax system under the tax act, in fiscal year 2018 the company began to account for substantially all of its non-u.s. subsidiaries as being immediately subject to tax, while still concluding that earnings are indefinitely reinvested for a limited number of subsidiaries.
during fiscal 2019, we repatriated approximately $767.3 million to the u.s. from our foreign subsidiaries. the source of these funds was cash and cash equivalents and from the liquidation of short and long-term investments.
in addition to cash generated by operating activities, we have access to existing financing sources, including the public debt markets and unsecured credit facilities with various banks.
in march 2019, we issued $1 billion aggregate principal amount of long-term notes in a registered public offering. the offering consisted of $425.0 million of 3.500% notes due in march 2029 ("2029 notes") and $575.0 million of 4.200% notes due in march 2049 ("2049 notes"), both issued at a discount. net proceeds to the company from the debt offering were $987.6 million. we used these net proceeds primarily to repay our outstanding commercial paper, with the remaining proceeds used for general corporate purposes.
on november 13, 2018, we replaced our former five-year $1.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility with a new five-year $1.25 billion unsecured revolving credit facility expiring in november 2023. we can increase the aggregate amount of this credit facility by up to $750.0 million, subject to the consent of the banks in the credit facility. we did not incur early termination penalties in connection with the termination of the former credit facility. we did not borrow against either facility during the periods ended september 30, 2019 or 2018. borrowings under the new credit facility bear interest based on short-term money market rates in effect during the period the borrowings are outstanding. this credit facility contains covenants under which we agree to maintain an ebitda-to-interest ratio of at least 3.0 to 1.0. the ebitda-to-interest ratio is defined in the credit facility as the ratio of consolidated ebitda (as defined in the facility) for the preceding four quarters to consolidated interest expense for the same period.
libor is the basis for determining interest payments on borrowings under our $1.25 billion credit facility. in addition, we have outstanding interest rate swaps that contain a variable element based on libor. banks currently reporting information used to set libor will stop doing so after 2021. various parties, including government agencies, are seeking to identify an alternative rate to replace libor. we are monitoring their efforts, and we will likely amend contracts to accommodate any replacement rate where it is not already provided.
separate short-term unsecured credit facilities of approximately $217.1 million at september 30, 2019 were available to non-u.s. subsidiaries. borrowings under our non-u.s. credit facilities at september 30, 2019 and 2018 were not significant. we were in compliance with all covenants under our credit facilities at september 30, 2019 and 2018. there are no significant commitment fees or compensating balance requirements under our credit facilities.
among other uses, we can draw on our credit facility as a standby liquidity facility to repay our outstanding commercial paper as it matures. this access to funds to repay maturing commercial paper is an important factor in maintaining the short-term credit ratings set forth in the table below. under our current policy with respect to these ratings, we expect to limit our other borrowings under our credit facility, if any, to amounts that would leave enough credit available under the facility so that we could borrow, if needed, to repay all of our then outstanding commercial paper as it matures.
the following is a summary of our credit ratings as of september 30, 2019:
credit rating agency    short term rating   long term rating   outlook standard &amp; poor's   a-1                 a                  stable moody's                 p-2                 a3                 stable fitch ratings           f1                  a                  stable our ability to access the commercial paper market, and the related costs of these borrowings, is affected by the strength of our credit ratings and market conditions. we have not experienced any difficulty in accessing the commercial paper market to date. if our access to the commercial paper market is adversely affected due to a change in market conditions or otherwise, we would expect to rely on a combination of available cash and our unsecured committed credit facility to provide short-term funding. in such event, the cost of borrowings under our unsecured committed credit facility could be higher than the cost of commercial paper borrowings.
we regularly monitor the third-party depository institutions that hold our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments. we diversify our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments among counterparties to minimize exposure to any one of these entities. in february 2017, we began investing in investment-grade fixed income securities, including corporate debt and government obligations, to provide further diversification. refer to note 9 in the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of these investments. our emphasis is primarily on safety and liquidity of principal and secondarily on maximizing yield on those funds.
we use foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage certain foreign currency risks. we enter into these contracts to hedge our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate variability in the expected future cash flows associated with certain third-party and intercompany transactions denominated in foreign currencies forecasted to occur within the next two years. we also use these contracts to hedge portions of our net investments in certain non-u.s. subsidiaries against the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of foreign currency balances to the u.s. dollar. in addition, we use foreign currency forward exchange contracts that are not designated as hedges to offset transaction gains or losses associated with some of our assets and liabilities resulting from intercompany loans or other transactions with third parties that are denominated in currencies other than our entities' functional currencies. our foreign currency forward exchange contracts are usually denominated in currencies of major industrial countries. we diversify our foreign currency forward exchange contracts among counterparties to minimize exposure to any one of these entities.

(a)   the amounts for long-term debt assume that the respective debt instruments will be outstanding until their scheduled maturity dates. the amounts include interest but exclude the amounts to be paid or received under interest rate swap contracts, including the $7.0 million fair value adjustment recorded for the interest rate swap contracts at september 30, 2019 and the unamortized discount of $46.6 million at september 30, 2019. see note 6 in the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding our long-term debt.
(b)   our postretirement benefit plans are unfunded and are subject to change. amounts reported are estimates of future benefit payments, to the extent estimable.
(c)   amounts reported for pension funding contributions reflect current estimates of known commitments. contributions to our pension plans beyond 2020 will depend on future investment performance of our pension plan assets, changes in discount rate assumptions and governmental regulations in effect at the time. amounts subsequent to 2020 are excluded from the summary above, as we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of these amounts. the minimum contribution for our u.s. pension plan as required by the employee retirement income security act (erisa) is currently zero. we may make additional contributions to this plan at the discretion of management.
(d)   this item includes contractual commitments for capital expenditures, certain materials purchases and long-term obligations under agreements with various service providers. included in this amount is $250 million paid to schlumberger in connection with the formation of sensia on october 1, 2019.
(e)   other long-term liabilities include environmental remediation costs, conditional asset retirement obligations and indemnification liabilities. amounts subsequent to 2020 are excluded from the summary above, as we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of when the liabilities will be paid.
(f)   under the tax act, the company may elect to pay the transition tax interest-free over eight years, with 8% due in each of the first five years, 15% in year six, 20% in year seven, and 25% in year eight.
(g)   amount for unrecognized tax benefits includes accrued interest and penalties. we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of when the liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits will be settled or paid.
supplemental sales information we translate sales of subsidiaries operating outside of the united states using exchange rates effective during the respective period. therefore, changes in currency exchange rates affect our reported sales. sales by acquired businesses also affect our reported sales. we believe that organic sales, defined as sales excluding the effects of changes in currency exchange rates and acquisitions, which is a non-gaap financial measure, provides useful information to investors because it reflects regional and operating segment performance from the activities of our businesses without the effect of changes in currency exchange rates and acquisitions. we use organic sales as one measure to monitor and evaluate our regional and operating segment performance. we determine the effect of changes in currency exchange rates by translating the respective period's sales using the same currency exchange rates that were in effect during the prior year. when we acquire businesses, we exclude sales in the current period for which there are no comparable sales in the prior period. when we divest a business, we exclude sales in the prior period for which there are no comparable sales in the current period. organic sales growth is calculated by comparing organic sales to reported sales in the prior year, excluding divestitures. we attribute sales to the geographic regions based on the country of destination.

critical accounting estimates we believe the following accounting estimates are the most critical to the understanding of our financial statements as they could have the most significant effect on our reported results and require subjective or complex judgments by management. accounting principles generally accepted in the united states require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and revenues and expenses during the periods reported. these estimates are based on our best judgment about current and future conditions, but actual results could differ from those estimates. refer to note 1 in the consolidated financial statements for information regarding our significant accounting policies.
retirement benefits - pension pension costs and obligations are actuarially determined and are influenced by assumptions used to estimate these amounts, including the discount rate and the expected rate of return on plan assets. changes in any of the assumptions and the amortization of differences between the assumptions and actual experience will affect the amount of pension expense in future periods.
our global pension expense in 2019 was $72.0 million compared to $114.1 million in 2018. approximately 76 percent of our 2019 global pension expense and global projected benefit obligation relates to our u.s. pension plan. the discount rate used to determine our 2019 u.s. pension expense was 4.35 percent, compared to 3.90 percent for 2018.
for 2020, our u.s. discount rate will decrease to 3.30 percent from 4.35 percent in 2019. the discount rate was set as of our september 30 measurement date and was determined by modeling a portfolio of bonds that match the expected cash flow of our benefit plans.
the changes in our discount rate has an inverse relationship with our net periodic benefit cost and projected benefit obligation. the following chart illustrates the estimated change in projected benefit obligation and annual net periodic benefit cost assuming a change of 25 basis points in the discount rate for our u.s. pension plans (in millions):
pension benefits change inprojected benefitobligation              change in net periodic benefit cost(1)
(1) change includes both operating and non-operating pension costs.
more information regarding pension benefits is contained in note 13 in the consolidated financial statements.
revenue recognition - customer incentives we offer various incentive programs that provide distributors and direct sale customers with cash rebates, account credits or additional hardware and software products, solutions and services based on meeting specified program criteria. customer incentives are recognized as a reduction of sales if distributed in cash or customer account credits. customer incentives are recognized in cost of sales for additional hardware and software products, solutions and services to be provided. we record accruals at the time of revenue recognition as a current liability within customer returns, rebates and incentives in our consolidated balance sheet or, where a right of setoff exists, as a reduction of receivables.
our primary incentive program provides distributors with cash rebates or account credits based on agreed amounts that vary depending on the customer to whom our distributor ultimately sells the product. a critical assumption used in estimating the accrual for this program is the time period from when revenue is recognized to when the rebate is processed. our estimate is based primarily on historical experience. if the time period were to change by 10 percent, the effect would be an adjustment to the accrual of approximately $12.0 million.
more information regarding our revenue recognition and returns, rebates and incentives policies are contained in note 1 in the consolidated financial statements.

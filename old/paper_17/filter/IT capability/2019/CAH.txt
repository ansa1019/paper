gaap operating earnings decreased 9 percent to $2.4 billion . the increase in gaap operating earnings was primarily due to the goodwill impairment charge related to our medical segment in the prior year and the current year gain from the divestiture of our navihealth holdings, llc ("navihealth") business.
the decrease in non-gaap operating earnings was primarily due to the negative impact of our pharmaceutical segment generics program, performance of medical segment cardinal health brand products and the adverse impact of pharmaceutical segment customer contract renewals. these factors were partially offset by growth from our specialty pharmaceutical products and services business within our pharmaceutical segment, the beneficial impact of enterprise-wide cost-savings measures and higher contribution from branded pharmaceutical sales and mix.

fiscal 2019 gaap diluted eps increased primarily due to the increase in gaap operating earnings and the benefits from applying a lower federal statutory tax rate to our u.s. pre-tax earnings as a result of the u.s. tax cuts and jobs act ("tax act"). this increase was partially offset by a $2.97 per share favorable impact in the prior year from the estimated net transitional benefit from the remeasurement of our deferred tax assets and liabilities partially offset by the repatriation tax on cash and earnings of foreign subsidiaries.
these factors were partially offset by the decrease in non-gaap operating earnings. the non-gaap effective tax rate is lower in the current year primarily because of the benefits from applying a lower federal statutory tax rate to our u.s. pre-tax earnings as a result of the tax act.
cash and equivalents our cash and equivalents balance was $2.5 billion at june 30, 2019 compared to $1.8 billion at june 30, 2018 . the increase in cash and equivalents during fiscal 2019 was due to $2.7 billion of net cash provided by operating activities and $737 million of net cash proceeds from the sale of our navihealth business, offset by $1.1 billion of debt repayments, $600 million of share repurchases, $577 million of dividends, and $328 million of capital expenditures.

and trends divestitures navihealth divestiture in august 2018, we sold our 98 percent ownership interest in navihealth in exchange for cash proceeds of $737
million and a 44 percent equity interest in a partnership that owns 100 percent of navihealth. we also have certain call rights to reacquire navihealth. we recognized a pre-tax gain of $508 million related to this divestiture during fiscal 2019.
trends within our pharmaceutical segment, we expect fiscal 2020 segment profit to be less than our fiscal 2019 segment profit due to the adverse impact of recent customer contract renewals and generics program performance, which includes the negative impact of generic pharmaceutical customer pricing changes partially offset by the benefits of red oak sourcing. as is generally the case, the frequency, timing, magnitude and profit impact of generic pharmaceutical customer pricing changes, customer renewals, and branded and generic pharmaceutical manufacturer pricing changes remain uncertain and their impact on pharmaceutical segment profit and consolidated operating earnings in fiscal 2020 could be more or less than we expect.
on august 7, 2019, we were authorized to incur restructuring costs in connection with certain cost-savings initiatives intended to optimize and simplify our operating model and cost structure. we expect these cost-savings initiatives, which will affect various functional and commercial areas across the company, to be substantially implemented during fiscal year 2020. as a result of these initiatives, we expect to record restructuring charges of approximately $120 million to $145 million, the majority of which are expected to be expensed during fiscal year
2020. we may incur additional restructuring charges in connection with other projects.

corporate the changes in corporate during fiscal 2018 were due to the factors discussed in the other components of consolidated operating earnings section that follows.
other components of consolidated operating earnings in addition to revenue, gross margin, and sg&a expenses discussed previously, consolidated operating earnings were impacted by the following:

restructuring and employee severance during fiscal 2019, we recognized $92 million of restructuring related costs in connection with enterprise-wide cost-savings measures that began in fiscal 2019. during fiscal 2018, we incurred $125 million of contract termination costs to transition the distribution of our medical segment surgeon gloves in certain international markets from a third-party distribution arrangement to a direct distribution model. amortization and other acquisition-
related costs amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets was $531 million , $574 million and
$395 million for fiscal 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , respectively. transaction and integration costs associated with the acquisition of the patient recovery business were $75 million , $109 million and $54 million during fiscal 2019 , 2018 , and 2017 , respectively.

fiscal 2018 interest expense increased primarily due to new debt issued in june 2017 to fund a portion of the purchase price of the patient recovery business acquisition.
11  cardinal health|fiscal 2019 form 10-k md&a  results of operations provision for income taxes generally, fluctuations in the effective tax rate are due to changes in the distribution of income among taxing jurisdictions with differing income tax rates and other reconciling items.
the fluctuations in the effective tax rate from fiscal 2018 to fiscal 2019 were primarily due to the prior-year impacts of the net benefits from the enactment of the tax act, nondeductible goodwill impairment charge, and benefit from a capital loss due to international legal entity reorganization.
a reconciliation of the provision based on the federal statutory income tax rate to our effective income tax rate from continuing operations is as follows (see note 7 of the "notes to consolidated financial statements" for additional information):

the fiscal 2018 effective income tax rate was impacted by various items including benefits from the enactment of the tax act, the impact of nondeductible goodwill impairment charges, changes in valuation allowances and a benefit from a capital loss due to an international legal entity reorganization. the net benefit from the tax act for fiscal 2018 includes a provisional net tax benefit of $977 million related to the remeasurement of our deferred tax assets and liabilities to the new federal statutory rate, the benefit from the impact of applying a lower federal tax rate to our year-to-date u.s. pre-tax earnings and a provisional tax expense of
$41 million for the one-time repatriation tax applied to our undistributed foreign earnings. our effective tax rate for fiscal 2018 also includes $59 million of tax expense recognized in connection with the sale of our china distribution business. the fiscal 2017 effective income tax rate was favorably impacted by the realignment of foreign subsidiaries in anticipation of closing the acquisition of the patient recovery business and also from deductions related to u.s. production activities. the state and local income tax rate decreased primarily due to resolutions with state taxing authorities.
md&a  liquidity and capital resources liquidity and capital resources we currently believe that, based on available capital resources (cash on hand and committed credit facilities) and projected operating cash flow, we have adequate capital resources to fund working capital needs; currently anticipated capital expenditures; currently anticipated business growth and expansion; contractual obligations; tax payments; and current and projected debt service requirements, dividends and share repurchases. if we decide to engage in one or more additional acquisitions, depending on the size and timing of such transactions, we may need to access capital markets for additional financing.
2019 was due to $2.7 billion of net cash provided by operating activities and $737 million of net cash proceeds from the sale of our navihealth business, offset by $1.1 billion paid for debt repayments, $600
million paid for share repurchases, $577 million paid in dividends and $328 million paid for capital expenditures. at june 30, 2019 , our cash and equivalents were held in cash depository accounts with major banks or invested in high quality, short-term liquid investments. during fiscal 2018 our cash and cash equivalents declined $5.1 billion due to $6.1 billion deployed for acquisitions during the year, $954 million used for debt repayments, $581 million paid in dividends, $550 million paid for share repurchases and
$384 million paid for capital expenditures, offset in part by $2.8 billion net cash provided by operating activities and $861 million of proceeds from the divestiture of the china distribution business. net cash provided by operating activities increased by $1.6
billion from fiscal 2017 primarily due to working capital changes in part as a result of timing of customer and vendor payments related to the new pharmaceutical segment finance and operating information systems. the increase in cash and equivalents during fiscal 2017 of $4.5 billion was due to proceeds from a
$5.2 billion debt issuance and $1.2 billion provided by operating activities, partially offset by $600 million paid for share repurchases, $577 million paid in dividends and $387 million paid in capital expenditures and $310 million in debt repayments. the $1.8 billion decrease in net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2017 was primarily due to an increase in working capital as a result of changes in timing of customer and vendor payments, some of which related to implementation of the new pharmaceutical segment finance and operating information systems.
changes in working capital, which impact operating cash flow, can vary significantly depending on factors such as the timing of customer payments, inventory purchases and payments to vendors in the regular course of business, as well as fluctuating working capital needs driven by customer and product mix.
included $575 million of cash held by subsidiaries outside of the united states.
in june 2019, we repatriated $318 million of cash held by foreign subsidiaries.
during the year ended june 30, 2019, we completed the final calculation of the u.s. repatriation tax after the issuance of final regulations by the u.s treasury department under section 965. after completion of the calculation and an overall review of our cash positions and business needs globally, we changed our assertion on
$309 million previously considered indefinitely reinvested as of june 30, 2018, which did not have a material impact on our provision for income taxes . see note 7 of the "notes to consolidated financial statements" for additional information on the tax act.
other financing arrangements and financial instruments credit facilities and commercial paper in addition to cash and equivalents and operating cash flow, other sources of liquidity at june 30, 2019 include a $2.0
billion revolving credit facility. we also have a $1.0
billion committed receivables sales facility. at june

2019, we extended our revolving credit facility through june 2024. the revolving credit facility requires us to maintain a maximum consolidated net leverage ratio as of the end of any calendar quarter. on june 30, 2019, the maximum permitted ratio was 4.25-to-1 . the maximum permitted ratio will reduce to 4.00-to-1 in september

15  cardinal health|fiscal 2019 form 10-k md&a  critical accounting policies and sensitive accounting estimates critical accounting policies and sensitive accounting estimates critical accounting policies are those accounting policies that (i) can have a significant impact on our financial condition and results of operations and (ii) require the use of complex and subjective estimates based upon past experience and management's judgment. other people applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances could develop different estimates. because estimates are inherently uncertain, actual results may differ. in this section, we describe the significant policies applied in preparing our consolidated financial statements that management believes are the most dependent on estimates and assumptions. for further discussion of accounting policies for items within this section and of additional accounting policies, see note 1 of the "notes to consolidated financial statements."
allowance for doubtful accounts the allowance for doubtful accounts includes general and specific reserves. we determine our allowance for doubtful accounts by reviewing accounts receivable aging, industry trends, customer financial strength and credit standing, historical write-off trends and payment history. we regularly evaluate how changes in economic conditions may affect credit risks. see note 1 of the
"notes to consolidated financial statements" for further information on our policy for receivables and allowance for doubtful accounts. a hypothetical 0.1 percent increase or decrease in the reserve as a percentage of trade receivables at june 30, 2019 , would result in an increase or decrease in bad debt expense of $9 million .
at this time, we are not aware of any analytical findings or customer issues that are likely to lead to a significant future increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of revenue. the following table presents information regarding the allowance for doubtful accounts over the past three fiscal years:
allowance for doubtful accounts at      $   139       $   137       $   135
beginning of period charged to costs and expenses               141           114            60

of period allowance as a percentage of customer       2.3  %        1.8  %        1.7  %
inventories a substantial portion of our inventories ( 56 percent at both june 30, 2019 and 2018 ) are valued at the lower of cost, using the last-in, first-out ("lifo") method, or market. these are primarily merchandise inventories at the core pharmaceutical distribution facilities within our pharmaceutical segment ("distribution facilities").
the lifo impact on the consolidated statements of earnings depends on pharmaceutical manufacturer price appreciation or deflation and our fiscal year-end inventory levels, which can be meaningfully influenced by customer buying behavior immediately preceding our fiscal year-end. historically, prices for branded pharmaceuticals have generally tended to rise, resulting in an increase in cost of products sold, whereas prices for generic pharmaceuticals generally tend to decline, resulting in a decrease in cost of products sold. see note 1 of the "notes to consolidated financial statements" for further information on our policy for inventories. using lifo, if there is a decrease in inventory levels that have experienced pharmaceutical price appreciation, the result generally will be a decrease in future cost of products sold as our older inventory is held at a lower cost. conversely, if there is a decrease in inventory levels that have experienced a pharmaceutical price decline, the result generally will be an increase in future cost of products sold as our older inventory is held at a higher cost.
we believe that the average cost method of inventory valuation provides a reasonable approximation of the current cost of replacing inventory within these distribution facilities. as such, the lifo reserve is the difference between (a) inventory at the lower of lifo cost or market and (b) inventory at replacement cost determined using the average cost method of inventory valuation. if we had used the average cost method of inventory valuation for all inventory within the distribution facilities, the value of our inventories would not have changed in fiscal 2019 or
2018 because inventories valued at lifo were $230
million and $92 million higher than the average cost value at june 30, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. we do not record inventories in excess of replacement cost. as such, we did not record a lifo reserve in fiscal 2019 or
our remaining inventory that is not valued at the lower of lifo or market is stated at the lower of cost, using the first-in, first-out method, or market. inventories presented in the consolidated balance sheets are net of reserves for excess and obsolete inventory which were
, respectively. we reserve for inventory obsolescence using estimates based on historical experience, historical and projected sales trends, specific categories of inventory, age and expiration dates of on-
md&a  critical accounting policies and sensitive accounting estimates if actual conditions are less favorable than our assumptions, additional inventory reserves may be required.
business combinations the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination, including identifiable intangible assets, are recorded at their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date. for further discussion of the business combinations accounting policy, see note 1 of the "notes to consolidated financial statements."
critical estimates and assumptions include: expected future cash flows for customer relationships, trademarks, trade names, patents, developed technology, in-process research and development ("ipr&d") and other identifiable intangible assets; discount rates that reflect the risk factors associated with future cash flows; and estimates of useful lives. see note 2 of the "notes to consolidated financial statements" for additional information regarding our acquisitions.
goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets purchased goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested for impairment annually or when indicators of impairment exist. goodwill impairment testing involves a comparison of the estimated fair value of reporting units to the respective carrying amount, which may be performed utilizing either a qualitative or quantitative assessment. qualitative factors are first assessed to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. there is an option to bypass the qualitative assessment for any reporting unit in any period and proceed directly to performing the quantitative goodwill impairment test. we have elected to bypass the qualitative assessment for the annual goodwill impairment test in the current year. the quantitative goodwill impairment test involves a comparison of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to the respective carrying amount. a reporting unit is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment (also known as a component). we have two operating segments, which are the same as our reportable segments: pharmaceutical and medical. these operating segments are comprised of divisions (which are components), for which discrete financial information is available. components are aggregated into reporting units for purposes of goodwill impairment testing to the extent that they share similar economic characteristics.
our reporting units are: pharmaceutical operating segment (excluding our nuclear and precision health solutions division); nuclear and precision health solutions division; medical operating segment (excluding our cardinal health at-home solutions division)
("medical unit"); and cardinal health at-home solutions division. our nuclear and precision health solutions division was formerly referred to as our nuclear pharmacy services division and our cardinal health at-
home solutions division was formerly referred to as our cardinal health at home division. goodwill impairment testing involves judgment, including the identification of repo rting units, qualitative evaluation of events and circumstances to determine if it is more likely than not that an impairment exists, and, if necessary, the estimation of the fair value of the applicable reporting unit. our qualitative evaluation considers the weight of evidence and significance of all identified events and circumstances and most relevant drivers of fair value, both positive and negative, in determining whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount.
our determination of estimated fair value of our reporting units is based on a combination of the income-
based and market-based approaches (using discount rates ranging from 8.5 percent to 11.5 percent ) . we use discount rates that are commensurate with the risks and uncertainty inherent in the respective reporting units and in our internally-developed forecasts. under the market-based approach, we determine fair value by comparing our reporting units to similar businesses or guideline companies whose securities are actively traded in public markets. we also use the guideline transaction method to determine fair value based on pricing multiples derived from the sale of companies that are similar to our reporting units.
estimating the fair value of reporting units requires the use of estimates and significant judgments that are based on a number of factors including actual operating results. the use of alternate estimates and assumptions or changes in the industry or peer groups could materially affect the determination of fair value for each reporting unit and potentially result in goodwill impairment. if a reporting unit fails to achieve expected earnings or otherwise fails to meet current financial plans, or if there were changes to any other key assumptions used in the tests, the reporting unit could incur a goodwill impairment in a future period.
we performed annual impairment testing in fiscal 2019,
2018 and 2017 and, with the exception of our medical unit in fiscal 2018, concluded that there were no impairments of goodwill as the estimated fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value. for our annual impairment test in fiscal 2019, the fair value of our medical unit exceeded its carrying value of $10.8
billion by approximately 4 percent. for this test, we used a discount rate of 8.5 percent and a terminal growth rate of 2 percent. the goodwill balance for our medical unit is $4.2 billion. a decrease in future cash flows, an increase in the discount rate or a decrease in the terminal growth rate, among other things, could result in a goodwill impairment for the medical unit.
for example, if we were to increase the discount rate by
0.5 percent, the carrying value would have exceeded the fair value for our medical unit by approximately 2
percent for fiscal 2019. similarly, if we were to decrease the terminal growth rate by 0.5
17  cardinal health|fiscal 2019 form 10-k md&a  critical accounting policies and sensitive accounting estimates percent, the carrying value would have exceeded the fair value for our medical unit by approximately 3 percent for fiscal 2019. for any of our other reporting units, the fair value would not have been less than the carrying amount for fiscal 2019 if we increased the discount rate by 0.5 percent or decreased the terminal growth rate by 0.5 percent. as discussed further in note
4 of the "notes to consolidated financial statements,"
$1.4 billion goodwill impairment charge related to our medical unit, which is included in impairments and
(gain)/loss on disposal of assets in our consolidated statements of earnings. there was no tax benefit related to the goodwill impairment charge. the impairment test for indefinite-lived intangibles other than goodwill
(primarily ipr&d) involves first assessing qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of the indefinite-
lived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount.
if so, then a quantitative test is performed to compare the estimated fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset to the respective asset's carrying amount. our qualitative evaluation requires the use of estimates and significant judgments and considers the weight of evidence and significance of all identified events and circumstances and most relevant drivers of fair value, both positive and negative, in determining whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount.
see note 1 of "notes to consolidated financial statements" for additional information regarding goodwill and other intangible assets.
loss contingencies and self-insurance we accrue for contingencies related to disputes, litigation and regulatory matters if it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. because these matters are inherently unpredictable and unfavorable developments or outcomes can occur, assessing contingencies is highly subjective and requires judgments about future events.
we also self-insure for employee healthcare, certain product liability matters, auto liability, property and workers' compensation and maintain insurance for individual losses exceeding certain limits when available. self-insurance accruals include an estimate for expected settlements on pending claims, defense costs, administrative fees, claims adjustment costs and an estimate for claims incurred but not reported. for certain types of exposures, we develop the estimate of expected ultimate costs to settle each claim based on specific information related to each claim if available. other estimates are based on an assessment of outstanding claims, historical analysis and current payment trends. for claims incurred but not reported, the liabilities are calculated and derived in accordance with generally accepted actuarial practices or using an estimated lag period.
we regularly review contingencies and self-insurance accruals to determine whether our accruals and related disclosures are adequate. any adjustments for changes in reserves are recorded in the period in which the change in estimate occurs.
examples of such contingencies include various lawsuits related to the distribution of prescription opioid pain medications and the cordis ivc filter lawsuits.
we develop and periodically update reserve estimates for cordis ivc claims, including those received to date and expected to be received in the future and related costs.
to project future cordis ivc claim costs, we use a methodology based largely on recent experience, including claim filing rates, estimated indemnity severity by claim type, sales data and estimated defense costs.
the amount of loss may differ from these estimates. see note 8 of the "notes to consolidated financial statements" for additional information regarding loss contingencies and product liability lawsuits.
md&a  critical accounting policies and sensitive accounting estimates provision for income taxes we account for income taxes using the asset and liability method. deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in the respective jurisdictions in which we operate. our income tax expense, deferred income tax assets and liabilities, and unrecognized tax benefits reflect management's assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid on items in the consolidated financial statements. the following table presents information about our tax position at june 30:
total deferred income tax assets (1)     $     864       $     848
valuation allowance for deferred income       (542  )         (412  )
tax assets (2)
net deferred income tax assets                 322             436
total deferred income tax liabilities       (2,035  )       (2,213  )
net deferred income tax liability        $  (1,713  )    $  (1,777  )
(1)  total deferred income tax assets included$621 millionand$526 millionof loss and tax credit carryforwards atjune 30, 2019and2018, respectively.
(2)  the valuation allowance primarily relates to federal, state and international loss and credit carryforwards for which the ultimate realization of future benefits is uncertain.
expiring or unusable loss and credit carryforwards and the required valuation allowances are adjusted quarterly when it is more likely than not that at least a portion of the respective deferred tax assets will not be realized.
after applying the valuation allowances, we do not anticipate any limitations on our use of any of the other net deferred income tax assets described above. we operate in a complex multinational tax environment and are subject to tax treaty arrangements and transfer pricing guidelines for intercompany transactions that are subject to interpretation. uncertainty in a tax position may arise as tax laws are subject to interpretation. tax benefits from uncertain tax positions are recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination of the technical merits of the position, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation. the amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon settlement. for tax benefits that do not qualify for recognition, we recognize a liability for unrecognized tax benefits. our assumptions and estimates around uncertain tax positions require significant judgment; the actual amount of tax benefit related to uncertain tax positions may differ from these estimates. see note 7 of the "notes to consolidated financial statements" for additional information regarding unrecognized tax benefits. we believe that our estimates for the valuation allowances against deferred tax assets and unrecognized tax benefits are appropriate based on current facts and circumstances. the amount we ultimately pay when matters are resolved may differ from the amounts accrued. changes in our current estimates due to unanticipated market conditions, tax law changes or other factors could have a material effect on our ability to utilize deferred tax assets. for a further discussion on provision for income taxes, see note 7 of the "notes to the consolidated financial statements." the calculation of our tax liabilities includes estimates for uncertainties in the application of broad and complex changes to the u.s. tax code as per the tax cuts and jobs act ("the tax act") as enacted by the united states government on december 22, 2017. we have made reasonable estimates and recorded amounts based on management judgment and our current understanding of the tax act which is subject to further interpretation by the internal revenue service ("irs"). see note 7 of the "notes to consolidated financial statements" for additional information regarding the tax act.
19  cardinal health|fiscal 2019 form 10-k explanation and reconciliation of non-gaap financial measures explanation and reconciliation of non-gaap financial measures this report, including the "fiscal 2019 overview" section within md&a, contains financial measures that are not calculated in accordance with gaap.
in addition to analyzing our business based on financial information prepared in accordance with gaap, we use these non-gaap financial measures internally to evaluate our performance, engage in financial and operational planning, and determine incentive compensation because we believe that these measures provide additional perspective on and, in some circumstances are more closely correlated to, the performance of our underlying, ongoing business. we provide these non-gaap financial measures to investors as supplemental metrics to assist readers in assessing the effects of items and events on our financial and operating results on a year-over-year basis and in comparing our performance to that of our competitors. however, the non-gaap financial measures that we use may be calculated differently from, and therefore may not be comparable to, similarly titled measures used by other companies. the non-gaap financial measures disclosed by us should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with gaap, and the financial results calculated in accordance with gaap and reconciliations to those financial statements set forth below should be carefully evaluated.
exclusions from non-gaap financial measures management believes it is useful to exclude the following items from the non-gaap measures presented in this report for its own and for investors' assessment of the business for the reasons identified below:
lifo charges and creditsare excluded because the factors that drive last-in first-out ("lifo") inventory charges or credits, such as pharmaceutical manufacturer price appreciation or deflation and year-end
•  inventory levels (which can be meaningfully influenced by customer buying behavior immediately preceding our fiscal year-end), are largely out of our control and cannot be accurately predicted. the exclusion of lifo charges and credits from non-gaap metrics facilitates comparison of our current financial results to our historical financial results and to our peer group companies' financial results.
state opioid assessment related to prior fiscal yearsis the portion of the new york state assessment under the opioid stewardship act for prescription opioid medications that were sold or distributed in periods prior to fiscal 2019. this portion was excluded from non-gaap financial measures because it related to sales in prior fiscal years and inclusion would have obscured analysis of the current fiscal year results of our underlying, ongoing business. additionally, while the new york law would have required us to make payments on an ongoing basis, the portion of the assessment related to sales in periods prior to fiscal 2019 was contemplated to be a one-time, nonrecurring item. in december 2018, this assessment was declared to be unconstitutional, so during the three months ended december 31, 2018, we reversed the accrual we booked in
•  restructuring and employee severance costsare excluded because they are not part of the ongoing operations of our underlying business.
amortization and other acquisition-related costs, which include transaction costs, integration costs, and changes in the fair value of contingent consideration obligations, are excluded because they are not part of the ongoing operations of our underlying business and to facilitate comparison of our current financial results to our historical financial results and to our peer group companies' financial results.
•  additionally, costs for amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets are non-cash amounts, which are variable in amount and frequency and are significantly impacted by the timing and size of acquisitions, so their exclusion facilitates comparison of historical, current and forecasted financial results. we also exclude other acquisition-related costs, which are directly related to an acquisition but do not meet the criteria to be recognized on the acquired entity's initial balance sheet as part of the purchase price allocation. these costs are also significantly impacted by the timing, complexity and size of acquisitions.
impairments and gain or loss on disposal of assetsare excluded because they do not occur in or reflect the
•  ordinary course of our ongoing business operations and are inherently unpredictable in timing and amount, and in the case of impairments, are non-cash amounts, so their exclusion facilitates comparison of historical, current and forecasted financial results.
litigation recoveries or charges, netare excluded because they often relate to events that may have occurred
•  in prior or multiple periods, do not occur in or reflect the ordinary course of our business and are inherently unpredictable in timing and amount.
loss on extinguishment of debtis excluded because it does not typically occur in the normal course of
•  business and may obscure analysis of trends and financial performance. additionally, the amount and frequency of this type of charge is not consistent and is significantly impacted by the timing and size of debt extinguishment transactions.
transitional tax benefit, netrelated to the tax cuts and jobs act is excluded because it results from the
•  one-time impact of a very significant change in the u.s. federal corporate tax rate and, due to the significant size of the benefit, obscures analysis of trends and financial performance. the transitional tax benefit includes the initial estimate and subsequent adjustments for the re-
explanation and reconciliation of non-gaap financial measures measurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities due to the reduction of the u.s. federal corporate income tax rate and the repatriation tax on undistributed foreign earnings.
the tax effect for each of the items listed above, other than the transitional tax benefit item, is determined using the tax rate and other tax attributes applicable to the item and the jurisdiction(s) in which the item is recorded. the gross, tax and net impact of each item are presented with our gaap to non-gaap reconciliations.

23  cardinal health|fiscal 2019 form 10-k disclosures about market risk quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to cash flow and earnings fluctuations as a result of certain market risks. these market risks primarily relate to foreign exchange, interest rate, and commodity price-related changes. we maintain a hedging program to manage volatility related to some of these market exposures which employs operational, economic, and derivative financial instruments in order to mitigate risk. see note 1 and note 11 of the "notes to consolidated financial statements" for further discussion regarding our use of derivative instruments.
foreign exchange rate sensitivity by the nature of our global operations, we are exposed to cash flow and earnings fluctuations resulting from foreign exchange rate variation. these exposures are transactional and translational in nature. the following foreign currencies represent the principal drivers of our foreign exchange exposure: canadian dollar, euro, thai baht, mexican peso, chinese renminbi, australian dollar, british pound and japanese yen. we apply a value-at-risk ("var") methodology to our transactional and translational exposures. the var model is a risk estimation tool and is not intended to represent actual losses in fair value that could be incurred.
transactional exposure transactional exposure arises from the purchase and sale of goods and services in currencies other than our functional currency or the functional currency of our subsidiaries. at the end of each fiscal year we perform sensitivity analyses on our forecasted transactional exposure for the upcoming fiscal year. these analyses include the estimated impact of our hedging program, which is designed to mitigate transactional exposure. applying a var methodology to our transactional exposure and including the impact of our hedging program, the potential maximum loss in earnings for the upcoming fiscal year is estimated to be $15 million, which is based on a one-year horizon and a 95 percent confidence level. under the same methodology, at june 30, 2018, our potential maximum loss in earnings for the upcoming fiscal year was estimated to be $26 million.
translational exposure we have exposure related to the translation of financial statements of our foreign operations into u.s. dollars, our functional currency. applying a var methodology to our translational exposure, the potential maximum loss in earnings for the upcoming fiscal year is estimated to be $7 million, which is based on a one-year horizon and a 95 percent confidence level. under the same methodology, at june 30, 2018, our potential maximum loss in earnings for the upcoming fiscal year was estimated to be $9 million.
interest rate sensitivity we are exposed to changes in interest rates primarily as a result of our borrowing and investing activities to maintain liquidity and fund operations. the nature and amount of our long-term and short-term debt can be expected to fluctuate as a result of business requirements, market conditions and other factors. our policy is to manage exposures to interest rates using a mix of fixed and floating rate debt as deemed appropriate by management. we utilize interest rate swap instruments to mitigate our exposure to interest rate movements. as part of our risk management program, we perform an annual sensitivity analysis on our forecasted exposure to interest rates for the upcoming fiscal year.
this analysis assumes a hypothetical 50 basis point change in interest rates. at june 30, 2019 and 2018 , the potential increase or decrease in annual interest expense under this analysis as a result of this hypothetical change was $9 million and $15 million, respectively.
we are also exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates related to our cash and cash equivalents, which includes marketable securities that are carried at fair value in the consolidated balance sheets. the fair value of our cash and cash equivalents is subject to change primarily as a result of changes in market interest rates and investment risk related to the issuers' credit worthiness. at june 30, 2019 and 2018, a hypothetical increase or decrease of 50 basis points in interest rates would result in no change in the estimated fair value.
disclosures about market risk commodity price sensitivity we are directly exposed to market price changes for certain commodities, including oil-based resins, nitrile, cotton, diesel fuel and latex. we typically purchase raw materials at either market prices or prices tied to a commodity index and some finished goods at prices based in part on a commodity price index. as part of our risk management program, we perform sensitivity analysis on our forecasted direct commodity exposure for the upcoming fiscal year. our forecasted direct commodity exposure at june 30, 2019 increased approximately $11 million from june 30, 2018. at june
30, 2019 and 2018 , we had hedged a portion of these direct commodity exposures (see note 11 of the "notes to consolidated financial statements" for further discussion).
our forecasted direct commodity exposures for the upcoming fiscal years were $435 million and $424 million at june 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. the potential gain/loss given a hypothetical 10 percent fluctuation in commodity prices, assuming pricing collectively shifts in the same direction and we are unable to change customer pricing in response to those shifts, for the upcoming fiscal year were $44 million and $42 million at june 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. the hypothetical offsetting impact of hedges in both periods was minimal.

pharmaceutical distribution our pharmaceutical distribution division's gross margin includes margin from our generic pharmaceutical program, from distribution services agreements with branded pharmaceutical manufacturers and from over-the-counter healthcare and consumer products. it also includes manufacturer cash discounts. margin from our generic pharmaceutical program includes price discounts and rebates from manufacturers and may in limited instances include price appreciation. our earnings on generic pharmaceuticals are generally highest during the period immediately following the initial launch of a product, because generic pharmaceutical selling prices are generally highest during that period and tend to decline over time. margin from distribution services agreements with branded pharmaceutical manufacturers is derived from compensation we receive for providing a range of distribution and related services to manufacturers. our compensation typically is a percentage of the wholesale acquisition cost that is set by manufacturers. in addition, under a limited number of agreements, branded pharmaceutical price appreciation, which is determined by the manufacturers, also serves as part of our compensation. sourcing venture with cvs health corporation in july 2014, we established red oak sourcing, a u.s.-based generic pharmaceutical sourcing venture with cvs with an initial term of 10 years. red oak sourcing negotiates generic pharmaceutical supply contracts on behalf of both companies. specialty pharmaceutical products and services we refer to products and services offered by our specialty solutions division as "specialty pharmaceutical products and services." the specialty solutions division distributes oncology, rheumatology, urology, nephrology and other pharmaceutical products ("specialty pharmaceutical products") and human-derived plasma products to hospitals, dialysis clinics, physician offices and other healthcare providers; provides consulting, patient support, logistics, group purchasing and other services to pharmaceutical manufacturers and healthcare providers primarily supporting the development, marketing and distribution of specialty pharmaceutical products; and provides specialty pharmacy services. our use of the terminology "specialty pharmaceutical products and services" may not be comparable to the terminology used by other industry participants.
business medical segment our medical segment manufactures and sources cardinal health branded general and specialty medical, surgical and laboratory products. these products include exam and surgical gloves; needle, syringe and sharps disposal;
compression; incontinence; nutritional delivery; wound care; cardiovascular and endovascular; single-use surgical drapes, gowns and apparel; fluid suction and collection systems; urology; operating room supply; and electrode product lines. our cardinal health brand products are sold directly or through third-party distributors in the united states, canada, europe, asia and other markets. the medical segment also distributes a broad range of medical, surgical and laboratory products known as national brand products and provides supply chain services and solutions to hospitals, ambulatory surgery centers, clinical laboratories and other healthcare providers in the united states and canada and this segment also assembles and sells sterile and non-sterile procedure kits.
through cardinal health at-home solutions, this segment also distributes medical products to patients' homes in the united states.
navihealth partnership in august 2018, we entered into a partnership with clayton, dubilier & rice, llc ("cd&r"), through which we own 44% of the ownership interests in the navihealth business. navihealth partners with health plans, hospital systems, physician groups and other healthcare providers to manage post-acute care through value-based programs.
see note 15 of the "notes to consolidated financial statements" for medical segment revenue, profit and assets for fiscal 2019 , 2018 and 2017 .
acquisitions and divestitures acquisitions we have acquired a number of businesses over the years that have enhanced our core strategic areas of cardinal health brand medical products, generic pharmaceutical distribution and services, specialty pharmaceutical products and services, international and post-acute care. we expect to continue to pursue additional acquisitions in the future. during the last five fiscal years, we completed the following three large acquisitions:
lines                                    acquisition date   company                              location       of business                                    price

10/15  cordis business of johnson &         fremont, ca    cardiovascular and endovascular                 $1.9
we also completed several smaller acquisitions during the last five fiscal years, including: in fiscal 2017, the acquisition of the north american rights to lymphoseek, a radiopharmaceutical diagnostic imaging agent, from navidea biopharmaceuticals, inc.; and in fiscal 2015, the acquisitions of tradex international, inc., a supplier of disposable gloves, and metro medical supply, inc., a distributor of specialty pharmaceuticals and medical and surgical products.
divestitures over the past two fiscal years, we have also completed several divestitures. in february 2018, we completed the sale of our pharmaceutical and medical products distribution business in china to shanghai pharmaceuticals holding co., ltd. for proceeds of $861 million (after adjusting for third party indebtedness and preliminary transaction adjustments). in august 2018, we completed the sale of our ownership interest in navihealth, inc. to investor entities controlled by cd&r for proceeds of $736 million (after adjusting for certain fees and expenses) and a 44% equity interest in a partnership that owns the navihealth business. we had acquired our ownership interest in navihealth through a series of transactions, beginning in fiscal 2016, when we acquired a
27  cardinal health|fiscal 2019 form 10-k business customers our largest customers, cvs and optumrx, accounted for 26
percent and 13 percent of our fiscal 2019 revenue, respectively. in the aggregate, our five largest customers, including cvs and optumrx, accounted for 51
percent of our fiscal 2019 revenue. in may 2019, we extended our pharmaceutical distribution agreements with cvs through fiscal 2023. we have agreements with group purchasing organizations ("gpos") that act as agents to negotiate vendor contracts on behalf of their members. our two largest gpo relationships in terms of member revenue are with vizient, inc. and premier, inc.
sales to members of these two gpos, under numerous contracts across all of our businesses, collectively accounted for 22 percent of our revenue in fiscal 2019 .
suppliers we rely on many different suppliers. products obtained from our five largest suppliers accounted for an aggregate of 42 percent of our revenue during fiscal 2019 , and our largest supplier's products accounted for approximately
competition we operate in a highly competitive environment in the distribution of pharmaceuticals and consumer healthcare products. we also operate in a highly competitive environment in the manufacturing and distribution of medical devices and surgical products. we compete on many levels, including price, service offerings, support services, breadth of product lines and product quality and efficacy. in the pharmaceutical segment, we compete with wholesale distributors with national reach, including mckesson corporation and amerisourcebergen corporation, regional wholesale distributors, self-
warehousing chains, specialty distributors, third-party logistics companies, companies that provide specialty pharmaceutical services and nuclear pharmacies, among others. in addition, the pharmaceutical segment has experienced competition from a number of organizations offering generic pharmaceuticals, including telemarketers. we also compete with manufacturers that sell their products directly.
in the medical segment, we compete with many diversified healthcare companies and national medical product distributors, such as medline industries, inc., owens &
minor, inc. and becton, dickinson and company, as well as regional medical product distributors and companies that are focused on specific product categories. we also compete with companies that distribute medical products to patients' homes and third-party logistics companies.
employees at june 30, 2019 , we had approximately 31,000 employees in the united states and approximately 18,500 employees outside of the united states.
intellectual property we rely on a combination of trade secret, patent, copyright and trademark laws, nondisclosure and other contractual provisions, and technical measures to protect our products, services and intangible assets. we hold patents, and continue to pursue patent protection throughout the world, relating to the manufacture, operation and use of various medical and surgical products, to certain distribution and logistics systems, to the production and distribution of our nuclear pharmacy products and to other service offerings. we also operate under licenses for certain proprietary technologies, and in certain instances we license our technologies to third parties.
we believe that we have taken all necessary steps to protect our proprietary rights, but no assurance can be given that we will be able to successfully enforce or protect our rights in the event that they are infringed upon by a third party. while all of these proprietary rights are important to our operations, we do not consider any particular patent, trademark, license, franchise or concession to be material to our overall business.
business regulatory matters our business is highly regulated in the united states, at both the federal and state level, and in foreign countries. depending upon the specific business, we may be subject to regulation by government entities including:
•  the u.s. drug enforcement administration (the "dea");
certain agencies within the u.s. department of health and human services, including the u.s. food and drug
•  administration (the "fda"), the centers for medicare and medicaid services, the office of inspector general and the office for civil rights;
•  state boards of pharmacy and other controlled substance authorities;
•  the u.s. nuclear regulatory commission (the "nrc");
•  agencies comparable to those listed above in markets outside the united states.
these regulatory agencies have a variety of civil, administrative and criminal sanctions at their disposal for failure to comply with applicable legal or regulatory requirements. they can suspend our ability to manufacture and distribute products, require us to initiate product recalls, seize products or impose criminal, civil and administrative sanctions. distribution state boards of pharmacy, fda, dea and various other state authorities regulate the marketing, purchase, storage and distribution of pharmaceutical and medical products under various federal and state statutes including the federal prescription drug marketing act of 1987, drug quality and security act of 2013 (the "dqsa"), and controlled substances act (the "csa"). the csa governs the sale, packaging, storage and distribution of controlled substances. wholesale distributors of controlled substances must hold valid dea registrations and state-level licenses, meet various security and operating standards including effective anti-
diversion programs, and comply with the csa. they must also comply with state requirements relating to controlled substances that differ from state to state. manufacturing and marketing we sell our manufactured products in the united states, canada, europe, asia, latin america and other markets. the fda and other governmental agencies in the united states, as well as foreign governmental agencies, administer requirements that cover the design, testing, safety, effectiveness, manufacturing (including good manufacturing practices), quality systems, labeling, promotion and advertising (including restrictions on promoting or advertising a product other than for the product's cleared or approved uses), distribution, importation and post-market surveillance for most of our manufactured products. in addition, we need specific approval or clearance from, and registrations with, regulatory authorities before we can market and sell some products in the united states and certain other countries, including countries in the european union ("eu"). in the united states, authorization to commercially market a medical device is generally received in one of two ways. the first, known as pre-market notification or the 510(k) process, requires us to demonstrate that a medical device is substantially equivalent to a legally marketed medical device. the second more rigorous process, known as pre-market approval ("pma"), requires us to independently demonstrate that a medical device is safe and effective. many of our medical segment products are cleared through the 510(k) process and certain products must be approved through the pma process. in the eu, we are required to comply with the medical device directive ("mdd") and obtain ce mark certification in order to market medical devices. the eu regulatory bodies finalized a new medical device regulation ("mdr") in 2017, which will replace the existing mdd after a three-year transition period. under the mdr, medical devices marketed in the eu will require certification under its requirements, except that devices with valid ce mark issued before may 2020 can be marketed until may 2024. it can be costly and time-consuming to obtain regulatory approvals, clearances and registrations of medical devices, and they might not be granted on a timely basis, if at all. even after we obtain approval or clearance to market a product or obtain product registrations, the product and our manufacturing processes are subject to continued regulatory oversight, including periodic inspection of manufacturing facilities by fda and other regulatory authorities both in the united states and internationally. from time to time, we may determine that products we manufacture or market do not meet our specifications, regulatory requirements or published standards. when we or a regulatory agency identify a quality or regulatory issue, we investigate and take appropriate corrective action, which may include recalling the product, correcting the product at the customer location, revising product labeling and notifying customers. health and personal information practices and privacy we collect, handle and maintain patient-identifiable health information. the u.s. health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996
("hipaa"), as augmented by the health information technology for economic and clinical health act, and state laws regulate the use and disclosure of patient-identifiable health information, including requiring specified privacy and security measures. we also collect, handle and maintain other sensitive personal and financial information that is subject to u.s. federal and state laws protecting such information. additionally, the new california consumer privacy act ("ccpa"), effective in january 2020, grants additional rights for consumers over the use of their personal information that we hold, including increased transparency. other u.s. states are considering adopting similar or different privacy laws.
29  cardinal health|fiscal 2019 form 10-k business the processing and disclosure of personal information is also highly regulated in many other countries in which we operate. in europe, for example, we are subject to the eu data protection regulations, including the current eu directive on data protection, which requires member states to impose minimum restrictions on the collection, use and transfer of personal data. the eu general data protection regulation ("gdpr") includes, among other things, a requirement for prompt notice of data breaches to data subjects and supervisory authorities in certain circumstances and significant fines for non-compliance. the gdpr also requires companies processing personal data of individuals residing in the eu to comply with eu privacy and data protection rules. nuclear pharmacies and related businesses our nuclear pharmacies and radiopharmaceutical manufacturing facilities (including for xofigo) require licenses or permits and must abide by regulations issued by the nrc, applicable state boards of pharmacy and the radiologic health agency or department of health of each state in which we operate, including pharmacy sterile compounding standards and practices. in addition, our radiopharmaceutical manufacturing facilities also must comply with fda regulations, including good manufacturing practices.
product tracing and supply chain integrity title ii of the dqsa, known as the drug supply chain security act or
"track and trace," establishes a phased-in national system for tracing pharmaceutical products through the pharmaceutical distribution supply chain to prevent the introduction of counterfeit, adulterated or mislabeled drugs. the first phase of implementation began in 2015, and upon full implementation in 2023, we and other supply chain stakeholders will participate in an electronic, interoperable, prescription drug tracing system. in addition, the fda also has issued regulations requiring most medical device labeling to bear a unique device identifier. these regulations are being phased in through 2020. the mdr finalized in the eu in 2017 also introduces a new unique device identifier requirement with a three-year transition period. government healthcare programs we are subject to u.s. federal healthcare fraud and abuse laws. these laws generally prohibit persons from soliciting, offering, receiving or paying any compensation in order to induce someone to order, recommend or purchase products or services that are in any way paid for by medicare, medicaid or other federally-funded healthcare programs. they also prohibit submitting any fraudulent claim for payment by the federal government. there are similar state healthcare fraud and abuse laws that apply to medicaid and other state-funded healthcare programs. violations of these laws may result in criminal or civil penalties, as well as breach of contract claims and qui tam actions (false claims cases initiated by private parties purporting to act on behalf of federal or state governments). some businesses within each of our segments are medicare-
certified suppliers or participate in other federal and state healthcare programs, such as state medicaid programs and the federal 340b drug pricing program. these businesses are subject to accreditation and quality standards and other rules and regulations, including applicable reporting, billing, payment and record-keeping requirements. other businesses within each segment manufacture pharmaceutical or medical products or repackage pharmaceuticals that are purchased or reimbursed through, or are otherwise governed by, federal or state healthcare programs. failure to comply with applicable eligibility requirements, standards and regulations could result in civil or criminal sanctions, including the loss of our ability to participate in medicare, medicaid and other federal and state healthcare programs.
our u.s. federal and state government contracts are subject to specific procurement requirements. failure to comply with applicable rules or regulations or with contractual or other requirements may result in monetary damages and criminal or civil penalties as well as termination of our government contracts or our suspension or debarment from government contract work.
environmental, health and safety laws in the united states and other countries, we are subject to various federal, state and local environmental laws, including laws regulating the production or use of hazardous substances, as well as laws relating to safe working conditions and laboratory practices.
antitrust laws the u.s. federal government, most u.s. states and many foreign countries have laws that prohibit certain types of conduct deemed to be anti-competitive. violations of these laws can result in various sanctions, including criminal and civil penalties. private plaintiffs also could bring civil lawsuits against us in the united states for alleged antitrust law violations, including claims for treble damages.
laws relating to foreign trade and operations u.s. and foreign laws require us to abide by standards relating to the import and export of finished goods, raw materials and supplies and the handling of information.
we also must comply with various export control and trade embargo laws, which may require licenses or other authorizations for transactions within some countries or with some counterparties.
similarly, we are subject to u.s. and foreign laws concerning the conduct of our foreign operations, including the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act, the u.k. bribery act and other foreign anti-bribery laws.
among other things, these laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from offering, promising or making payments to officials of foreign governments for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business.
business other information although our agreements with manufacturers sometimes require us to maintain inventory levels within specified ranges, our distribution businesses are generally not required by our customers to maintain particular inventory levels other than as needed to meet service level requirements. certain supply contracts with u.s.
government entities require us to maintain sufficient inventory to meet emergency demands, but we do not believe those requirements materially affect inventory levels.
our customer return policies generally require that the product be physically returned, subject to restocking fees. we only allow customers to return product for credit that can be added back to inventory and resold at full value, or that can be returned to vendors for credit.
we offer market payment terms to our customers.
31  cardinal health|fiscal 2019 form 10-k risk factors risk factors the risks described below could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity or cash flows. these are not the only risks we face. our businesses also could be affected by risks that we are not presently aware of or that we currently consider immaterial to our operations. we could continue to suffer the adverse effects of competitive pressures.
as described in greater detail in the "business"
section, we operate in markets that are highly competitive and dynamic. in addition, competitive pressures in our pharmaceutical and medical segments may be increased by new business models, new entrants, new regulations, changes in consumer demand or general competitive dynamics. our businesses face continued pricing pressure from these factors, which adversely affects our margins. if we are unable to offset margin reductions caused by these pricing pressures through steps such as sourcing or cost control measures, additional service offerings and sales of higher margin products, our results of operations could continue to be adversely affected. our pharmaceutical segment's generic pharmaceutical program may continue to be adversely affected by pricing changes and fewer product launches.
the performance of our pharmaceutical segment's generic pharmaceutical program declined in fiscal 2019, 2018 and
these declines have been due, in large part, to generic pharmaceutical customer pricing deflation and less incremental benefit from new generic pharmaceutical launches, which have more than offset the benefits from sourcing generic pharmaceuticals through our red oak sourcing venture with cvs. if performance of the generic pharmaceutical program continues to decline and we continue to be unable to offset the decline, our pharmaceutical segment profit and consolidated operating earnings will continue to be adversely affected. the extent and magnitude of generic pharmaceutical pricing changes is uncertain in future fiscal years and may vary from what we anticipate. similarly, the number of new generic pharmaceutical launches also varies from year to year, and the margin impact of these launches varies from product to product. finally, the benefit from red oak sourcing could be less than we anticipate. changes in manufacturer approaches to pricing branded pharmaceutical products could have an adverse effect on our pharmaceutical segment's margins. compensation under our contractual arrangements with manufacturers for the purchase of branded pharmaceutical products is generally based on the wholesale acquisition cost set by the manufacturer. sales prices of branded pharmaceutical products to our customers generally are a percentage discount from wholesale acquisition cost. historically, pharmaceutical manufacturers have generally increased the wholesale acquisition cost of their branded pharmaceuticals each year. however, the u.s. government has announced plans to, among other things, adopt policies to encourage manufacturers to limit increases in (or reduce) wholesale acquisition cost. in fiscal 2019, manufacturers, in the aggregate, increased prices less than in prior years. if manufacturers change their historical approach to setting and increasing wholesale acquisition cost and we are unable to negotiate alternative ways to be compensated by manufacturers or customers for the value of our services, our pharmaceutical segment profit and consolidated operating earnings could be adversely affected.
also, almost all of our distribution services agreements with branded pharmaceutical manufacturers generally provide that we receive fees from the manufacturers to compensate us for services we provide them. however, under a limited number of agreements, branded pharmaceutical price appreciation, which is determined by the manufacturers also serves as a part of our compensation. if manufacturers decide to reduce prices, not to increase prices or to implement only small increases and we are unable to negotiate alternative ways to be compensated by manufacturers or customers for the value of our services, our margins could be adversely affected.
the public health crisis involving the abuse of prescription opioid pain medication could have a material negative effect on our business.
a significant number of counties, municipalities and other plaintiffs, including a number of state attorneys general, have filed lawsuits against pharmaceutical manufacturers, pharmaceutical wholesale distributors
(including us), retail chains and others relating to the manufacturing, marketing or distribution of prescription opioid pain medications. in addition, we are currently being investigated or sued by most other states for the same activities and expect to be named as a defendant in additional lawsuits. we are vigorously defending ourselves in these lawsuits. the defense and resolution of current and future lawsuits and events relating to these lawsuits could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows or liquidity or have adverse reputational or operational effects on our business. see note 8 of the
"notes to the consolidated financial statements" for more information regarding these matters.
other legislative, regulatory or industry measures related to the public health crisis involving the abuse of prescription opioid pain medication and the distribution of these medications could affect our business in ways that we may not be able to predict. for example, several states have now adopted taxes or other fees on the sale of opioids, and several other states have proposed similar legislative initiatives. these laws and proposals vary in the tax amounts imposed and the means of calculation. liabilities for taxes or assessments under any such laws could have an adverse impact on our results of operations unless we are able to mitigate them through operational changes or commercial arrangements where permitted.
risk factors ongoing unfavorable publicity regarding the abuse or misuse of prescription opioid pain medications and the role of wholesale distributors in the supply chain of such prescription medications, as well as the continued proliferation of the opioid lawsuits, investigations, regulations and legislative actions, and unfavorable publicity in relation to those lawsuits could have a material adverse effect on our reputation or results of operations. our business is subject to rigorous regulatory and licensing requirements. as described in greater detail in the "business" section, our business is highly regulated in the united states, at both the federal and state level, and in foreign countries. if we fail to comply with regulatory requirements, or if allegations are made that we fail to comply, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. to lawfully operate our businesses, we are required to obtain and hold permits, product registrations, licenses and other regulatory approvals from, and to comply with operating and security standards of, numerous governmental bodies. for example, as a wholesale distributor of controlled substances, we must hold valid dea registrations and state-level licenses, meet various security and operating standards, and comply with the csa. failure to maintain or renew necessary permits, product registrations, licenses or approvals, or to comply with required standards, could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. products that we manufacture, source, distribute or market must comply with regulatory requirements. noncompliance or concerns over noncompliance may result in suspension of our ability to distribute, import or manufacture products, product bans, recalls or seizures, or criminal or civil sanctions, which, in turn, could result in product liability claims and lawsuits, including class actions.
in addition, it can be costly and time-consuming to obtain regulatory approvals or product registrations to market a medical device, and such approvals or registrations might not be granted on a timely basis, if at all. we collect, handle and maintain patient-
identifiable health information and other sensitive personal and financial information, which are subject to federal, state and foreign laws that regulate the use and disclosure of such information. regulations currently in place continue to evolve, and new laws in this area could further restrict our ability to collect, handle and maintain personal or patient information, or could require us to incur additional compliance costs, either of which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations. violations of federal, state or foreign laws concerning privacy and data protection could subject us to civil or criminal penalties, breach of contract claims, costs for remediation and harm to our reputation. we are required to comply with laws relating to healthcare fraud and abuse. the requirements of these laws are complex and subject to varying interpretations. from time to time, regulatory authorities investigate our policies or practices, and may challenge them. if we fail to comply with these laws, we could be subject to federal or state government investigations or qui tam actions (false claims cases initiated by private parties purporting to act on behalf of federal or state governments), which could result in civil or criminal sanctions, including the loss of licenses or the ability to participate in medicare, medicaid and other federal and state healthcare programs. such sanctions and damages could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
some businesses within each of our segments are medicare-certified suppliers or participate in other federal and state healthcare programs, such as state medicaid program and the federal 340b drug pricing program. in addition, some businesses within each segment manufacture pharmaceutical or medical products or repackage pharmaceuticals that are purchased or reimbursed through, or are otherwise governed by, federal or state healthcare programs. failure to comply with applicable eligibility requirements, standards and regulations could result in civil or criminal sanctions, including the loss of our ability to participate in medicare, medicaid and other federal and state healthcare programs.
our government contracts are subject to specific procurement requirements. failure to comply with applicable rules or regulations or with contractual or other requirements may result in monetary damages and criminal or civil penalties as well as termination of our government contracts or our suspension or debarment from government contract work.
our global operations are required to comply with the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act, the u.k. bribery act and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions and u.s. and foreign export control, trade embargo and customs laws. if we fail to comply with any of these laws, we could suffer civil or criminal sanctions.
we could be subject to adverse changes in the tax laws or challenges to our tax positions.
we are a large multinational corporation with operations in the united states and many foreign countries. as a result, we are subject to the tax laws of many jurisdictions.
from time to time, initiatives are proposed in the united states and other jurisdictions in which we operate that could adversely affect our tax positions, effective tax rate or tax payments. specific initiatives that may impact us include the repeal of the lifo (last-
in, first-out) method of inventory accounting for income tax purposes, the establishment or increase in taxation at the u.s. state level on the basis of gross revenues, recommendations of the recently completed base erosion and profit shifting project undertaken by the organization for economic cooperation and development and the european commission's investigation into illegal state aid.
tax laws are complex and subject to varying interpretations. tax authorities have challenged some of our tax positions and it is possible that they will challenge others. these challenges may adversely affect our effective tax rate or tax payments.
changes to the u.s. healthcare environment may not be favorable to us.
over a number of years, the u.s. healthcare industry has undergone significant changes designed to increase access to medical care, improve safety and patient outcomes, contain costs and increase efficiencies. these changes include adoption of the patient protection and affordable care act, a general decline in medicare
33  cardinal health|fiscal 2019 form 10-k risk factors and medicaid reimbursement levels, efforts by healthcare insurance companies to limit or reduce payments to pharmacies and providers, the basis for payments beginning to transition from a fee-for-service model to value-based payments and risk-sharing models, and the industry shifting away from traditional healthcare venues like hospitals and into clinics, physician offices and patients' homes. we expect the u.s.
healthcare industry to continue to change significantly in the future. possible changes include repeal and replacement of major parts of the patient protection and affordable care act, further reduction or limitations on governmental funding at the state or federal level, efforts by healthcare insurance companies to further limit payments for products and services or changes in legislation or regulations governing prescription pharmaceutical pricing, healthcare services or mandated benefits. these possible changes, and the uncertainty surrounding these possible changes, may cause healthcare industry participants to reduce the amount of products and services they purchase from us or the price they are willing to pay for our products and services, which could adversely affect us. our business and operations depend on the proper functioning of information systems, critical facilities and distribution networks. we rely on our and third-party service providers' information systems for a wide variety of critical operations, including to obtain, rapidly process, analyze and manage data to:
•  facilitate the purchase and distribution of inventory items from numerous distribution centers;
•  receive, process and ship orders on a timely basis;
•  manage accurate billing and collections for thousands of customers;
•  process payments to suppliers;
•  facilitate manufacturing and assembly of medical products; and
•  generate financial information.
our business also depends on the proper functioning of our critical facilities, including our national logistics center, and our distribution networks. our results of operations could be adversely affected if our or a service provider's information systems, critical facilities or distribution networks are disrupted (including disruption of access), are damaged or fail, whether due to physical disruptions, such as fire, natural disaster, pandemic or power outage, or due to cyber-security incidents, ransomware or other actions of third parties, including labor strikes, political unrest and terrorist attacks. manufacturing disruptions also can occur due to regulatory action, production quality deviations, safety issues or raw material shortages or defects, or because a key product or component is manufactured at a single manufacturing facility with limited alternate facilities. from time to time, our businesses perform business process improvements or infrastructure modernizations or use service providers for key systems and processes, such as receiving and processing customer orders, customer service and accounts payable.
if any of these initiatives are not successfully or efficiently implemented or maintained, they could adversely affect our business and our internal control over financial reporting. our business and results of operations could be adversely affected if we experience a cyber-attack or other systems breach. our business relies on the secure transmission, storage and hosting of patient-identifiable health information, financial information and other sensitive information relating to our customers, company and workforce. we have programs in place to detect, contain and respond to information security incidents. however, because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service or sabotage systems change frequently and may be difficult to detect for long periods of time, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. in addition, hardware, software or applications developed internally or procured from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture or other problems that could unexpectedly compromise information security. unauthorized parties have gained access and will continue to attempt to gain access to our or a service provider's systems or facilities through fraud, trickery or other forms of deception. we have been the target of cyber attacks, including incidents where certain customer account information was accessed. although we do not believe these incidents had a material impact on us, similar incidents or events in the future may negatively impact our business, reputation or financial results. any compromise of our or a service provider's information systems, including unauthorized access to or use or disclosure of sensitive information, could adversely impact our operations, results of operations or our ability to satisfy legal or regulatory requirements, including the new eu general data protection regulation (gdpr) and those related to patient-identifiable health information as further described in the risk factor titled "our business is subject to rigorous regulatory and licensing requirements," above. cvs is a large customer that generates a significant amount of our revenue. our sales and credit concentration is significant. cvs accounted for 26 percent of our fiscal 2019
risk factors two incumbents. if this consolidation trend continues, it could adversely affect our results of operations. we may become involved in legal proceedings that could adversely impact our cash flows or results of operations. due to the nature of our business, which includes the distribution of controlled substances and the manufacture of medical products, we regularly become involved in disputes, litigation and regulatory matters.
litigation is inherently unpredictable and the unfavorable outcome of one or more of these legal proceedings could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition. for example, we are subject to a number of lawsuits and investigations related to the national health crisis involving the abuse of opioid pain medication as described above in the risk factor titled "the public health crisis involving the abuse of prescription opioid pain medication could negatively affect our business" and in note 8 to the "notes to consolidated financial statements." additionally, some of the products that we distribute or manufacture have been and may in the future be alleged to cause personal injury, subjecting us to product liability claims. for example, we are a defendant in product liability lawsuits that allege personal injuries associated with the use of cordis optease and trapease inferior vena cava (ivc) filter products. we have accrued an amount for losses and legal defense costs related to these lawsuits, which are discussed in note 8 of the "notes to consolidated financial statements." any settlement of or judgment for a product liability claim that is not covered by insurance and is in excess of any prior accruals could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. we also operate in an industry characterized by extensive intellectual property litigation. patent litigation can result in significant damage awards and injunctions that could prevent the manufacture and sale of affected products or force us to make royalty payments in order to continue selling the affected products. our ability to manage and complete acquisitions could impact our strategic objectives and financial condition. an important element of our growth strategy has been to acquire other businesses that expand or complement our existing businesses. completion of acquisitions and the integration of acquired businesses involve a number of risks, including the following: we may overpay for a business or fail to realize the synergies and other benefits we expect from the acquisition; our management's attention may be diverted to integration efforts; we may fail to retain key personnel of the acquired business; future developments may impair the value of our purchased goodwill or intangible assets; we may face difficulties or delays establishing, integrating or combining operations and systems, including manufacturing facilities; we may assume liabilities related to legal proceedings involving the acquired business; we may face challenges retaining the customers of the acquired business; or we may encounter unforeseen internal control, regulatory or compliance issues.
our results of operations could be adversely impacted if we fail to manage and complete divestitures.
we regularly evaluate our portfolio of businesses to determine whether an asset or business may no longer help us meet our objectives or whether there may be a more advantaged owner for that business. for example, over the past two fiscal years, we divested our pharmaceutical and medical products distribution business in china and our ownership interest in navihealth, inc. when we decide to sell assets or a business, we may encounter difficulty finding buyers or alternative exit strategies, which could delay the achievement of our strategic objectives. we could also experience greater dis-synergies than expected and the impact of the divestiture on our results of operations could be greater than anticipated.
we depend on certain suppliers to make their raw materials and products available to us and are subject to fluctuations in costs of raw materials and products.
we depend on the availability of various components, compounds, raw materials and energy supplied by others for our operations. in some instances, for reasons of quality assurance, cost effectiveness, or availability, we procure certain components and raw materials from a sole supplier. any of our supplier relationships could be interrupted or become less favorable due to events beyond our control, including natural disasters, u.s. or international foreign policy, including tariffs, or could be terminated. in addition, due to the stringent regulations and requirements of the fda regarding the manufacture of our products, we may not be able to quickly establish additional or replacement sources for certain components or materials. a sustained supply reduction or interruption, and an inability to develop alternative sources for such supply, could have an adverse effect on our business.
our manufacturing businesses use oil-based resins, pulp, cotton, latex and other commodities as raw materials in many products. prices of oil and gas also affect our distribution and transportation costs. prices of these commodities are volatile and can fluctuate significantly, causing our costs to produce and distribute our products to fluctuate. due to competitive dynamics and contractual limitations, we may be unable to pass along cost increases through higher prices. if we cannot fully offset cost increases through other cost reductions, or recover these costs through price increases or surcharges, our results of operations could be adversely affected.
we may not realize the expected benefits from our restructuring and cost-savings initiatives.
we recently announced that we will be undertaking certain cost-savings initiatives intended to simplify our operating model and cost structure, and we expect to identify and enter into similar initiatives in the future. these initiatives could result in unexpected charges and expenses that negatively impact our financial results or we could fail to achieve the desired efficiencies and estimated cost savings.
additionally, these types of initiatives could yield unintended consequences such as distraction of management and employees, business disruption, an inability to attract or retain key personnel,
35  cardinal health|fiscal 2019 form 10-k risk factors which could negatively affect our business or financial condition and results of operations. if we are not able to effectively develop, implement and manage our outsourcing or similar third-party relationships, we may experience operational difficulties and increased costs, which may adversely affect our results of operations. as a result of our international operations, we have exposure to economic, political and currency risks. we conduct our operations in various regions of the world outside of the united states, including europe, asia and latin america. global developments can affect our business in many ways. our global operations are affected by local economic environments, including inflation, recession and competition. additionally, divergent or unfamiliar regulatory systems and labor markets also can increase the risks and burdens of operating in numerous countries. in addition, we conduct our business in u.s. dollars and various functional currencies of our foreign subsidiaries. changes in foreign currency exchange rates could adversely affect our financial results, which are reported in u.s.
dollars. we may not be able to hedge to protect us against these exposures, and any hedges may not successfully mitigate these exposures.
changes or uncertainty in u.s. or international trade policies or tariffs could disrupt our global operations or negatively impact our financial results.
our foreign operations expose us to a number of risks related to trade protection laws, tariffs, excise or other border taxes on goods sourced from certain countries or on the importation or exportation of products or raw materials. changes or uncertainty in u.s. or international trade policies or tariffs could impact our global operations, as well as our customers and suppliers. we may be required to spend more money to source certain products or materials that we need or to manufacture certain of our products. this could adversely impact our business and results of operations.
our goodwill may be further impaired, which would require us to record a significant charge to earnings in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
u.s. gaap requires us to test our goodwill for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if indicators for potential impairment exist. in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018, we recorded a $1.4 billion impairment to goodwill within our medical segment. the testing required by gaap involves estimates and significant judgments by management. although we believe our assumptions and estimates are reasonable and appropriate, any changes in key assumptions, including a failure to meet business plans or other unanticipated events and circumstances such as a rise in interest rates, may affect the accuracy or validity of such estimates. it is possible that we may record significant charges related to other reporting units or we may record additional charges in our medical segment, which charge or charges could adversely affect our results of operations. see "critical accounting policies and sensitive accounting estimates" in md&a above for more information regarding goodwill impairment testing.
properties and legal proceedings properties in the united states, at june 30, 2019 , the pharmaceutical segment operated one national logistics center; a number of primary pharmaceutical and specialty distribution facilities as well as nuclear pharmacy and radiopharmaceutical manufacturing facilities. the medical segment operated medical-surgical distribution, assembly, manufacturing and other operating facilities in the united states. outside the united states and puerto rico, at june 30, 2019 , our medical segment operated manufacturing facilities in canada, costa rica, the dominican republic, germany, ireland, japan, malaysia, malta, mexico and thailand.
our principal executive offices are headquartered in an owned building located at 7000 cardinal place in dublin, ohio.
we consider our operating properties to be in satisfactory condition and adequate to meet our present needs. however, we regularly evaluate operating properties and may make further additions and improvements or consolidate locations as we seek opportunities to expand or enhance the efficiency of our business.
legal proceedings in addition to the proceedings described below, the legal proceedings described in note 8 of the "notes to consolidated financial statements" are incorporated in this "legal proceedings" section by reference.
in june 2019, melissa cohen, a purported shareholder, filed an action on behalf of cardinal health, inc. in the u.s. district court for the southern district of ohio against certain current and former members of our board of directors alleging that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties by failing to effectively monitor cardinal health's distribution of controlled substances. the derivative complaint seeks, among other things, unspecified money damages against the defendants and an award of attorney's fees.

41  cardinal health|fiscal 2019 form 10-k reports report of independent registered public accounting firm to the shareholders and the board of directors of cardinal health, inc.
opinion on the financial statements we have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of cardinal health, inc. and subsidiaries (the company) as of june 30, 2019 and 2018, the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income, shareholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended june 30, 2019, and the related notes and the financial statement schedule listed in the index at item 15(a)(2) (collectively referred to as the
"consolidated financial statements"). in our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the company at june 30, 2019 and 2018, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended june 30, 2019, in conformity with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles.
we also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board (united states) (pcaob), the company's internal control over financial reporting as of june 30, 2019, based on criteria established in internal control-integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission (2013 framework) and our report dated august 20, 2019 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
basis for opinion these financial statements are the responsibility of the company's management. our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company's financial statements based on our audits. we are a public accounting firm registered with the pcaob and are required to be independent with respect to the company in accordance with the u.s. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the securities and exchange commission and the pcaob.
we conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the pcaob. those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. we believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
critical audit matters the critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. the communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.
medical unit goodwill at june 30, 2019, goodwill related to the company's medical segment, including the medical unit was $5.7 billion. as discussed innote 4to the consolidated financial statements, goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually at the reporting unit level.
auditing management's annual goodwill impairment test for the medical unit was description of the matter  challenging because this reporting unit's fair value had an impairment in the previous year and there is significant judgement required in determining the fair value of the reporting unit.  in particular, the fair value estimate was sensitive to significant judgmental assumptions including the revenue growth rate, gross margin, distribution, selling, general and administrative expenses, and company specific risk premium, which are affected by expectations about future market or economic conditions.
reports we obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the company's goodwill impairment review process. for example, we tested controls over management's review of significant judgmental assumptions, including the revenue growth rate, gross margin, distribution, selling, general and administrative expenses, and company specific risk premium, among other assumptions.
to test the estimated fair value of the company's reporting unit, we performed audit procedures that included, among others, evaluating methodologies used, involving our valuation specialists in testing the significant assumptions described above and testing the how we addressed the matter in our audit  underlying data used by the company in its analysis for completeness and accuracy. we compared the significant assumptions used by management to current industry and economic trends, recent historical performance, changes to the reporting unit's business model, customer base or product mix and other relevant factors. we assessed the historical accuracy of management's estimates and performed sensitivity analyses of significant assumptions to evaluate the changes in the fair value of the reporting unit that would result from changes in the assumptions. we evaluated the incorporation of the applicable assumptions into the model and tested the model's computational accuracy. in addition, we inspected the company's reconciliation of the fair value of all reporting units to the market capitalization of the company and assessed the results.
product liability lawsuits as described innote 8to the consolidated financial statements, the company is a defendant in various product liability claims in which individuals seek damages associated with the use of cordis optease and trapease inferior vena cava (ivc) filter products. the company accrues for losses and defense costs related to product liability at the time a loss is probable and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. the methodology used by the company to project future cordis ivc claim costs is based largely on recent experience, including claim filing rates, indemnity severity by claim type, sales data and defense costs. the company periodically reviews such estimates and records adjustments for changes in reserves in the period in which the change in estimate occurs.  at june 30, 2019, the description of the matter                 company's product liability reserve balance related to the cordis ivc lawsuits totaled $368 million, net. the company believes there is a range of estimated losses with respect to these matters. because no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount within the range, the company has accrued the minimum amount in the range. the company estimates the high end of the range to be approximately $762 million, net of estimated insurance recoveries.
auditing management's accounting for and disclosure of loss contingencies related to the cordis ivc product liability lawsuits was challenging due to the significant judgment required to develop the key assumptions utilized in the model and the nature of information available given the early stages of these lawsuits and the limited claims history.
we obtained an understanding, evaluated the design, and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over management's evaluation of the product liability litigation reserve.  for example, we tested controls over management's review of the model used to estimate the product liability reserve amount and the significant assumptions as described above used within the model. we also tested management's controls over the completeness and accuracy of the data used in the model.
to test management's assessment of the probability of occurrence of a loss and whether the loss was reasonably estimable, we evaluated, for example, claims data of the company, we evaluated the legal letters how we addressed the matter in our audit  obtained from internal and external legal counsel, and we discussed with internal and external legal counsel of the plaintiffs' claims.
among other procedures we performed to test the measurement of the product liability litigation reserve, we evaluated the method of measuring the reserve for claims including analyses to determine the range of possible losses, obtained and performed audit procedures relative to the analysis, tested the accuracy and completeness of the data, and evaluated new or contrary information affecting the estimate. in addition, we involved internal actuarial specialists to assist with our procedures related to the measurement of the product liability reserve. we have also assessed the adequacy of the company's disclosures included innote 8in relation to these matters.
uncertain tax positions as described innote 7to the consolidated financial statements, the company's unrecognized tax benefits related to its uncertain tax positions were approximately $456 million at june 30, 2019. the company operates in a multinational tax environment and is subject to tax treaty arrangements and transfer pricing guidelines for intercompany transactions that have pricing subjectivity.
for those tax positions that qualify for recognition, the company description of the matter                 uses significant judgment to measure the largest amount of benefit that is more likely than not to be realized upon ultimate settlement.
for tax benefits that do not qualify for recognition, the company recognizes a liability for unrecognized tax benefits.  auditing the measurement of tax positions related to transfer pricing used in intercompany transactions was challenging because the pricing of the intercompany transactions is based on pricing analyses that may produce a number of different outcomes or ranges of outcomes (e.g., the price that would be charged in an arm's-length transaction).
43  cardinal health|fiscal 2019 form 10-k reports we obtained an understanding, evaluated the design, and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the company's process to measure tax positions related to transfer pricing from intercompany transactions. for example, we tested management's review of inputs and calculations of these tax positions, which included evaluation of the ranges of outcomes and pricing conclusions reached within management's transfer pricing studies.
to test the company's measurement of tax positions related to transfer pricing used in intercompany transactions, we involved our tax professionals to assess the appropriateness of the ranges of how we addressed the matter in our audit  outcomes utilized and the pricing conclusions reached within the transfer pricing studies conducted by the company. for example, we compared the transfer pricing methodology utilized by management to alternative methodologies and industry benchmarks. we also verified our understanding of the relevant facts by reading the company's correspondence with the relevant tax authorities and any third-party advice obtained by the company. in addition, we used our knowledge of international and local income tax laws, as well as historical settlement activity from income tax authorities, to evaluate the appropriateness of the company's measurement of uncertain tax positions related to transfer pricing used in these intercompany transactions.

notes to financial statements notes to consolidated financial statements
1. basis of presentation and summary of significant accounting policies cardinal health, inc. is a globally integrated healthcare services and products company providing customized solutions for hospitals, healthcare systems, pharmacies, ambulatory surgery centers, clinical laboratories and physician offices. the company provides medical products and pharmaceuticals and cost-
effective solutions that enhance supply chain efficiency. references to "we", "our" and similar pronouns in these consolidated financial statements are to cardinal health, inc. and its majority-owned or controlled subsidiaries unless the context otherwise requires. our fiscal year ends on june 30. references to fiscal 2019 , 2018 and 2017 in these consolidated financial statements are to the fiscal years ended june
30, 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , respectively. basis of presentation our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of all majority-owned or controlled subsidiaries, and all significant intercompany transactions and amounts have been eliminated. to conform to the current year presentation, certain prior year amounts have been reclassified. the results of businesses acquired or disposed of are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date of the acquisition or up to the date of disposal, respectively.
use of estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states ("gaap"). the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires us to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. estimates, judgments and assumptions are used in the accounting and disclosure related to, among other items, allowance for doubtful accounts, inventory valuation and reserves, business combinations, goodwill and other intangible asset impairment, vendor reserves, loss contingencies, self-insurance accruals, income taxes and share-based compensation. actual amounts could ultimately differ from these estimated amounts. cash equivalents we consider liquid investments purchased with an initial maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. the carrying value of cash equivalents approximates fair value. receivables and allowance for doubtful accounts trade receivables are presented net of an allowance for doubtful accounts of $193 million and
an account is considered past due on the first day after its due date. in accordance with contract terms, we generally have the ability to charge customers service fees or higher prices if an account is considered past due. we regularly monitor past due accounts and establish appropriate reserves to cover potential losses, which are based primarily on historical collection rates and the credit worthiness of the customer. we write off any amounts deemed uncollectible against the established allowance for doubtful accounts.
we provide financing to various customers. such financing arrangements range from 1 year to 5 years at interest rates that are generally subject to fluctuation. interest income on these arrangements is recognized as it is earned. the financings may be collateralized, guaranteed by third parties or unsecured. finance notes, net and related accrued interest were $103 million (current portion $12 million
) and $136 million (current portion $26 million ) at june 30, 2019 and 2018 , respectively, and are included in other assets (current portion is included in prepaid expenses and other) in the consolidated balance sheets.
finance notes receivable allowance for doubtful accounts were $14 million and $7 million at june 30, 2019 and
2018 , respectively. we estimate an allowance for these financing receivables based on historical collection rates and the credit worthiness of the customer. we write off any amounts deemed uncollectible against the established allowance for doubtful accounts.
concentrations of credit risk we maintain cash depository accounts with major banks, and we invest in high quality, short-term liquid instruments, and in marketable securities. our short-
term liquid instruments mature within three months and we have not historically incurred any related losses.
our trade receivables and finance notes and related accrued interest are exposed to a concentration of credit risk with certain large customers and with customers in the retail and healthcare sectors. credit risk can be affected by changes in reimbursement and other economic pressures impacting the healthcare industry. with respect to customers in the retail and healthcare sectors, such credit risk is limited due to supporting collateral and the diversity of the customer base, including its wide geographic dispersion. we perform regular credit evaluations of our customers'
financial conditions and maintain reserves for losses through the established allowance for doubtful accounts.
historically, such losses have been within our expectations. refer to the "receivables and allowance for doubtful accounts" section within this note for additional information on the accounting treatment of reserves for allowance for doubtful accounts.
major customers cvs health corporation ("cvs") and optumrx, are our only customers that individually account for at least 10
percent of revenue and gross trade receivables. these customers are primarily serviced through our pharmaceutical segment.
51  cardinal health|fiscal 2019 form 10-k notes to financial statements the following table summarizes historical percent of revenue and gross trade receivables from cvs and optumrx:
we have entered into agreements with group purchasing organizations ("gpos") which act as purchasing agents that negotiate vendor contracts on behalf of their members. vizient, inc. and premier, inc. are our two largest gpo member relationships in terms of revenue.
sales to members of these two gpos collectively accounted for 22 percent , 22 percent and 21 percent of revenue for fiscal 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , respectively.
our trade receivable balances are with individual members of the gpo, and therefore no significant concentration of credit risk exists with these types of arrangements. inventories a substantial portion of our inventories ( 56 percent at both june 30, 2019 and 2018
) are valued at the lower of cost, using the last-in, first-out ("lifo") method, or market. these inventories are included within the core pharmaceutical distribution facilities of our pharmaceutical segment ("distribution facilities") and are primarily merchandise inventories.
the lifo method presumes that the most recent inventory purchases are the first items sold, so lifo helps us better match current costs and revenue. we believe that the average cost method of inventory valuation provides a reasonable approximation of the current cost of replacing inventory within the distribution facilities.
inventory at the lower of lifo cost or market and (b)
inventory at replacement cost determined using the average cost method of inventory valuation. if we had used the average cost method of inventory valuation for all inventory within the distribution facilities, the value of our inventories would not have changed in fiscal 2019 or 2018 because inventories valued at lifo were $230 million and $92 million higher than the average cost value at june 30, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. we do not record inventories in excess of replacement cost. as such, we did not record a lifo reserve in fiscal 2019 or 2018 . our remaining inventory that is not valued at the lower of lifo or market is stated at the lower of cost, using the first-in, first-
out method, or net realizable value. net realizable value is defined as the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation.
inventories presented in the consolidated balance sheets are net of reserves for excess and obsolete inventory which were $171 million and $147 million at june 30,
2019 and 2018 , respectively. we reserve for inventory obsolescence using estimates based on historical experience, historical and projected sales trends, specific categories of inventory, age and expiration dates of on-hand inventory and manufacturer return policies.
property and equipment property and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation. property and equipment held for sale are recorded at the lower of cost or fair value less cost to sell. when certain events or changes in operating conditions occur, an impairment assessment may be performed on the recoverability of the carrying amounts. depreciation expense is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, including capital lease assets which are depreciated over the terms of their respective leases. we generally use the following range of useful lives for our property and equipment categories: buildings and improvements- 3 to
39 years ; machinery and equipment- 3 to 20 years ; and furniture and fixtures- 3 to 7 years . we recorded depreciation and amortization expense of $455 million ,
$446 million and $314 million for fiscal 2019 , 2018 and
land, building and improvements        $   1,992       $   2,115
furniture and fixtures                       138             139
repairs and maintenance expenditures are expensed as incurred. interest on long-term projects is capitalized using a rate that approximates the weighted-average interest rate on long-term obligations, which was 5
percent at june 30, 2019 . the amount of capitalized interest was immaterial for all periods presented.
business combinations the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination, including identifiable intangible assets, are recorded at their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date. the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. we base the fair values of identifiable intangible assets on detailed valuations that require management to make significant judgments, estimates and assumptions. critical estimates and assumptions include: expected future cash flows for customer relationships, trade names and other identifiable intangible assets; discount rates that reflect the risk factors associated with future cash flows; and estimates of useful lives. when an acquisition involves contingent consideration, we recognize a liability equal to the fair value of the contingent consideration obligation at the acquisition date. the estimate of fair value of a contingent consideration obligation requires subjective assumptions to be made regarding future business results, discount rates, discount periods and probabilities assigned to various potential business result scenarios. see note 2
for additional information regarding our acquisitions.
notes to financial statements goodwill and other intangible assets purchased goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized, but instead are tested for impairment annually or when indicators of impairment exist.
purchased goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually. qualitative factors are first assessed to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. there is an option to bypass the qualitative assessment for any reporting unit in any period and proceed directly to performing the quantitative goodwill impairment test. we have elected to bypass the qualitative assessment for our annual goodwill impairment test in the current year. the quantitative goodwill impairment test involves a comparison of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to the respective carrying amount. goodwill impairment testing involves judgment, including the identification of reporting units, qualitative evaluation of events and circumstances to determine if it is more likely than not that an impairment exists, and, if necessary, the estimation of the fair value of the applicable reporting unit. our qualitative evaluation considers the weight of evidence and significance of all identified events and circumstances and most relevant drivers of fair value, both positive and negative, in determining whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. we have two operating segments, which are the same as our reportable segments: pharmaceutical and medical. these operating segments are comprised of divisions (components), for which discrete financial information is available.
components are aggregated into reporting units for purposes of goodwill impairment testing to the extent that they share similar economic characteristics. our reporting units are: pharmaceutical operating segment
(excluding our nuclear and precision health solutions division); nuclear and precision health solutions division; medical operating segment (excluding our cardinal health at-home solutions division) ("medical unit"); and cardinal health at-home solutions division.
our nuclear and precision health solutions division was formerly referred to as our nuclear pharmacy services division and our cardinal health at-home solutions division was formerly referred to as our cardinal health at home division. fair value can be determined using market, income or cost-based approaches. our determination of estimated fair value of the reporting units is based on a combination of the income-based and market-based approaches. under the income-based approach, we use a discounted cash flow model in which cash flows anticipated over several future periods, plus a terminal value at the end of that time horizon, are discounted to their present value using an appropriate risk-adjusted rate of return. we use our internal forecasts to estimate future cash flows, which we believe are consistent with those of a market participant, and include an estimate of long-term growth rates based on our most recent views of the long-term outlook for each reporting unit. actual results may differ materially from those used in our forecasts. we use discount rates that are commensurate with the risks and uncertainty inherent in the respective reporting units and in our internally-developed forecasts.
discount rates used in our reporting unit valuations ranged from 8.5 percent to 11.5 percent .
under the market-based approach, we determine fair value by comparing our reporting units to similar businesses or guideline companies whose securities are actively traded in public markets. we also use the guideline transaction method to determine fair value based on pricing multiples derived from the sale of companies that are similar to our reporting units. to further confirm fair value, we compare the aggregate fair value of our reporting units to our total market capitalization. estimating the fair value of reporting units requires the use of estimates and significant judgments that are based on a number of factors including forecasted operating results. the use of alternate estimates and assumptions or changes in the industry or peer groups could materially affect the determination of fair value for each reporting unit and potentially result in goodwill impairment.
we performed annual impairment testing in fiscal 2019 ,
2018 and 2017 and with the exception of our medical unit in fiscal 2018, concluded that there were no impairments of goodwill as the estimated fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value. as discussed further in note 4 of the "notes to consolidated financial statements," during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 we recognized a $1.4 billion goodwill impairment charge related to our medical unit, which is included in impairments and loss on disposal of assets in our consolidated statements of earnings. there was no tax benefit related to this goodwill impairment charge.
the impairment test for indefinite-lived intangibles other than goodwill (primarily ipr&d) involves first assessing qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of the indefinite-
lived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount.
if so, then a quantitative test is performed to compare the estimated fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset to the respective asset's carrying amount. our qualitative evaluation requires the use of estimates and significant judgments and considers the weight of evidence and significance of all identified events and circumstances and most relevant drivers of fair value, both positive and negative, in determining whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount.
intangible assets with finite lives, primarily customer relationships; trademarks, trade names and patents; and developed technology, are amortized using a combination of straight-line and accelerated methods based on the expected cash flows from the asset over their estimated useful lives. we review intangible assets with finite lives for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable. determining whether an impairment loss occurred requires a comparison of the carrying amount to the sum of the future forecasted undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset group. actual results may differ materially from those used in our forecasts.
assets held for sale we classify assets and liabilities (the "disposal group") as held for sale when management commits to a plan to sell the disposal group in its present condition and at a price that is reasonable in relation to its current fair value. we also consider whether an active program to locate a buyer has been initiated and if it is probable that the sale will
53  cardinal health|fiscal 2019 form 10-k notes to financial statements occur within one year without significant changes to the plan to sell. upon classification of the disposal group as held for sale, we test the assets for impairment and cease related depreciation and amortization. investments investments in non-marketable equity securities are accounted for under the fair value, equity or net asset value method of accounting and are included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets. for equity securities without a readily determinable fair value, we use the fair value measurement alternative and measure the securities at cost less impairment, if any, including adjustments for observable price changes in orderly transactions for an identical or similar investment of the same issuer. for investments in which we can exercise significant influence but do not control, we use the equity method of accounting. our share of the earnings and losses are recorded in other income, net in the consolidated statements of earnings.
we monitor our investments for impairment by considering factors such as the operating performance of the investment and current economic and market conditions.
vendor reserves in the ordinary course of business, our vendors may dispute deductions taken against payments otherwise due to them or assert other disputes. these disputes are researched and resolved based upon the findings of the research performed. at any given time, there are outstanding items in various stages of research and resolution. in determining appropriate reserves for areas of exposure with our vendors, we assess historical experience and current outstanding claims. we have established various levels of reserves based on the type of claim and status of review. though the claim types are relatively consistent, we periodically refine our methodology by updating the reserve estimate percentages to reflect actual historical experience. the ultimate outcome of certain claims may be different than our original estimate and may require an adjustment. adjustments to vendor reserves are included in cost of products sold. in addition, the reserve balance will fluctuate due to variations of outstanding claims from period-to-period, timing of settlements and specific vendor issues, such as bankruptcies. vendor reserves were $53 million and
$45 million at june 30, 2019 and 2018 , respectively, excluding third-party returns. see third-party returns section within this note for a description of third-
party returns. distribution services agreement and other vendor fees our pharmaceutical segment recognizes fees received from distribution services agreements and other fees received from vendors related to the purchase or distribution of the vendors' inventory when those fees have been earned and we are entitled to payment. since the benefit provided to a vendor is related to the purchase and distribution of the vendor's inventory, we recognize the fees as a reduction in the carrying value of the inventory that generated the fees, and as such, a reduction of cost of products sold in our consolidated statements of earnings when the inventory is sold.
loss contingencies and self-insurance we accrue for contingencies related to disputes, litigation and regulatory matters if it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.
we develop and periodically update reserve estimates for cordis ivc claims, including those received to date and expected to be received in the future and related costs.
to project future cordis ivc claim costs, we use a methodology based largely on recent experience, including claim filing rates, estimated indemnity severity by claim type, sales data and estimated defense costs.
we also self-insure for employee healthcare, general liability, certain product liability matters, auto liability, property and workers' compensation. self-
insurance accruals include an estimate for expected settlements or pending claims, defense costs, administrative fees, claim adjustment costs and an estimate for claims incurred but not reported.
because these matters are inherently unpredictable and unfavorable developments or resolutions can occur, assessing contingencies and other liabilities is highly subjective and requires judgments about future events.
we regularly review contingencies and our self-insurance accruals to determine whether our accruals and related disclosures are adequate. any adjustments for changes in reserves are recorded in the period in which the change in estimate occurs.
the amount of ultimate loss may differ from these estimates. we recognize these estimated loss contingencies, income from favorable resolution of litigation and certain defense costs in litigation
(recoveries)/charges in our consolidated statements of earnings. see note 8 for additional information regarding loss contingencies and product liability lawsuits.
income taxes we account for income taxes using the asset and liability method. deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in the respective jurisdictions in which we operate . we assess the realizability of deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis and provide a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that at least a portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
the realizability of deferred tax assets depends on our ability to generate sufficient taxable income within the carryback or carryforward periods provided for in the tax law for each applicable tax jurisdiction and also considers all available positive and negative evidence.
deferred taxes for non-u.s. liabilities are not provided on the unremitted earnings of subsidiaries outside of the united states when it is expected that these earnings are indefinitely reinvested.
we operate in a complex multinational tax environment and are subject to tax treaty arrangements and transfer pricing guidelines for intercompany transactions that are subject to interpretation. uncertainty in a tax position may arise as tax laws are subject to interpretation.
notes to financial statements recognized is measured as the largest amoun t of tax benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon settlement. for tax benefits that do not qualify for recognition, we recognize a liability for unrecognized tax benefits. see note 7 for additional information regarding income taxes. other accrued liabilities other accrued liabilities represent various current obligations, including certain accrued operating expenses and taxes payable. noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests noncontrolling interests represent the portion of net earnings, comprehensive income and net assets that is not attributable to cardinal health, inc. the redeemable noncontrolling interests relate to our prior ownership interest in navihealth holdings, llc ("navihealth"), which we acquired during fiscal 2016. the redeemable noncontrolling interests were redeemable at the option of the third-party noncontrolling interest holders at any time after the two-year anniversary of the closing, or earlier if a trigger event occurred. as such, the noncontrolling interests were presented as redeemable noncontrolling interests in our june 30, 2018
consolidated balance sheets. the noncontrolling interests were adjusted each period for net earnings and dividends attributable to the noncontrolling interests and changes in the noncontrolling ownership interests, if any. changes in the carrying value of the noncontrolling interests related to a change in the redemption value were recorded through retained earnings and did not affect net earnings attributable to cardinal health, inc. see note 12 for additional information regarding redeemable noncontrolling interests. in august
2018, we sold our 98 percent ownership interest in navihealth. for more information on this divestiture see note 2 . share-based compensation share-based compensation provided to employees is recognized in the consolidated statements of earnings based on the grant date fair value of the awards. the fair value of stock options is determined on the grant date using a lattice valuation model. the fair value of restricted share units and performance share units is determined by the grant date market price of our common shares. the compensation expense associated with nonvested performance share units is dependent on our periodic assessment of the probability of the targets being achieved and our estimate, which may vary over time, of the number of shares that ultimately will be issued. the compensation expense recognized for share-based awards is net of estimated forfeitures and is recognized ratably over the service period of the awards. all income tax effects of share-based awards are recognized in the statement of earnings as awards vest or are settled. we classify share-based compensation expense in distribution, selling, general and administrative
("sg&a") expenses to correspond with the same line item as the majority of the cash compensation paid to employees. if awards are modified in connection with a restructuring activity, the incremental share-based compensation expense is classified in restructuring and employee severance. see note 16 for additional information regarding share-based compensation.
revenue recognition we recognize revenue in an amount that reflects the consideration to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for the transfer of goods or services to customers.
revenue in both segments is primarily related to the distribution of pharmaceutical and medical products, which we recognize at a point in time when title transfers to customers and we have no further obligation to provide services related to such merchandise. service revenues are recognized over the period that services are provided to the customer. revenues derived from services are not material for either segment for all periods presented.
we are generally the principal in a transaction, therefore our revenue is primarily recorded on a gross basis. when we are a principal in a transaction, we have determined that we control the ability to direct the use of the product or service prior to transfer to a customer, are primarily responsible for fulfilling the promise to provide the product or service to our customer, have discretion in establishing prices, and ultimately control the transfer of the product or services provided to the customer.
revenues are measured based on the amount of consideration that we expect to receive, reduced by estimates for return allowances, discounts, rebates and other variable consideration. sales returns are recorded based on estimates using historical data. our customer return policies generally require that the product be physically returned, subject to restocking fees. we only allow customers to return products for credit in a condition suitable to be added back to inventory and resold at full value, or returned to vendors for credit
("merchantable product"). product returns are generally consistent throughout the year and typically are not specific to any particular product or customer.
we accrue for estimated sales returns and allowances at the time of sale based upon historical customer return trends, margin rates and processing costs. our accrual for sales returns is reflected as a reduction of revenue and cost of products sold for the sales price and cost, respectively. at both june 30, 2019 and 2018 , the accrual for estimated sales returns and allowances was
billion , for fiscal 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , respectively.
third-party returns we generally do not accept non-merchantable pharmaceutical product returns from our customers, so many of our customers return non-merchantable pharmaceutical products to the manufacturer through third parties. since our customers generally do not have a direct relationship with manufacturers, our vendors pass the value of such returns to us (usually in the form of an accounts payable deduction). we, in turn, pass the value received, less an
55  cardinal health|fiscal 2019 form 10-k notes to financial statements administrative fee, to our customer. in certain instances, we pass the estimated value of the return to our customer prior to our receipt of the value from the vendor. although we believe we have satisfactory protections, we could be subject to claims from customers or vendors if our administration of this overall process was deficient in some respect or our contractual terms with vendors are in conflict with our contractual terms with our customers. we have maintained reserves for some of these situations based on their nature and our historical experience with their resolution. shipping and handling shipping and handling costs are primarily included in sg&a expenses in our consolidated statements of earnings and include all delivery expenses as well as all costs to prepare the product for shipment to the end customer. shipping and handling costs were $622 million , $543 million and $496
million , for fiscal 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , respectively. restructuring and employee severance restructuring activities are programs that are not part of the ongoing operations of our underlying business, such as closing and consolidating facilities, changing the way we manufacture or distribute our products, moving manufacturing of a product to another location, changes in production or business process outsourcing or insourcing, employee severance (including rationalizing headcount or other significant changes in personnel) and realigning operations (including realignment of the management structure in response to changing market conditions). also included within restructuring and employee severance are employee severance costs that are not incurred in connection with a restructuring activity. see note 3 for additional information regarding our restructuring activities. amortization and other acquisition-related costs we classify certain costs incurred in connection with acquisitions as amortization and other acquisition-related costs in our consolidated statements of earnings. these costs consist of amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, transaction costs, integration costs and changes in the fair value of contingent consideration obligations. transaction costs are incurred during the initial evaluation of a potential acquisition and primarily relate to costs to analyze, negotiate and consummate the transaction as well as due diligence activities. integration costs relate to activities required to combine the operations of an acquired enterprise into our operations and, in the case of the cordis and patient recovery businesses, to stand-up the systems and processes needed to support an expanded geographic footprint. we record changes in the fair value of contingent consideration obligations relating to acquisitions as income or expense in amortization and other acquisition-related costs. see note 4 for additional information regarding amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets. translation of foreign currencies financial statements of our subsidiaries outside the united states are generally measured using the local currency as the functional currency. adjustments to translate the assets and liabilities of these foreign subsidiaries into u.s.
dollars are accumulated in shareholders' equity through aoci utilizing period-end exchange rates. revenues and expenses of these foreign subsidiaries are translated using average exchange rates during the year. the foreign currency translation gains/(losses) included in aoci at june 30, 2019 and
2018 are presented in note 13 . foreign currency transaction gains and losses for the period are included in the consolidated statements of earnings in the respective financial statement line item. interest rate, currency and commodity risk all derivative instruments are recognized at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets and all changes in fair value are recognized in net earnings or shareholders' equity through aoci, net of tax. for contracts that qualify for hedge accounting treatment, the hedge contracts must be effective at reducing the risk associated with the exposure being hedged and must be designated as a hedge at the inception of the contract. hedge effectiveness is assessed periodically. any contract not designated as a hedge, or so designated but ineffective, is adjusted to fair value and recognized immediately in net earnings.
if a fair value or cash flow hedge ceases to qualify for hedge accounting treatment, the contract continues to be carried on the balance sheet at fair value until settled and future adjustments to the contract's fair value are recognized immediately in net earnings. if a forecasted transaction is probable not to occur, amounts previously deferred in aoci are recognized immediately in net earnings. see note 11 for additional information regarding our derivative instruments, including the accounting treatment for instruments designated as fair value, cash flow and economic hedges. fair value measurements fair value is defined as the price that would be received upon selling an asset or the price paid to transfer a liability on the measurement date. it focuses on the exit price in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between willing market participants.
a three-tier fair value hierarchy is established as a basis for considering such assumptions and for inputs used in the valuation methodologies in measuring fair value. this hierarchy requires entities to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. the three levels of inputs used to measure fair values are:
level 1 -  observable prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities.
level 2 -  observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities.
level 3 -  unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets and liabilities.

this guidance will be effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 and must be applied on a prospective basis. the impact of adoption on our consolidated financial statements is contingent upon future events. we do not expect the adoption to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. in march 2018, the fasb issued amended accounting guidance to codify sec staff accounting bulletin 118 ("sab 118"), which was issued in connection with the tax cuts and jobs act (the "tax act") of december 2017. the guidance allows companies to use provisional estimates to record the effects of the tax act and also provides a measurement period (not to exceed one year from the date of enactment) to complete the accounting for the impacts of the tax act. we adopted this guidance in the second quarter of fiscal
2018 when it was initially issued as sab 118. we completed our accounting for the impacts from enactment of the tax act during the second quarter of fiscal 2019.
future adjustments to the financial statements may be necessary as final tax regulations, including issued and pending regulatory changes, are issued. we will assess any impact as additional guidance is issued. see note 7
for additional information regarding income taxes. in june 2016, the fasb issued amended accounting guidance that will require entities to measure credit losses on trade and other receivables, held-to-maturity debt securities, loans and other instruments using an
"expected credit loss" model that considers historical experience, current conditions and reasonable supportable forecasts. this guidance also requires that credit losses on available-for-sale debt securities with unrealized losses be recognized as allowances rather than as deductions in the amortized cost of the securities. this guidance will be effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal 2021. we are currently evaluating the impact of adoption on our consolidated financial statements. leases in february 2016, the fasb issued amended accounting guidance that requires lessees to recognize most leases on the balance sheet as a lease liability and corresponding right-of-use asset. the guidance also requires disclosures that meet the objective of enabling financial statement users to assess the amount, timing and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. we will adopt this guidance when it is effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal 2020
and we will elect the transition option which will allow us to apply the guidance prospectively. while we are finalizing the evaluation of the impact of this standard on our consolidated financial statements, we expect the adoption of this guidance will result in recognition of operating lease liabilities in excess of $400 million based on the present value of the remaining minimum lease commitments. we anticipate recognizing a corresponding right-of-use asset based on the operating lease liabilities adjusted for prepaid and deferred rent and unamortized initial direct costs. we do not currently believe that the guidance will have a material impact on our results of operations, liquidity or debt covenant compliance under our current debt agreements.
the majority of our lease spend relates to certain real estate with the remaining lease spend primarily related to equipment. we generally anticipate that the adoption of the amended lease guidance will require certain changes to our systems and processes.
revenue recognition in may 2014, the fasb issued amended accounting guidance related to revenue recognition which we adopted in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 using the modified retrospective method and that we applied to customer contracts that were not completed as of june 30, 2018.
the adoption of the amended accounting guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. we did not record any material contract assets, contract liabilities, or deferred contract costs in our consolidated balance sheets upon adopting the amended accounting guidance. as a result of adoption, assets recorded for the right to recover products from customers and the associated refund liabilities for return allowances were not material.
we elected the practical expedient to expense costs to obtain a contract when incurred when the amortization period would have been one year or less. additionally, we elected the practical expedients to not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for contracts with an original expected length of one year or less, contracts for which we recognize revenue at the amount to which we have the right to invoice for services performed and for contracts for which the variable consideration is allocated entirely to a wholly unsatisfied performance obligation or to a wholly unsatisfied promise to transfer a distinct good or service that forms part of a single performance obligation. see note 15 for additional information regarding our disaggregation of revenue.
other recently adopted financial accounting standards in the first quarter of fiscal 2019, we adopted the following accounting standards updates ("asu"). asu
2016-01 financial instruments: recognition and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities; asu 2018-03 technical corrections and improvements to financial instruments; asu 2016-15
intra-entity transfers of assets other than inventory;
and asu 2017-12 derivatives and hedging: targeted improvements to accounting for hedging activities. the adoption of these asu's did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
2. acquisitions and divestitures acquisitions while we have completed several acquisitions d uring fiscal 2019 , the pro forma results of operations and the results of operations for acquired businesses since the acquisition dates have not been separately disclosed because the effects were not significant compared to the consolidated financial statements, individually or in the aggregate. the cash paid for these acquisitions, net of cash acquired was $ 82 million .
patient recovery business on july 29, 2017, we acquired the patient care, deep vein thrombosis, and nutritional insufficiency businesses (the "patient recovery business") from medtronic plc for $6.1 billion in cash. the
57  cardinal health|fiscal 2019 form 10-k notes to financial statements acquisition further expanded the medical segment's portfolio of self-manufactured products. transaction and integration costs associated with the acquisition of the patient recovery business were $75 million and $109
million for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2019 and
2018, respectively. these costs are included in amortization and other acquisition-related costs in the consolidated statement of earnings. fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed the allocation of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed for the acquisition of the patient recovery business was finalized during the three months ended september 30,
2018, resulting in goodwill of $3.3 billion . there were no significant adjustments to the allocation of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed for the patient recovery business acquisition from those disclosed in our fiscal 2018 form 10-k. the valuation of identifiable intangible assets utilizes significant unobservable inputs and thus represents a level 3
nonrecurring fair value measurement. the estimated fair value of the identifiable intangible assets was determined using income-based approaches, which includes market participant expectations of the cash flows that an asset could generate over its economic life, discounted back to present value using an appropriate rate of return. the weighted- average discount rate used to arrive at the present value of the identifiable intangible assets was 8.0 percent, and considers the inherent risk of each intangible asset relative to the internal rate of return and weighted-average cost of capital. the following table summarizes the estimated fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date for the patient recovery business:
identifiable intangible assets:                   patient recovery business

(3)  the useful life of developed technology is15years.
divestitures china divestiture in february 2018, we sold our pharmaceutical and medical products distribution business in china ("china distribution business") for proceeds of $861 million (after adjusting for third party indebtedness and preliminary transaction adjustments) to shanghai pharmaceuticals holding co., ltd. the proceeds are not reflective of tax obligations due in connection with the sale, for which we have recorded a liability of $59 million . the purchase price was subject to adjustment based on working capital requirements as set forth in the definitive agreement, for which there were no significant changes in fiscal
2019. we determined that the sale of the china distribution business did not meet the criteria to be classified as discontinued operations. the china distribution business primarily operated within our pharmaceutical segment, and a smaller portion operated within our medical segment. during the fiscal year ended
2018, we recognized a pre-tax loss of $41 million related to this divestiture. navihealth in august 2018, we sold our 98 percent ownership interest in navihealth to investor entities controlled by clayton, dubilier &
rice in exchange for cash proceeds of $737 million
(after adjusting for certain fees and expenses) and a 44
percent equity interest in a partnership that owns 100
percent of the equity interest of navihealth. we also have certain call rights to reacquire navihealth. refer to note 5 for further discussion regarding this investment. for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2019 , we recognized a pre-tax gain of $508 million related to this divestiture in impairments and (gain)/loss on disposal of assets in our consolidated statement of earnings. this gain includes our initial recognition of an equity method investment for $358 million and the derecognition of redeemable noncontrolling interests of
$12 million . the fiscal 2019 tax expense as a result of this transaction was $130 million . we determined that the sale of the navihealth business did not meet the criteria to be classified as discontinued operations.
the navihealth business operated within our medical segment. 3. restructuring and employee severance the following tables summarize restructuring and employee severance costs:
employee-related costs (1)         $    95    $    34    $    51

total restructuring and employee   $   125    $   176    $    56
severance employee-related costs primarily consist of termination benefits provided to employees who have been
(1)  involuntarily terminated, duplicate payroll costs and retention bonuses incurred during transition periods.
facility exit and other costs primarily consist of product distribution and lease contract termination
(2)  costs, lease costs associated with vacant facilities, accelerated depreciation, equipment relocation costs, project consulting fees, costs associated with restructuring our delivery of information technology infrastructure services and certain other divestiture-related costs.
notes to financial statements in early fiscal 2019, we began implementing certain enterprise-wide cost-savings measures, which we expect will reduce our future operating expenses. as a result of these measures, we incurred pre-tax restructuring related costs of $92 million during the fiscal year ended june 30, 2019, which are reflected in restructuring and employee severance in the consolidated statements of earnings. in fiscal 2018, we entered into an agreement to transition the distribution of our medical segment's surgeon gloves in certain international markets from a third-party distribution arrangement to a direct distribution model. the costs associated with this restructuring included $125 million , on a pre-tax basis, in contract termination costs that were paid during fiscal 2018. these costs are reflected in restructuring and employee severance in the consolidated statements of earnings during the fiscal year ended 2018. the following table summarizes activity related to liabilities associated with restructuring and employee severance:

fiscal 2018 the increase in the medical segment goodwill during fiscal 2018 is primarily due to the patient recovery business acquisition. goodwill recognized in connection with the patient recovery business acquisition primarily represents the expected benefits from certain synergies of integrating the business, the existing workforce of the acquired entity, and the expected growth from new customers. see note 2 for further discussion of this acquisition. in conjunction with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements for fiscal 2018, we completed our annual quantitative goodwill impairment test, which we perform annually in the fourth quarter. using a combination of income and market-based approaches (using a discount rate of 8.5 percent ), the carrying value exceeded the fair value and resulted in an impairment charge of $1.4 billion related to our medical unit, which is included in impairments and loss on disposal of assets in our consolidated statements of earnings. our fair value estimates utilize significant unobservable inputs and thus represent level 3 fair value measurements. the impairment was primarily driven by inventory and cost challenges within our cordis business which furthered in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018. this impairment charge did not impact our liquidity, cash flows from operations, or compliance with debt covenants. there was no tax benefit related to the goodwill impairment charge. the goodwill balance for our medical unit, after recognizing the impairment, was $4.3 billion at june 30, 2018. during fiscal
2018, goodwill was also reduced by $401 million and $509 million in connection with the sale of our china distribution business and reclassification of navihealth's assets and liabilities to held for sale, respectively.
see note 2 for further discussion of this divestiture and assets held for sale.

million and $133 million in connection with the sale of our china distribution business and reclassification of navihealth's assets and liabilities to held for sale, respectively.
5. investments in connection with the navihealth divestiture discussed in note 2 , we obtained a 44
percent equity interest in a partnership that owns 100
percent of the equity interest of navihealth. we accounted for this investment initially at its fair value using level 3 unobservable inputs based on expected sales proceeds following a competitive bidding process. we initially recognized a $358 million equity method investment. we are accounting for our equity interest in navihealth using the equity method of accounting on a one-month reporting lag. the impact of our proportionate share of navihealth's results was a loss of $9 million for fiscal 2019. upon the divestiture closing, we received a non-cash distribution of $14
million in the form of the partnership's payment for certain of our divestiture transaction costs directly to the applicable third-party. at june 30, 2019 the carrying value of this investment was $334 million . 6.
(1) maturities are presented on a calendar year basis.
maturities of existing long-term obligations and other short-term borrowings for fiscal 2020 through 2024 and thereafter are as follows: $452 million , $512 million ,
notes to financial statements long-term debt all the notes represent unsecured obligations of cardinal health, inc. and rank equally in right of payment with all of our existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. the 7.0%
debentures represent unsecured obligations of allegiance corporation (a wholly-owned subsidiary), which cardinal health, inc. has guaranteed. none of these obligations are subject to a sinking fund and the allegiance obligations are not redeemable prior to maturity.
interest is paid pursuant to the terms of the obligations. these notes are effectively subordinated to the liabilities of our subsidiaries, including trade payables of $21.5 billion . in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, we repurchased $67 million of the 2.616%
million of the 3.41% notes due 2027 for a total of $100
million . the repurchases were paid for with available cash. we also paid off the 1.948% notes due 2019 as they became due with available cash. in june 2018, we repaid the full principal of the 1.95% notes due 2018 at maturity for $550 million . in july 2017, we redeemed the 1.7% notes due 2018 early in full with a portion of the proceeds from the june 2017 issuance for $400
million . if we undergo a change of control, as defined in the notes, and if the notes receive specified ratings below investment grade by each of standard & poors ratings services, moody's investors services and fitch ratings, any holder of the notes, excluding the debentures, can require with respect to the notes owned by such holder, or we can offer, to repurchase the notes at 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. other financing arrangements in addition to cash and equivalents and operating cash flow, other sources of liquidity include a $2.0 billion commercial paper program backed by a $2.0 billion revolving credit facility. we also have a $1.0 billion committed receivables sales facility. in june 2019, we renewed our
$2.0 billion revolving credit facility. as part of the renewal of our revolving credit facility, as of the end of any calendar quarter, our maximum consolidated net leverage ratio may be no more than 4.25-to-1. the maximum permitted ratio will reduce to 4.00-to-1 in september 2019, and to 3.75-to-1 in march 2021 and thereafter. as of june 30, 2019 , we were in compliance with this financial covenant. in november 2018, we increased the maximum consolidated leverage ratio permitted under our committed receivables facilities to provide that, as of the end of any calendar quarter, our maximum consolidated leverage ratio may be no more than
4.25-to-1. the maximum permitted ratio will reduce to
, we were in compliance with this financial covenant.
in november 2016, we renewed our committed receivables sales facility program through cardinal health funding, llc ("chf") through november 1, 2019. chf was organized for the sole purpose of buying receivables and selling undivided interests in those receivables to third-party purchasers. although consolidated with cardinal health, inc. in accordance with gaap, chf is a separate legal entity from cardinal health, inc. and from our subsidiary that sells receivables to chf. chf is designed to be a special purpose, bankruptcy-remote entity whose assets are available solely to satisfy the claims of its creditors. we intend to renew our committed receivables sales facility program in the first quarter of fiscal 2020. at june 30, 2019 , we had no amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility; however, availability was reduced by outstanding letters of credit of $24 million at both june 30, 2019 and 2018 . we also had no amounts outstanding under the committed receivables sales facility program; however, availability was reduced by outstanding standby letters of credit of $30 million and
we had no amounts outstanding under the commercial paper program as of june 30, 2019 . we also maintain other short-term credit facilities and an unsecured line of credit that allowed for borrowings up to $9 million and
$10 million and $11 million balance of other obligations at june 30, 2019 and 2018 , respectively, consisted of short-term borrowings and capital leases. in fiscal 2018
we sold our china distribution business, including its debt which was $378 million as of june 30, 2017. see note 2 for further discussion of this divestiture. 7.

(1)  the effective income tax rate for fiscal 2019 and 2017 represents an income tax expense tax rate.
(2)  the effective income tax rate for fiscal 2018 represents an income tax benefit tax rate.
the income tax expense rate in fiscal 2019 was 22.1% compared to an income tax benefit rate of 213.8% in fiscal
2018 and an income tax expense rate of 32.7% in fiscal 2017. fluctuations in the effective tax rates are primarily due to fiscal 2018 net benefits from the enactment of the tax act, the impact of nondeductible goodwill impairment charge, and a benefit from a capital loss due to international legal entity reorganization. there were also changes in valuation allowances related to capital losses, credit carryforwards and net operating loss carryforwards in u.s. federal, u.s. state and international jurisdictions. our effective tax rate has benefits from negotiated lower than statutory tax rates in select foreign jurisdictions which individually are not material to our effective tax rate but in aggregate have a favorable tax impact of approximately $40 million .
on december 22, 2017, the united states enacted the tax act. the tax act made broad and comp lex changes to the u.s. tax code that affected fiscal 2018 and will incrementally affect our fiscal year 2019 financial results in several ways. first, the u.s. statutory tax rate in fiscal 2019 is reduced to 21.0% . second, the tax act established new tax provisions that affected us beginning july 1, 2018 including, (1) eliminating the u.s.
manufacturing deduction; (2) establishing new limitations on deductible interest expense and certain executive compensation; (3) eliminating the corporate alternative minimum tax; (4) creating the base erosion anti-abuse tax;
(5) creating a new provision designed to tax global intangible low-tax income ("gilti") and allow for a deduction related to foreign derived intangible income ("fdii"); (6) generally eliminating u.s. federal income taxes on dividends from foreign subsidiaries; and (7) changing rules related to uses and limitations of net operating loss carryforwards created in tax years beginning after december 31, 2017. regarding the new gilti tax rules, we elected to treat taxes due on future gilti inclusions in u.s. taxable income as a current period expense when incurred. in accordance with sab 118, we finalized our provisional estimates related to transitional tax benefits (i.e., remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities and the repatriation tax on undistributed foreign earnings)
which did not have a significant impact on tax expense during fiscal 2019. future adjustments to the financial statements may be necessary as final tax regulations, including issued and pending regulatory changes are issued.
we will assess any impact as additional guidance is issued. during the fiscal year ended june 30, 2019, the company completed the final calculation of the u.s. repatriation tax after the issuance of final regulations by the u.s treasury department under section 965. after completion of the calculation and an overall review of the cash positions post-tax reform and business needs globally, the company is changing its assertion on $309 million previously considered indefinitely reinvested as of june 30, 2018, which did not have a material impact on our provision for income taxes. as of june 30, 3019, foreign earnings of approximately $780 million are considered indefinitely reinvested for working capital and other offshore investment needs. the computation of tax required if those earnings are repatriated is not practicable. deferred income taxes deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between financial reporting and tax reporting bases of assets and liabilities and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards for tax purposes.
notes to financial statements the following table presents the components of the deferred income tax assets and liabilities at june 30:

at june 30, 2019 we had gross federal, state and international loss and credit carryforwards of $463
million , $2.7 billion and $1.9 billion , respectively, the tax effect of which is an aggregate deferred tax asset of $621 million . substantially all of these carryforwards are available for at least three years.
approximately $524 million of the valuation allowance at june 30, 2019 applies to certain federal, state and international loss carryforwards that, in our opinion, are more likely than not to expire unutilized. however, to the extent that tax benefits related to these carryforwards are realized in the future, the reduction in the valuation allowance would reduce income tax expense. unrecognized tax benefits we had $456 million ,
$423 million and $417 million of unrecognized tax benefits at june 30, 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , respectively. the june 30, 2019 , 2018 and 2017 balances include $303 million , $262 million and $268 million , respectively, of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would have an impact on the effective tax rate. the remaining unrecognized tax benefits relate to tax positions for which ultimate deductibility is highly certain but for which there is uncertainty as to the timing of such deductibility. recognition of these tax benefits would not affect our effective tax rate. we include the full amount of unrecognized tax benefits in deferred income taxes and other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. the following table presents a reconciliation of the beginning and ending amounts of unrecognized tax benefits:

(1)  acquired as part of the patient recovery business for which we are fully indemnified. also for fiscal 2018
are settlements of$81 millionrelated to the patient recovery business as well as$11 millionof statute expirations.
it is reasonably possible that there could be a change in the amount of unrecognized tax benefits within the next 12 months due to activities of the u.s. internal revenue service ("irs") or other taxing authorities, possible settlement of audit issues, reassessment of existing unrecognized tax benefits or the expiration of statutes of limitations. we estimate that the range of the possible change in unrecognized tax benefits within the next 12 months is a net decrease of $0 million to
$15 million , exclusive of penalties and interest. we recognize accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for income taxes. at june 30, 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , we had $122
million , $110 million and $99 million , respectively, accrued for the payment of interest and penalties. these balances are gross amounts before any tax benefits and are included in deferred income taxes and other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. during fiscal 2019 , 2018, and 2017 we recognized $8 million ,
$8 million , and $12 million of expense for interest and penalties in income tax expense, respectively. other tax matters we file income tax returns in the u.s. federal jurisdiction, various u.s. state and local jurisdictions, and various foreign jurisdictions. with few exceptions, we are subject to audit by taxing authorities for fiscal years 2008 through the current fiscal year. we are a party to a tax matters agreement with carefusion corporation ("carefusion"), which has been acquired by becton, dickinson and company. under the tax matters agreement, carefusion is obligated to indemnify us for certain tax exposures and transaction taxes prior to our fiscal 2010 spin-off of carefusion.
million at june 30, 2019 and 2018 , respectively, and is included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets. as a result of the acquisition of the patient recovery business, medtronic plc is obligated to indemnify us for certain tax exposures and transaction taxes related to periods prior to the acquisition under the purchase agreement. the indemnification receivable was $22

through 2024 and thereafter are as follows: $126 million , $100 million , $76 million , $54 million , $33 million and $94 million . rental expense relating to operating leases was $153 million , $172 million and $159 million in fiscal 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , respectively. sublease rental income was immaterial for all periods presented.
generic sourcing venture with cvs health corporation
("cvs health") red oak sourcing, llc ("red oak sourcing") is a u.s.-based generic pharmaceutical sourcing venture with cvs health for an initial term through june 2024. red oak sourcing negotiates generic pharmaceutical supply contracts on behalf of its participants. due to the achievement of predetermined milestones, we are required to make quarterly payments of $ 45.6 million to cvs health for the initial term.
2018, the state of new york passed a budget which included the opioid stewardship act (the "osa"). the osa created an aggregate $100 million annual assessment on all manufacturers and distributors licensed to sell or distribute opioids in new york. under the osa, each licensed manufacturer and distributor would be required to pay a portion of the assessment based on its ratable share, as determined by the state, of the total morphine milligram equivalents sold or distributed in new york during the applicable calendar year, beginning in 2017.
in october 2018, we received notices from the new york department of health of our estimated payment amount for calendar year 2017. in december 2018, the u.s. district court for the southern district of new york ruled that the osa is unconstitutional and enjoined its enforcement
(the "ruling"). in january 2019, the state filed notice of its intent to appeal the ruling. in april 2019, the state, among other things, amended the osa so that the assessment would only cover opioid sales in 2017 and
2018, subject to the state's pending appeal of the ruling. we accrue contingencies if it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be estimated. at june 30, 2019, we have no amounts accrued for the osa because we do not believe it is probable that a liability has been incurred. legal proceedings we become involved from time to time in disputes, litigation and regulatory matters. we may be named from time to time in qui tam actions initiated by private third parties. in such actions, the private parties purport to act on behalf of federal or state governments, allege that false claims have been submitted for payment by the government and may receive an award if their claims are successful. after a private party has filed a qui tam action, the government must investigate the private party's claim and determine whether to intervene in and take control over the litigation. these actions may remain under seal while the government makes this determination. if the government declines to intervene, the private party may nonetheless continue to pursue the litigation on his or her own purporting to act on behalf of the government .
from time to time, we become aware through employees, internal audits or other parties of possible compliance matters, such as complaints or concerns relating to accounting, internal accounting controls, financial reporting, auditing, or other ethical matters or relating to compliance with laws such as healthcare fraud and abuse, anti-corruption or anti-bribery laws.
when we become aware of such possible compliance matters, we investigate internally and take appropriate corrective action. in addition, from time to time, we receive subpoenas or requests for information from various federal or state agencies relating to our business or to the business of a customer, supplier or other industry participants. internal investigations, subpoenas or requests for information could lead to the assertion of claims or the commencement of legal proceedings against us or result in sanctions.
from time to time, we determine that products we manufacture or market do not meet our specifications, regulatory requirements, or published standards. when we or a regulatory agency identify a potential quality or regulatory issue, we investigate and take appropriate corrective action. such actions can lead to product recalls, costs to repair or replace affected products, temporary interruptions in product sales, action by regulators and product liability claims and lawsuits, including class actions. even absent an identified regulatory or quality issue or product recall, we can become subject to product liability claims and lawsuits.
we accrue for contingencies related to disputes, litigation and regulatory matters if it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. because these matters are inherently unpredictable and unfavorable developments or resolutions can occur, assessing contingencies is highly subjective and requires judgments about future events.
we regularly review contingencies to determine whether our accruals and related disclosures are adequate. the amount of ultimate loss may differ from these estimates.
we recognize income from the favorable outcome of litigation when we receive the associated cash or assets.
we recognize estimated loss contingencies for certain litigation and regulatory matters and income from favorable resolution of litigation in litigation
opioid lawsuits pharmaceutical wholesale distributors, including us, have been named as defendants in approximately 2,500
notes to financial statements of plaintiffs, primarily counties, municipalities and political subdivisions. plaintiffs also include unions and other health and welfare funds, hospital systems and other healthcare providers, as well as individuals. of these lawsuits, 95 are purported class actions. the lawsuits seek equitable relief and monetary damages based on a variety of legal theories including various common law claims, such as negligence, public nuisance and unjust enrichment as well as violations of controlled substance laws, the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act and various other statutes.
these lawsuits also name pharmaceutical manufacturers, retail pharmacy chains and other entities as defendants.
the vast majority of these lawsuits were filed in u.s.
federal court and have been transferred for consolidated pre-trial proceedings in a multi-district litigation proceeding in the u.s. district court for the northern district of ohio. the court, among other things, has ordered that a bellwether trial involving two county plaintiffs begin in october 2019. motions for summary judgment have been filed by plaintiffs and defendants.
in addition, 18 state attorneys general have filed lawsuits against distributors, including us, in various state courts. several of these lawsuits, including lawsuits filed by the new york, ohio and washington attorneys general, as well as other cases pending in state court, are currently scheduled to go to trial in the second half of fiscal year 2020 or early fiscal
2021. in addition to the 18 state attorneys general that have filed suit, 43 state attorneys general have formed a multi-state task force to investigate the manufacturing, distribution, dispensing and prescribing practices of opioid medications. we have received requests related to the multi-state investigation, as well as separate civil investigative demands, subpoenas or requests for information from these and other state attorneys general offices. we are cooperating with the offices conducting these investigations. in connection with these proceedings, distributors continue to discuss possible resolution with various parties, including state attorneys general and representatives of the mdl plaintiffs. we are vigorously defending ourselves in all of these opioid-related matters. given the uncertainty surrounding these lawsuits and investigations, we are unable to predict their outcome or estimate a range of reasonably possible losses, but the defense and resolution of these lawsuits could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and liquidity or have adverse reputational or operational effects on our business.
product liability lawsuits as of august 13, 2019, we are named as a defendant in 261 product liability lawsuits coordinated in alameda county superior court in california involving claims by approximately 3,160
plaintiffs that allege personal injuries associated with the use of cordis optease and trapease inferior vena cava (ivc) filter products. another 22 lawsuits involving similar claims by approximately 26 plaintiffs are pending in other jurisdictions. these lawsuits seek a variety of remedies, including unspecified monetary damages. we are vigorously defending ourselves in these lawsuits.
at june 30, 2019, we had a total of $368 million , net of estimated insurance recoveries, accrued for losses and legal defense costs related to the cordis ivc filter lawsuits which are presented on a gross basis in the consolidated balance sheets. we believe there is a range of estimated losses with respect to these matters.
because no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount within the range, we have accrued the minimum amount in the range. we estimate the high end of the range to be approximately $762 million , net of estimated insurance recoveries.
shareholder securities litigation in august 2019, the louisiana sheriffs' pension & relief fund filed a purported class action complaint against cardinal health and certain current and former officers and employees in the united states district court for the southern district of ohio purportedly on behalf of all purchasers of our common shares between march 2015
and may 2018. the complaint alleges that the defendants violated sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the securities and exchange act of 1934 by making misrepresentations and omissions related to the integration of the cordis business and inventory and supply chain problems within the cordis business, and seeks to recover unspecified damages and equitable relief for the alleged misstatements and omissions. we believe that the claims asserted in this complaint are without merit and intend to vigorously defend against them. due to the early stage of this proceeding, it is not possible to reasonably estimate the amount of any possible loss or range of loss in this matter.
antitrust litigation proceeds we received and recognized income resulting from settlements of lawsuits in which we were a class member or plaintiff of $94 million and $22 million during fiscal 2019 and 2018, respectively.
9. guarantees in the ordinary course of business, we agree to indemnify certain other parties under acquisition and disposition agreements, customer agreements, intellectual property licensing agreements, and other agreements. such indemnification obligations vary in scope and, when defined, in duration. in many cases, a maximum obligation is not explicitly stated, and therefore the overall maximum amount of the liability under such indemnification obligations cannot be reasonably estimated. where appropriate, such indemnification obligations are recorded as a liability.
historically, we have not, individually or in the aggregate, made payments under these indemnification obligations in any material amounts. in certain circumstances, we believe that existing insurance arrangements, subject to the general deduction and exclusion provisions, would cover portions of the liability that may arise from these indemnification obligations. in addition, we believe that the likelihood of a material liability being triggered under these indemnification obligations is not probable.
from time to time we enter into agreements that obligate us to make fixed payments upon the occurrence of certain events. such obligations primarily relate to obligations arising under acquisition transactions, where we have agreed to make payments based upon the achievement of certain financial performance measures by the
65  cardinal health|fiscal 2019 form 10-k notes to financial statements acquired business. generally, the obligation is capped at an explicit amount. there were no material obligations at june 30, 2019. 10. fair value measurements the following tables present the fair values for assets and (liabilities) measured on a recurring basis at june 30:
assets:                   level 1       level 2       level 3       total
other investments (1)  $      118    $        -    $  -          $    118

forward contracts (2)           -       (76      )       -               (76  )
the other investments balance includes investments in mutual funds, which are used to offset fluctuations
(1)  in deferred compensation liabilities. these mutual funds invest in the equity securities of companies with both large and small market capitalization and high-quality fixed income debt securities. the fair value of these investments is determined using quoted market prices.
the fair value of interest rate swaps, foreign currency contracts, net investment hedges and commodity contracts is determined based on the present value of expected future cash flows considering the risks
(2)  involved, including non-performance risk, and using discount rates appropriate for the respective maturities. observable level 2 inputs are used to determine the present value of expected future cash flows. the fair value of these derivative contracts, which are subject to master netting arrangements under certain circumstances, is presented on a gross basis in the consolidated balance sheets.
11. financial instruments we utilize derivative financial instruments to manage exposure to certain risks related to our ongoing operations. the primary risks managed through the use of derivative instruments include interest rate risk, currency exchange risk, and commodity price risk. we do not use derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes. while the majority of our derivative instruments are designated as hedging instruments, we also enter into derivative instruments that are designed to hedge a risk, but are not designated as hedging instruments.
these derivative instruments are adjusted to current fair value through earnings at the end of each period.
we are exposed to counterparty credit risk on all of our derivative instruments. accordingly, we have established and maintain strict counterparty credit guidelines and only enter into derivative instruments with major financial institutions that are investment grade or better. we do not have significant exposure to any one counterparty and we believe the risk of loss is remote.
additionally, we do not require collateral under these agreements. interest rate risk management we are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes. our objective is to manage the impact of interest rate changes on cash flows and the market value of our borrowings. we utilize a mix of debt maturities along with both fixed-rate and variable-rate debt to manage changes in interest rates. in addition, we enter into interest rate swaps to further manage our exposure to interest rate variations related to our borrowings and to lower our overall borrowing costs. currency exchange risk management we conduct business in several major international currencies and are subject to risks associated with changing foreign exchange rates. our objective is to reduce earnings and cash flow volatility associated with foreign exchange rate changes to allow management to focus its attention on business operations. accordingly, we enter into various contracts that change in value as foreign exchange rates change to protect the value of existing foreign currency assets and liabilities, commitments and anticipated foreign currency revenue and expenses. commodity price risk management we are exposed to changes in the price of certain commodities. our objective is to reduce earnings and cash flow volatility associated with forecasted purchases of these commodities to allow management to focus its attention on business operations. accordingly, we enter into derivative contracts when possible to manage the price risk associated with certain forecasted purchases. the following table summarizes the fair value of our assets and liabilities related to derivatives designated as hedging instruments and the respective line items in which they were recorded in the consolidated balance sheets at june 30:
assets:                                  2019       2018

(3)  included in deferred income taxes and other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.
(4)  included in other accrued liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.
notes to financial statements there was no gain or loss recorded to interest expense as changes in the market value of our derivative instruments offset changes in the market value of the underlying debt. during fiscal 2018 we entered into pay-
floating interest rate swaps with total notional amounts of $1.1 billion . these swaps have been designated as fair value hedges of our fixed rate debt and are included in deferred income taxes and other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. during fiscal 2019 , we terminated notional amounts of $163 million of pay-
floating interest rate swaps in connection with the debt redemption in fourth quarter fiscal 2019 described in note 6 . these swaps were previously designated as fair value hedges. during fiscal 2018 , $550 million of pay-
floating interest rate swaps matured. the following tables summarize the outstanding interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges at june 30:

recognized in earnings for interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges:
(1) included in interest expense, net in the consolidated statements of earnings. there was no ineffectiveness associated with these derivative instruments for any periods presented. cash flow hedges we enter into derivative instruments to hedge our exposure to changes in cash flows attributable to interest rate, foreign currency and commodity price fluctuations associated with certain forecasted transactions. these derivative instruments are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges. accordingly, the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is reported as a component of other comprehensive income and reclassified into earnings in the same line item associated with the forecasted transaction and in the same period during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. all gains and losses currently included within accumulated other comprehensive loss associated with our foreign exchange forward contracts that are expected to be reclassified into net earnings within the next 12
months are immaterial. we enter into foreign currency contracts to protect the value of anticipated foreign currency revenues and expenses. at june 30,
2019 and 2018 , we held contracts to hedge probable, but not firmly committed, revenue and expenses. the principal currencies hedged are the canadian dollar, mexican peso, euro, thai baht, chinese renminbi, japanese yen, australian dollar, and british pound. we enter into commodity contracts to manage the price risk associated with forecasted purchases of certain commodities used in our medical segment. the following tables summarize the outstanding cash flow hedges at june 30:

commodity contracts (3)               -          -            (3  )
the amount of ineffectiveness associated with these derivative instruments was immaterial for all periods presented. net investment hedges we hedge the foreign currency risk associated with certain net investment positions in european subsidiaries. to accomplish this, we enter into cross-currency swaps that are designated as hedges of net investments. in september 2018 , we entered into a €200 million cross-currency swap maturing in 2023 . cross-currency swaps designated as net investment hedges are marked-to-market using the current spot exchange rate as of the end of the period, with gains and losses included in the foreign currency translation component of accumulated other comprehensive loss until the sale or substantial liquidation of the underlying net investments. to the extent the cross-
67  cardinal health|fiscal 2019 form 10-k notes to financial statements net investment hedges are not highly effective, changes in carrying value attributable to the change in spot rates are recorded in earnings. there was no ineffectiveness in our net investment hedges during fiscal 2019 . economic (non-designated) hedges we enter into foreign currency contracts to manage our foreign exchange exposure related to sales transactions, intercompany financing transactions and other balance sheet items subject to revaluation that do not meet the requirements for hedge accounting treatment.
accordingly, these derivative instruments are adjusted to current market value at the end of each period through earnings. the gain or loss recorded on these instruments is substantially offset by the remeasurement adjustment on the foreign currency denominated asset or liability. the settlement of the derivative instrument and the remeasurement adjustment on the foreign currency denominated asset or liability are both recorded in other (income)/expense, net. the principal currency managed through foreign currency contracts is the euro.

fair value of financial instruments the carrying amounts of cash and equivalents, trade receivables, net, accounts payable, and other accrued liabilities at june

estimated fair value  $  8,065    $  8,852
the fair value of our long-term obligations and other short-term borrowings is estimated based on either the quoted market prices for the same or similar issues or other inputs derived from available market information, which represents a level 2 measurement.

12. redeemable noncontrolling interests in connection with the acquisition of a 71 percent ownership interest in navihealth during fiscal 2016 , we recognized redeemable noncontrolling interests with a fair value of
$119 million at the acquisition date. in august 2017 , certain third-party noncontrolling interest holders exercised their put right on the noncontrolling interest representing 16 percent of navihealth with a redemption value of $ 103 million and a carrying value of $ 109
, we entered into a securities purchase agreement and related contribution and rollover agreement to sell our
98 percent ownership interest in navihealth, which closed on august 1, 2018 . see note 2 for more information. the reconciliation of the changes in redeemable noncontrolling interests are as follows:

750 million class a common shares, without par value; 5
million class b common shares, without par value; and
500 thousand non-voting preferred shares, without par value. the class a common shares and class b common shares are collectively referred to below as "common shares". holders of common shares are entitled to share equally in any dividends declared by the board of directors and to participate equally in all distributions of assets upon liquidation. generally, the holders of class a common shares are entitled to one vote per share, and the holders of class b common shares are entitled to one-fifth of one vote per share on proposals presented to shareholders for vote. under certain circumstances, the holders of class b common shares are entitled to vote as a separate class. only class a common shares were outstanding at june 30, 2019
and 2018 . we repurchased $1.8 billion of our common shares, in the aggregate, through share repurchase programs during fiscal 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , as described below. we funded the repurchases with available cash and short term borrowings. the common shares repurchased are held in treasury to be used for general corporate purposes. during fiscal 2019 , we repurchased 11.5 million common shares having an aggregate cost of $600 million . the average price paid per common share was $52.32 . these repurchases were made under an accelerated share repurchase ("asr")
the retirement of these shares had no impact on total shareholders' equity; however, it did impact certain individual components of shareholders' equity as follows: $2.5 billion decrease in common shares in treasury, $302 million decrease in common shares, and

15. segment information our operations are principally managed on a products and services basis and are comprised of two operating segments, which are the same as our reportable segments: pharmaceutical and medical.
the factors for determining the reportable segments include the manner in which management evaluates performance for purposes of allocating resources and assessing performance combined with the nature of the individual business activities. revenue our pharmaceutical segment distributes branded and generic pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and over-the-
counter healthcare and consumer products in the united states. this segment also provides services to pharmaceutical manufacturers and healthcare providers for specialty pharmaceutical products; operates nuclear pharmacies and radiopharmaceutical manufacturing facilities; provides pharmacy management services to hospitals as well as medication therapy management and patient outcomes services to hospitals, other healthcare providers and payers; and repackages generic pharmaceuticals and over-the-counter healthcare products. our medical segment manufactures, sources and distributes cardinal health branded medical, surgical and laboratory products, which are sold in the united states, canada, europe, asia and other markets. we further expanded this segment's portfolio of manufactured products through the acquisition of the patient recovery business from medtronic in july 2017, which includes incontinence, wound care, enteral feeding, urology, operating room supply, electrode and needle, syringe and sharps disposal product lines. in addition to distributing cardinal health branded products, this segment also distributes a broad range of medical, surgical and laboratory products known as national brand products and provides supply chain services and solutions to hospitals, ambulatory surgery centers, clinical laboratories and other healthcare providers in the united states and canada. the following table presents revenue for each reportable segment and corporate:

united states           $  141,479       $  132,539       $  125,017
segment profit we evaluate segment performance based on segment profit, among other measures. segment profit is segment revenue, less segment cost of products sold, less segment distribution, selling, general, and administrative ("sg&a") expenses. segment sg&a expenses include share-based compensation expense as well as allocated corporate expenses for shared functions, including corporate management, corporate finance, financial and customer care shared services, human resources, information technology, legal and compliance, including certain litigation defense costs. corporate expenses are allocated to the segments based on headcount, level of benefit provided and other ratable allocation methodologies. the results attributable to noncontrolling interests are recorded within segment profit. we do not allocate the following items to our segments: last-in first-out, or ("lifo"), inventory charges/(credits); restructuring and employee severance;
amortization and other acquisition-related costs;
impairments and (gain)/loss on disposal of assets;
litigation (recoveries)/charges, net; other
(income)/expense, net; interest expense, net; loss on extinguishment of debt; and provision for/(benefit from)
notes to financial statements allocated to the segments. investment spending generally includes the first-year spend for certain projects that require incremental investments in the form of additional operating expenses. because approval for these projects is dependent on executive management, we retain these expenses at corporate. investment spending within corporate was $55 million , $43 million and $17
million for fiscal 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , respectively.
in connection with the navihealth divestiture discussed in note 2 , we recognized a pre-tax gain of $508 million during fiscal 2019 which was retained at corporate. the following tables present segment profit by reportable segment and corporate:

2011 ltip's fungible share counting provisions, stock options are counted against the plan as one share for every share issued ; awards other than stock options are counted against the plan as two and one-half shares for every share issued . this means that only 6 million shares could be issued under awards other than stock options while 16 million shares could be issued under stock options. shares are issued out of treasury shares when stock options are exercised and when restricted share units and performance share units vest. the following table provides total share-based compensation expense by type of award:
restricted share unit expense           $    63    $    73       $    69

performance share unit expense                9        (10  )          8
the total tax benefit related to share-based compensation was $16 million , $23 million and $34
million for fiscal 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , respectively.
restricted share units restricted share units granted under the plans generally vest in equal annual installments over three years . restricted share units accrue cash dividend equivalents that are payable upon vesting of the awards. the following table summarizes all transactions related to restricted share units under the plans:

be recognized until the end of fiscal 2018, stock options were granted to our officers and certain employees. the fair values were estimated on the grant date using a lattice valuation model. we believe the lattice model provides reasonable estimates because it has the ability to take into account individual exercise patterns based on changes in our stock price and other variables, and it provides for a range of input assumptions, which are disclosed in the table below. the risk-free rate is based on the u.s. treasury yield curve at the time of the grant. we analyzed historical data to estimate option exercise behaviors and employee terminations to be used within the lattice model. the expected life of the options granted was calculated from the option valuation model and represents the length of time in years that the options granted are expected to be outstanding. expected volatilities are based on implied volatility from traded options on our common shares and historical volatility over a period of time commensurate with the contractual term of the option grant (up to ten years ). there were no stock options granted to employees during fiscal year 2019. the following table provides the range of assumptions used to estimate the fair value of stock options:

notes to financial statements performance share units performance share units generally vest over a three -year performance period based on achievement of specific performance goals.

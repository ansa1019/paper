item 1a. risk factors.
we face many risks. if any of the events or circumstances described below actually occur, we and our businesses, financial condition or results of operations could suffer, and the trading price of our debt or equity securities could decline. our current and potential investors should consider the following risks and the information contained under the heading "cautionary note regarding forward-looking statements" before deciding to invest in our securities.
business risks our customers may shift from paper and tape storage to alternative technologies that require less physical space.
we derive most of our revenues from rental fees for the storage of physical records and computer backup tapes and from storage related services. alternative storage technologies exist, many of which require significantly less space than traditional physical records and tape storage, and as alternative technologies are adopted, storage volume and/or requirements for storage related services may decline. for example, volumes in our global rim business segment were relatively steady in 2019 and we expect them to remain relatively consistent in the near term. we can provide no assurance that our customers will continue to store most or a portion of their records as paper documents or as tapes, or that the paper documents or tapes they do store with us will require our storage related services at the same levels as they have in the past. a significant shift by our customers to storage of data through non-paper or non-tape-based technologies, whether now existing or developed in the future, could adversely affect our businesses. in addition, the digitization of records may shift our revenue mix from the more predictable storage revenue to service revenue, which is inherently more volatile.
failure to execute our strategic growth plan may adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.
as part of our strategic growth plan, we expect to continue to invest in our existing businesses, including records and information management storage and services businesses in our higher-growth markets, data centers and adjacent businesses, and in new businesses, business strategies, products, services, technologies and geographies, and we may selectively divest certain businesses. these initiatives may involve significant risks and uncertainties, including:
•   our inability to identify suitable companies to acquire or invest in;
•   our inability to complete acquisitions or investments on satisfactory terms;
•   our inability to structure investments or acquisitions in a manner that complies with our debt covenants and is consistent with our leverage ratio goals;
•   increased demands on our management, operating systems, internal controls and financial and physical resources and, if necessary, our inability to successfully expand our infrastructure;
•   our inability to execute on our plans to help our customers digitize their records or incorporate new technologies into our offerings;
•   failure to achieve satisfactory returns on acquired companies or other investments, particularly in markets where we do not currently operate;
•   incurring additional debt necessary to acquire suitable companies or make other growth investments if we are unable to pay the purchase price or make the investment out of working capital, common stock or other equity securities;
•   our inability to manage the budgeting, forecasting and other process control issues presented by future growth, particularly with respect to operations in countries outside of the united states or in new lines of business;
•   insufficient revenues to offset expenses and liabilities associated with new investments; and
•   our inability to attract, develop and retain skilled employees to lead and support our strategic growth plan.
our data center expansion in particular requires significant capital commitments. our data center expansion and other new ventures are inherently risky and we can provide no assurance that such strategies and offerings will be successful in achieving the desired returns within a reasonable timeframe, if at all, and that they will not adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results.
we also face competition from other companies in our efforts to grow our data center, international and complementary businesses, some of which possess substantial financial and other resources. as a result, we may be unable to acquire, invest in, or may pay a premium purchase price for, data centers, technology and higher-growth markets and adjacent businesses that support our strategic growth plan, or we may fail to manage the growth of any businesses we acquire or invest in, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
as stored records and tapes become less active our service revenue growth and profitability from related services may decline.
our records management and data management service revenue growth is being negatively impacted by declining activity rates as stored records and tapes are becoming less active and more archival. the amount of information available to customers digitally or in their own information systems has been steadily increasing in recent years, and we believe this trend continues to accelerate. as a result, our customers are less likely than they have been in the past to retrieve records and rotate tapes, thereby reducing their activity levels. at the same time, many of our costs related to records and tape related services remain fixed. in addition, our reputation for providing secure information storage is critical to our success, and actions to manage cost structure, such as outsourcing certain transportation, security or other functions, could negatively impact our reputation and adversely affect our business. ultimately, if we are unable to appropriately align our cost structure with decreased levels of service activity, our operating results could be adversely affected.
in october 2019, we announced project summit, a global program designed to better position us for future growth and achievement of our strategic objectives. project summit focuses on simplifying our global records and information management structure, streamlining our managerial structure and leveraging our global and regional customer facing resources. as a result of the program, we expect to reduce the number of positions at vice president and above by approximately 45%. the total program is expected to have reduced our total managerial and administrative workforce by approximately 700 positions by the end of 2021. we also plan to implement systems and process changes designed to make our organization more agile and dynamic, streamline our organization and reallocate our resources to better align with our strategic goals. we expect the total program benefits associated with project summit to be fully realized by the end of 2022. we have included in this annual report on form 10-k estimates of expected improvements to our adjusted ebitda and the costs (including operating and capital expenditures) we expect to incur. however, we may not be able to realize the full amount of our expected improvements to adjusted ebitda in a timely manner, or at all, and the costs associated project summit may exceed our expectations. in addition, this program may yield unintended consequences, such as attrition beyond our intended reduction in force, distraction of our employees and our anticipated systems and process changes may not work as expected and may create additional risks to our business. as a result, project summit could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.
our future growth depends in part upon our ability to continue to effectively manage and execute on revenue management.
over the past several years, our organic revenue growth has been positively impacted by our ability to effectively introduce, expand and monitor revenue management initially in our more established markets, and subsequently in our higher-growth markets. if we are not able to continue and effectively manage pricing, our results of operations could be adversely affected and we may not be able to execute on our strategic growth plan.
changes in customer behavior with respect to document destruction could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
over the past year, our destruction rates as a percentage of records stored have fluctuated. when destruction rates increase, it has a positive impact on our service revenues in the year of destruction, but negatively impacts our longer term storage revenues, adversely affecting our financial condition and results of operations.
we and our customers are subject to laws and governmental regulations relating to data privacy and cybersecurity and our customers' demands in this area are increasing. this may cause us to incur significant expenses and non-compliance with such regulations and demands could harm our business.
we are subject to numerous u.s. federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations relating to data privacy and cybersecurity. these regulations are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time. there are also a number of legislative proposals pending before the u.s. congress, various state legislative bodies and foreign governments concerning data protection that could affect us. in addition, a growing number of u.s. and foreign legislative and regulatory bodies have adopted consumer notification and other requirements if consumer information is accessed by unauthorized persons and additional regulations regarding the use, access, accuracy and security of such information are possible. in the u.s., we are subject to various state laws which provide for disparate notification regimes. in addition, as a result of the continued emphasis on information security and instances in which personal information has been compromised, our customers are requesting that we take additional measures to enhance security, store electronic data locally, and assume higher liability under our contracts.
we devote substantial resources, and may in the future have to devote significant additional resources, to facilitate compliance with laws and regulations, our customers' demands and to investigate, defend or remedy actual or alleged violations or breaches. any failure by us to comply with, or remedy any violations or breaches of, laws and regulations or customer requirements could result in the curtailment of certain of our operations, the imposition of fines and penalties, liability resulting from litigation, restrictions on our ability to carry on or expand our operations, significant costs and expenses and reputational harm. for example, we have experienced incidents in which customers' information has been lost, and we have been informed by customers that some of the incidents involved the loss of personal information, resulting in monetary costs to those customers for which we have provided reimbursement. it is difficult to predict the impact on our business if we were subject to allegations of having violated existing laws or regulations.
attacks on our internal it systems could damage our reputation, harm our business and adversely impact our results of operations.
our reputation for providing secure information storage to customers is critical to the success of our business. although we seek to prevent and detect attempts by unauthorized users to gain access to our it systems, our it and network infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breaches due to employee error or other disruptions. moreover, until we have migrated businesses we acquire on to our it systems, we may face additional risks because of the continued use of predecessor it systems. we have outsourced, and expect to continue to outsource, certain support services to third parties, which may subject our it and other sensitive information to additional risk. a successful breach of the security of our it systems could lead to theft or misuse of our customers' proprietary or confidential information and result in third party claims against us and reputational harm. if our reputation is damaged, we may become less competitive, which could negatively impact our businesses, financial condition or results of operations.
as of december 31, 2019, we operated approximately 1,450 facilities worldwide, including over 650 in the united states. many of these facilities were built and outfitted by third parties and added to our real estate portfolio as part of acquisitions. some of these facilities contain fire suppression and safety features that are different from our current specifications and current standards for new facilities, although we believe all of our facilities were constructed, in all material respects, in compliance with applicable laws and regulations in effect at the time of their construction or outfitting. in some instances, local authorities may take the position that our fire suppression and safety features in a particular facility are insufficient and require additional measures that may involve considerable expense to us. in addition, where we determine that the fire suppression and safety features of a facility require improvement, we will develop and implement a plan to remediate the issue, although implementation may require an extended period to complete. a significant aspect of the integration of businesses we have acquired or may acquire is the process of making investments in the acquired facilities to conform such facilities to our standards of operations. this process is complex and time-consuming. if additional fire safety and suppression measures beyond our current operating plan were required at a large number of our facilities, the expense required for compliance could negatively impact our business, financial condition or results of operations.
changes to environmental laws and standards may increase the cost to operate some of our businesses. furthermore, if we fail to meet our commitment to transition to more renewable and sustainable sources of energy, it may negatively impact our ability to attract and retain customers and investors who focus on this commitment. this could impact our results of operations and the trading of our stock.
changes in environmental laws in any of the jurisdictions in which we operate could increase compliance costs or impose limitations on our operations. for example, our emergency generators at our data centers are subject to regulations and permit requirements governing air pollutants, and the heating, ventilation and air conditioning and fire suppression systems at some of our data centers and data management locations may include ozone-depleting substances that are subject to regulation. while environmental regulations do not normally impose material costs upon operations at our facilities, unexpected events, equipment malfunctions, human error and changes in law or regulations, among other factors, could result in unexpected costs, which could be material.
furthermore, we have made a commitment to transition to more renewable and sustainable sources of energy. if we are not successful in this transition, it may negatively impact our ability to attract and retain customers and investors who focus on this commitment. this could negatively impact our results of operations and the trading of our stock.
failure to successfully integrate acquired businesses could negatively impact our balance sheet and results of operations.
strategic acquisitions are an important element of our growth strategy and the success of any acquisition we make depends in part on our ability to integrate the acquired business and realize anticipated synergies. the process of integrating acquired businesses, particularly in new markets, may involve unforeseen difficulties and may require a disproportionate amount of our management's attention and our financial and other resources.
for example, the success of our significant acquisitions depends, in large part, on our ability to realize the anticipated benefits, including cost savings from combining the acquired businesses with ours. to realize these anticipated benefits, we must be able to successfully integrate our business and the acquired businesses, and this integration is complex and time-consuming. we may encounter challenges in the integration process including the following:
•   challenges and difficulties associated with managing our larger, more complex, company;
•   conforming standards, controls, procedures and policies, business cultures and compensation and benefits structures between the two businesses;
•   consolidating corporate and administrative infrastructures;
•   potential unknown liabilities and unforeseen expenses or delays associated with an acquisition; and
•   our ability to deliver on our strategy going forward.
further, our acquisitions subject us to liabilities (including tax liabilities) that may exist at an acquired company, some of which may be unknown. although we and our advisors conduct due diligence on the operations of businesses we acquire, there can be no guarantee that we are aware of all liabilities of an acquired company. these liabilities, and any additional risks and uncertainties related to an acquired company not known to us or that we may deem immaterial or unlikely to occur at the time of the acquisition, could negatively impact our future business, financial condition and results of operations.
we can give no assurance that we will ultimately be able to effectively integrate and manage the operations of any acquired business or realize anticipated synergies. the failure to successfully integrate the cultures, operating systems, procedures and information technologies of an acquired business could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
our customer contracts may not always limit our liability and may sometimes contain terms that could lead to disputes in contract interpretation.
our customer contracts typically contain provisions limiting our liability regarding the loss or destruction of, or damage to, records, information, or other items stored with us. our liability for physical storage is often limited to a nominal fixed amount per item or unit of storage (such as per cubic foot) and our liability for igds, data center, destruction and other services unrelated to records, information and other items stored with us is often limited to a percentage of annual revenue under the contract; however, some of our contracts with large customers and some of the contracts assumed in our acquisitions contain no such limits or contain higher limits. we can provide no assurance that our limitation of liability provisions will be enforceable in all instances or, if enforceable, that they would otherwise protect us from liability. in addition to provisions limiting our liability, our customer contracts generally include a schedule setting forth the majority of the customer-specific terms, including storage rental and related service pricing and service delivery terms. our customers may dispute the interpretation of various provisions in their contracts. in the past, we have had relatively few disputes with our customers regarding the terms of their customer contracts, and most disputes to date have not been material, but we can provide no assurance that we will not have material disputes in the future. moreover, as we expand our operations in storage of fine arts and other valuable items and respond to customer demands for higher limitation of liability as a result of regulatory changes, our exposure to contracts with higher or no limitations of liability and disputes with customers over the interpretation of their contracts may increase. although we maintain a comprehensive insurance program, we can provide no assurance that we will be able to maintain insurance policies on acceptable terms or with high enough coverage amounts to cover losses to us in connection with customer contract disputes.
as of december 31, 2019, we operated in approximately 50 countries outside the united states. our international operations account for a significant portion of our overall operations, and as part of our growth strategy, we expect its share to increase as we continue to acquire or invest in businesses in select foreign markets, including countries where we do not currently operate. international operations are subject to numerous risks, including:
•   the impact of foreign government regulations and united states regulations that apply to us in foreign countries where we operate; in particular, we are subject to united states and foreign anticorruption laws, such as the foreign corrupt practices act and the united kingdom bribery act, and, although we have implemented internal controls, policies and procedures and training to deter prohibited practices, our employees, partners, contractors or agents may violate or circumvent such policies and the law;
•   the volatility of certain foreign economies in which we operate;
•   political uncertainties and changes in the global political climate or other global events, such as the recent trade wars involving the u.s. or global pandemics, which may impose restrictions on, or create additional risk in relation to, global operations;
•   unforeseen liabilities, particularly within acquired businesses;
•   costs and difficulties associated with managing international operations of varying sizes and scale;
•   our operations in the united kingdom and the european union may be adversely affected by the exit from the european union ("brexit") by the united kingdom, and the uncertainty associated therewith;
•   the risk that business partners upon whom we depend for technical assistance or management and acquisition expertise in some markets outside of the united states will not perform as expected;
•   difficulties attracting and retaining local management and key employees to operate our business in certain countries;
•   cultural differences and differences in business practices and operating standards; and
•   foreign currency fluctuations.
we have operations in numerous foreign countries and, as a result, are subject to foreign exchange translation risk, which could have an adverse effect on our financial results.
we conduct business operations in numerous foreign countries through our foreign subsidiaries or affiliates, which primarily transact in their respective local currencies. those local currencies are translated into united states dollars at the applicable exchange rates for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements. the results of operations of, and certain of our debt balances (including intercompany debt balances) associated with, our international businesses are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. upon translation, operating results may differ materially from expectations, and significant shifts in foreign currencies can impact our short-term results, as well as our long-term forecasts and targets. in addition, because we intend to distribute 100% of our reit taxable income to our stockholders, and any exchange rate fluctuations may negatively impact our reit taxable income, our distribution amounts may fluctuate because of exchange rate fluctuations.
significant costs or disruptions at our data centers could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
since 2017, we have substantially expanded our global data center business through acquisitions and organically and we expect to continue to grow our global data center business in both ways going forward. for example, we paid an aggregate cash purchase price of over $1.7 billion for data center businesses we acquired in 2017 and 2018 and incurred other costs associated with the development of real estate to support this business. our global data center business depends on providing customers with highly reliable facilities, power infrastructure and operations solutions, and we will need to retain and hire qualified personnel to manage our data centers. service interruptions or significant equipment damage could result in difficulty maintaining service level commitment obligations that we owe to certain of our customers. service interruptions or equipment damage may occur at one or more of our data centers because of numerous factors, including:
•   human error;
•   physical, electronic and cyber security breaches;
•   power loss or telecommunications failure;
in addition, climate change may increase the likelihood that our data centers are affected by some of these factors.
while these risks could impact our overall business, they could have a more significant impact on our global data center business, where we have service level commitment obligations to certain of our customers. as a result, service interruptions or significant equipment damage at our data centers could result in difficulty maintaining service level commitments to these customers and potential claims related to such failures. because our data centers are critical to many of our customers' businesses, service interruptions or significant equipment damage at our data centers could also result in lost profits or other indirect or consequential damages to our customers.
our global data center business is susceptible to regional costs of power, power shortages, planned or unplanned power outages and limitations on the availability of adequate power resources. we rely on third parties to provide power to our data centers. we are therefore subject to an inherent risk that such third parties may fail to deliver such power in adequate quantities or on a consistent basis. if the power delivered to our data centers is insufficient or interrupted, we would be required to provide power through the operation of our on-site generators, generally at a significantly higher operating cost. additionally, global fluctuations in the price of power can increase the cost of energy, and we may be limited in our ability to, or may not always choose to, pass these increased costs on to our customers. we also rely on third party telecommunications carriers to provide internet connectivity to our customers. these carriers may elect not to offer or to restrict their services within our data centers or may elect to discontinue such services. furthermore, carriers may face business difficulties, which could affect their ability to provide telecommunications services or the quality of such services. if connectivity is interrupted or terminated, our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected. events such as these may also impact our reputation as a data center provider which could adversely affect our results of operations.
our data center expansion requires a significant amount of capital and, if we are not able to raise that capital on advantageous terms, our ability to fund our data center expansion may be limited.
our data center expansion requires significant capital commitments. in addition, we may be required to commit significant operational and financial resources in connection with the organic growth of our global data center business, generally 12 to 18 months in advance of securing customer contracts, and we may not have enough customer demand to support these data centers when they are built. there can be no assurance we will have sufficient customer demand to support these data centers or data centers we have acquired or that we will not be adversely affected by the risks noted above, which could make it difficult for us to realize expected returns on our investments, if any.
we may expand our use of joint ventures which could expose us to risks and liabilities, some of which differ from the risks and liabilities related to the operation of our wholly owned subsidiaries, and our joint venture partners on whom we may rely may have economic and business interests that are inconsistent with our business interests.
as part of our growth strategy we may expand our use of joint ventures, particularly in connection with our data center expansion. these joint ventures could result in our acquisition of non-controlling interests in, or shared responsibility for, managing the affairs of a property or portfolio of properties, business, partnership, joint venture or other entity. as a result, in connection with pursuing or entering into any new joint ventures, we may be subject to additional risks, including:
•   we may not have the right to exercise sole decision-making authority regarding the properties, business, partnership, joint venture or other entity;
•   if our partners become bankrupt or fail to fund their share of required capital contributions, we may choose or be required to contribute such capital;
•   our partners may have economic, tax or other interests or goals that are inconsistent with our interests or goals, and that could affect our ability to negotiate satisfactory joint venture terms, to operate the property or business or maintain our qualification for taxation as a reit;
•   our partners may be subject to different laws or regulations than us, or may be structured differently than us for tax purposes, which could create conflicts of interest and/or affect our ability to maintain our qualification for taxation as a reit;
•   our partners may take actions that are not within our control, which could require us to dispose of the joint venture asset, transfer it to a taxable reit subsidiary ("trs") in order for us to maintain our qualification for taxation as a reit, or purchase such partner's interests or assets at an above-market price;
•   in connection with our joint ventures, we may agree to restrictions on our ability to expand our business in certain geographies independently or with other partners;
•   disputes between us and our partners may result in litigation or arbitration that would increase our expenses and prevent our management from focusing their time and effort on our day-to-day business; and
•   we may in certain circumstances be liable for the actions of our third-party partners or guarantee all or a portion of the joint venture's liabilities, which may require the company to pay an amount greater than its investment in the joint venture.
each of these factors may result in returns on these investments being less than we expect or in losses, and our financial and operating results may be adversely affected.
failure to comply with certain regulatory and contractual requirements under our united states government contracts could adversely affect our revenues, operating results and financial position and reputation.
having the united states government as a customer subjects us to certain regulatory and contractual requirements. failure to comply with these requirements could subject us to investigations, price reductions, up to treble damages, and civil penalties. noncompliance with certain regulatory and contractual requirements could also result in us being suspended or barred from future united states government contracting. we may also face private derivative securities claims because of adverse government actions. any of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our revenues, operating results, financial position and reputation.
an important part of our growth strategy involves expanding operations in international markets, including in markets where we currently do not operate, and we expect to continue this expansion. europe, latin america, asia and australia have historically been our primary areas of focus for international expansion of our records and information management services business, with expansion of our records and information management services business into africa and the middle east and expansion of our data center and adjacent business operations becoming more of a focus recently. we have entered into joint ventures or have acquired all or a majority of the equity in storage and information management services and data center businesses operating in these areas and may enter into joint ventures and/or acquire other storage and information management services, data center or adjacent businesses in the future, including in new countries or markets where we currently do not operate. a changing global political climate may impose restrictions on our ability to expand internationally. this growth strategy involves risks. we may be unable to pursue this strategy in the future at the desired pace or at all.
we may be subject to certain costs and potential liabilities associated with the real estate required for our business.
because our business is heavily dependent on real estate, we face special risks attributable to the real estate we own or lease. such risks include:
•   acquisition and occupancy costs that make it difficult to meet anticipated margins and difficulty locating suitable facilities due to a relatively small number of available buildings having the desired characteristics in some real estate markets;
•   uninsured losses or damage to our storage facilities due to an inability to obtain full coverage on a cost-effective basis for some casualties, such as fires, hurricanes and earthquakes, or any coverage for certain losses, such as losses from riots or terrorist activities;
•   inability to use our real estate holdings effectively and costs associated with vacating or consolidating facilities if the demand for physical storage were to diminish; and
•   liability under environmental laws for the costs of investigation and cleanup of contaminated real estate owned or leased by us, whether or not (i) we know of, or were responsible for, the contamination, or (ii) the contamination occurred while we owned or leased the property.
some of our current and formerly owned or leased properties were previously used by entities other than us for industrial or other purposes, or were affected by waste generated from nearby properties, that involved the use, storage, generation and/or disposal of hazardous substances and wastes, including petroleum products. in some instances this prior use involved the operation of underground storage tanks or the presence of asbestos-containing materials. where we are aware of environmental conditions that require remediation, we undertake appropriate activity, in accordance with all legal requirements. although we have from time to time conducted limited environmental investigations and remedial activities at some of our former and current facilities, we have not undertaken an environmental review of all of our properties, including those we have acquired. we therefore may be potentially liable for environmental costs like those discussed above and may be unable to sell, rent, mortgage or use contaminated real estate owned or leased by us. environmental conditions for which we might be liable may also exist at properties that we may acquire in the future. in addition, future regulatory action and environmental laws may impose costs for environmental compliance that do not exist today.
unexpected events, including fires or explosions at our facilities, natural disasters such as hurricanes and earthquakes, war or terrorist activities, unplanned power outages, supply disruptions and failure of equipment or systems, could adversely affect our reputation and results of operations. our customers rely on us to securely store and timely retrieve their critical information, and these events could result in customer service disruption, physical damage to one or more key operating facilities and the information stored in those facilities, the temporary closure of one or more key operating facilities or the temporary disruption of information systems, each of which could negatively impact our reputation and results of operations. during the past several years we have seen an increase in severe weather events and we expect this trend to continue due to climate change. some of our key facilities worldwide are vulnerable to severe weather events.
damage to our reputation could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
our reputation for providing highly secure information storage to customers is critical to the success of our business. our reputation or brand, and specifically, the trust our customers place in us, could be negatively impacted in the event of perceived or actual failures by us to store information securely. for example, events such as fires, natural disasters, attacks on our it systems or security breaches involving us could negatively impact our reputation, particularly if such incidents result in adverse publicity, governmental investigations or litigation. damage to our reputation could make us less competitive, which could negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.
fluctuations in commodity prices may affect our operating revenues and results of operations.
our operating revenues and results of operations are impacted by significant changes in commodity prices. in particular, our secure shredding operations generate revenue from the sale of shredded paper for recycling. further, significant declines in the cost of paper may continue to negatively impact our revenues and results of operations, and increases in other commodity prices, including steel, may negatively impact our results of operations.
the performance of our businesses relies on our ability to attract, develop, and retain talented personnel, while controlling our labor costs.
we are highly dependent on skilled and qualified personnel to operate our businesses. the failure to attract and retain qualified employees or to effectively control our labor costs could negatively affect our competitive position and operating results. our ability to control labor costs and attract qualified personnel is subject to numerous external factors, including prevailing wages, labor shortages, the impact of legislation or regulations governing wages and hours, labor relations, immigration, healthcare and other benefits, other employment-related costs and the hiring practices of our competitors.
we face competition for customers.
we compete with multiple businesses in all geographic areas where we operate; our current or potential customers may choose to use those competitors instead of us. in addition, if we are successful in winning customers from competitors, the process of moving their stored records into our facilities is often costly and time consuming. we also compete, in some of our business lines, with our current and potential customers' internal storage and information management services capabilities and their cloud-based alternatives. these organizations may not begin or continue to use us for their future storage and information management service needs.
we have guaranteed certain obligations of recall to brambles relating to brambles' prior demerger transaction.
on december 18, 2013, brambles limited, an australian corporation ("brambles"), implemented a demerger transaction by way of a distribution of shares of recall holdings limited ("recall") to brambles' shareholders (the "demerger"). prior to and in connection with the demerger, brambles spun off certain of its united states and canadian subsidiaries, directly or indirectly, to recall. such spin-offs were intended to be tax-free or tax-deferred under united states and canadian tax laws, respectively, and brambles obtained rulings from the united states internal revenue service (the "irs") (with respect to the united states spin-off) and the canada revenue agency (with respect to the canadian spin-off), as well as opinions of its tax advisors, to such effect. however, the tax-free status of the spin-off of such united states subsidiaries could be adversely affected under certain circumstances if a 50% or greater interest in such united states subsidiaries were acquired as part of a plan or series of related transactions that included such spin-off. similarly, the tax-deferred status of the spin-off of the canadian subsidiaries could be adversely affected under certain circumstances if control of such subsidiaries were acquired as part of a series of transactions or events that included such spin-off.
in connection with the demerger, recall agreed to indemnify brambles and certain of its affiliates for taxes to the extent that actions by recall (e.g., an acquisition of recall shares) resulted in the united states spin-off or the canadian spin-off described above failing to qualify as tax-free or tax-deferred for united states or canadian tax purposes, respectively. in addition, recall agreed, among other things, that it would not, within two years of the 2013 spin-offs, enter into a proposed acquisition transaction, merger or consolidation (with respect to the united states spin-off) or take any action that could reasonably be expected to jeopardize, directly or indirectly, any of the conclusions reached in the canadian tax ruling or opinion, without obtaining either a supplemental tax ruling from the relevant taxing authority, the consent of brambles or an opinion of a tax advisor, acceptable to brambles in its reasonable discretion, that such transaction should not result in the spin- offs failing to be tax-free under united states federal income tax law or canadian tax law, respectively. recall has obtained such tax opinions, based on, among other things, representations and warranties made by recall and us. such opinions do not affect recall's obligation to indemnify brambles for an adverse impact on the tax-free status of such prior spin-offs.
we have guaranteed the foregoing indemnification obligations of recall. consistent with the foregoing tax opinions, we believe that our acquisition of recall is not part of a plan or series of related transactions, or part of a series of transactions or events, that included the united states spin-off or the canadian spin-off, respectively. however, if the irs or the canadian revenue agency were to prevail in asserting a contrary view, we would be liable for the resulting taxes, which could be material.
risks related to our indebtedness our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under our various debt instruments.
we have a significant amount of indebtedness. as of december 31, 2019, our total long-term debt was approximately $8.8 billion, stockholders equity was approximately $1.5 billion and we had cash and cash equivalents (including restricted cash) of approximately $193.6 million. our substantial indebtedness could have important consequences to our current and potential investors. these risks include:
•   inability to satisfy our obligations with respect to our various debt instruments;
•   inability to make borrowings to fund future working capital, capital expenditures and strategic opportunities, including acquisitions, further organic development of our global data center business and expansions into adjacent businesses, and other general corporate requirements, including possible required repurchases, redemptions or prepayments of our various indebtedness;
•   limits on our distributions to stockholders; in this regard if these limits prevented us from satisfying our reit distribution requirements, we could fail to remain qualified for taxation as a reit or, if these limits do not jeopardize our qualification for taxation as a reit but do nevertheless prevent us from distributing 100% of our reit taxable income, we will be subject to federal corporate income tax, and potentially a nondeductible excise tax, on the retained amounts;
•   limits on future borrowings under our existing or future credit arrangements, which could affect our ability to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs;
•   inability to generate sufficient funds to cover required interest payments;
•   restrictions on our ability to refinance our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms;
•   limits on our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the information management services industry; and
•   inability to adjust to adverse economic conditions that could place us at a disadvantage to our competitors with less debt and who, therefore, may be able to take advantage of opportunities that our indebtedness prevents us from pursuing.
we are subject to risks associated with debt financing, including the risk that our cash flow could be insufficient to meet required payments on our debt. our credit agreement (as defined in note 4 to notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report) and our indentures contain customary restrictive covenants and financial restrictions on us, including a maximum allowable net total lease adjusted leverage ratio of 6.5 (subject to certain exceptions) under the credit agreement and a maximum allowable leverage ratio of 6.5 (subject to certain exceptions) under certain of our indentures. as of december 31, 2019, our leverage ratio under our indentures was 5.9. in addition, potential changes to, or the elimination of, the london interbank offered rate may adversely affect interest expense related to borrowings under the credit agreement and interest rate swaps, which could potentially negatively impact our financial condition.
despite our current indebtedness levels, we may still be able to incur substantially more debt. the terms of our indentures generally do not cap the maximum amount of additional funds that may be borrowed under our credit agreement and possible future credit arrangements.
restrictive debt covenants may limit our ability to pursue our growth strategy.
our indentures and our credit agreement contain covenants restricting or limiting our ability to, among other things:
•   incur additional indebtedness;
•   make asset dispositions;
•   create or permit liens;
•   sell, transfer or exchange assets;
•   make acquisitions and other investments; and
•   enter into partnerships and joint ventures.
these restrictions and our long-term commitment to reduce our leverage ratio may adversely affect our ability to pursue our acquisition and other growth strategies.
we may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to finance the repurchase of outstanding senior or senior subordinated notes upon a change of control event as required by our indentures.
upon the occurrence of a "change of control," as defined in our indentures, we will be required to offer to repurchase all of our outstanding senior and senior subordinated notes. however, it is possible that we will not have sufficient funds at the time of a change of control to make the required repurchase of any outstanding notes or that restrictions in our credit agreement will not allow such repurchases. certain important corporate events, however, such as leveraged recapitalizations that would increase the level of our indebtedness, would not constitute a "change of control" under our indentures.
iron mountain incorporated ("imi") is a holding company, and, therefore, its ability to make payments on its various debt obligations depends in large part on the operations of its subsidiaries.
imi is a holding company; substantially all of its assets consist of the equity in its subsidiaries, and substantially all of its operations are conducted by its direct and indirect consolidated subsidiaries. as a result, its ability to make payments on its debt obligations will be dependent upon the receipt of sufficient funds from its subsidiaries, whose ability to distribute funds may be limited by local capital requirements, joint venture structures and other applicable restrictions. however, our various debt obligations are guaranteed, on a joint and several and full and unconditional basis, by imi's u.s. subsidiaries that represent the substantial majority of its u.s. operations.
risks related to our taxation as a reit if we fail to remain qualified for taxation as a reit, we will be subject to tax at corporate income tax rates and will not be able to deduct distributions to stockholders when computing our taxable income.
we have elected to be taxed as a reit since our 2014 taxable year; however, we can provide no assurance that we will remain qualified for taxation as a reit. if we fail to remain qualified for taxation as a reit, we will be taxed at corporate income tax rates unless certain relief provisions apply.
qualification for taxation as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex provisions of the internal revenue code of 1986, as amended (the "code"), to our operations as well as various factual determinations concerning matters and circumstances not entirely within our control. there are limited judicial or administrative interpretations of applicable reit provisions.
if, in any taxable year, we fail to remain qualified for taxation as a reit and are not entitled to relief under the code:
•   we will not be allowed a deduction for distributions to stockholders in computing our taxable income;
•   we would not be eligible to elect reit status again until the fifth taxable year that begins after the first year for which we failed to qualify as a reit.
any such corporate tax liability could be substantial and would reduce the amount of cash available for other purposes. if we fail to remain qualified for taxation as a reit, we may need to borrow additional funds or liquidate some investments to pay any additional tax liability. accordingly, funds available for investment and distributions to stockholders could be reduced.
as a reit, failure to make required distributions would subject us to federal corporate income tax.
we expect to continue paying regular quarterly distributions; however, the amount, timing and form of our regular quarterly distributions will be determined, and will be subject to adjustment, by our board of directors. to remain qualified for taxation as a reit, we are generally required to distribute at least 90% of our reit taxable income (determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding net capital gain) each year, or in limited circumstances, the following year, to our stockholders. generally, we expect to distribute all or substantially all of our reit taxable income. if our cash available for distribution falls short of our estimates, we may be unable to maintain distributions that approximate our reit taxable income and may fail to remain qualified for taxation as a reit. in addition, our cash flows from operations may be insufficient to fund required distributions as a result of differences in timing between the actual receipt of income and the payment of expenses and the recognition of income and expenses for federal income tax purposes, or the effect of nondeductible expenditures, such as capital expenditures, payments of compensation for which section 162(m) of the code denies a deduction, the creation of reserves or required debt service or amortization payments.
to the extent that we satisfy the 90% distribution requirement but distribute less than 100% of our reit taxable income, we will be subject to federal corporate income tax on our undistributed taxable income. in addition, we will be subject to a 4% nondeductible excise tax on our undistributed taxable income if the actual amount that we distribute to our stockholders for a calendar year is less than the minimum amount specified under the code.
we may be required to borrow funds, sell assets or raise equity to satisfy reit distribution requirements, to comply with asset ownership tests or to fund capital expenditures, future growth and expansion initiatives.
in order to meet the reit distribution requirements and maintain our qualification and taxation as a reit, or to fund capital expenditures, future growth and expansion initiatives, we may need to borrow funds, sell assets or raise equity, even if our financial condition or the then-prevailing market conditions are not favorable for these borrowings, sales or offerings. furthermore, the reit distribution requirements and our commitment to investors on dividend growth may result in increasing our financing needs to fund capital expenditures, future growth and expansion initiatives, which would increase our indebtedness. an increase in our outstanding debt could lead to a downgrade of our credit ratings, which could negatively impact our ability to access credit markets. further, certain of our current debt instruments limit the amount of indebtedness we and our subsidiaries may incur. additional financing, therefore, may be unavailable, more expensive or restricted by the terms of our outstanding indebtedness. for a discussion of risks related to our substantial level of indebtedness, see "risks related to our indebtedness." see also "risks related to our common stock" for certain risks related to our issuances of equity securities or debt convertible into equity securities.
complying with reit requirements may limit our flexibility, cause us to forgo otherwise attractive opportunities that we would otherwise pursue to execute our growth strategy, or otherwise reduce our income and amounts available for distribution to our stockholders.
to remain qualified for taxation as a reit, we must satisfy tests concerning, among other things, the sources of our income, the nature and diversification of our assets and the amounts we distribute to our stockholders. thus, compliance with these tests may require us to refrain from certain activities and may hinder our ability to make certain attractive investments, including the purchase of non-reit qualifying operations or assets, the expansion of non-real estate activities, and investments in the businesses to be conducted by our trss, and to that extent limit our opportunities and our flexibility to change our business strategy. this may restrict our ability to enter into joint ventures or acquire minority interests of companies. furthermore, acquisition opportunities in domestic and international markets may be adversely affected if we need or require the target company to comply with some reit requirements prior to closing.
we conduct a significant portion of our business activities, including our information management services businesses and several of our international operations, through domestic and foreign trss. under the code, no more than 25% of the value of the assets of a reit may be represented by securities of one or more trss and other nonqualifying assets. in addition, no more than 20% of the value of the assets of a reit may be represented by securities of one or more trss within the overall 25% nonqualifying assets limitation. these limitations may affect our ability to make additional investments in non-reit qualifying operations or assets or in international operations through trss.
if we fail to comply with specified asset ownership tests applicable to reits as measured at the end of any calendar quarter, we generally must correct such failure within 30 days after the end of the applicable calendar quarter or qualify for statutory relief provisions to avoid losing our qualification for taxation as a reit. as a result, we may be required to liquidate assets or to forgo our pursuit of otherwise attractive investments. these actions may reduce our income and amounts available for distribution to our stockholders.
as a reit, we are limited in our ability to fund distribution payments using cash generated through our trss.
our ability to receive distributions from our trss is limited by the rules with which we must comply to maintain our qualification for taxation as a reit. in particular, at least 75% of our gross income for each taxable year as a reit must be derived from real estate, which principally includes gross income from providing customers with secure storage space or colocation or wholesale data center space. consequently, no more than 25% of our gross income may consist of dividend income from our trss and other nonqualifying types of income. thus, our ability to receive distributions from our trss may be limited, which may impact our ability to fund distributions to our stockholders using cash flows from our trss. specifically, if our trss become highly profitable, we might become limited in our ability to receive net income from our trss in an amount required to fund distributions to our stockholders commensurate with that profitability.
in addition, a significant amount of our income and cash flows from our trss is generated from our international operations. in many cases, there are local withholding taxes and currency controls that may impact our ability or willingness to repatriate funds to the united states to help satisfy reit distribution requirements.
our extensive use of trss, including for certain of our international operations, may cause us to fail to remain qualified for taxation as a reit.
our operations include an extensive use of trss. the net income of our trss is not required to be distributed to us, and income that is not distributed to us generally is not subject to the reit income distribution requirement. however, there may be limitations on our ability to accumulate earnings in our trss and the accumulation or reinvestment of significant earnings in our trss could result in adverse tax treatment. in particular, if the accumulation of cash in our trss causes (1) the fair market value of our securities in our trss to exceed 20% of the fair market value of our assets or (2) the fair market value of our securities in our trss and other nonqualifying assets to exceed 25% of the fair market value of our assets, then we will fail to remain qualified for taxation as a reit. further, a substantial portion of our operations are conducted overseas, and a material change in foreign currency rates could also affect the value of our foreign holdings in our trss, negatively impacting our ability to remain qualified for taxation as a reit.
even if we remain qualified for taxation as a reit, some of our business activities are subject to corporate level income tax and foreign taxes, which will continue to reduce our cash flows, and we will have potential deferred and contingent tax liabilities.
even if we remain qualified for taxation as a reit, we may be subject to some federal, state, local and foreign taxes, including taxes on any undistributed income, and state, local or foreign income, franchise, property and transfer taxes. in addition, we could in certain circumstances be required to pay an excise or penalty tax, which could be significant in amount, in order to utilize one or more relief provisions under the code to maintain our qualification for taxation as a reit.
our information management services businesses, several of our international operations and certain of our other businesses are conducted through wholly owned trss because these activities could generate nonqualifying reit income as currently structured and operated. the income of our domestic trss will continue to be subject to federal and state corporate income taxes. in addition, we and our subsidiaries continue to be subject to foreign income taxes in jurisdictions in which we have business operations or a taxable presence, regardless of whether assets are held or operations are conducted through subsidiaries disregarded for federal income tax purposes or trss. any of these taxes would decrease our earnings and our available cash.
we will also be subject to a federal corporate level income tax at the highest regular corporate income tax rate (currently 21%) on gains we recognize within a specified period from a sale of a reit asset where our basis in the asset is determined by reference to the basis of the asset in the hands of a c corporation (such as an asset that we hold in one of our qualified reit subsidiaries ("qrss") following the liquidation or other conversion of a former trs). this 21% tax is generally applicable to any disposition of such an asset during the five-year period after the date we first owned the asset as a reit asset to the extent of the built-in-gain based on the fair market value of such asset on the date we first held the asset as a reit asset. in addition, any depreciation recapture income that we recognize because of accounting method changes that we make in connection with our acquisition activities will be fully subject to this 21% tax.
complying with reit requirements may limit our ability to hedge effectively and increase the cost of our hedging and may cause us to incur tax liabilities.
the reit provisions of the code limit our ability to hedge assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. generally, income from hedging transactions that we enter into to manage risk of interest rate changes with respect to borrowings made or to be made by us to acquire or carry real estate assets and income from certain currency hedging transactions related to our non- united states operations, as well as income from qualifying counteracting hedges, do not constitute "gross income" for purposes of the reit gross income tests. to the extent that we enter into other types of hedging transactions, the income from those transactions is likely to be treated as nonqualifying income for purposes of the reit gross income tests. as a result of these rules, we may need to limit our use of advantageous hedging techniques or implement those hedges through our trss. this could increase the cost of our hedging activities because our trss would be subject to tax on income or gains resulting from hedges entered into by them and may expose us to greater risks associated with changes in interest rates or exchange rates than we would otherwise want to bear. in addition, hedging losses in any of our trss generally will not provide any tax benefit, except for being carried forward for possible use against future income or gain in the trss.
distributions payable by reits generally do not qualify for preferential tax rates.
dividends payable by united states corporations to noncorporate stockholders, such as individuals, trusts and estates, are generally eligible for reduced united states federal income tax rates applicable to "qualified dividends." distributions paid by reits generally are not treated as "qualified dividends" under the code, and the reduced rates applicable to such dividends do not generally apply. however, for tax years beginning before 2026, reit dividends paid to noncorporate stockholders are generally taxed at an effective tax rate lower than applicable ordinary income tax rates due to the availability of a deduction under the code for specified forms of income from passthrough entities. more favorable rates will nevertheless continue to apply to regular corporate "qualified" dividends, which may cause some investors to perceive that an investment in a reit is less attractive than an investment in a non-reit entity that pays dividends, thereby reducing the demand and market price of our common stock.
the ownership and transfer restrictions contained in our certificate of incorporation may not protect our qualification for taxation as a reit, could have unintended antitakeover effects and may prevent our stockholders from receiving a takeover premium.
in order for us to remain qualified for taxation as a reit, no more than 50% of the value of outstanding shares of our capital stock may be owned, beneficially or constructively, by five or fewer individuals at any time during the last half of each taxable year. in addition, pursuant to attribution rules under the code, we are treated as the owner of each affiliate of any person who owns 10% or more of our outstanding shares; if such an affiliate is a customer and we are treated under these attribution rules as owning 10% or more of the vote or value of such customer, rents from that "affiliated tenant" will not qualify as qualifying reit income. subject to certain exceptions, our certificate of incorporation prohibits any stockholder from owning, beneficially or constructively, more than (i) 9.8% in value of the outstanding shares of all classes or series of our capital stock or (ii) 9.8% in value or number, whichever is more restrictive, of the outstanding shares of any class or series of our capital stock. we refer to these restrictions collectively as the "ownership limits" and we included them in our certificate of incorporation to facilitate our compliance with reit tax rules. the constructive ownership rules under the code are complex and may cause the outstanding stock owned by a group of related individuals or entities to be deemed to be constructively owned by one individual or entity. as a result, the acquisition of less than 9.8% of our outstanding common stock (or the outstanding shares of any class or series of our capital stock) by an individual or entity could cause that individual or entity or another individual or entity to own constructively in excess of the relevant ownership limits. any attempt to own or transfer shares of our common stock or of any of our other capital stock in violation of these restrictions may result in the shares being automatically transferred to a charitable trust or may be void. even though our certificate of incorporation contains the ownership limits, there can be no assurance that these provisions will be effective to prevent our qualification for taxation as a reit from being jeopardized, including under the affiliated tenant rule. furthermore, there can be no assurance that we will be able to monitor and enforce the ownership limits. if the restrictions in our certificate of incorporation are not effective and as a result we fail to satisfy the reit tax rules described above, then absent an applicable relief provision, we will fail to remain qualified for taxation as a reit.
in addition, the ownership and transfer restrictions could delay, defer or prevent a transaction or a change in control that might involve a premium price for our stock or otherwise be in the best interest of our stockholders. as a result, the overall effect of the ownership and transfer restrictions may be to render more difficult or discourage any attempt to acquire us, even if such acquisition may be favorable to the interests of our stockholders.
legislative or other actions affecting reits could have a negative effect on us or our stockholders.
at any time, the federal or state income tax laws governing reits, or the administrative interpretations of those laws, may be amended. federal and state tax laws are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process, the irs, the united states department of the treasury (the "treasury") and state taxing authorities. changes to the tax laws, regulations and administrative interpretations, which may have retroactive application, could adversely affect us. in addition, some of these changes could have a more significant impact on us as compared to other reits due to the nature of our business and our substantial use of trss, particularly non-united states trss. we cannot predict with certainty whether, when, in what forms, or with what effective dates, the tax laws, regulations and administrative interpretations applicable to us may be changed.
risks related to our common stock sales or issuances of shares of our common stock may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.
future sales or issuances of common stock or other equity related securities may adversely affect the market price of our common stock, including any shares of our common stock issued to finance capital expenditures, finance acquisitions or repay debt. in october 2017, we entered into a distribution agreement (the "distribution agreement") with a syndicate of 10 banks (the "agents") pursuant to which we may sell, from time to time, up to an aggregate sales price of $500.0 million of our common stock through the agents (the "at the market (atm) equity program"). as of december 31, 2019, we have sold 1,754,539 shares of our common stock for gross proceeds of approximately $68.8 million under the at the market (atm) equity program. see note 12 to notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report.
sales or issuances of equity securities or debt convertible into equity securities could negatively impact our existing stockholders.
future sales or issuances of equity securities or debt convertible into equity securities, the percentage of stock ownership by our existing stockholders may be reduced. in addition, new equity securities or convertible debt securities could have rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of our current stockholders, which could substantially decrease the value of our securities owned by them. depending upon the market price of our common stock at the time of any potential issuances of equity securities, we may have to sell a significant number of shares in order to raise the capital we deem necessary to execute our long-term strategy, and our stockholders may experience dilution in the value of their shares as a result.
as a reit, we are generally required to distribute at least 90% of our reit taxable income to our stockholders. furthermore, we are committed to growing our dividends, and have stated this publicly.
our board of directors, in its sole discretion, will determine, on a quarterly basis, the amount of cash to be distributed to our stockholders based on a number of factors including, but not limited to, our results of operations, cash flow and capital requirements, economic conditions, tax considerations, borrowing capacity and other factors, including debt covenant restrictions that may impose limitations on cash payments, future acquisitions and divestitures, any stock repurchase program and general market demand for our space and related services. consequently, our distribution levels may fluctuate and we may not be able to meet our public commitments with respect to dividend growth.
item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with "item 6. selected financial data" and the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto and the other financial and operating information included elsewhere in this annual report.
this discussion contains "forward-looking statements" as that term is defined in the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 and in other securities laws. see "cautionary note regarding forward-looking statements" on page iii of this annual report and "item 1a. risk factors" beginning on page 7 of this annual report.
overview project summit in october 2019, we announced project summit. project summit focuses on simplifying our global structure by combining our core records and information management operations under one global leader and rebalancing our resources, streamlining managerial structures and leveraging our global and regional customer facing resources. we are also implementing systems and process changes designed to make our organization more agile and dynamic, streamline our organization and reallocate our resources to better align with our strategic goals as part of project summit. as a result of the program, we expect to reduce the number of positions at vice president and above by approximately 45%. the total program is expected to have reduced our total managerial and administrative workforce by approximately 700 positions by the end of 2021.
the activities associated with project summit began in the fourth quarter of 2019 and are expected to be substantially complete by the end of 2021. we expect the total program benefits associated with project summit to be fully realized by the end of 2022. we estimate that project summit will improve adjusted ebitda (as defined below) by approximately $200.0 million by the end of 2022. we expect project summit to improve adjusted ebitda by approximately $80.0 million in 2020, of which we expect to realize approximately $50.0 million of adjusted ebitda improvement as a result of the actions initiated during the fourth quarter of 2019. we will continue to evaluate our overall operating model, as well as various opportunities and initiatives, including those associated with real estate consolidation, system implementation and process changes, which could result in the identification and implementation of additional actions associated with project summit and incremental costs and benefits.
we estimate that the implementation of project summit will result in total costs (including operating expenditures ("restructuring charges") and capital expenditures) of approximately $240.0 million. during the fourth quarter of 2019, we incurred approximately $48.6 million of costs related to project summit, which were comprised entirely of restructuring charges primarily related to employee severance costs and professional fees.
during the fourth quarter of 2019, as a result of the realignment of our global managerial structure and changes to our internal financial reporting associated with project summit, we reassessed the composition of our reportable operating segments and reporting units. as a result of the managerial structure changes associated with project summit, we now have the following reportable operating segments: (i) global rim business (which consists of the former north american records and information management business (excluding our technology escrow services business, which is now included as a component of our corporate and other business segment), north american data management business, western european business and other international business); (ii) global data center business; and (iii) corporate and other business (which includes our adjacent businesses and our technology escrow services business). as a result of these changes, previously reported segment information has been restated to conform to the current presentation.
iodc acquisition on january 10, 2018, we completed the iodc transaction and at the closing of the iodc transaction, we paid approximately $1,347.0 million. in february 2019, we paid approximately $31.0 million in additional purchase price associated with the execution of customer contracts from the closing through the one-year anniversary of the iodc transaction. see note 6 to notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for unaudited pro forma results of operations for us and iodc for the years ended december 31, 2018 and 2017, as if the iodc transaction was completed on january 1, 2017.
divestments a.    consumer storage transaction on march 19, 2019, we contributed our customer contracts and certain intellectual property and other assets used by us to operate our consumer storage business in the united states and canada (the "im consumer storage assets") and approximately $20.0 million in cash (gross of certain transaction expenses) (the "cash contribution") to the makespace jv (the "consumer storage transaction"). upon the closing of the consumer storage transaction on march 19, 2019, the makespace jv owned (i) the im consumer storage assets, (ii) the cash contribution and (iii) the customer contracts, intellectual property and certain other assets used by makespace to operate its consumer storage business in the united states. as part of the consumer storage transaction, we received an equity interest of approximately 34% in the makespace jv (the "makespace investment").
as described in note 13 to notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report, the divestment of the im consumer storage assets in the consumer storage transaction does not meet the criteria to be reported as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements. in connection with the consumer storage transaction and the makespace investment, we also entered into a storage and service agreement with the makespace jv to provide certain storage and related services to the makespace jv (the "makespace agreement"). revenues and expenses associated with the makespace agreement are presented as a component of our global rim business segment. we recognized approximately $22.5 million of revenue for the year ended december 31, 2019 associated with the makespace agreement.
as a result of the consumer storage transaction, we recorded a gain on sale of approximately $4.2 million to other expense (income), net, in the first quarter of 2019, representing the excess of the fair value of the consideration received over the sum of (i) carrying value of our consumer storage operations and (ii) the cash contribution.
b.    imfs divestment on september 28, 2018, iron mountain fulfillment services, inc. ("imfs"), a consolidated subsidiary of imi that operated our fulfillment services business in the united states, sold substantially all of its assets for total consideration of approximately $3.0 million (the "imfs divestment"). we have concluded that the imfs divestment does not meet the criteria to be reported as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements, as our decision to divest this business does not represent a strategic shift that will have a major effect on our operations and financial results. accordingly, the revenues and expenses associated with this business are presented as a component of income (loss) from continuing operations in our consolidated statements of operations for the years ended december 31, 2018 and 2017 and the cash flows associated with this business are presented as a component of cash flows from continuing operations in our consolidated statements of cash flows for the years ended december 31, 2018 and 2017 through the sale date. the fair value of the consideration received as a result of the imfs divestment approximated the carrying value of imfs and, therefore, during the third quarter of 2018, we recorded an insignificant loss in connection with the imfs divestment to other (income) expense, net. our imfs business represented approximately $20.2 million and $22.3 million of total revenues for the years ended december 2018 and 2017, respectively. our imfs business represented approximately $1.6 million and $2.1 million of total income (loss) from continuing operations for the years ended december 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. revenues for the year ended december 31, 2018 reflect the impact of the adoption of asu 2014-09 whereas revenues for the year ended december 31, 2017 do not.
c.    russia and ukraine divestment see note 13 to notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for details regarding the divestment of our records and information management operations in russia and ukraine to osg records management (europe) limited ("osg").
in connection with the divestment, we became a holder of 25% of the equity interest in osg. on january 9, 2020, we acquired the remaining 75% equity interest in osg. see note 15 to notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for additional information on the acquisition of osg.
significant acquisition costs our significant acquisition costs represent operating expenditures associated with (1) our acquisition of recall that we completed on may 2, 2016 (the "recall transaction"), including: (i) advisory and professional fees to complete the recall transaction; (ii) costs associated with the divestments (as defined in note 13 to notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report) required in connection with receipt of regulatory approvals (including transitional services); and (iii) costs to integrate recall with our existing operations, including moving, severance, facility upgrade, reit integration and system upgrade costs, as well as certain costs associated with our shared service center initiative for our finance, human resources and information technology functions; and (2) the advisory and professional fees to complete the iodc transaction (collectively, "significant acquisition costs").
total acquisition and integration expenditures associated with the recall transaction and the iodc transaction were approximately $403.8 million, the substantial majority of which was incurred prior to the end of 2018. from january 1, 2015 through december 31, 2019, we incurred cumulative operating and capital expenditures associated with the recall transaction and the iodc transaction of $327.8 million of significant acquisition costs and $76.0 million of capital expenditures.
immaterial restatement in june 2019, we received a notification of assessment from tax and customs authorities in the netherlands related to a vat liability of approximately 16.8 million euros primarily related to the years ending december 31, 2018 and 2017. we have established a reserve for this matter based upon our estimate of the amount of loss that is both probable and estimable, including interest and penalties, and have reflected this reserve through an immaterial restatement of our consolidated financial statements. as a result, certain line items in our consolidated statements of operations for the years ended december 31, 2018 and 2017 have been restated to reflect the immaterial restatement. see note 2.y. to notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for additional information regarding the effect of the immaterial restatement on certain line items in our consolidated statements of operations for the years ended december 31, 2018 and 2017.
adoption of asu 2014-09, revenue from contracts with customers in may 2014, the financial accounting standards board ("fasb") issued asu 2014-09. we adopted asu 2014-09 as of january 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective method for all of our customer contracts, whereby the cumulative effect of applying asu 2014-09 is recognized at the date of initial application. see note 2.l. to notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for information on the impact to opening balance of (distributions in excess of earnings) earnings in excess of distributions on our consolidated balance sheets.
as a result of the adoption of asu 2014-09, adjusted ebitda for the year ended december 31, 2018 increased by approximately $25.3 million, compared to the prior year period. the adoption of asu 2014-09 did not have a material impact on adjusted eps, ffo (nareit) or ffo (normalized) for the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to the prior year period. the revenues for the year ended december 31, 2018 reflect a net $14.2 million, reclassification of certain components of storage rental revenues to service revenues associated with the adoption of asu 2014-09.
changes impacting comparability with prior year in 2019, we made the following changes which impacted the results of fiscal years 2018 and 2017 and the accompanying management discussion and analysis that was presented in previous filings: (i) as a result of the changes associated with project summit, in the fourth quarter of 2019, we created a newly formed global rim business reportable operating segment, which is comprised of the majority of our former north american records and information management business, north american data management business, western european business and other international business reportable operating segments; (ii) in the first quarter of 2019, we began to present gains on sale of real estate as a component of operating income in the line item (gain) loss on disposal/write-down of property, plant and equipment, gross of tax (with any tax impact presented within provision (benefit) for income taxes); and (iii) in the fourth quarter of 2019, we began to present significant acquisition costs as its own line item within operating expenses in our consolidated statements of operations, rather than as components of selling, general and administrative expenses and cost of sales. as a result of these changes, we have included management discussion and analysis of 2018 compared to 2017 for these three items under the "segment analysis", "gain on disposal/write-down of property, plant and equipment, net" and "significant acquisition costs" sections in this item 7. all other management discussion and analysis related to 2018 and 2017 has been excluded, as there have been no material changes to what was included in previous filings. see "item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" in our annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2018 for a comparison of 2018 to 2017.
general our revenues consist of storage rental revenues as well as service revenues and are reflected net of sales and value-added taxes. storage rental revenues, which are considered a key driver of financial performance for the storage and information management services industry, consist primarily of recurring periodic rental charges related to the storage of materials or data (generally on a per unit basis) that are typically retained by customers for many years, technology escrow services that protect and manage source code and revenues associated with our data center operations. service revenues include charges for related service activities, the most significant of which include: (1) the handling of records, including the addition of new records, temporary removal of records from storage, refiling of removed records and courier operations, consisting primarily of the pickup and delivery of records upon customer request; (2) destruction services, consisting primarily of secure shredding of sensitive documents and the subsequent sale of shredded paper for recycling, the price of which can fluctuate from period to period, and customer termination and permanent removal fees; (3) other services, including the scanning, imaging and document conversion services of active and inactive records and project revenues; and (4) consulting services. our service revenue growth has been negatively impacted by declining activity rates as stored records are becoming less active. while customers continue to store their records and tapes with us, they are less likely than they have been in the past to retrieve records for research and other purposes, thereby reducing service activity levels.
cost of sales (excluding depreciation and amortization) consists primarily of wages and benefits for field personnel, facility occupancy costs (including rent and utilities), transportation expenses (including vehicle leases and fuel), other product cost of sales and other equipment costs and supplies. of these, wages and benefits and facility occupancy costs are the most significant. selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of wages and benefits for management, administrative, it, sales, account management and marketing personnel, as well as expenses related to communications and data processing, travel, professional fees, bad debts, training, office equipment and supplies.
trends in facility occupancy costs are impacted by the total number of facilities we occupy, the mix of properties we own versus properties we occupy under leases, fluctuations in per square foot occupancy costs, and the levels of utilization of these properties. trends in total wages and benefits in dollars and as a percentage of total consolidated revenue are influenced by changes in headcount and compensation levels, achievement of incentive compensation targets, workforce productivity and variability in costs associated with medical insurance and workers' compensation.
the expansion of our international businesses has impacted the major cost of sales components and selling, general and administrative expenses. our international operations are more labor intensive relative to revenue than our operations in north america and, therefore, labor costs are a higher percentage of international operational revenue. in addition, the overhead structure of our expanding international operations has generally not achieved the same level of overhead leverage as our north american operations, which may result in an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of consolidated revenue as our international operations become a larger percentage of our consolidated results.
our depreciation and amortization charges result primarily from depreciation related to storage systems, which include racking structures, buildings, building and leasehold improvements and computer systems hardware and software. amortization relates primarily to customer relationship intangible assets, contract fulfillment costs and data center lease-based intangible assets. both depreciation and amortization are impacted by the timing of acquisitions.
our consolidated revenues and expenses are subject to the net effect of foreign currency translation related to our operations outside the united states. it is difficult to predict the future fluctuations of foreign currency exchange rates and how those fluctuations will impact our consolidated statements of operations. as a result of the relative size of our international operations, these fluctuations may be material on individual balances. our revenues and expenses from our international operations are generally denominated in the local currency of the country in which they are derived or incurred. therefore, the impact of currency fluctuations on our operating income and operating margin is partially mitigated. in order to provide a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses performed excluding the effect of foreign currency fluctuations, we compare the percentage change in the results from one period to another period in this report using constant currency presentation. the constant currency growth rates are calculated by translating the 2018 results at the 2019 average exchange rates and the 2017 results at the 2018 average exchange rates. constant currency growth rates are a non-gaap measure.

non-gaap measures adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda is defined as income (loss) from continuing operations before interest expense, net, provision (benefit) for income taxes, depreciation and amortization, and also excludes certain items that we believe are not indicative of our core operating results, specifically: (1) (gain) loss on disposal/write-down of property, plant and equipment, net (including real estate); (2) intangible impairments; (3) other expense (income), net (which includes foreign currency transaction (gains) losses, net); (4) significant acquisition costs; and (5) restructuring charges. adjusted ebitda margin is calculated by dividing adjusted ebitda by total revenues. we use multiples of current or projected adjusted ebitda in conjunction with our discounted cash flow models to determine our estimated overall enterprise valuation and to evaluate acquisition targets. we believe adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin provide our current and potential investors with relevant and useful information regarding our ability to generate cash flows to support business investment. these measures are an integral part of the internal reporting system we use to assess and evaluate the operating performance of our business.
adjusted ebitda excludes both interest expense, net and the provision (benefit) for income taxes. these expenses are associated with our capitalization and tax structures, which we do not consider when evaluating the operating profitability of our core operations. finally, adjusted ebitda does not include depreciation and amortization expenses, in order to eliminate the impact of capital investments, which we evaluate by comparing capital expenditures to incremental revenue generated and as a percentage of total revenues. adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america ("gaap"), such as operating income, income (loss) from continuing operations, net income (loss) or cash flows from operating activities from continuing operations (as determined in accordance with gaap).

(1)   the difference between our effective tax rate and our structural tax rate (or adjusted effective tax rate) for the years ended december 31, 2019, 2018, 2017, 2016 and 2015 is primarily due to (i) the reconciling items above, which impact our reported income (loss) from continuing operations before provision (benefit) for income taxes but have an insignificant impact on our reported provision (benefit) for income taxes and (ii) other discrete tax items. our structural tax rate for purposes of the calculation of adjusted eps for the years ended december 31, 2019, 2018, 2017, 2016 and 2015 was 18.2%, 18.2%, 19.7%, 18.5% and 16.8%, respectively.
ffo (nareit) and ffo (normalized)
funds from operations ("ffo") is defined by the national association of real estate investment trusts ("nareit") and us as net income (loss) excluding depreciation on real estate assets, gains on sale of real estate, net of tax and amortization of data center leased-based intangibles ("ffo (nareit)"). ffo (nareit) does not give effect to real estate depreciation because these amounts are computed, under gaap, to allocate the cost of a property over its useful life. because values for well-maintained real estate assets have historically increased or decreased based upon prevailing market conditions, we believe that ffo (nareit) provides investors with a clearer view of our operating performance. our most directly comparable gaap measure to ffo (nareit) is net income (loss). although nareit has published a definition of ffo, modifications to ffo (nareit) are common among reits as companies seek to provide financial measures that most meaningfully reflect their particular business. our definition of ffo (normalized) excludes certain items included in ffo (nareit) that we believe are not indicative of our core operating results, specifically: (1) (gain) loss on disposal/write-down of property, plant and equipment (excluding real estate), net; (2) intangible impairments; (3) other expense (income), net (which includes foreign currency transaction (gains) losses, net); (4) real estate financing lease depreciation; (5) significant acquisition costs; (6) restructuring charges; (7) the tax impact of reconciling items and discrete tax items; (8) (income) loss from discontinued operations, net of tax; and (9) loss (gain) on sale of discontinued operations, net of tax.

critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with gaap. the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and for the period then ended. on an ongoing basis, we evaluate the estimates used. we base our estimates on historical experience, actuarial estimates, current conditions and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and are not readily apparent from other sources. actual results may differ from these estimates. our critical accounting policies include the following, which are listed in no particular order:
revenue recognition storage rental and service revenues are recognized in the month the respective storage rental or service is provided, and customers are generally billed on a monthly basis on contractually agreed-upon terms. amounts related to future storage rental or prepaid service contracts for customers where storage rental fees or services are billed in advance are accounted for as deferred revenue and recognized ratably over the period the applicable storage rental or service is provided or performed. revenues from the sales of products, which are included as a component of service revenues, are recognized when products are shipped and title has passed to the customer. revenues from the sales of products, which represented less than 2% of consolidated revenues for the year ended december 31, 2019, have historically not been significant. the performance obligation is a series of distinct services (as determined for purposes of asu 2014-09, a "series") that have the same pattern of transfer to the customer that is satisfied over time. for those contracts that qualify as a series, we have a right to consideration from the customer in an amount that corresponds directly with the value of the underlying performance obligation transferred to the customer to date. this concept is known as "right to invoice" and we are applying the "right to invoice" practical expedient to all revenues, with the exception of storage revenues in our global data center business.
for all of our businesses, with the exception of the storage component of our global data center business, each purchasing decision is fully in the control of the customer and, therefore, consideration beyond the current reporting period is variable and allocated to the specific period, which is consistent with the practical expedient described above. our global data center business features storage rental provided to the customer at contractually specified rates over a fixed contractual period. the storage rental revenue related to the storage component of our global data center business is recognized on a straight-line basis over the contract term. the revenue related to the service component of our global data center business is recognized in the period the data center access or related services are provided.
the costs associated with the initial movement of customer records into physical storage and certain commissions are considered costs to obtain or fulfill customer contracts ("contract fulfillment costs"). see note 2.l. to notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for information on each of the contract fulfillment costs recognized under asu 2014-09.
accounting for acquisitions part of our growth strategy has been to acquire businesses. the purchase price of each acquisition has been determined after due diligence of the target business, market research, strategic planning and the forecasting of expected future results and synergies. estimated future results and expected synergies are subject to revisions as we integrate each acquisition and attempt to leverage resources.
during the third quarter of 2017, we adopted asu no. 2017-01, business combinations (topic 805): clarifying the definition of a business ("asu 2017-01"). asu 2017-01 provides guidance for evaluating whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions of assets or businesses. the guidance provides a screen to determine when an integrated set of assets and activities does not qualify to be a business. the screen requires that when substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired is concentrated in an identifiable asset or a group of similar identifiable assets, the acquisition should not be accounted for as the acquisition of a business, but rather the acquisition of an asset. if an acquisition is determined to be a business, goodwill is recognized as part of purchase accounting, whereas with the acquisition of an asset there is no goodwill recognized.
each acquisition has been accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting as defined under the applicable accounting standards at the date of each acquisition. accounting for acquisitions of a business has resulted in the capitalization of the cost in excess of the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired in each of these acquisitions as goodwill. we estimate the fair values of the assets acquired in each acquisition as of the date of acquisition and these estimates are subject to adjustment based on the final assessments of the fair value of intangible assets (primarily customer relationship and data center lease-based intangible assets), property, plant and equipment (primarily building, building improvements, leasehold improvements, data center infrastructure and racking structures), operating leases, contingencies and income taxes (primarily deferred income taxes). we complete these assessments within one year of the date of acquisition, as we acquire additional information impacting our estimates as of the acquisition date. see note 6 to notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for a description of recent acquisitions.
determining the fair values of the net assets acquired requires management's judgment and often involves the use of assumptions with respect to future cash inflows and outflows, discount rates and market data, among other items. as it relates to our data center acquisitions, the fair values of the net assets acquired requires management's judgment and often involves the use of assumptions with respect to (i) certain economic costs (as described more fully in note 2.i. to notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report) avoided by acquiring a data center operation with active tenants that would have otherwise been incurred if the data center operation was purchased vacant, (ii) market rental rates and (iii) expectations of lease renewals and extensions. due to the inherent uncertainty of future events, actual values of net assets acquired could be different from our estimated fair values and could have a material impact on our financial statements.
of the net assets acquired in our acquisitions, the fair value of owned buildings, including building improvements, customer relationship and data center lease-based intangible assets, racking structures and operating leases are generally the most common and most significant. for significant acquisitions or acquisitions involving new markets or new products, we generally use third parties to assist us in estimating the fair value of owned buildings, including building improvements, customer relationship and lease-based intangible assets and market rental rates for acquired operating leases. for acquisitions that are not significant or do not involve new markets or new products, we generally use third parties to assist us in estimating the fair value of acquired owned buildings, including building improvements, and market rental rates for acquired operating leases. when not using third party appraisals of the fair value of acquired net assets, the fair value of acquired customer relationship intangible assets, above and below market in-place operating leases, and racking structures is determined internally. the fair value of acquired racking structures is determined internally by taking current estimated replacement cost at the date of acquisition for the quantity of racking structures acquired, discounted to take into account the quality (e.g. age, material and type) of the racking structures. we use discounted cash flow models to determine the fair value of customer relationship assets, which requires a significant amount of judgment by management, including estimating expected lives of the relationships, expected future cash flows and discount rates. we determine the fair value of tangible data center assets using an estimated replacement cost at the date of acquisition, then discounting for age, economic and functional obsolescence.
our estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable at that time but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. assumptions may be incomplete or inaccurate, and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur, which may affect the accuracy of such assumptions. total property, plant and equipment acquired in our 2019 acquisitions was approximately $5.4 million.
impairment of tangible and intangible assets assets subject to depreciation or amortization: we review long-lived assets and all finite-lived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. examples of events or circumstances that may be indicative of impairment include, but are not limited to:
•   a significant decrease in the market price of an asset;
•   a significant change in the extent or manner in which a long-lived asset is being used or in its physical condition;
•   a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of the asset;
•   an accumulation of costs significantly greater than the amount originally expected for the acquisition or construction of an asset;
•   a current-period operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a projection or forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of a long-lived asset; and
•   a current expectation that, more likely than not, an asset will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life.
if events indicate the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable, recoverability of these assets is determined by comparing the sum of the forecasted undiscounted net cash flows of the operation to which the assets relate to their carrying amount. the operations are generally distinguished by the business segment and geographic region in which they operate. if it is determined that we are unable to recover the carrying amount of the assets, the long-lived assets are written down, on a pro rata basis, to fair value. fair value is determined based on discounted cash flows or appraised values, depending upon the nature of the assets.
goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets not subject to amortization: goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but are reviewed annually for impairment, or more frequently if impairment indicators arise. other than goodwill, we currently have no intangible assets that have indefinite lives and which are not amortized.
we have selected october 1 as our annual goodwill impairment review date. we have performed our annual goodwill impairment review as of october 1, 2019, 2018 and 2017. we concluded that as of october 1, 2019 and october 1, 2018, goodwill was not impaired. as of october 1, 2017, we determined that the fair value of the consumer storage reporting unit was less than its carrying value and, therefore, we recorded a $3.0 million impairment charge, which represented a full write-off of all goodwill associated with this reporting unit. we concluded that the goodwill associated with each of our other reporting units was not impaired as of october 1, 2017.
our reporting units at which level we performed our goodwill impairment analysis as of october 1, 2019 were as follows: (1) north american records and information management; (2) north american data management; (3) fine arts; (4) entertainment services; (5) western europe; (6) northern/eastern europe and middle east and india ("nee and mei"); (7) latin america; (8) australia, new zealand and south africa ("anz sa"); (9) asia; and (10) global data center. see note 2.h. to notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for a description of our reporting units.
based on our goodwill impairment analysis as of october 1, 2019, our reporting units that had estimated fair values that exceeded their carrying values by greater than 20% represent approximately $4,023.1 million, or 89.7%, of our consolidated goodwill balance at december 31, 2019. our global data center and fine arts reporting units had estimated fair values that exceeded their carrying values by less than 20%. these reporting units represent approximately $462.1 million, or 10.3%, of our consolidated goodwill balance at december 31, 2019. the following is a summary of the global data center and fine arts reporting units, including goodwill balances (in thousands), percentage by which the fair value of these reporting units exceeded its carrying value, and certain key assumptions used by us in determining the fair value of the reporting unit as of october 1, 2019:

(1)   for purposes of our goodwill impairment analysis, the term "capital expenditures" includes both growth investment and recurring capital expenditures.
reporting unit valuations have generally been determined using a combined approach based on the present value of future cash flows (the "discounted cash flow model") and market multiples (the "market approach"). there are inherent uncertainties and judgments involved when determining the fair value of the reporting units for purposes of our annual goodwill impairment testing. the following includes supplemental information to the table above for those reporting units where the estimated fair values exceeded their carrying values by less than 20% as of october 1, 2019. the success of each of these businesses and the achievement of certain key assumptions developed by management and used in the discounted cash flow model are contingent upon various factors including, but not limited to, (i) achieving growth from existing customers, (ii) sales to new customers, (iii) increased market penetration and (iv) accurately timing the capital investments related to expansions.
our global data center business footprint spanned nine markets in the united states: denver, colorado; kansas city, missouri; boston, massachusetts; boyers, pennsylvania; manassas, virginia; edison, new jersey; columbus, ohio; and phoenix and scottsdale, arizona and four international markets: amsterdam, london, and singapore, with land held for development in frankfurt. we provide mission-critical data centers that are designed and operated to protect and ensure the continued operation of it infrastructure for our customers. data centers are highly specialized and secure assets that serve as centralized repositories of server, storage and network equipment. they are capital intensive and designed to provide the space, power, cooling and network connectivity necessary to efficiently operate mission-critical it equipment. the demand for data center infrastructure is being driven by many factors, but most importantly by significant growth in data as well as an increased demand for outsourcing. in order to attract and retain customers, as well as sustain growth in our existing and new markets, we must have the capability to tailor our facilities and invest capital to meet the customers' needs. our estimate of fair value reflects the expected growth in each of our data center markets along with the corresponding capital investments required to meet demand. the business is primarily comprised of acquisitions completed in 2018 and late 2017; therefore, we would expect that the fair value of this reporting unit will closely approximate its carrying value.
our fine arts business operates in a growing, but fragmented, industry marked by increasing international interest and changes in purchasing habits by collectors and museums. we believe the increase in contemporary art as a focus for collectors will result in increasing storage needs, while the increase in auction "turnover" (the rate at which catalogs, collections and individual pieces are made available for auction) has heightened the need for transportation, shipping, and related services. taken together, we believe these factors will result in continued growth of the fine art storage industry. the fine arts storage market continues to change and expand, and the assumptions used when determining the fair value of the fine arts reporting unit reflect this growth potential and the capital needs required to respond to the expansion opportunities. the fine arts reporting unit is primarily composed of businesses we acquired in 2018 and 2015; therefore, we would expect the fair value of this reporting unit to closely approximate its carrying value.
key factors that could reasonably be expected to have a negative impact on the estimated fair value of these reporting units and potentially result in impairment charges include, but are not limited to: (i) a deterioration in general economic conditions, (ii) significant adverse changes in regulatory factors or in the business climate, and (iii) adverse actions or assessment by regulators, all of which could result in adverse changes to the key assumptions used in valuing the reporting units. the inability to meet the assumptions used in the discounted cash flow model and market approach for each of the reporting units, or future adverse market conditions not currently known, could lead to a fair value that is less than the carrying value in any one of our reporting units.
as described more above, during the fourth quarter of 2019, as a result of the realignment of our global managerial structure and changes to our internal financial reporting associated with project summit, we reassessed the composition of our reportable operating segments (see note 9 to notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for a description of our reportable operating segments) and reporting units. subsequent to the implementation of the managerial structure changes and changes to our internal financial reporting associated with project summit, we now have the following reportable operating segments: (i) global rim business (which consists of the former north american records and information management business (excluding our technology escrow services business, which is now included as a component of our corporate and other business segment), north american data management business, western european business and other international business); (ii) global data center business; and (iii) corporate and other business (which includes our adjacent businesses and our technology escrow services business). see note 9 for disclosure of our reportable operating segments.
as a result of the realignment of our global managerial structure and changes to our internal financial reporting associated with project summit, we note the following changes to our reporting units: (1) our former north american records and information management (excluding our technology escrow services business) and north american data management reporting units are now being managed as our "north america rim" reporting unit; (2) our former western europe and nee and mei reporting units (excluding india) and our business in africa (which was which was previously managed as a component of our former anz sa reporting unit) is now being managed together as our "europe rim" reporting unit; (3) our business in india (which was previously managed as a component of our former nee and mei reporting unit) is now being managed in conjunction with our businesses in asia as our "asia rim" reporting unit; (4) our former anz sa reporting unit will no longer include south africa and will be referred to as our "australia and new zealand rim" (or "anz rim") reporting unit; and (5) our technology escrow services business is now being managed separately as our "technology escrow services" reporting unit. there were no changes to our global data center, fine arts, entertainment services and latin america rim reporting units as a result of the realignment of our global managerial structure and changes to our internal financial reporting associated with project summit.
we concluded that the goodwill associated with our newly formed (1) north america rim, (2) europe rim, (3) anz rim, (4) asia rim and (5) technology escrow services reporting units were not impaired following the changes in reporting units described above.
at december 31, 2019, no factors were identified that would alter the conclusions of our october 1, 2019 goodwill impairment analysis. in making this assessment, we considered a number of factors including operating results, business plans, anticipated future cash flows, transactions and marketplace data. there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and our judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill impairment.
reporting unit valuations have generally been determined using a combined approach based on the discounted cash flow model and market approach. the discounted cash flow model incorporates significant assumptions including future revenue growth rates, operating margins, discount rates and capital expenditures. the market approach requires us to make assumptions related to adjusted ebitda multiples. changes in economic and operating conditions impacting these assumptions or changes in multiples could result in goodwill impairments in future periods. in conjunction with our annual goodwill impairment reviews, we reconcile the sum of the valuations of all of our reporting units to our market capitalization as of such dates.
although we believe we have sufficient historical and projected information available to us to test for goodwill impairment, it is possible that actual results could differ from the estimates used in our impairment tests. of the key assumptions that impact the goodwill impairment test, the expected future cash flows and discount rate are among the most sensitive and are considered to be critical assumptions, as changes to these estimates could have an effect on the estimated fair value of each of our reporting units. we have assessed the sensitivity of these assumptions on each of our reporting units as of october 1, 2019. with respect to the north american records and information management, north american data management, entertainment services, western europe, nee and mei, latin america, anz sa and asia reporting units as of october 1, 2019, we noted that, based on the estimated fair value of these reporting units determined as of october 1, 2019, (i) a hypothetical decrease of 10% in the expected annual future cash flows of these reporting units, with all other assumptions unchanged, would have decreased the estimated fair value of these reporting units as of october 1, 2019 by approximately 9.7% to 10.5% but would not, however, have resulted in the carrying value of any of these reporting units with goodwill exceeding their estimated fair value; and (ii) a hypothetical increase of 100 basis points in the discount rate, with all other assumptions unchanged, would have decreased the estimated fair value of these reporting units as of october 1, 2019 by a range of approximately 4.4% to 8.7% but would not, however, have resulted in the carrying value of any of these reporting units with goodwill exceeding their estimated fair value. with respect to the global data center and fine arts reporting units, we noted that, as of october 1, 2019, the estimated fair value of these reporting units exceeds their carrying value by less than 20%. accordingly, any significant negative change in either the expected annual future cash flows of these reporting units or the discount rate may result in the carrying value of these reporting units exceeding their estimated fair value.
income taxes as a reit, we are generally permitted to deduct from our federal taxable income the dividends we pay to our stockholders. the income represented by such dividends is not subject to federal taxation at the entity level but is taxed, if at all, at the stockholder level. the income of our domestic trss, which hold our domestic operations that may not be reit-compliant as currently operated and structured, is subject, as applicable, to federal and state corporate income tax. in addition, we and our subsidiaries continue to be subject to foreign income taxes in other jurisdictions in which we have business operations or a taxable presence, regardless of whether assets are held or operations are conducted through subsidiaries disregarded for federal income tax purposes or trss. we will also be subject to a separate corporate income tax on any gains recognized on the sale or disposition of any asset previously owned by a c corporation during a five-year period after the date we first owned the asset as a reit asset that are attributable to "built-in gains" with respect to that asset on that date. we will also be subject to a built-in gains tax on our depreciation recapture recognized into income as a result of accounting method changes in connection with our acquisition activities. if we fail to remain qualified for taxation as a reit, we will be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate income tax rates. even if we remain qualified for taxation as a reit, we may be subject to some federal, state, local and foreign taxes on our income and property in addition to taxes owed with respect to our trs operations. in particular, while state income tax regimes often parallel the federal income tax regime for reits, many states do not completely follow federal rules and some do not follow them at all.
accounting for income taxes requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax and financial reporting bases of assets and liabilities and for loss and credit carryforwards. we measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates expected to be applied to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences and carryforwards are expected to be recovered or settled. the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities as a result of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that the change is enacted. valuation allowances are provided when recovery of deferred tax assets does not meet the more likely than not standard as defined in gaap. valuation allowances would be reversed as a reduction to the provision for income taxes if related deferred tax assets are deemed realizable based on changes in facts and circumstances relevant to the recoverability of the asset.
at december 31, 2019, we have federal net operating loss carryforwards of $152.7 million available to reduce future federal taxable income, the majority of which expire from 2024 through 2037. of the $152.7 million, we expect to utilize $39.2 million and realize a federal tax benefit of $8.2 million. we can carry forward these net operating losses to the extent we do not utilize them in any given available year. we have state net operating loss carryforwards, which expire from 2020 through 2039, of which an insignificant state tax benefit is expected to be realized. we have assets for foreign net operating losses of $90.8 million, with various expiration dates (and in some cases no expiration date), subject to a valuation allowance of approximately 64%. if actual results differ unfavorably from certain of our estimates used, we may not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred income tax assets and additional valuation allowances may be required. although we believe our estimates are reasonable, no assurance can be given that our estimates reflected in the tax provisions and accruals will equal our actual results. these differences could have a material impact on our income tax provision and operating results in the period in which such determination is made.
the evaluation of an uncertain tax position is a two-step process. the first step is a recognition process whereby we determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. the second step is a measurement process whereby a tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold is calculated to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements. the tax position is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement.
we are subject to income taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions. we are subject to examination by various tax authorities in jurisdictions in which we have business operations or a taxable presence. we regularly assess the likelihood of additional assessments by tax authorities and provide for these matters as appropriate. as of december 31, 2019 and 2018, we had approximately $35.1 million and $35.3 million, respectively, of reserves related to uncertain tax positions. the reversal of these reserves will be recorded as a reduction of our income tax provision if sustained. although we believe our tax estimates are appropriate, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could result in changes in our estimates.
following our conversion to a reit in 2014, we concluded that it was not our intent to reinvest our current and future undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries indefinitely outside the united states. as of december 31, 2016, we concluded that it is our intent to indefinitely reinvest our current and future undistributed earnings of certain of our unconverted foreign trss outside the united states. we no longer provide incremental foreign withholding taxes on the retained book earnings of these unconverted foreign trss, which was approximately $279.7 million as of december 31, 2019. as a reit, future repatriation of incremental undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries will not be subject to federal or state income tax, with the exception of foreign withholding taxes in limited instances; however, such future repatriations will require distribution in accordance with reit distribution rules, and any such distribution may then be taxable, as appropriate, at the stockholder level. we continue, however, to provide for incremental foreign withholding taxes on net book over outside basis differences related to the earnings of our foreign qrss and certain other foreign trss (excluding unconverted foreign trss).
tax reform on december 22, 2017, legislation commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act (the "tax reform legislation") was enacted into law in the united states. the tax reform legislation amended the code to reduce tax rates and modify policies, credits and deductions for businesses and individuals. the following summarizes certain components of the tax reform legislation and the impact such components of the tax reform legislation. one of the primary components of the tax reform legislation was a reduction in the united states corporate federal income tax rate from 35% to 21% for taxable years beginning after december 31, 2017.
a.    deemed repatriation transition tax the tax reform legislation imposed a transition tax (the "deemed repatriation transition tax") on a mandatory deemed repatriation of post-1986 undistributed foreign earnings and profits not previously subject to united states tax as of november 2, 2017 or december 31, 2017, whichever was greater (the "undistributed e&p"), as of the last taxable year beginning before january 1, 2018. the deemed repatriation transition tax varied depending on whether the undistributed e&p was held in liquid (as defined in the tax reform legislation) or non-liquid assets. a participation deduction against the deemed repatriation resulted in a deemed repatriation transition tax on undistributed e&p of 15.5% if held in cash and liquid assets and 8.0% if held in non-liquid assets. the deemed repatriation transition tax applied regardless of whether or not an entity had cash in its foreign subsidiaries and regardless of whether the entity actually repatriated the undistributed e&p back to the united states.
we have completed our analysis and determined that the amount of undistributed e&p deemed repatriated under the tax reform legislation in our taxable year ending december 31, 2017 was $160.0 million. we opted to include the full amount of undistributed e&p in our 2017 taxable income, rather than spread it over eight years (as permitted by the tax reform legislation). after applying the participation deduction, included in our reit taxable income for 2017 was approximately $70.9 million related to the deemed repatriation of undistributed e&p.
b.    global intangible low-taxed income for taxable years beginning after december 31, 2017, the tax reform legislation introduced new provisions intended to prevent the erosion of the united states federal income tax base through the taxation of certain global intangible low-taxed income ("gilti"). the gilti provisions created a new requirement that certain income earned by controlled foreign corporations ("cfcs") must be included currently in the gross income of the cfc's united states tax resident shareholder. generally, gilti is the excess of the united states shareholder's pro rata portion of the income of its foreign subsidiaries over the net deemed tangible income return of such subsidiaries.
the gilti provisions also provide for certain deductions against the inclusion of gilti in taxable income; however, reits are not eligible for such deductions. therefore, 100% of our gilti is included in our taxable income and will increase the required minimum distribution to our stockholders. there was no gilti included in our taxable income for the year ended december 31, 2019 and the amount included in our reit taxable income for the year ended december 31, 2018 was approximately $41.9 million. we have adopted an accounting policy such that we will recognize no deferred taxes related to basis differences resulting from gilti.
the internal revenue service issued guidance clarifying that gilti included in a reit's taxable income is qualifying income for purposes of the 95% reit gross income test that we are required to satisfy. we do not expect the gilti provision will impact our provision for income taxes. however, the gilti provision may impact the amount and characterization of dividends that we expect to pay in future taxable years.
c.    interest deduction limitation the tax reform legislation also limits, for certain entities, the deduction for net interest expense to the sum of business interest income plus 30% of adjusted taxable income (the "interest deduction limitation"). adjusted taxable income is defined in the tax reform legislation similar to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization for taxable years beginning after december 31, 2017 and before january 1, 2022, and is defined similar to earnings before interest and taxes for taxable years beginning after december 31, 2021.
the interest deduction limitation does not apply to taxpayers that qualify, and make an election, to be treated as an "electing real property trade or business". as a reit, imi, including all of our qrss, made an election to be treated as an "electing real property trade or business" beginning in our taxable year ended december 31, 2018. as such, the interest deduction limitation does not apply to imi or our qrss; however, imi will be required to utilize the alternative depreciation system for its real property. this election does not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. we do not generally believe that our trss are eligible for treatment as "electing real property trades or businesses".

(1)   constant currency growth rates are calculated by translating the 2018 results at the 2019 average exchange rates and the 2017 results at the 2018 average exchange rates.
(2)   our organic revenue growth rate, which is a non-gaap measure, represents the year-over-year growth rate of our revenues excluding the impact of business acquisitions, divestitures, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and the impact of the adoption of asu 2014-09, but including the impact of acquisitions of customer relationships.
storage rental revenues in the year ended december 31, 2019, the increase in reported consolidated storage rental revenue was driven by the favorable impact of acquisitions/divestitures and consolidated organic storage rental revenue growth, partially offset by unfavorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. the net impact of acquisitions/divestitures contributed 1.8% to the reported storage rental revenue growth rates for the year ended december 31, 2019 compared to the prior year period, primarily driven by acquisitions in our global data center business segment. organic storage rental revenue growth of 2.5% in the year ended december 31, 2019 compared to the prior year period was driven by organic storage rental revenue growth of 2.2% in our global rim business segment, mainly driven by revenue management. excluding the impact of acquisitions/divestitures, our global rim business segment net volumes as of december 31, 2019 were relatively steady compared to the ending volume as of december 31, 2018. including the impact of acquisitions/divestitures, our global rim business segment net volumes as of december 31, 2019 increased by 0.4% over the ending volume at december 31, 2018. organic storage rental revenue growth in our global data center business segment was 5.3% compared to the prior year period, primarily related to a $5.4 million lease modification fee that benefited organic storage rental revenue growth for the segment by 2.5%. foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations decreased our reported storage rental revenue growth rate for the year ended december 31, 2019 by 2.1%, compared to the prior year period.
service revenues in the year ended december 31, 2019, the decrease in reported consolidated service revenues was driven by unfavorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and negative organic service revenue growth, partially offset by the favorable impact of acquisitions/divestitures. foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations decreased our reported service revenue growth rate in the year ended december 31, 2019 by 2.3%, compared to the prior year period. in the year ended december 31, 2019, organic service revenue growth was negative 1.0% compared to the prior year period, primarily driven by continued declines in recycled paper prices, lower destructions and reduced retrieval/re-file and related transportation activity, partially offset by growth in our secure shredding revenue and increased project activity in our global rim business segment. the net impact of acquisitions/divestitures contributed 1.9% to the reported service revenue growth rates in the year ended december 31, 2019, compared to the prior year period.
total revenues for the reasons stated above, our reported consolidated revenues increased $36.8 million, or 0.9%, to $4,262.6 million for the year ended december 31, 2019 from $4,225.8 million for the year ended december 31, 2018. the net impact of acquisitions/divestitures contributed 1.9% to the reported consolidated revenue growth rate for the year ended december 31, 2019 compared to the prior year period. consolidated organic revenue growth was 1.1% in the year ended december 31, 2019 compared to the prior year period. foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations decreased our reported consolidated revenues by 2.1% in the year ended december 31, 2019 compared to the prior year period.
we expect our consolidated organic storage rental revenue growth rate for 2020 to be approximately 1.0% to 3.0% and our consolidated organic total revenue growth rate to be flat to approximately 2.0%. during the past eight quarters, our organic storage rental revenue growth rate has ranged between 1.9% and 3.7%. consolidated organic storage rental revenue growth and consolidated total organic revenue growth were benefited by (i) 0.3% and 0.2%, respectively, for the second quarter of 2019 related to a $1.7 million customer lease modification fee in our global data center business segment, (ii) 0.3% and 0.2%, respectively, for the third quarter of 2019 related to a $1.7 million customer lease modification fee in our global data center business segment and (iii) 0.3% and 0.2%, respectively, for the fourth quarter of 2019 related to a $2.0 million customer lease modification fee in our global data center business segment. our organic storage rental revenue growth rates have increased over the past two fiscal years, as organic storage rental revenue growth for full year 2018 and 2019 was 2.4% and 2.5%, respectively. at various points in the economic cycle, organic storage rental revenue growth may be influenced by changes in pricing and volume. in 2018 and 2019, we experienced relatively steady net volume in our global rim business segment, with organic storage rental revenue growth coming primarily from revenue management. we expect organic storage rental revenue growth to benefit from revenue management and volume to remain relatively consistent in the near term.
the organic growth rate for service revenue is inherently more volatile than the organic growth rate for storage rental revenues due to the more discretionary nature of certain services we offer, such as large special projects, and, as a commodity, the volatility of pricing for recycled paper. these revenues, which are often event-driven and impacted to a greater extent by economic downturns as customers defer or cancel the purchase of certain services as a way to reduce their short-term costs, may be difficult to replicate in future periods. the organic growth rate for total service revenues over the past eight quarters reflects reduced retrieval/re-file activity and a related decrease in transportation revenues within our global rim business segment. the increases in organic service revenue growth rates of 7.6%, 7.1% and 6.1% in the second, third and fourth quarters of 2018 reflect a strong contribution from our secure shredding business, which benefited from higher recycled paper prices, higher destruction activity and acquisitions of customer relationships. organic service revenue growth declined to 1.8%, negative 2.0%, negative 3.0% and negative 0.7% for the first, second, third and fourth quarters of 2019, respectively, reflecting declining recycled paper prices and moderation of destruction activity compared to previous quarters. we expect these trends to continue into 2020.

labor labor expenses decreased to 19.1% of consolidated revenues in the year ended december 31, 2019 compared to 19.4% in the year ended december 31, 2018. the decrease in labor expenses as a percentage of consolidated revenues was primarily driven by improvements in our global rim business segment, partially attributable to ongoing cost management actions. on a constant dollar basis, labor expenses for the year ended december 31, 2019 increased by $17.4 million, or 2.2%, compared to the prior year period, primarily driven by recent acquisitions in our adjacent businesses operating segment within our corporate and other business segment, as well as increased labor costs related to the growth of our shredding operations within our global rim business segment.
facilities facilities expenses increased to 16.4% of consolidated revenues in the year ended december 31, 2019 compared to 15.4% in the year ended december 31, 2018. the 100 basis point increase in facilities expenses as a percentage of consolidated revenues was primarily driven by acquisitions in our global data center business segment and our adjacent businesses operating segment within our corporate and other business segment. on a constant dollar basis, facilities expenses for the year ended december 31, 2019 increased by $60.3 million, or 9.5%, compared to the prior year period, driven by higher rent expense, insurance costs, utilities and building maintenance, in part driven by the acquisitions mentioned above.
transportation transportation expenses remained constant at 3.8% of consolidated revenues for the year ended december 31, 2019 compared to 3.8% for the year ended december 31, 2018. this was primarily driven by increases in third party carrier expenses, in part due to recent acquisitions in our adjacent businesses operating segment within our corporate and other business segment, offset by a decrease in transportation costs within our global rim business segment. on a constant dollar basis, transportation expenses for the year ended december 31, 2019 increased by $7.9 million, or 5.1%, compared to the prior year period, primarily driven by increases in third party carrier expenses, in part due to recent acquisitions in our adjacent businesses operating segment within our corporate and other business segment.
product cost of sales and other product cost of sales and other, which includes cartons, media and other service, storage and supply costs and is highly correlated to service revenue streams, particularly project revenues, were 3.7% of consolidated revenues for the year ended december 31, 2019 compared to 3.9% in the year ended december 31, 2018. on a constant dollar basis, product cost of sales and other decreased by $2.2 million, or 1.4%, compared to the prior year period, primarily driven by lower special project costs.

general and administrative general and administrative expenses decreased to 13.2% of consolidated revenues for the year ended december 31, 2019 compared to 13.7% for the year ended december 31, 2018. general and administrative expenses for the year ended december 31, 2018 includes $11.0 million of indirect expenses associated with a value-added tax matter in the netherlands (the "netherlands vat matter"), as described in note 2.y. to notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report. on a constant dollar basis, excluding the impact of the netherlands vat matter, general and administrative expenses for the year ended december 31, 2019 increased by $8.5 million, or 1.5%, compared to the prior year period. the increase in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of consolidated revenues was driven primarily by higher compensation expense and professional fees within our corporate and other business segment, primarily associated with our global operations support team that is tasked with driving operational improvements and continued investment in innovation and product development, as well as acquisitions in our adjacent businesses operating segment within our corporate and other business segment. the increase in compensation expense is primarily the result of merit-based increases as well as increased headcount, partially offset by a reduction in variable compensation expense.
sales, marketing & account management sales, marketing and account management expenses decreased to 5.8% of consolidated revenues for the year ended december 31, 2019 compared to 6.1% for the year ended december 31, 2018. the decrease in sales, marketing and account management expenses as a percentage of consolidated revenues was driven by a decrease in compensation expense, primarily due to lower commissions expense, as well as a decrease in marketing costs. on a constant dollar basis, sales, marketing and account management expenses for the year ended december 31, 2019 decreased by $7.1 million, or 2.8%, compared to the prior year period, primarily driven by lower marketing costs.
information technology it expenses increased to 3.8% of consolidated revenues for the year ended december 31, 2019 compared to 3.6% for the year ended december 31, 2018. it expenses as a percentage of consolidated revenues reflect an increase in professional fees and compensation expense, primarily related to information security costs and investments in innovation and product development. on a constant dollar basis, it expenses for the year ended december 31, 2019 increased by $10.8 million, or 7.1%, compared to the prior year period, primarily driven by an increase in professional fees and compensation expense, primarily related to information security costs and investments in innovation and product development.
bad debt expense we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts that is calculated based on our past loss experience, current and prior trends in our aged receivables, current economic conditions, and specific circumstances of individual receivable balances. we continue to monitor our customers' payment activity and make adjustments based on their financial condition and in light of historical and expected trends. bad debt expense for the year ended december 31, 2019 increased by $1.2 million on a constant dollar basis compared to the year ended december 31, 2018, primarily driven by higher bad debt expense associated with our global rim business segment.
depreciation and amortization our depreciation and amortization charges result primarily from depreciation related to storage systems, which include racking structures, buildings, building and leasehold improvements and computer systems hardware and software. amortization relates primarily to customer relationship intangible assets, contract fulfillment costs and data center lease-based intangible assets. both depreciation and amortization are impacted by the timing of acquisitions.
depreciation expense increased $3.6 million, or 0.8%, on a reported dollar basis for the year ended december 31, 2019 compared to the year ended december 31, 2018. see note 2.f. to notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for additional information regarding the useful lives over which our property, plant and equipment is depreciated.
amortization expense increased $15.1 million, or 8.1%, on a reported dollar basis for the year ended december 31, 2019 compared to the year ended december 31, 2018.
significant acquisition costs significant acquisition costs for the years ended december 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 were approximately $13.3 million, $50.7 million and $84.9 million, respectively, and primarily consisted of employee severance costs, facility integration costs and advisory and professional fees associated with the recall transaction.
restructuring charges restructuring charges were approximately $48.6 million for the year ended december 31, 2019, and primarily consisted of employee severance costs and professional fees associated with project summit.
gain on disposal/write-down of property, plant and equipment, net consolidated gain on disposal/write-down of property, plant and equipment, net, for the year ended december 31, 2019 was approximately $63.8 million. the gain consisted primarily of gains associated with (i) sale and sale-leaseback transactions involving the sales of facilities in the united states of approximately $67.8 million and (ii) the sale of certain land and buildings in the united kingdom of approximately $36.0 million. these gains were partially offset by losses primarily associated with (i) the impairment charge on the assets associated with the select offerings within our iron cloud portfolio (as described below) and (ii) the write-down of certain property, plant and equipment in the united states of approximately $15.7 million.
during the second quarter of 2019, we began exploring strategic options regarding how to maintain and support the infrastructure of select offerings within our iron mountain iron cloud ("iron cloud") portfolio. as a result, during the second quarter of 2019, we performed a long-lived asset impairment analysis on the assets associated with these select offerings and concluded that the associated carrying value of the long-lived assets (which consisted entirely of property, plant and equipment) was not recoverable based upon the underlying cash flows associated with these select offerings. on september 30, 2019, we entered into an agreement (the "iron cloud outsourcing agreement") with a wholesale provider of data infrastructure and data management services to outsource the operation, infrastructure management and maintenance and delivery of select offerings within our iron cloud portfolio. in conjunction with the entry into the iron cloud outsourcing agreement, we also sold certain it infrastructure assets and the rights to certain hardware and software maintenance contracts used to deliver these iron cloud offerings. as a result of our long-lived asset impairment analysis and sale of certain it infrastructure assets and rights to certain hardware and software maintenance contracts, we recognized an impairment charge and a loss on sale of the assets totaling approximately $25.0 million during the year ended december 31, 2019.
consolidated gain on disposal/write-down of property, plant and equipment, net for the year ended december 31, 2018 was $73.6 million. the gain consisted primarily of (i) the gain on sale of real estate for the sale of buildings in the united kingdom of approximately $63.8 million and (ii) gains associated with the involuntary conversion of assets included in a facility that we own in argentina which was partially destroyed in a fire in 2014, for which we received insurance proceeds in excess of the carrying amount of such assets during the fourth quarter of 2018. see note 10 to notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report.
other expenses, net interest expense, net consolidated interest expense, net increased $9.7 million to $419.3 million for the year ended december 31, 2019 from $409.6 million for the year ended december 31, 2018. the increase in interest expense, net during the year ended december 31, 2019 compared to the year ended december 31, 2018 was the result of higher average debt outstanding during 2019. our weighted average interest rate was 4.8% and 4.9% at december 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. see note 4 to notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for additional information regarding our indebtedness.

foreign currency transaction losses (gains)
we recorded net foreign currency transaction losses of $24.9 million in the year ended december 31, 2019, based on period-end exchange rates. these losses resulted primarily from the impact of changes in the exchange rate of the british pound sterling against the united states dollar compared to december 31, 2018 on our intercompany balances with and between certain of our subsidiaries.
we recorded net foreign currency transaction gains of $15.6 million in the year ended december 31, 2018, based on period-end exchange rates. these gains resulted primarily from the impact of changes in the exchange rate of each of the british pound sterling and canadian dollar against the united states dollar compared to december 31, 2017 on our intercompany balances with and between certain of our subsidiaries and the euro notes (as defined below). these gains were partially offset by losses resulting primarily from the impact of changes in the exchange rate of each of the australian dollar, brazilian real and the turkish lira against the united states dollar compared to december 31, 2017 on our intercompany balances with and between certain of our subsidiaries.
provision (benefit) for income taxes our effective tax rates for the years ended december 31, 2019 and 2018 were 18.3% and 10.4%, respectively. our effective tax rate is subject to variability in the future due to, among other items: (1) changes in the mix of income between our qrss and our trss, as well as among the jurisdictions in which we operate; (2) tax law changes; (3) volatility in foreign exchange gains and losses; (4) the timing of the establishment and reversal of tax reserves; and (5) our ability to utilize net operating losses that we generate.
on december 22, 2017, the tax reform legislation was enacted into law in the united states. the tax reform legislation amended the code to reduce tax rates and modify policies, credits and deductions for businesses and individuals. the components of the tax reform legislation are described in detail in note 7 to notes to consolidated financial statements included in our annual report. one of the primary components of the tax reform legislation was a reduction in the united states corporate federal income tax rate from 35.0% to 21.0% for taxable years beginning after december 31, 2017.
the primary reconciling items between the federal statutory tax rate of 21.0% and our overall effective tax rate for the year ended december 31, 2019 were the benefit derived from the dividends paid deduction of $40.6 million and the impact of differences in the tax rates at which our foreign earnings are subject to, resulting in a tax provision of $8.6 million.
the primary reconciling items between the federal statutory tax rate of 21.0% and our overall effective tax rate for the year ended december 31, 2018 were the benefit derived from the dividends paid deduction of $35.2 million, the impact of differences in the tax rates at which our foreign earnings are subject to, resulting in a tax provision of approximately $1.0 million and a discrete tax benefit of approximately $14.0 million associated with the resolution of a tax matter.
as a reit, we are entitled to a deduction for dividends paid, resulting in a substantial reduction of federal income tax expense. as a reit, substantially all of our income tax expense will be incurred based on the earnings generated by our foreign subsidiaries and our domestic trss.
we are subject to income taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions. we are subject to examination by various tax authorities in jurisdictions in which we have business operations or a taxable presence. we regularly assess the likelihood of additional assessments by tax authorities and provide for these matters as appropriate. although we believe our tax estimates are appropriate, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could result in changes in our estimates.

consolidated adjusted ebitda for the year ended december 31, 2019 increased by $12.8 million, or 0.9%, and consolidated adjusted ebitda margin remained consistent with the year ended december 31, 2018. consolidated adjusted ebitda for the year ended december 31, 2018 was negatively impacted by $11.0 million of indirect tax expenses associated with the netherlands vat matter that did not repeat in 2019. excluding the impact of the netherlands vat matter, consolidated adjusted ebitda increased $1.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2019 compared to the year ended december 31, 2018, primarily due to lower variable compensation expense and the impact of cost management actions, partially offset by increased labor costs in our secure shredding business and higher technology costs associated with information security investments.
consolidated adjusted ebitda for the year ended december 31, 2018 increased by $181.3 million, or 14.6%, compared to the year ended december 31, 2017, primarily due to acquisitions within our global data center business segment, the adoption of asu 2014-09 and synergies associated with our acquisition of recall.

for the year ended december 31, 2019, reported revenue in our global rim business segment decreased 0.8%, compared to the year ended december 31, 2018, due to unfavorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, partially offset by organic revenue growth and the favorable net impact of acquisitions/dispositions. organic revenue growth of 0.8% was primarily the result of organic storage rental revenue growth of 2.2% driven by revenue management. in addition, negative organic service revenue growth of 1.3% was driven by continued declines in recycled paper prices, lower destructions and reduced retrieval/re-file and related transportation activity, partially offset by growth in our secure shredding revenue and increased project activity. adjusted ebitda margin increased 20 basis points during the year ended december 31, 2019 compared to the year ended december 31, 2018, primarily driven by lower compensation expense and other employee related costs, partially offset by increased facility rent expense and the impact of lower recycled paper prices. the decrease in compensation expense is primarily due to a reduction in variable compensation expense, partially offset by increased labor costs related to growth in our secure shredding operations.
for the year ended december 31, 2018, reported revenue in our global rim business segment increased 3.7% compared to the year ended december 31, 2017, due to organic revenue growth, the favorable net impact of acquisitions/divestitures and the adoption of asu 2014-09, partially offset by unfavorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. organic revenue growth of 3.4% was primarily the result of organic storage rental revenue growth of 2.3%, driven by revenue management and organic service revenue growth of 5.1%, driven by growth in secure shredding revenue, in part due to higher recycled paper prices and acquisitions of customer relationships, as well as increased project and destruction activity. the net impact of acquisitions/divestitures and the adoption of asu 2014-09 contributed 0.6% to the reported revenue growth rates in our global rim business segment for the year ended december 31, 2018, compared to the year ended december 31, 2017. adjusted ebitda margin increased 110 basis points during the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to the year ended december 31, 2017, primarily driven by a decrease in wages and benefits as a percentage of segment revenue, partially attributable to synergies associated with our acquisition of recall, cost management initiatives, the capitalization of certain commissions as a result of our adoption of asu 2014-09 and the benefit of revenue management.

for the year ended december 31, 2019, reported revenue in our global data center business segment increased 12.3% compared to the year ended december 31, 2018, primarily due to the impact of acquisitions (see note 6 of notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for additional acquisition details). the impact of acquisitions contributed 8.0% to the reported revenue growth rate in our global data center business segment for the year ended december 31, 2019 compared to the prior year period. organic storage rental revenue growth in our global data center business segment was 5.3% for the year ended december 31, 2019 compared to the prior year period, primarily related to a $5.4 million lease modification fee that benefited organic storage rental revenue growth by 2.5%. adjusted ebitda margin increased 380 basis points during the year ended december 31, 2019 compared to the year ended december 31, 2018 primarily due to the impact of cost management actions, the lease modification fee described above and a $4.0 million contractual settlement, partially offset by higher facilities costs, in part due to acquisitions, and increased overhead to support the growth of this business.

for the year ended december 31, 2019, reported revenue in our corporate and other business segment increased 25.2% compared to the year ended december 31, 2018, primarily due to the impact of acquisitions. the impact of acquisitions contributed 21.4% to the reported revenue growth rate in our corporate and other business segment for the year ended december 31, 2019 compared to the prior year period. adjusted ebitda in our corporate and other business segment decreased $3.0 million in the year ended december 31, 2019 compared to the year ended december 31, 2018. adjusted ebitda for the year ended december 31, 2018 was negatively impacted by $11.0 million of indirect tax expenses associated with the netherlands vat matter that did not repeat in 2019. excluding the impact of the netherlands vat matter, adjusted ebitda in our corporate and other business segment decreased $14.1 million in the year ended december 31, 2019 compared to the year ended december 31, 2018, primarily driven by higher compensation expense and professional fees associated with investments in our global operations support team that is tasked with driving operational improvements and continued investment in innovation and product development, partially offset by profitability associated with recent acquisitions in our adjacent businesses operating segment. the increase in compensation expense is primarily the result of merit-based increases as well as increased headcount, partially offset by a reduction in variable compensation expense.
liquidity and capital resources project summit as disclosed above, in october 2019, we announced project summit. we estimate that the implementation of project summit will result in total costs of approximately $240.0 million. during the fourth quarter of 2019, we incurred approximately $48.6 million of costs related to project summit which were comprised entirely of restructuring charges, primarily related to employee severance costs and professional fees.

a.    credit agreement on august 21, 2017, we entered into a new credit agreement (the "credit agreement") which amended and restated our then existing credit agreement which consisted of a revolving credit facility (the "former revolving credit facility") and a term loan and was scheduled to terminate on july 6, 2019. the credit agreement consists of a revolving credit facility (the "revolving credit facility") and a term loan (the "term loan a"). the maximum amount permitted to be borrowed under the revolving credit facility is $1,750.0 million. the original principal amount of the term loan a was $250.0 million. under the revolving credit facility, we had the option to request additional commitments of up to $500.0 million, in the form of term loans or through increased commitments under the revolving credit facility, subject to the conditions specified in the credit agreement. the credit agreement was originally scheduled to mature on august 21, 2022, at which point all obligations were to become due.
on march 22, 2018, we entered into an amendment (the "march 2018 amendment") to the credit agreement which provided us with the option to request additional commitments of up to approximately $1,260.0 million under the credit agreement in the form of term loans or through increased commitments under the revolving credit facility, subject to the conditions specified in the credit agreement. on june 4, 2018, we entered into another amendment (the "june 2018 amendment") to the credit agreement which (i) reduced interest rate margins applicable to existing and future borrowings under the revolving credit facility and term loan a by 0.25% and (ii) extended the maturity date of the credit agreement to june 4, 2023. the term loan a is to be paid in quarterly installments in an amount equal to $3.1 million per quarter, with the remaining balance due on june 4, 2023.
on december 20, 2019, we entered into an amendment (the "december 2019 amendment") to the credit agreement. the december 2019 amendment amended the definition of ebitda and certain other definitions and restrictive covenants contained in the credit agreement.

the amount available for borrowing under the revolving credit facility as of december 31, 2019, which is based on imi's leverage ratio, the last 12 months' earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and rent expense ("ebitdar"), other adjustments as defined in the credit agreement and current external debt, was $1,396.3 million (which amount represents the maximum availability as of such date). available borrowings under the revolving credit facility are subject to compliance with our indenture covenants as described more fully below.
in connection with the march 2018 amendment, imi's wholly owned subsidiary, iron mountain information management, llc ("imim"), entered into an incremental term loan activation notice (the "activation notice"), with certain lenders pursuant to which the lenders party to the activation notice agreed to provide commitments to fund an incremental term loan b in the original principal amount of $700.0 million (the "term loan b"). on march 26, 2018, imim borrowed the full amount of the term loan b, which matures on january 2, 2026. the term loan b was issued at 99.75% of par. the aggregate net proceeds of approximately $689.9 million, after paying commissions to the joint lead arrangers and net of the original discount, were used to repay outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility. the term loan b holders benefit from the same security and guarantees as other borrowings under the credit agreement. the term loan b holders also benefit from the same affirmative and negative covenants as other borrowings under the credit agreement; however, the term loan b holders are not generally entitled to the benefits of the financial covenants under the credit agreement.
as of december 31, 2019, we had $686.4 million outstanding on the term loan b and the interest rate in effect under the term loan b was 3.6%. the amount of debt for the term loan b reflects an unamortized original issue discount of $1.4 million as of december 31, 2019.
in september 2019, imi completed a private offering of $1,000.0 million in aggregate principal amount of the 4/% notes due 2029. the 4/% notes due 2029 were issued at par. the net proceeds of approximately $987.5 million from the 4/% notes due 2029, after paying the initial purchasers' commissions, were used to repay outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility.

("im australia"), a wholly owned subsidiary of imi, amended its aud term loan (the "aud term loan amendment") to (i) increase the borrowings under the aud term loan from 250.0 million australian dollars to 350.0 million australian dollars; (ii) increase the quarterly principal payments from 6.3 million australian dollars per year to 8.8 million australian dollars per year; and (iii) decrease the interest rate on the aud term loan from bbsy (an australian benchmark variable interest rate) plus 4.3% to bbsy plus 3.875%. the interest rate in effect under the aud term loan was 4.8% as of december 31, 2019. the aud term loan matures in september 2022. all indebtedness associated with the aud term loan was issued at 99% of par. the net proceeds associated with the aud term loan amendment of approximately 99.0 million australian dollars (or approximately $75.6 million, based upon the exchange rate between the australian dollar and the united states dollar on march 29, 2018 (the closing date of the aud term loan amendment)), net of the original discount, were used to repay outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility. see note 4 to notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for additional details on the aud term loan.
d.    uk bilateral revolving credit facility on september 24, 2018, iron mountain (uk) plc ("im uk") and iron mountain (uk) data centre limited entered into a 140.0 million british pounds sterling revolving credit facility (the "uk bilateral facility") with barclays bank plc. the maximum amount permitted to be borrowed under the uk bilateral facility is 140.0 million british pounds sterling, and we have the option to request additional commitments of up to 125.0 million british pounds sterling, subject to the conditions specified in the uk bilateral facility. the uk bilateral facility was fully utilized on september 24, 2018 (the closing date of the uk bilateral facility). the initial net proceeds received under the uk bilateral facility of 138.3 million british pounds sterling (or approximately $180.3 million, based upon the exchange rate between the british pound sterling and the united states dollar on september 24, 2018 (the closing date of the uk bilateral facility)), net of upfront fees, were used to repay borrowings under the revolving credit facility. the uk bilateral facility is secured by certain properties in the united kingdom. imi and its direct and indirect 100% owned united states subsidiaries that represent the substantial majority of its united states operations guarantee all the obligations under the uk bilateral facility. the uk bilateral facility is scheduled to mature on september 23, 2022, at which point all obligations become due. the uk bilateral facility contains an option to extend the maturity date for an additional year, subject to the conditions specified in the uk bilateral facility, including the lender's consent. the uk bilateral facility bears interest at libor plus 2.25%. the interest rate in effect under the uk bilateral facility as of december 31, 2019 was 3.1%.
e.    accounts receivable securitization program in march 2015, we entered into a $250.0 million accounts receivable securitization program (the "accounts receivable securitization program") involving several of our wholly owned subsidiaries and certain financial institutions. under the accounts receivable securitization program, certain of our subsidiaries sell substantially all of their united states accounts receivable balances to our wholly owned special purpose entities, iron mountain receivables qrs, llc and iron mountain receivables trs, llc (the "accounts receivable securitization special purpose subsidiaries"). the accounts receivable securitization special purpose subsidiaries use the accounts receivable balances to collateralize loans obtained from certain financial institutions. the accounts receivable securitization special purpose subsidiaries are consolidated subsidiaries of imi. imim retains the responsibility of servicing the accounts receivable balances pledged as collateral for the accounts receivable securitization program and imi provides a performance guaranty. the maximum availability allowed is limited by eligible accounts receivable, as defined under the terms of the accounts receivable securitization program.
on july 31, 2017, we amended the accounts receivable securitization program to (i) increase the maximum amount available from $250.0 million to $275.0 million and (ii) to extend the maturity date from march 6, 2018 to july 30, 2020, at which point all obligations become due. as the accounts receivable securitization program matures on july 30, 2020, the amount outstanding under the accounts receivable securitization program is classified within the current portion of long-term debt in our consolidated balance sheet as of december 31, 2019. as of december 31, 2019, the maximum availability allowed and amount outstanding under the accounts receivable securitization program was $272.1 million. the interest rate in effect under the accounts receivable securitization program was 2.8% as of december 31, 2019. commitment fees at a rate of 40 basis points are charged on amounts made available but not borrowed under the accounts receivable securitization program.
f.    letters of credit as of december 31, 2019, we had outstanding letters of credit totaling $35.3 million, of which $4.9 million reduce our borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facility (as described above). the letters of credit expire at various dates between january 2020 and january 2033.
g.    debt covenants the credit agreement, our indentures and other agreements governing our indebtedness contain certain restrictive financial and operating covenants, including covenants that restrict our ability to complete acquisitions, pay cash dividends, incur indebtedness, make investments, sell assets and take certain other corporate actions. the covenants do not contain a rating trigger. therefore, a change in our debt rating would not trigger a default under the credit agreement, our indentures or other agreements governing our indebtedness. the credit agreement uses ebitdar-based calculations as the primary measures of financial performance, including leverage and fixed charge coverage ratios.
our leverage and fixed charge coverage ratios under the credit agreement as of december 31, 2019 and 2018, as well as our leverage ratio under our indentures as of december 31, 2019 and 2018 are as follows:
december 31, 2019         december 31, 2018   maximum/minimum allowable net total lease adjusted leverage ratio               5.7                       5.6              maximum allowable of 6.5
net secured debt lease adjusted leverage ratio        2.3                       2.6              maximum allowable of 4.0
bond leverage ratio (not lease adjusted)              5.9                       5.8              maximum allowable of 6.5-7.0(1)
(1)   the maximum allowable leverage ratio under our indentures for the gbp notes due 2025, the 4/% notes due 2027, the 51/4% notes and the 4/% notes due 2029 is 7.0, while the maximum allowable leverage ratio under the indentures pertaining to our remaining senior and senior subordinated notes is 6.5. in certain instances as provided in our indentures, we have the ability to incur additional indebtedness that would result in our bond leverage ratio exceeding the maximum allowable ratio under our indentures and still remain in compliance with the covenant.
noncompliance with these leverage and fixed charge coverage ratios would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and liquidity.
our ability to pay interest on or to refinance our indebtedness depends on our future performance, working capital levels and capital structure, which are subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors which may be beyond our control. there can be no assurance that we will generate sufficient cash flow from our operations or that future financings will be available on acceptable terms or in amounts sufficient to enable us to service or refinance our indebtedness or to make necessary capital expenditures.
derivative instruments in july 2019, we entered into forward-starting interest rate swap agreements to limit our exposure to changes in interest rates on a portion of our floating rate indebtedness once our current interest rate swaps expire in march 2022. the forward-starting interest rate swap agreements have $350.0 million in notional value, commence in march 2022 and expire in march 2024. under the swap agreements we will receive variable rate interest payments based upon one-month libor, in exchange for the payment of fixed interest rate payments at the rates specified in the interest rate swap agreements. we have designated these interest rate swap agreements as cash flow hedges.
in august 2019, we entered into cross-currency swap agreements to hedge the variability of exchange rate impacts between the united states dollar and the euro. under the terms of the cross-currency swap agreements we notionally exchanged approximately $110.0 million at an interest rate of 6.0% for approximately 99.1 million euros at a weighted average interest rate of approximately 3.65%. the cross-currency swap agreements, which expire in august 2023, are designated as a hedge of net investment against certain of our euro denominated subsidiaries and require an exchange of the notional amounts at maturity. we have designated these cross-currency swap agreements as net investment hedges.
see note 3 to notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for additional information on our derivative instruments.
equity financing in october 2017, we entered into the distribution agreement with the agents pursuant to which we may sell, from time to time, up to an aggregate sales price of $500.0 million of our common stock through the at the market (atm) equity program. sales of our common stock made pursuant to the distribution agreement may be made in negotiated transactions or transactions that are deemed to be "at the market" offerings as defined in rule 415 under the securities act, including sales made directly on the nyse, or sales made to or through a market maker other than on an exchange, or as otherwise agreed between the applicable agent and us. we intend to use the net proceeds from sales of our common stock pursuant to the at the market (atm) equity program for general corporate purposes, which may include acquisitions and investments, including acquisitions and investments in our global data center business, and repaying amounts outstanding from time to time under the revolving credit facility.
during the quarter and year ended december 31, 2019, there were no shares of common stock sold under the at the market (atm) equity program. as of december 31, 2019, the remaining aggregate sale price of shares of our common stock available for distribution under the at the market (atm) equity program was approximately $431.2 million.
see note 12 to notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for additional information regarding our equity financing.
acquisitions a.    acquisitions see note 6 to notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for information regarding our 2019 acquisitions.
on january 9, 2020, we acquired the remaining 75% equity interest in osg for cash consideration of 6,026 million russian rubles (or approximately $95.1 million, based upon the exchange rate between the russian ruble and the united states dollar on the closing date of the osg acquisition) (the "osg acquisition"). the osg acquisition will enable us to extend our global rim business in russia, ukraine, kazakhstan, belarus, and armenia. commencing on the date of the osg acquisition we will fully consolidate the results of osg within our consolidated financial statements.
b.    significant acquisition costs and capital expenditures included in significant acquisition costs are certain costs associated with the recall transaction and the iodc transaction. significant acquisition costs associated with the recall transaction and the iodc transaction and capital expenditures to integrate recall with our existing operations ("recall capital expenditures"), were $403.8 million, the substantial majority of which were incurred prior to the end of 2018.
the following table presents the cumulative amount of significant acquisition costs and recall capital expenditures incurred for the years ended december 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 and the cumulative amount incurred through december 31, 2019 (in thousands):
significant acquisition costs         $13,293               $50,665                 $84,901                               $327,817
recall capital expenditures             2,447                23,640                  31,441                                 75,984
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december 31, 2019 and the anticipated effect of these obligations on our liquidity in future years (in thousands):
(1)   excluded from our financing lease obligations is the potential obligation related to an agreement we entered into in the fourth quarter of 2019 to lease a facility in the united kingdom that is currently under construction. the exact terms of the lease will be determined upon the completion of building construction, which is expected to occur in late 2020. we expect the rent due in the first year of the lease to be approximately $5.0 million, and we expect the term of the lease to be approximately 25 years.
(2)   amounts include variable rate interest payments, which are calculated utilizing the applicable interest rates as of december 31, 2019; see note 4 to notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report.
(4)   purchase commitments include obligations for future construction costs associated with the expansion of our global data center business, which represent a significant amount of the purchase commitments due in less than one year.
(5)   the table above excludes $35.1 million in uncertain tax positions as we are unable to make reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement, if any, with the respective taxing authorities.
(6)   the table above excludes $67.7 million of redeemable noncontrolling interests, which represents the estimated redemption value of the redeemable noncontrolling interests. see note 2.v. to notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report. this table also excludes purchase commitments associated with acquisitions closed or expected to close in 2020.
we expect to meet our cash flow requirements for the next twelve months from cash generated from operations, cash on hand, borrowings under the credit agreement and other financings (including the issuance of equity under our at the market (atm) equity program). we expect to meet our long-term cash flow requirements using the same means described above. we are currently operating above our long-term targeted leverage ratio and expect our leverage ratio to reduce over time through effective capital allocation strategies and business growth.
off-balance sheet arrangements we have no off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in regulation s-k item 303(a)(4)(ii).
net operating losses at december 31, 2019, we have federal net operating loss carryforwards of $152.7 million available to reduce future federal taxable income, the majority of which expire from 2024 through 2037. of the $152.7 million, we expect to utilize $39.2 million and realize a federal tax benefit of $8.2 million. we can carry forward these net operating losses to the extent we do not utilize them in any given available year. we have state net operating loss carryforwards, which expire from 2020 through 2039, of which an insignificant state tax benefit is expected to be realized. we have assets for foreign net operating losses of $90.8 million, with various expiration dates (and in some cases no expiration date), subject to a valuation allowance of approximately 64%.
inflation certain of our expenses, such as wages and benefits, insurance, occupancy costs and equipment repair and replacement, are subject to normal inflationary pressures. although to date we have been able to offset inflationary cost increases with increased operating efficiencies, the negotiation of favorable long-term real estate leases and an ability to increase prices in our customer contracts (many of which contain provisions for inflationary price escalators), we can give no assurance that we will be able to offset any future inflationary cost increases through similar efficiencies, leases or increased storage rental or service charges.

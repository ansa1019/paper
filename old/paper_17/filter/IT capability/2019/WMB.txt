item 1a. risk factors forward-looking statements and cautionary statement for purposes of the "safe harbor" provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995
the reports, filings, and other public announcements of williams may contain or incorporate by reference statements that do not directly or exclusively relate to historical facts. such statements are "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of section 27a of the securities act of 1933, as amended (securities act) and section 21e of the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended. these forward-looking statements relate to anticipated financial performance, management's plans and objectives for future operations, business prospects, outcome of regulatory proceedings, market conditions, and other matters as discussed below. we make these forward-looking statements in reliance on the safe harbor protections provided under the private securities litigation reform act of 1995.
all statements, other than statements of historical facts, included in this report that address activities, events, or developments that we expect, believe or anticipate will exist or may occur in the future, are forward-looking statements. forward-looking statements can be identified by various forms of words such as "anticipates," "believes," "seeks," "could," "may," "should," "continues," "estimates," "expects," "forecasts," "intends," "might," "goals," "objectives," "targets," "planned," "potential," "projects," "scheduled," "will," "assumes," "guidance," "outlook," "in-service date," or other similar expressions. these forward-looking statements are based on management's beliefs and assumptions and on information currently available to management and include, among others, statements regarding:
•   future credit ratings of williams and its affiliates;
•   amounts and nature of future capital expenditures;
•   expected in-service dates for capital projects;
•   financial condition and liquidity;
•   seasonality of certain business components;
forward-looking statements are based on numerous assumptions, uncertainties, and risks that could cause future events or results to be materially different from those stated or implied in this report. many of the factors that will determine these results are beyond our ability to control or predict. specific factors that could cause actual results to differ from results contemplated by the forward-looking statements include, among others, the following:
•   availability of supplies, market demand, and volatility of prices;
•   the impact of existing and future laws and regulations, the regulatory environment, environmental liabilities, and litigation, as well as our ability to obtain necessary permits and approvals, and achieve favorable rate proceeding outcomes;
•   our exposure to the credit risk of our customers and counterparties;
•   our ability to acquire new businesses and assets and successfully integrate those operations and assets into existing businesses as well as successfully expand our facilities, and to consummate asset sales on acceptable terms;
•   whether we are able to successfully identify, evaluate, and timely execute our capital projects and investment opportunities;
•   the strength and financial resources of our competitors and the effects of competition;
•   the amount of cash distributions from and capital requirements of our investments and joint ventures in which we participate;
•   increasing scrutiny and changing expectations from stakeholders with respect to our environmental, social and governance practices;
•   the physical and financial risks associated with climate change;
•   risks associated with weather and natural phenomena, including climate conditions and physical damage to our facilities;
•   acts of terrorism, cybersecurity incidents, and related disruptions;
•   our costs and funding obligations for defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans;
•   changes in maintenance and construction costs, as well as our ability to obtain sufficient construction related inputs including skilled labor;
•   inflation, interest rates, and general economic conditions (including future disruptions and volatility in the global credit markets and the impact of these events on customers and suppliers);
•   risks related to financing, including restrictions stemming from debt agreements, future changes in credit ratings as determined by nationally recognized credit rating agencies, and the availability and cost of capital;
•   changes in the current geopolitical situation;
•   additional risks described in our filings with the securities and exchange commission.
in addition to causing our actual results to differ, the factors listed above and referred to below may cause our intentions to change from those statements of intention set forth in this report. such changes in our intentions may also cause our results to differ. we may change our intentions, at any time and without notice, based upon changes in such factors, our assumptions, or otherwise.
because forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, we caution that there are important factors, in addition to those listed above, that may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. these factors are described in the following section.
risk factors you should carefully consider the following risk factors in addition to the other information in this report. each of these factors could adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and, in some cases our reputation. the occurrence of any of such risks could also adversely affect the value of an investment in our securities.
risks related to our business the financial condition of our natural gas transportation and midstream businesses is dependent on the continued availability of natural gas supplies in the supply basins that we access and demand for those supplies in the markets we serve.
our ability to maintain and expand our natural gas transportation and midstream businesses depends on the level of drilling and production by third parties in our supply basins. production from existing wells and natural gas supply basins with access to our pipeline and gathering systems will naturally decline over time. the amount of natural gas reserves underlying these existing wells may also be less than anticipated, and the rate at which production from these reserves declines may be greater than anticipated. we do not obtain independent evaluations of natural gas reserves connected to our systems and processing facilities. accordingly, we do not have independent estimates of total reserves dedicated to our systems or the anticipated life of such reserves. in addition, low prices for natural gas, regulatory limitations, or the lack of available capital have, and may continue to, adversely affect the development and production of existing or additional natural gas reserves and the installation of gathering, storage, and pipeline transportation facilities. the import and export of natural gas supplies may also be affected by such conditions. low natural gas prices in one or more of our existing supply basins, whether caused by a lack of infrastructure or otherwise, could also result in depressed natural gas production in such basins and limit the supply of natural gas made available to us. the competition for natural gas supplies to serve other markets could also reduce the amount of natural gas supply for our customers. a failure to obtain access to sufficient natural gas supplies will adversely impact our ability to maximize the capacities of our gathering, transportation, and processing facilities.
demand for our services is dependent on the demand for gas in the markets we serve. alternative fuel sources such as electricity, coal, fuel oils, or nuclear energy, as well as technological advances and renewable sources of energy, could reduce demand for natural gas in our markets and have an adverse effect on our business.
a failure to obtain access to sufficient natural gas supplies or a reduction in demand for our services in the markets we serve could result in impairments of our assets and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.
prices for natural gas, ngls, oil, and other commodities, are volatile and this volatility has and could continue to adversely affect our financial results, cash flows, access to capital, and ability to maintain our existing businesses.
our revenues, operating results, future rate of growth, and the value of certain components of our businesses depend primarily upon the prices of natural gas, ngls, oil, or other commodities, and the differences between prices of these commodities and could be materially adversely affected by an extended period of low commodity prices, or a decline in commodity prices. price volatility has and could continue to impact both the amount we receive for our products and services and the volume of products and services we sell. prices affect the amount of cash flow available for capital expenditures and our ability to borrow money or raise additional capital. price volatility has and could continue to have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.
the markets for natural gas, ngls, oil, and other commodities are likely to continue to be volatile. wide fluctuations in prices might result from one or more factors beyond our control, including:
•   worldwide and domestic supplies of and demand for natural gas, ngls, oil, and related commodities;
•   the activities of the organization of petroleum exporting countries;
•   the price and availability of other types of fuels or feedstocks;
•   the availability of pipeline capacity;
•   the price and quantity of foreign imports and domestic exports of natural gas and oil;
•   the credit of participants in the markets where products are bought and sold.
we are exposed to the credit risk of our customers and counterparties, and our credit risk management will not be able to completely eliminate such risk.
we are subject to the risk of loss resulting from nonpayment and/or nonperformance by our customers and counterparties in the ordinary course of our business. generally, our customers are rated investment grade, are otherwise considered creditworthy, are required to make prepayments or provide security to satisfy credit concerns or are dependent upon us, in some cases without a readily available alternative, to provide necessary services. however, our credit procedures and policies cannot completely eliminate customer and counterparty credit risk. our customers and counterparties include industrial customers, local distribution companies, natural gas producers, and marketers whose creditworthiness may be suddenly and disparately impacted by, among other factors, commodity price volatility, deteriorating energy market conditions, and public and regulatory opposition to energy producing activities. in a low commodity price environment certain of our customers have been or could be negatively impacted, causing them significant economic stress resulting, in some cases, in a customer bankruptcy filing or an effort to renegotiate our contracts. to the extent one or more of our key customers commences bankruptcy proceedings, our contracts with the customers may be subject to rejection under applicable provisions of the united states bankruptcy code or, if we so agree, may be renegotiated. further, during any such bankruptcy proceeding, prior to assumption, rejection or renegotiation of such contracts, the bankruptcy court may temporarily authorize the payment of value for our services less than contractually required, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. if we fail to adequately assess the creditworthiness of existing or future customers and counterparties or otherwise do not take or are unable to take sufficient mitigating actions, including obtaining sufficient collateral, deterioration in their creditworthiness, and any resulting increase in nonpayment and/or nonperformance by them could cause us to write down or write off accounts receivable. such write-downs or write-offs could negatively affect our operating results in the periods in which they occur, and, if significant, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.
we face opposition to operation and expansion of our pipelines and facilities from various individuals and groups.
we have experienced, and we anticipate that we will continue to face, opposition to the operation and expansion of our pipelines and facilities from governmental officials, environmental groups, landowners, tribal groups, local groups and other advocates. in some instances, we encounter opposition which disfavors hydrocarbon-based energy supplies regardless of practical implementation or financial considerations. opposition to our operation and expansion can take many forms, including the delay or denial of required governmental permits, organized protests, attempts to block or sabotage our operations, intervention in regulatory or administrative proceedings involving our assets, or lawsuits or other actions designed to prevent, disrupt or delay the operation or expansion of our assets and business. in addition, acts of sabotage or eco-terrorism could cause significant damage or injury to people, property or the environment or lead to extended interruptions of our operations. any such event that delays or prevents the expansion of our business, that interrupts the revenues generated by our operations, or which causes us to make significant expenditures not covered by insurance, could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
as part of our growth strategy, we consider acquisition opportunities and engage in significant capital projects. we have both a project lifecycle process and an investment evaluation process. these are processes we use to identify, evaluate, and execute on acquisition opportunities and capital projects. we may not always have sufficient and accurate information to identify and value potential opportunities and risks or our investment evaluation process may be incomplete or flawed. regarding potential acquisitions, suitable acquisition candidates or assets may not be available on terms and conditions we find acceptable or, where multiple parties are trying to acquire an acquisition candidate or assets, we may not be chosen as the acquirer. if we are able to acquire a targeted business, we may not be able to successfully integrate the acquired businesses and realize anticipated benefits in a timely manner.
our growth may also be dependent upon the construction of new natural gas gathering, transportation, compression, processing or treating pipelines, and facilities, ngl transportation, or fractionation or storage facilities as well as the expansion of existing facilities. additional risks associated with construction may include the inability to obtain rights-of-way, skilled labor, equipment, materials, and other required inputs in a timely manner such that projects are completed, on time or at all, and the risk that construction cost overruns could cause total project costs to exceed budgeted costs. additional risks associated with growing our business include, among others, that:
•   we could be required to contribute additional capital to support acquired businesses or assets;
•   we may assume liabilities that were not disclosed to us, that exceed our estimates and for which contractual protections are either unavailable or prove inadequate;
•   acquisitions could disrupt our ongoing business, distract management, divert financial and operational resources from existing operations and make it difficult to maintain our current business standards, controls, and procedures;
•   acquisitions and capital projects may require substantial new capital, including proceeds from the issuance of debt or equity, and we may not be able to access capital markets or obtain acceptable terms.
if realized, any of these risks could have an adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations, including the possible impairment of our assets, or cash flows.
our industry is highly competitive and increased competitive pressure could adversely affect our business and operating results.
we have numerous competitors in all aspects of our businesses, and additional competitors may enter our markets. any current or future competitor that delivers natural gas, ngls, or other commodities into the areas that we operate could offer transportation services that are more desirable to shippers than those we provide because of price, location, facilities or other factors. in addition, current or potential competitors may make strategic acquisitions or have greater financial resources than we do, which could affect our ability to make strategic investments or acquisitions. our competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new laws or regulations or emerging technologies or to devote greater resources to the construction, expansion, or refurbishment of their facilities than we can. failure to successfully compete against current and future competitors could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.
we do not own 100 percent of the equity interests of certain subsidiaries, including the partially owned entities, which may limit our ability to operate and control these subsidiaries. certain operations, including the partially owned entities, are conducted through arrangements that may limit our ability to operate and control these operations.
the operations of our current non-wholly-owned subsidiaries, including the partially owned entities, are conducted in accordance with their organizational documents. we anticipate that we will enter into more such arrangements, including through new joint venture structures or new partially owned entities. we may have limited operational flexibility in such current and future arrangements and we may not be able to control the timing or amount of cash distributions received. in certain cases:
•   we cannot control the amount of capital expenditures that we are required to fund and we are dependent on third parties to fund their required share of capital expenditures;
•   we may be subject to restrictions or limitations on our ability to sell or transfer our interests in the jointly owned assets;
•   we have limited ability to influence or control certain day to day activities affecting the operations;
•   we may have additional obligations, such as required capital contributions, that are important to the success of the operations.
in addition, conflicts of interest may arise between us, on the one hand, and other interest owners, on the other hand. if such conflicts of interest arise, we may not have the ability to control the outcome with respect to the matter in question. disputes between us and other interest owners may also result in delays, litigation or operational impasses.
the risks described above or the failure to continue such arrangements could adversely affect our ability to conduct the operations that are the subject of such arrangements which could, in turn, negatively affect our business, growth strategy, financial condition and results of operations.
we may not be able to replace, extend, or add additional customer contracts or contracted volumes on favorable terms, or at all, which could affect our financial condition, the amount of cash available to pay dividends, and our ability to grow.
we rely on a limited number of customers and producers for a significant portion of our revenues and supply of natural gas and ngls. although many of our customers and suppliers are subject to long-term contracts, if we are unable to replace or extend such contracts, add additional customers, or otherwise increase the contracted volumes of natural gas provided to us by current producers, in each case on favorable terms, if at all, our financial condition, growth plans, and the amount of cash available to pay dividends could be adversely affected. our ability to replace, extend, or add additional customer or supplier contracts, or increase contracted volumes of natural gas from current producers, on favorable terms, or at all, is subject to a number of factors, some of which are beyond our control, including:
•   the level of existing and new competition in our businesses or from alternative sources, such as electricity, renewable resources, coal, fuel oils, or nuclear energy;
•   natural gas and ngl prices, demand, availability, and margins in our markets. higher prices for energy commodities related to our businesses could result in a decline in the demand for those commodities and, therefore, in customer contracts or throughput on our pipeline systems. also, lower energy commodity prices could negatively impact our ability to maintain or achieve favorable contractual terms, including pricing, and could also result in a decline in the production of energy commodities resulting in reduced customer contracts, supply contracts, and throughput on our pipeline systems;
•   general economic, financial markets, and industry conditions;
•   our ability to understand our customers' expectations, efficiently and reliably deliver high quality services and effectively manage customer relationships. the results of these efforts will impact our reputation and positioning in the market.
our gas pipelines provide some services pursuant to long-term, fixed-price contracts. it is possible that costs to perform services under such contracts will exceed the revenues our pipelines collect for their services. although most of the services are priced at cost-based rates that are subject to adjustment in rate cases, under ferc policy, a regulated service provider and a customer may mutually agree to sign a contract for service at a "negotiated rate" that may be above or below the ferc regulated cost-based rate for that service. these "negotiated rate" contracts are not generally subject to adjustment for increased costs that could be produced by inflation or other factors relating to the specific facilities being used to perform the services.
some of our businesses are exposed to supplier concentration risks arising from dependence on a single or a limited number of suppliers.
some of our businesses may be dependent on a small number of suppliers for delivery of critical goods or services. if a supplier on which one of our businesses depends were to fail to timely supply required goods and services, such business may not be able to replace such goods and services in a timely manner or otherwise on favorable terms or at all. if our business is unable to adequately diversify or otherwise mitigate such supplier concentration risks and such risks were realized, such businesses could be subject to reduced revenues and increased expenses, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operation, and cash flows.
failure of our service providers or disruptions to our outsourcing relationships might negatively impact our ability to conduct our business.
certain of our accounting and information technology services are currently provided by third-party vendors, and sometimes from service centers outside of the united states. services provided pursuant to these agreements could be disrupted. similarly, the expiration of such agreements or the transition of services between providers could lead to loss of institutional knowledge or service disruptions. our reliance on others as service providers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.
an impairment of our assets, including property, plant, and equipment, intangible assets, and/or equity-method investments, could reduce our earnings.
gaap requires us to test certain assets for impairment on either an annual basis or when events or circumstances occur which indicate that the carrying value of such assets might be impaired. the outcome of such testing could result in impairments of our assets including our property, plant, and equipment, intangible assets, and/or equity-method investments. additionally, any asset monetizations could result in impairments if any assets are sold or otherwise exchanged for amounts less than their carrying value. if we determine that an impairment has occurred, we would be required to take an immediate noncash charge to earnings.
increasing scrutiny and changing expectations from stakeholders with respect to our environmental, social and governance practices may impose additional costs on us or expose us to new or additional risks.
companies across all industries are facing increasing scrutiny from stakeholders related to their environmental, social and governance ("esg") practices. investor advocacy groups, certain institutional investors, investment funds and other influential investors are also increasingly focused on esg practices and in recent years have placed increasing importance on the implications and social cost of their investments. regardless of the industry, investors' increased focus and activism related to esg and similar matters may hinder access to capital, as investors may decide to reallocate capital or to not commit capital as a result of their assessment of a company's esg practices. companies which do not adapt to or comply with investor or stakeholder expectations and standards, which are evolving, or which are perceived to have not responded appropriately to the growing concern for esg issues, regardless of whether there is a legal requirement to do so, may suffer from reputational damage and the business, financial condition, and/or stock price of such a company could be materially and adversely affected.
we face pressures from our stockholders, who are increasingly focused on climate change, to prioritize sustainable energy practices, reduce our carbon footprint and promote sustainability. our stockholders may require us to implement esg procedures or standards in order to remain invested in us or before they may make further investments in us. additionally, we may face reputational challenges in the event our esg procedures or standards do not meet the standards set by certain constituencies. we have adopted certain practices as highlighted in our 2018 sustainability report, including with respect to air emissions, biodiversity and land use, climate change and environmental stewardship. it is possible, however, that our stockholders might not be satisfied with our sustainability efforts or the speed of their adoption. if we do not meet our stockholders' expectations, our business, ability to access capital, and/or our stock price could be harmed.
additionally, adverse effects upon the oil and gas industry related to the worldwide social and political environment, including uncertainty or instability resulting from climate change, changes in political leadership and environmental policies, changes in geopolitical-social views toward fossil fuels and renewable energy, concern about the environmental impact of climate change and investors' expectations regarding esg matters, may also adversely affect demand for our services. any long-term material adverse effect on the oil and gas industry could have a significant financial and operational adverse impact on our business.
the occurrence of any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on the price of our stock and our business and financial condition.
we may be subject to physical and financial risks associated with climate change.
the threat of global climate change may create physical and financial risks to our business. energy needs vary with weather conditions. to the extent weather conditions may be affected by climate change, energy use could increase or decrease depending on the duration and magnitude of any changes. increased energy use due to weather changes may require us to invest in more pipelines and other infrastructure to serve increased demand. a decrease in energy use due to weather changes may affect our financial condition through decreased revenues. extreme weather conditions in general require more system backup, adding to costs, and can contribute to increased system stresses, including service interruptions. weather conditions outside of our operating territory could also have an impact on our revenues. to the extent the frequency of extreme weather events increases, this could increase our cost of providing service. we may not be able to pass on the higher costs to our customers or recover all costs related to mitigating these physical risks.
additionally, many climate models indicate that global warming is likely to result in rising sea levels and increased frequency and severity of weather events, which may lead to higher insurance costs, or a decrease in available coverage, for our assets in areas subject to severe weather. these climate-related changes could damage our physical assets, especially operations located in low-lying areas near coasts and river banks, and facilities situated in hurricane-prone and rain-susceptible regions.
to the extent financial markets view climate change and greenhouse gas ("ghg") emissions as a financial risk, this could negatively impact our cost of and access to capital. climate change and ghg regulation could also reduce demand for our services. our business could also be affected by the potential for lawsuits against ghg emitters, based on links drawn between ghg emissions and climate change.
there are operational risks associated with the gathering, transporting, storage, processing, and treating of natural gas, the fractionation, transportation, and storage of ngls, and crude oil transportation and production handling, including:
•   damage caused by third-party activity, such as operation of construction equipment;
•   security risks, including cybersecurity;
any of these risks could result in loss of human life, personal injuries, significant damage to property, environmental pollution, impairment of our operations, loss of services to our customers, reputational damage, and substantial losses to us. the location of certain segments of our facilities in or near populated areas, including residential areas, commercial business centers, and industrial sites, could increase the level of damages resulting from these risks. an event such as those described above could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations, particularly if the event is not fully covered by insurance.
we do not insure against all potential risks and losses and could be seriously harmed by unexpected liabilities or by the inability of our insurers to satisfy our claims.
in accordance with customary industry practice, we maintain insurance against some, but not all, risks and losses, and only at levels we believe to be appropriate. the occurrence of any risks not fully covered by our insurance could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows and our ability to repay our debt.
our assets and operations, especially those located offshore, and our customers' assets and operations can be adversely affected by hurricanes, floods, earthquakes, landslides, tornadoes, fires, and other natural phenomena and weather conditions, including extreme or unseasonable temperatures, making it more difficult for us to realize the historic rates of return associated with our assets and operations. a significant disruption in our or our customers' operations or a significant liability for which we are not fully insured could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.
given the volatile nature of the commodities we transport, process, store, and sell, our assets and the assets of our customers and others in our industry may be targets of terrorist activities. a terrorist attack could create significant price volatility, disrupt our business, limit our access to capital markets, or cause significant harm to our operations, such as full or partial disruption to our ability to produce, process, transport, or distribute natural gas, ngls, or other commodities. acts of terrorism, as well as events occurring in response to or in connection with acts of terrorism, could cause environmental repercussions that could result in a significant decrease in revenues or significant reconstruction or remediation costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.
a breach of our information technology infrastructure, including a breach caused by a cybersecurity attack on us or third parties with whom we are interconnected, may interfere with the safe operation of our assets, result in the disclosure of personal or proprietary information, and harm our reputation.
we rely on our information technology infrastructure to process, transmit, and store electronic information, including information we use to safely operate our assets. our board of directors has oversight responsibility with regard to assessment of the major risks inherent in our business, including cybersecurity risks, and reviews management's efforts to address and mitigate such risks, including the establishment and implementation of policies to address cybersecurity threats. we have invested, and expect to continue to invest, significant time, manpower and capital in our information technology infrastructure. however, the age, operating systems, or condition of our current information technology infrastructure and software assets and our ability to maintain and upgrade such assets could affect our ability to resist cybersecurity threats. while we believe that we maintain appropriate information security policies, practices, and protocols, we regularly face cybersecurity and other security threats to our information technology infrastructure, which could include threats to our operational industrial control systems that are used to operate our pipelines, plants, and assets. we face unlawful attempts to gain access to our information technology infrastructure, including coordinated attacks from hackers, whether state-sponsored groups, "hacktivists", or private individuals. we face the threat of theft and misuse of sensitive data and information, including customer and employee information. we also face attempts to gain access to information related to our assets through attempts to obtain unauthorized access by targeting acts of deception against individuals with legitimate access to physical locations or information. we also are subject to cybersecurity risks arising from the fact that our business operations are interconnected with third parties, including third-party pipelines, other facilities and our contractors and vendors. in addition, the breach of certain business systems could affect our ability to correctly record, process and report financial information. breaches in our information technology infrastructure or physical facilities, or other disruptions including those arising from theft, vandalism, fraud, or unethical conduct, could result in damage to or destruction of our assets, unnecessary waste, safety incidents, damage to the environment, reputational damage, potential liability, the loss of contracts, the imposition of significant costs associated with remediation and litigation, heightened regulatory scrutiny, increased insurance costs, and a material adverse effect on our operations, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.
if third-party pipelines and other facilities interconnected to our pipelines and facilities become unavailable to transport natural gas and ngls or to treat natural gas, our revenues could be adversely affected.
we depend upon third-party pipelines and other facilities that provide delivery options to and from our pipelines and facilities for the benefit of our customers. because we do not own these third-party pipelines or other facilities, their continuing operation is not within our control. if these pipelines or facilities were to become temporarily or permanently unavailable for any reason, or if throughput were reduced because of testing, line repair, damage to pipelines or facilities, reduced operating pressures, lack of capacity, increased credit requirements or rates charged by such pipelines or facilities or other causes, we and our customers would have reduced capacity to transport, store or deliver natural gas or ngl products to end use markets or to receive deliveries of mixed ngls, thereby reducing our revenues. any temporary or permanent interruption at any key pipeline interconnect or in operations on third-party pipelines or facilities that would cause a material reduction in volumes transported on our pipelines or our gathering systems or processed, fractionated, treated, or stored at our facilities could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.
revenues from certain components of our business can have seasonal characteristics. in many parts of the country, demand for natural gas and other fuels peaks during the winter. as a result, our overall operating results in the future might fluctuate substantially on a seasonal basis. demand for natural gas and other fuels could vary significantly from our expectations depending on the nature and location of our facilities and pipeline systems and the terms of our natural gas transportation arrangements relative to demand created by unusual weather patterns.
we do not own all of the land on which our pipelines and facilities are located, which could disrupt our operations.
we do not own all of the land on which our pipelines and facilities have been constructed. as such, we are subject to the possibility of increased costs to retain necessary land use. in those instances in which we do not own the land on which our facilities are located, we obtain the rights to construct and operate our pipelines and gathering systems on land owned by third parties and governmental agencies for a specific period of time. in addition, some of our facilities cross native american lands pursuant to rights-of-way of limited terms. we may not have the right of eminent domain over land owned by native american tribes. our loss of these rights, through our inability to renew right-of-way contracts or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.
we were the target of a proxy contest from a stockholder activist, which resulted in our incurring significant costs. if stockholder activists were to again take or threaten to take actions against the company or seek to involve themselves in the governance, strategic direction or operations of the company, we could incur significant costs as well as the distraction of management, which could have an adverse effect on our business or financial results. in addition, actions of activist stockholders may cause significant fluctuations in our stock price based on temporary or speculative market perceptions or other factors that do not necessarily reflect the underlying fundamentals and prospects of our business.
our costs and funding obligations for our defined benefit pension plans and costs for our other postretirement benefit plans are affected by factors beyond our control.
we have defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans. the timing and amount of our funding requirements under the defined benefit pension plans depend upon a number of factors that we control, including changes to pension plan benefits, as well as factors outside of our control, such as asset returns, interest rates, and changes in pension laws. changes to these and other factors that can significantly increase our funding requirements could have a significant adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
events such as an aging workforce without appropriate replacements, mismatch of skill sets to future needs, the challenges of attracting new, qualified workers to the midstream energy industry, or unavailability of contract labor may lead to operating challenges such as lack of resources, loss of knowledge, and a lengthy time period associated with skill development, including with the workforce needs associated with projects and ongoing operations. failure to hire and adequately obtain replacement employees, including the ability to transfer significant internal historical knowledge and expertise to the new employees, or the future availability and cost of contract labor may adversely affect our ability to manage and operate the businesses. if we are unable to successfully attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce, results of operations could be negatively impacted.
•   the amount of cash we generate from our operations, our working capital needs, our level of capital expenditures, and our ability to borrow;
•   the restrictions contained in our indentures and credit facility and our debt service requirements;
•   the cost of acquisitions, if any.
a failure either to pay dividends or to pay dividends at expected levels could result in a loss of investor confidence, reputational damage, and a decrease in the value of our stock price.
if there is a determination that the spin-off of wpx energy, inc. (wpx) stock to our stockholders is taxable for u.s. federal income tax purposes because the facts, representations or undertakings underlying a u.s. internal revenue service private letter ruling or a tax opinion are incorrect or for any other reason, then we and our stockholders could incur significant income tax liabilities.
in connection with our original separation plan that called for an initial public offering (ipo) of stock of wpx and a subsequent spin-off of our remaining shares of wpx to our stockholders, we obtained a private letter ruling from the irs and an opinion of our outside tax advisor, to the effect that the distribution by us of wpx shares to our stockholders, and any related restructuring transaction undertaken by us, would not result in recognition for u.s. federal income tax purposes, of income, gain or loss to us or our stockholders under section 355 and section 368(a)(1)(d) of the u.s. internal revenue code of 1986, as amended (code), except for cash payments made to our stockholders in lieu of fractional shares of wpx common stock. in addition, we received an opinion from our outside tax advisor to the effect that the spin-off pursuant to our revised separation plan which was ultimately consummated on december 31, 2011, which did not involve an ipo of wpx shares, would not result in the recognition, for federal income tax purposes, of income, gain, or loss to us or our stockholders under section 355 and section 368(a)(1)(d) of the code, except for cash payments made to our stockholders in lieu of fractional shares of wpx. the private letter ruling and opinion have relied on or will rely on certain facts, representations, and undertakings from us and wpx regarding the past and future conduct of the companies' respective businesses and other matters. if any of these facts, representations, or undertakings are, or become, incorrect or are not otherwise satisfied, including as a result of certain significant changes in the stock ownership of us or wpx after the spin-off, or if the irs disagrees with any such facts and representations upon audit, we and our stockholders may not be able to rely on the private letter ruling or the opinion of our tax advisor and could be subject to significant income tax liabilities.
risks related to financing our business downgrades of our credit ratings, which are determined outside of our control by independent third parties, impact our liquidity, access to capital, and our costs of doing business.
downgrades of our credit ratings increase our cost of borrowing and could require us to provide collateral to our counterparties, negatively impacting our available liquidity. in addition, our ability to access capital markets could continue to be limited by the downgrading of our credit ratings.
credit rating agencies perform independent analysis when assigning credit ratings. this analysis includes a number of criteria such as, business composition, market, and operational risks, as well as various financial tests. credit rating agencies continue to review the criteria for industry sectors and various debt ratings and may make changes to those criteria from time to time. credit ratings are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the ratings agencies. as of the date of the filing of this report, we have been assigned an investment-grade credit rating by each of the three credit ratings agencies.
difficult conditions in the global financial markets and the economy in general could negatively affect our business and results of operations.
our businesses may be negatively impacted by adverse economic conditions or future disruptions in global financial markets. included among these potential negative impacts are industrial or economic contraction leading to reduced energy demand and lower prices for our products and services and increased difficulty in collecting amounts owed to us by our customers. if financing is not available when needed, or is available only on unfavorable terms, we may be unable to implement our business plans or otherwise take advantage of business opportunities or respond to competitive pressures. in addition, financial markets have periodically been affected by concerns over u.s. fiscal and monetary policies. these concerns, as well as actions taken by the u.s. federal government in response to these concerns, could significantly and adversely impact the global and u.s. economies and financial markets, which could negatively impact us in the manner described above.
restrictions in our debt agreements and the amount of our indebtedness may affect our future financial and operating flexibility.
the agreements governing our indebtedness contain covenants that restrict our and our material subsidiaries' ability to incur certain liens to support indebtedness and our ability to merge or consolidate or sell all or substantially all of our assets in certain circumstances. in addition, certain of our debt agreements contain various covenants that restrict or limit, among other things, our ability to make certain distributions during the continuation of an event of default, the ability of our subsidiaries to incur additional debt, and our, and our material subsidiaries', ability to enter into certain affiliate transactions and certain restrictive agreements. certain of our debt agreements also contain, and those we enter into in the future may contain, financial covenants, and other limitations with which we will need to comply.
•   make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness, which could in turn result in an event of default on such indebtedness;
•   impair our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, general corporate purposes, or other purposes;
•   diminish our ability to withstand a continued or future downturn in our business or the economy generally;
•   require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to debt service payments, thereby reducing the availability of cash for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, the payments of dividends, general corporate purposes, or other purposes;
•   limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate, including limiting our ability to expand or pursue our business activities and preventing us from engaging in certain transactions that might otherwise be considered beneficial to us.
our ability to comply with our debt covenants, to repay, extend, or refinance our existing debt obligations and to obtain future credit will depend primarily on our operating performance. our ability to refinance existing debt obligations or obtain future credit will also depend upon the current conditions in the credit markets and the availability of credit generally. if we are unable to comply with these covenants, meet our debt service obligations, or obtain future credit on favorable terms, or at all, we could be forced to restructure or refinance our indebtedness, seek additional equity capital or sell assets. we may be unable to obtain financing or sell assets on satisfactory terms, or at all.
our failure to comply with the covenants in the documents governing our indebtedness could result in events of default, which could render such indebtedness due and payable. we may not have sufficient liquidity to repay our indebtedness in such circumstances. in addition, cross-default or cross-acceleration provisions in our debt agreements could cause a default or acceleration to have a wider impact on our liquidity than might otherwise arise from a default or acceleration of a single debt instrument. for more information regarding our debt agreements, please read note 15 - debt and banking arrangements of notes to consolidated financial statements.
changes to interest rates or increases in interest rates could adversely impact our access to credit, share price, our ability to issue securities or incur debt for acquisitions or other purposes, and our ability to make cash dividends at our intended levels.
interest rates may increase in the future. as a result, interest rates on future credit facilities and debt offerings could be higher than current levels, causing our financing costs to increase accordingly. as with other yield-oriented securities, our share price will be impacted by the level of our dividends and implied dividend yield. the dividend yield is often used by investors to compare and rank yield-oriented securities for investment decision-making purposes. therefore, changes in interest rates, either positive or negative, may affect the yield requirements of investors who invest in our shares, and a rising interest rate environment could have an adverse impact on our share price and our ability to issue equity or incur debt for acquisitions or other purposes and to pay cash dividends at our intended levels.
our hedging activities might not be effective and could increase the volatility of our results.
in an effort to manage our financial exposure related to commodity price and market fluctuations, we have entered, and may in the future enter into contracts to hedge certain risks associated with our assets and operations. in these hedging activities, we have used, and may in the future use, fixed-price, forward, physical purchase, and sales contracts, futures, financial swaps, and option contracts traded in the over-the-counter markets or on exchanges. nevertheless, no single hedging arrangement can adequately address all risks present in a given contract. for example, a forward contract that would be effective in hedging commodity price volatility risks would not hedge the contract's counterparty credit or performance risk. therefore, unhedged risks will always continue to exist. while we attempt to manage counterparty credit risk within guidelines established by our credit policy, we may not be able to successfully manage all credit risk and as such, future cash flows and results of operations could be impacted by counterparty default.
public and regulatory scrutiny of the energy industry has resulted in the proposal and/or implementation of increased regulations. such scrutiny has also resulted in various inquiries, investigations, and court proceedings, including litigation of energy industry matters. both the shippers on our pipelines and regulators have rights to challenge the rates we charge under certain circumstances. any successful challenge could materially affect our results of operations.
certain inquiries, investigations, and court proceedings are ongoing. adverse effects may continue as a result of the uncertainty of ongoing inquiries, investigations, and court proceedings, or additional inquiries and proceedings by federal or state regulatory agencies or private plaintiffs. in addition, we cannot predict the outcome of any of these inquiries or whether these inquiries will lead to additional legal proceedings against us, civil or criminal fines and/or penalties, or other regulatory action, including legislation, which might be materially adverse to the operation of our business and our results of operations or increase our operating costs in other ways. current legal proceedings or other matters, including environmental matters, suits, regulatory appeals, and similar matters might result in adverse decisions against us which, among other outcomes, could result in the imposition of substantial penalties and fines and could damage our reputation. the result of such adverse decisions, either individually or in the aggregate, could be material and may not be covered fully or at all by insurance.
in addition, existing regulations, including those pertaining to financial assurances to be provided by our businesses in respect of potential asset decommissioning and abandonment activities, might be revised, reinterpreted, or otherwise enforced in a manner which differs from prior regulatory action. new laws and regulations, including those pertaining to oil and gas hedging and cash collateral requirements, might also be adopted or become applicable to us, our customers, or our business activities. if new laws or regulations are imposed relating to oil and gas extraction, or if additional or revised levels of reporting, regulation, or permitting moratoria are required or imposed, including those related to hydraulic fracturing, the volumes of natural gas and other products that we transport, gather, process, and treat could decline, our compliance costs could increase, and our results of operations could be adversely affected.
the natural gas sales, transportation, and storage operations of our gas pipelines are subject to regulation by the ferc, which could have an adverse impact on their ability to establish transportation and storage rates that would allow them to recover the full cost of operating their respective pipelines, including a reasonable rate of return.
in addition to regulation by other federal, state, and local regulatory authorities, interstate pipeline transportation and storage service is subject to regulation by the ferc. federal regulation extends to such matters as:
•   rates, operating terms, types of services, and conditions of service;
•   certification and construction of new interstate pipelines and storage facilities;
•   acquisition, extension, disposition, or abandonment of existing interstate pipelines and storage facilities;
•   relationships with affiliated companies who are involved in marketing functions of the natural gas business;
•   market manipulation in connection with interstate sales, purchases, or transportation of natural gas.
regulatory or administrative actions in these areas, including successful complaints or protests against the rates of the gas pipelines, can affect our business in many ways, including decreasing tariff rates and revenues, decreasing volumes in our pipelines, increasing our costs, and otherwise altering the profitability of our pipeline business.
our operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations, including laws and regulations relating to climate change and greenhouse gas emissions, which may expose us to significant costs, liabilities, and expenditures that could exceed our expectations.
our operations are subject to extensive federal, state, tribal, and local laws and regulations governing environmental protection, endangered and threatened species, the discharge of materials into the environment, and the security of industrial facilities. substantial costs, liabilities, delays, and other significant issues related to environmental laws and regulations are inherent in the gathering, transportation, storage, processing, and treating of natural gas, fractionation, transportation, and storage of ngls, and crude oil transportation and production handling as well as waste disposal practices and construction activities. failure to comply with these laws, regulations, and permits may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and/or criminal penalties, the imposition of remedial obligations, the imposition of stricter conditions on or revocation of permits, the issuance of injunctions limiting or preventing some or all of our operations, and delays or denials in granting permits.
joint and several, strict liability may be incurred without regard to fault under certain environmental laws and regulations, for the remediation of contaminated areas and in connection with spills or releases of materials associated with natural gas, oil, and wastes on, under or from our properties and facilities. private parties, including the owners of properties through which our pipeline and gathering systems pass and facilities where our wastes are taken for reclamation or disposal, may have the right to pursue legal actions to enforce compliance as well as to seek damages for noncompliance with environmental laws and regulations or for personal injury or property damage arising from our operations. some sites at which we operate are located near current or former third-party hydrocarbon storage and processing or oil and natural gas operations or facilities, and there is a risk that contamination has migrated from those sites to ours.
we are generally responsible for all liabilities associated with the environmental condition of our facilities and assets, whether acquired or developed, regardless of when the liabilities arose and whether they are known or unknown. in connection with certain acquisitions and divestitures, we could acquire, or be required to provide indemnification against, environmental liabilities that could expose us to material losses, which may not be covered by insurance. in addition, the steps we could be required to take to bring certain facilities into compliance could be prohibitively expensive, and we might be required to shut down, divest or alter the operation of those facilities, which might cause us to incur losses.
in addition, climate change regulations and the costs associated with the regulation of emissions of greenhouse gases have the potential to affect our business. regulatory actions by the environmental protection agency or the passage of new climate change laws or regulations could result in increased costs to operate and maintain our facilities, install new emission controls on our facilities, or administer and manage our ghg compliance program. we believe it is possible that future governmental legislation and/or regulation may require us either to limit ghg emissions associated with our operations or to purchase allowances for such emissions. however, we cannot predict precisely what form these future regulations might take, the stringency of any such regulations or when they might become effective. several legislative bills have been introduced in the united states congress that would require carbon dioxide emission reductions. previously considered proposals have included, among other things, limitations on the amount of ghgs that can be emitted (so called "caps") together with systems of permitted emissions allowances. these proposals could require us to reduce emissions or to purchase allowances for such emissions.
in addition to activities on the federal level, state and regional initiatives could also lead to the regulation of ghg emissions sooner than and/or independent of federal regulation. these regulations could be more stringent than any federal legislation that may be adopted. future legislation and/or regulation designed to reduce ghg emissions could make some of our activities uneconomic to maintain or operate. we continue to monitor legislative and regulatory developments in this area and otherwise take efforts to limit and reduce ghg emissions from our facilities. although the regulation of ghg emissions may have a material impact on our operations and rates, we believe it is premature to attempt to quantify the potential costs of the impacts.
if we are unable to recover or pass through a significant level of our costs related to complying with climate change regulatory requirements imposed on us, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general we are an energy infrastructure company focused on connecting north america's significant hydrocarbon resource plays to growing markets for natural gas and ngls through our gas pipeline and midstream business. our operations are located in the united states.
our interstate natural gas pipeline strategy is to create value by maximizing the utilization of our pipeline capacity by providing high quality, low cost transportation of natural gas to large and growing markets. our gas pipeline businesses' interstate transmission and storage activities are subject to regulation by the ferc and as such, our rates and charges for the transportation of natural gas in interstate commerce, and the extension, expansion or abandonment of jurisdictional facilities and accounting, among other things, are subject to regulation. the rates are established through the ferc's ratemaking process. changes in commodity prices and volumes transported have limited near-term impact on these revenues because the majority of cost of service is recovered through firm capacity reservation charges in transportation rates.
the ongoing strategy of our midstream operations is to safely and reliably operate large-scale midstream infrastructure where our assets can be fully utilized and drive low per-unit costs. we focus on consistently attracting new business by providing highly reliable service to our customers. these services include natural gas gathering, processing, treating, and compression, ngl fractionation and transportation, crude oil production handling and transportation, marketing services for ngl, crude oil and natural gas, as well as storage facilities.
as of december 31, 2019, our operations are presented within the following reportable segments: atlantic-gulf, northeast g&p, and west, consistent with the manner in which our chief operating decision maker evaluates performance and allocates resources. all remaining business activities as well as corporate activities are included in other. our reportable segments are comprised of the following businesses:
•   atlantic-gulf is comprised of our interstate natural gas pipeline, transco, and natural gas gathering and processing and crude oil production handling and transportation assets in the gulf coast region, including a 51 percent interest in gulfstar one (a consolidated variable interest entity), which is a proprietary floating production system, as well as a 50 percent equity-method investment in gulfstream, a 60 percent equity-method investment in discovery, and a 41 percent equity-method investment in constitution as of december 31, 2019.
•   northeast g&amp;p is comprised of our midstream gathering, processing, and fractionation businesses in the marcellus shale region primarily in pennsylvania, new york, and the utica shale region of eastern ohio, as well as a 65 percent interest in our northeast jv (a consolidated variable interest entity) which operates in west virginia, ohio, and pennsylvania, a 66 percent interest in cardinal (a consolidated variable interest entity) which operates in ohio, a 69 percent equity-method investment in laurel mountain, a 58 percent equity-method investment in caiman ii, and appalachia midstream services, llc, which owns equity-method investments with an approximate average 66 percent interest in multiple gas gathering systems in the marcellus shale (appalachia midstream investments).
•   west is comprised of our interstate natural gas pipeline, northwest pipeline, and our gas gathering, processing, and treating operations in the rocky mountain region of colorado and wyoming, the barnett shale region of north-central texas, the eagle ford shale region of south texas, the haynesville shale region of northwest louisiana, and the mid-continent region which includes the anadarko, arkoma, delaware, and permian basins. this segment also includes our ngl and natural gas marketing business, storage facilities, an undivided 50 percent interest in an ngl fractionator near conway, kansas, a 50 percent equity-method investment in oppl, a 50 percent equity-method investment in rmm, and a 15 percent equity-method investment in brazos permian ii. west also included our former natural gas gathering and processing assets in the four corners area of new mexico and colorado, which were sold during the fourth quarter of 2018 (see note 3 - acquisitions and divestitures of notes to consolidated financial statements), and our former 50 percent interest in jackalope (an equity-method investment following deconsolidation as of june 30, 2018), which was sold in april 2019, and our previously owned 50 percent equity-method investment in the delaware basin gas gathering system (dbjv) (see note 6 - investing activities of notes to consolidated financial statements).
•   other includes minor business activities that are not operating segments, as well as corporate operations. other also includes our previously owned operations, including an 88.5 percent undivided interest in an olefins production facility in geismar, louisiana, which was sold in july 2017 (see note 3 - acquisitions and divestitures of notes to consolidated financial statements), and a refinery grade propylene splitter in the gulf region, which was sold in june 2017.
unless indicated otherwise, the following discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition and liquidity relates to our current continuing operations and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in part ii, item 8 of this report. effective january 1, 2020, the composition of our reportable segments changed (see part i, item i business segments for further discussion).
•   a $431 million increase in service revenues primarily associated with transco expansion projects, the consolidation of ueom beginning march 2019, and growth in northeast g&amp;p volumes, partially offset by lower revenues from our barnett shale operations primarily associated with the reduced recognition of deferred revenue and the end of a contractual mvc period, as well as the absence of revenues from operations sold or deconsolidated during 2018;
•   a $484 million decrease to net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests primarily due to the wpz merger in the third quarter of 2018, as well as the noncontrolling interests' share of the 2019 constitution impairment.
•   a $266 million decrease in other investing income (loss) - net primarily due to the absence of 2018 gains on deconsolidations and 2019 impairments of equity-method investments, partially offset by a 2019 gain on the sale of our interest in jackalope;
•   $138 million of lower commodity margins;
•   $58 million lower allowance for equity funds used during construction (afudc);
acquisition of ueom as of december 31, 2018, we owned a 62 percent interest in ueom which we accounted for as an equity-method investment. on march 18, 2019, we signed and closed the acquisition of the remaining 38 percent interest in ueom. total consideration paid, including post-closing adjustments, was $741 million in cash funded through credit facility borrowings and cash on hand. as a result of acquiring this additional interest, we obtained control of and now consolidate ueom. (see note 3 - acquisitions and divestitures of notes to consolidated financial statements.)
northeast jv concurrent with the ueom acquisition, we executed an agreement whereby we contributed our consolidated interests in ueom and our ohio valley midstream business to a newly formed partnership. in june 2019, our partner invested approximately $1.33 billion for a 35 percent ownership interest, and we retained 65 percent ownership of, as well as operate and consolidate, the northeast jv business. (see note 3 - acquisitions and divestitures of notes to consolidated financial statements.)
sale of jackalope in april 2019, we sold our 50 percent equity-method interest in jackalope for $485 million in cash, resulting in a gain on the disposition of $122 million. (see note 6 - investing activities of notes to consolidated financial statements.)
constitution although constitution received a certificate of public convenience and necessity from the ferc to construct and operate the proposed pipeline and obtained, among other approvals, a waiver of the water quality certification under section 401 of the clean water act for the new york portion of the project, the members of constitution, following extensive evaluation and discussion, recently determined that the underlying risk-adjusted return for this greenfield pipeline project has diminished in such a way that further development is no longer supported. (see note 4 - variable interest entities of notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion.)
northeast g&p ohio river supply hub expansion we agreed to expand our services for certain customers to provide additional rich gas processing capacity in the marcellus and upper devonian shale in west virginia and pennsylvania. associated with these agreements, we have expanded the inlet processing capacity of our oak grove facility to 400 mmcf/d. we have also constructed a new ngl pipeline from moundsville to the harrison hub fractionation facility to provide an additional outlet for ngls. these expansions are supported by long-term, fee-based agreements and volumetric commitments.
susquehanna supply hub expansion in november 2019, we completed a 500 mmcf/d expansion of the gathering systems in the susquehanna supply hub to bring the capacity to approximately 4.3 bcf/d.
atlantic-gulf rivervale south to market in august 2018, we received approval from the ferc to expand transco's existing natural gas transmission system to provide incremental firm transportation capacity from the existing rivervale interconnection with tennessee gas pipeline on transco's north new jersey extension to other existing transco locations within new jersey. the project was placed into partial service in july 2019. the remaining portion of the project was placed into service in september 2019. the full project increased capacity by 190 mdth/d.
norphlet project in march 2016, we announced that we reached an agreement to provide deepwater gas gathering services to the appomattox development in the gulf of mexico. we completed modifications to install an alternate delivery route to our main pass 261 platform, as well as modifications to our onshore mobile bay processing facility. the project went in service early in july 2019, at which time we also purchased a 54-mile-long, 16-inch-diameter pipeline (the norphlet pipeline) for $200 million. this pipeline transports gas from the appomattox development to our main pass 261 platform.
gateway in december 2018, we received approval from the ferc to expand transco's existing natural gas transmission system to provide incremental firm transportation capacity from penneast pipeline company's proposed interconnection with transco's mainline south of station 205 in new jersey to other existing transco meter stations within new jersey. the project was placed into service in december 2019 and increased capacity by 65 mdth/d.
gulf connector in january 2019, the gulf connector project was placed into service. this project expanded transco's existing natural gas transmission system to provide incremental firm transportation capacity from station 65 in louisiana to delivery points in wharton and san patricio counties, texas. the project increased capacity by 475 mdth/d.
west north seattle lateral upgrade in july 2018, we received approval from the ferc to expand delivery capabilities on northwest pipeline's north seattle lateral. the project consists of the removal and replacement of approximately 5.9 miles of 8-inch diameter pipeline with new 20-inch diameter pipeline. the project was placed into service in november 2019. the project increased delivery capacity by approximately 159 mdth/d.
wamsutter expansion we have expanded our gathering and processing infrastructure in the wamsutter region of wyoming in order to meet our customers' production plans. we have completed construction of new compressor stations and modifications to our processing facilities, which were placed into service throughout 2019. the expansion added approximately 20 miles of gathering pipelines and approximately 15,000 horsepower of compression.
filing of rate case on august 31, 2018, transco filed a general rate case with the ferc for an overall increase in rates. in september 2018, with the exception of certain rates that reflected a rate decrease, the ferc accepted and suspended our general rate filing to be effective march 1, 2019, subject to refund and the outcome of a hearing. the specific rates that reflected a rate decrease were accepted, without suspension, to be effective october 1, 2018, as requested by transco, and were not subject to refund. in march 2019, the ferc accepted our motion to place the rates that were suspended by the september 2018 order into effect on march 1, 2019, subject to refund. in october 2019, we reached an agreement on the terms of a settlement with the participants that would resolve all issues in the rate case without the need for a hearing, and on december 31, 2019, we filed a formal stipulation and agreement with the ferc setting forth such terms of settlement. we anticipate ferc approval of the stipulation and agreement in the second quarter of 2020. as of december 31, 2019, we have provided a $189 million reserve for rate refunds related to increased rates collected since march 2019, which we believe is adequate for any refunds that may be required.
commodity prices ngl per-unit margins were approximately 44 percent lower in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily due to a 31 percent and a 44 percent decrease in per-unit non-ethane and ethane sales prices, respectively, slightly offset by an approximate 10 percent decrease in per-unit natural gas feedstock prices.
ngl margins are defined as ngl revenues less any applicable btu replacement cost, plant fuel, and third-party transportation and fractionation. per-unit ngl margins are calculated based on sales of our own equity volumes at the processing plants. our equity volumes include ngls where we own the rights to the value from ngls recovered at our plants under both "keep-whole" processing agreements, where we have the obligation to replace the lost heating value with natural gas, and "percent-of-liquids" agreements whereby we receive a portion of the extracted liquids with no obligation to replace the lost heating value.
the potential impact of commodity prices on our business is further discussed in the following company outlook.
company outlook our strategy is to provide large-scale energy infrastructure designed to maximize the opportunities created by the vast supply of natural gas and natural gas products that exists in the united states. we accomplish this by connecting the growing demand for cleaner fuels and feedstocks with our major positions in the premier natural gas and natural gas products supply basins. we continue to maintain a strong commitment to safety, environmental stewardship, operational excellence, and customer satisfaction. we believe that accomplishing these goals will position us to deliver safe and reliable service to our customers and an attractive return to our shareholders.
our business plan for 2020 includes a continued focus on earnings and cash flow growth, while continuing to improve leverage metrics and control operating costs. many of our producer customers are being impacted by extremely low natural gas and ngl prices, which are driving decreased drilling. we are responding by reducing the pace of our capital growth spending in our gathering and processing business and remaining committed to operating cost discipline.
in 2020, our operating results are expected to include increases from transco's recent expansion projects placed in-service and general rate settlement as previously discussed. we also expect an increase from a full year contribution from the norphlet project, partially offset by lower deferred revenue amortization from gulfstar, both in the eastern gulf region. northeast results are expected to increase from higher gathering and processing volumes.we expect decreases in the west primarily due to lower deferred revenue amortization in the barnett shale and lower revenues from our haynesville operations, partially offset by increased results from our dj basin and eagle ford operations. additionally, we expect our recently implemented organizational realignment will benefit our expenses.
our growth capital and investment expenditures in 2020 are expected to be in a range from $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion. growth capital spending in 2020 primarily includes transco expansions, all of which are fully contracted with firm transportation agreements, and our bluestem ngl pipeline project in the mid-continent region. in addition to growth capital and investment expenditures, we also remain committed to projects that maintain our assets for safe and reliable operations, as well as projects that meet legal, regulatory, and/or contractual commitments.
•   opposition to, and legal regulations affecting, our infrastructure projects, including the risk of delay or denial in permits and approvals needed for our projects;
•   counterparty credit and performance risk;
•   unexpected significant increases in capital expenditures or delays in capital project execution;
•   unexpected changes in customer drilling and production activities, which could negatively impact gathering and processing volumes;
•   lower than anticipated demand for natural gas and natural gas products which could result in lower than expected volumes, energy commodity prices, and margins;
•   physical damages to facilities, including damage to offshore facilities by named windstorms;
•   other risks set forth under part i, item 1a. risk factors in this report.
we seek to maintain a strong financial position and liquidity, as well as manage a diversified portfolio of energy infrastructure assets which continue to serve key growth markets and supply basins in the united states.
atlantic-gulf hillabee in february 2016, the ferc issued a certificate order for the initial phases of transco's hillabee expansion project. the project involves an expansion of transco's existing natural gas transmission system from station 85 in west central alabama to a new interconnection with the sabal trail pipeline in alabama. the project is being constructed in phases, and all of the project expansion capacity is dedicated to sabal trail pursuant to a capacity lease agreement. phase i was completed in 2017 and it increased capacity by 818 mdth/d. the in-service date of phase ii is planned for the second quarter of 2020, and together phases i and ii are expected to increase capacity by 1,025 mdth/d.
northeast supply enhancement in may 2019, we received approval from the ferc to expand transco's existing natural gas transmission system to provide incremental firm transportation capacity from station 195 in pennsylvania to the rockaway delivery lateral transfer point in new york. approvals required for the project from the new york state department of environmental conservation and the new jersey department of environmental protection remain pending, with each such agency having denied, without prejudice, transco's applications for such approvals. we have refiled our applications for those approvals and have addressed the technical issues identified by the agencies. we plan to place the project into service in the fall of 2021, assuming timely receipt of these remaining approvals. the project is expected to increase capacity by 400 mdth/d.
southeastern trail in october 2019, we received approval from the ferc to expand transco's existing natural gas transmission system to provide incremental firm transportation capacity from the pleasant valley interconnect with dominion's cove point pipeline in virginia to the station 65 pooling point in louisiana. we plan to place the project into service in late 2020. the project is expected to increase capacity by 296 mdth/d.
leidy south in july 2019, we filed an application with the ferc for approval of the project to expand transco's existing natural gas transmission system and also extend its system through a capacity lease with national fuel gas supply corporation that will enable us to provide incremental firm transportation from clermont, pennsylvania and from the zick interconnection on transco's leidy line to the river road regulating station in lancaster county, pennsylvania. we plan to place the project into service as early as the fourth quarter of 2021, assuming timely receipt of all necessary regulatory approvals. the project is expected to increase capacity by 582 mdth/d.
west project bluestem we are expanding our presence in the mid-continent region through building a 188-mile ngl pipeline from our fractionator near conway, kansas to an interconnect with a third-party ngl pipeline system in oklahoma, providing us with firm access to mt. belvieu pricing. as part of the project, the third-party intends to construct a 110-mile pipeline extension of their existing ngl pipeline system that will have an initial capacity of 120 mbbls/d. further, during the first quarter of 2019, we exercised an option to purchase a 20 percent equity interest in a mt. belvieu fractionation train developed by the third party. the pipeline and extension projects are expected to be placed into service during the first quarter of 2021.
critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions. we believe that the nature of these estimates and assumptions is material due to the subjectivity and judgment necessary, or the susceptibility of such matters to change, and the impact of these on our financial condition or results of operations.
pension and postretirement obligations we have employee benefit plans that include pension and other postretirement benefits. net periodic benefit cost and obligations for these plans are impacted by various estimates and assumptions. these estimates and assumptions include the expected long-term rates of return on plan assets, discount rates, cash balance interest crediting rate, and employee demographics, including retirement age and mortality. these assumptions are reviewed annually and adjustments are made as needed. the assumptions utilized to compute cost and the benefit obligations are shown in note 10 - employee benefit plans of notes to consolidated financial statements.
the following table presents the estimated increase (decrease) in net periodic benefit cost and obligations resulting from a one-percentage-point change in the specific assumption.
benefit cost                                                                   benefit obligation one-percentage-pointincrease                 one-percentage-pointdecrease      one-percentage-pointincrease             one-percentage-pointdecrease

cash balance interest crediting rate               12                                                        (10           )                         71                    (60                     )
other postretirement benefits:
our expected long-term rates of return on plan assets, as determined at the beginning of each fiscal year, are based on the average rate of return expected on the funds invested in the plans. we determine our long-term expected rates of return on plan assets using our expectations of capital market results, which include an analysis of historical results as well as forward-looking projections. these capital market expectations are based on a period of at least 10 years and take into account our investment strategy and mix of assets. we develop our expectations using input from our third-party independent investment consultant. the forward-looking capital market projections start with current conditions of interest rates, equity pricing, economic growth, and inflation and those are overlaid with forward looking projections of normal inflation, growth, and interest rates to determine expected returns. the capital market return projections for specific asset classes in the investment portfolio are then applied to the relative weightings of the asset classes in the investment portfolio. the resulting rates are an estimate of future results and, thus, likely to be different than actual results.
the discount rates are used to measure the benefit obligations of our pension and other postretirement benefit plans. the objective of the discount rates is to determine the amount, if invested at the december 31 measurement date in a portfolio of high-quality debt securities, that will provide the necessary cash flows when benefit payments are due. increases in the discount rates decrease the obligation and, generally, decrease the related cost. the discount rates for our pension and other postretirement benefit plans are determined separately based on an approach specific to our plans and their respective expected benefit cash flows as described in note 1 - general, description of business, basis of presentation, and summary of significant accounting policies and note 10 - employee benefit plans of notes to consolidated financial statements. our discount rate assumptions are impacted by changes in general economic and market conditions that affect interest rates on long-term, high-quality debt securities as well as by the duration of our plans' liabilities.
the cash balance interest crediting rate assumption represents the average long-term rate by which the pension plans' cash balance accounts are expected to grow. interest on the cash balance accounts is based on the 30-year u.s. treasury securities rate and is credited to the accounts quarterly. an increase in this rate causes the pension obligation and cost to increase.
equity-method investments we continue to monitor our equity-method investments for any indications that the carrying value may have experienced an other-than-temporary decline in value. when evidence of a loss in value has occurred, we compare our estimate of the fair value of the investment to the carrying value of the investment to determine whether an impairment has occurred. we generally estimate the fair value of our investments using an income approach where significant judgments and assumptions include expected future cash flows and the appropriate discount rate. we also utilize a form of market approach to estimate the fair value of our investments. during 2019, we recognized impairments totaling $186 million related to our equity-method investments. (see note 18 - fair value measurements, guarantees, and concentration of credit risk of notes to consolidated financial statements.)

service revenues increased primarily due to higher transportation fee revenues at transco associated with expansion projects placed in service in 2019 and 2018, as well as the impact of the consolidation of ueom, higher northeast volumes at the susquehanna supply hub and ohio valley midstream regions, and higher gathering rates and volumes at the utica shale region. these increases are partially offset by the absence of revenues associated with asset divestitures and deconsolidations during 2018, including our former four corners area operations, as well as lower revenue in the barnett shale associated with the end of a contractual mvc period and lower revenue at gulfstar primarily associated with producer operational issues.
service revenues - commodity consideration decreased due to lower ngl prices and lower volumes primarily due to the absence of our former four corners area operations. these revenues represent consideration we receive in the form of commodities as full or partial payment for processing services provided. most of these ngl volumes are sold within the month processed and therefore are offset in product costs below.
product sales decreased primarily due to lower ngl and natural gas prices associated with our marketing and equity ngl sales activities, lower volumes from our equity ngl sales primarily reflecting the absence of our former four corners area operations, and lower system management gas sales, partially offset by higher marketing volumes. marketing sales and system management gas sales are substantially offset in product costs.
product costs decreased primarily due to lower ngl and natural gas prices associated with our marketing and equity ngl production activities. this decrease also includes lower volumes acquired as commodity consideration for ngl processing services reflecting the absence of our former four corners area operations and lower system management gas purchases, partially offset by higher volumes for marketing activities.
processing commodity expenses decreased primarily due to lower production of equity ngls primarily related to ethane rejection and the absence of our former four corners area operations, and lower prices for natural gas purchases associated with our ngl production.
operating and maintenance expenses decreased primarily due to the absence of our former four corners area operations and lower contracted services at transco primarily due to the timing of required engine overhauls and integrity testing. these decreases are partially offset by the impact of the consolidation of ueom and by a $32 million charge for severance and related costs primarily associated with a voluntary separation program (vsp) in 2019.
selling, general, and administrative expenses decreased primarily due to the absences of a charitable contribution of preferred stock to the williams foundation, inc. (see note 16 - stockholders' equity of notes to consolidated financial statements) and fees associated with the wpz merger, partially offset by a $25 million charge for severance and related costs primarily associated with our 2019 vsp, and transaction expenses associated with the acquisition of ueom and the formation of the northeast jv.
impairment of certain assets includes 2019 impairments of our constitution development project, certain eagle ford shale gathering assets, and certain assets that may no longer be in use or are surplus in nature. asset impairments in 2018 included certain assets in the barnett shale region and certain idle pipelines (see note 18 - fair value measurements, guarantees, and concentration of credit risk of notes to consolidated financial statements).
gain on sale of certain assets and businesses includes gains recognized on the sales of our four corners area and our gulf coast pipeline systems in 2018 (see note 3 - acquisitions and divestitures of notes to consolidated financial statements).
the favorable change in other (income) expense - net within operating income (loss) includes net favorable changes to charges and credits to regulatory assets and liabilities, partially offset by the absence of a 2018 gain on asset retirement (see note 7 - other income and expenses of notes to consolidated financial statements).
the favorable change in operating income (loss) includes lower impairments of assets, an increase in service revenues primarily associated with transco projects placed in-service and higher volumes in the northeast region, the favorable impact of acquiring the additional interest of ueom, and higher transco rates and favorable changes in the amortization of regulatory assets and liabilities. the change is also impacted favorably by the absence of a charitable contribution of preferred stock to the williams foundation, inc., and the absence of fees associated with the wpz merger. these favorable changes were partially offset by the impact of asset divestitures and deconsolidations during 2018, including the related gains on sales. they were also partially offset by lower margins associated with our equity ngl production primarily associated with lower prices, higher depreciation expense associated with new assets placed in service, and charges for severance and related costs primarily associated with our vsp.
the unfavorable change in equity earnings (losses) is primarily due to 2019 losses from our brazos permian ii investment acquired in december 2018 of $14 million, the impact of the consolidation of ueom during the first quarter of 2019 which reduced equity earnings by $9 million, and a $7 million unfavorable impact related to the april 2019 sale of our jackalope investment. additionally, equity earnings at aux sable decreased $9 million related to lower rates reflecting lower ngl prices. these decreases are partially offset by improved results at our appalachia midstream investments of $20 million.
the unfavorable change in other investing income (loss) - net includes higher impairments of equity-method investments, the absence of 2018 gains on the deconsolidations of our delaware basin assets and jackalope, and a 2019 loss on the deconsolidation of constitution. these were partially offset by a 2019 gain on the disposition of jackalope (see note 6 - investing activities of notes to consolidated financial statements).
interest expense increased primarily due to an increase in financing obligations associated with transco's atlantic sunrise project and lower interest capitalized related to construction projects that have been placed into service. (see note 15 - debt and banking arrangements of notes to consolidated financial statements.)
the unfavorable change in other income (expense) - net below operating income (loss) is primarily due to a decrease in equity afudc associated with reduced capital expenditures on projects, partially offset by the absence of 2018 unfavorable settlement charges from our pension early payout program (see note 7 - other income and expenses of notes to consolidated financial statements).
provision (benefit) for income taxes changed unfavorably primarily due to higher pre-tax income attributable to the williams companies, inc, partially offset by the absence of a charge to establish a $105 million valuation allowance, recorded in 2018, on certain deferred tax assets that may not be realized following the wpz merger. see note 8 - provision (benefit) for income taxes of notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the effective tax rate compared to the federal statutory rate for both periods.
the favorable change in net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests is primarily due to our third- quarter 2018 acquisition of the publicly held interests in wpz associated with the wpz merger, the impairment of constitution project costs, and lower results at gulfstar.
service revenues increased primarily due to higher transportation fee revenues at transco associated with expansion projects placed in-service in 2017 and 2018, as well as higher gathering volumes at the susquehanna supply hub and ohio river supply hub. these increases were partially offset by an unfavorable change in the rate of deferred revenue recognition resulting from implementing accounting standards update 2014-09 "revenue from contracts with customers" (asc 606), reduced revenues from our four corners area operations that were sold in october 2018, a reduction of rates resulting from a northwest pipeline rate case settlement, and a decrease following the jackalope deconsolidation.
service revenues - commodity consideration increased as the result of implementing asc 606 using a modified retrospective approach, effective january 1, 2018. therefore, prior periods were not recast. these revenues represent consideration we receive in the form of commodities as full or partial payment for gathering and processing services provided. (see note 1 - general, description of business, basis of presentation, and summary of significant accounting policies of notes to consolidated financial statements.) most of these ngl volumes are sold within the month processed and therefore are offset in product costs below.
product sales increased primarily due to higher marketing sales and higher system management gas sales, which are offset in product costs, and higher sales from the production of our equity ngls, reflecting higher ngl prices. these increases are partially offset by the absence of $269 million in olefins sales associated with our former olefins operations in 2017.
the increase in product costs is primarily due to the impact of asc 606 in which costs reflected in this line item for 2018 include volumes acquired as commodity consideration for ngl processing services, as well as higher marketing and system management gas purchases. this increase is partially offset by the absence of $147 million of olefin feedstock purchases due to the sale of our former olefins operations, as well as the absence of natural gas purchases associated with the production of equity ngls, which are reported in processing commodity expenses in conjunction with the 2018 implementation of asc 606.
processing commodity expenses presents the natural gas purchases associated with the production of equity ngls as previously described in conjunction with the implementation of asc 606.
operating and maintenance expenses decreased primarily due to the absence of $80 million of costs associated with our former olefins and four corners area operations.
selling, general, and administrative expenses decreased primarily due to the absence of severance-related, organizational realignment, and financial repositioning costs incurred in 2017, $25 million in reduced costs associated with our former olefins and four corners area operations, and cost containment efforts. these decreases are partially offset by a charitable contribution of preferred stock to the williams companies foundation, inc. and fees associated with the wpz merger.
impairment of certain assets includes 2018 impairments on certain assets in the barnett shale region and certain idle pipelines and 2017 impairments associated with certain assets in the mid-continent, marcellus south, and houston ship channel areas (see note 18 - fair value measurements, guarantees, and concentration of credit risk of notes to consolidated financial statements).
gain on sale of certain assets and businesses includes gains recognized on the sales of our four corners area in october 2018, our gulf coast pipeline systems in december 2018 and our geismar interest in july 2017 (see note 3 - acquisitions and divestitures of notes to consolidated financial statements).
regulatory charges resulting from tax reform relates to the 2017 establishment of regulatory liabilities for the probable return to customers through future rates of the future decrease in income taxes payable associated with tax reform. (see note 1 - general, description of business, basis of presentation, and summary of significant accounting policies of notes to consolidated financial statements).
the favorable change in other (income) expense - net within operating income (loss) includes the benefit of establishing a regulatory asset associated with an increase in transco's estimated deferred state income tax rate following the wpz merger in 2018, substantially offset by the absence of gains from certain contract settlements and terminations in 2017, the absence of a gain on the sale of our rgp splitter in 2017, and 2018 charges establishing a regulatory liability associated with a decrease in northwest pipeline's estimated deferred state income tax rate following the wpz merger (see note 7 - other income and expenses of notes to consolidated financial statements).
operating income (loss) changed unfavorably primarily due to higher impairments of assets, lower gains on sales of assets and businesses, and the absence of operating income associated with our former olefins and four corners area operations, partially offset by the absence of regulatory charges resulting from tax reform, higher service revenues primarily from expansion projects, and higher ngl margins.
the unfavorable change in equity earnings (losses) is primarily due to a decrease in volumes at discovery, partially offset by improved results at our appalachia midstream investments and the deconsolidation of our jackalope interest, which is accounted for as an equity-method investment beginning in the second quarter of 2018.
other investing income (loss) - net includes a 2017 gain on disposition of our investments in dbjv and ranch westex jv llc, a 2018 impairment related to our investment in ueom, and 2018 gains on the deconsolidations of certain permian basin assets and of our interest in jackalope. (see note 6 - investing activities of notes to consolidated financial statements.)
interest expense increased primarily due to an increase in other financing obligations associated with transco's dalton and atlantic sunrise projects, as well as expense related to the deemed financing component of certain contract liabilities resulting from our implementation of asc 606 in 2018. this increase is partially offset by lower interest rates on our outstanding debt in 2018 and lower borrowings on our credit facilities in 2018.
other income (expense) - net below operating income (loss) changed favorably primarily due to a decrease in charges reducing regulatory assets related to deferred taxes on equity afudc resulting from tax reform, an increase in equity afudc, and a lower settlement charge from the pension early payout program. these favorable changes were partially offset by a decrease due to the absence of a net gain on early retirement of debt in 2017 and a loss on early retirement of debt in 2018. (see note 7 - other income and expenses of notes to consolidated financial statements.)
provision (benefit) for income taxes changed unfavorably primarily due to the absence of a $1.923 billion tax provision benefit associated with tax reform and releasing a $127 million valuation allowance in 2017. the unfavorable change also reflects a $105 million valuation allowance in 2018 associated with certain foreign tax credits. see note 8 - provision (benefit) for income taxes of notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the effective tax rate compared to the federal statutory rate for both periods.
the unfavorable change in net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests is primarily related to wpz, reflective of both our acquisition of the publicly held interests in wpz associated with the wpz merger and a fourth quarter 2017 net loss incurred by wpz, partially offset by lower operating results at gulfstar.
year-over-year operating results - segments we evaluate segment operating performance based upon modified ebitda. note 20 - segment disclosures of notes to consolidated financial statements includes a reconciliation of this non-gaap measure to net income (loss). management uses modified ebitda because it is an accepted financial indicator used by investors to compare company performance. in addition, management believes that this measure provides investors an enhanced perspective of the operating performance of our assets. modified ebitda should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for a measure of performance prepared in accordance with gaap.

atlantic-gulf modified ebitda decreased primarily due to the impairment of constitution, the absence of a 2018 gain on sale of certain assets and businesses , and higher other segment costs and expenses, partially offset by increased service revenues related to expansion projects placed into service during 2018 and 2019.
service revenues increased primarily due to a $403 million increase in transco's natural gas transportation revenues primarily driven by a $358 million increase related to expansion projects placed in service in 2018 and 2019, as well as higher revenue associated with transco's general rate case settlement and increased amounts for reimbursable power and storage expenses. partially offsetting these increases were lower fee revenues of $62 million primarily due to producer operational issues and lower deferred revenue amortization at gulfstar, as well as the sale of certain gulf coast pipeline assets in fourth-quarter 2018.
the net sum of service revenues - commodity consideration, product sales, product costs, and processing commodity expenses comprise our commodity margins. our commodity margins associated with our equity ngls decreased $16 million, consisting of a $26 million decrease associated with unfavorable net realized ngl sales prices, partially offset by a $10 million increase associated with higher sales volumes. the higher ngl volumes were primarily related to the absence of 2018 downtime to modify the mobile bay processing plant for the norphlet project. additionally, the decrease in product sales includes a $93 million decrease in commodity marketing sales due to lower ngl prices and volumes and a $39 million decrease in system management gas sales. marketing sales and system management gas sales are substantially offset in product costs and therefore have little impact to modified ebitda.
other segment costs and expenses increased primarily due a $56 million unfavorable change in equity afudc due to lower construction activity, a $32 million charge in 2019 for severance and related costs primarily associated with our 2019 vsp, a $21 million increase in reimbursable power and storage expenses, $16 million of expense in 2019 related to the reversal of expenditures previously capitalized, and the absence of a $12 million 2018 gain on asset retirements. these unfavorable changes were partially offset by $77 million of net favorable changes to charges and credits associated with regulatory assets and liabilities, which were significantly driven by the previously mentioned settlement in transco's general rate case, and a $46 million decrease in transco's contracted services compared to 2018 mainly due to the timing of required engine overhauls and integrity testing.
impairment of certain assets includes the 2019 impairment of our constitution development project (see note 18 - fair value measurements, guarantees, and concentration of credit risk of notes to consolidated financial statements).
gain on sale of certain assets and businesses  reflects an $81 million gain from the sale of our gulf coast pipeline system assets in fourth-quarter 2018 (see note 3 - acquisitions and divestitures of notes to consolidated financial statements).
atlantic-gulf modified ebitda increased primarily due to the absence of regulatory charges associated with the impact of tax reform at transco, higher service revenues, and a 2018 gain on the sale of certain assets; partially offset by lower proportional modified ebitda of equity-method investments.
service revenues increased primarily due to a $253 million increase in transco's natural gas transportation fee revenues primarily due to a $241 million increase associated with expansion projects placed in-service in 2017 and 2018.
service revenues - commodity consideration increased as a result of implementing asc 606 using a modified retrospective approach. these revenues represent consideration we received in the form of commodities as full or partial payment for gathering and processing services provided. most of these ngl volumes are sold within the month processed and therefore are offset in product costs below.
•   a $90 million decrease in commodity marketing sales driven by a $149 million decrease in crude oil sales as this activity is now presented on a net basis within product costs in conjunction with the adoption of asc 606, partially offset by a $59 million increase in ngl marketing sales primarily reflecting 20 percent higher non-ethane prices;
•   a $14 million decrease in sales associated with the production of our equity ngls, as further described below as part of our commodity margins;
•   a $57 million increase in system management gas sales. system management gas sales are offset in product costs and therefore have little impact to modified ebitda.
product costs slightly increased primarily due to a $59 million increase in system management gas purchases (substantially offset in product sales) and the impact of asc 606 in which costs reflected in this line item for 2018 include volumes acquired as commodity consideration for ngl processing services. this increase was partially offset by an $87 million decrease in marketing purchases (more than offset in product sales) and the absence of natural gas purchases associated with the production of equity ngls, which are now reported in processing commodity expenses in conjunction with the implementation of asc 606.
processing commodity expenses presents the natural gas purchases associated with the production of equity ngls as previously described in conjunction with the implementation of asc 606.
the net sum of service revenues - commodity consideration, product sales, product costs, and processing commodity expenses comprise our commodity margins.
other segment costs and expenses decreased primarily due to a $17 million increase in transco's equity afudc as a result of higher construction activity in 2018.
the decrease in regulatory charges resulting from tax reform reflects the absence of $493 million of regulatory charges in 2017 associated with the impact of tax reform at transco (see note 1 - general, description of business, basis of presentation, and summary of significant accounting policies of notes to consolidated financial statements).
the decrease in proportional modified ebitda of equity-method investments is due to an $89 million decrease at discovery, primarily related to a $76 million decrease associated with production ending on certain wells.

northeast g&p modified ebitda increased primarily due to higher service revenues due to increased gathering volumes, as well as the $38 million favorable impact of acquiring the additional interest of ueom, partially offset by 2019 impairments.
•   a $158 million increase associated with the consolidation of ueom, as previously discussed;
•   a $102 million increase associated with higher gathering revenues at susquehanna supply hub reflecting 18 percent higher gathering volumes due to increased production from customers and higher rates;
product sales decreased primarily due to lower non-ethane volumes and prices within our marketing activities. the changes in marketing revenues are offset by similar changes in marketing purchases, reflected above as product costs.
•   a $53 million increase associated with the consolidation of ueom;
•   a $10 million increase related to transaction expenses associated with the acquisition of ueom and the formation of the northeast jv;
•   a $7 million charge in 2019 for severance and related costs primarily associated with our vsp.
impairment of certain assets increased due to a $10 million write-down of other certain assets that may no longer be in use or are surplus in nature in 2019 (see note 18 - fair value measurements, guarantees, and concentration of credit risk of notes to consolidated financial statements).
proportional modified ebitda of equity-method investments decreased $59 million as a result of the consolidation of ueom and $10 million due to unfavorable rates reflecting lower ngl prices at aux sable. this decrease was partially offset by a $29 million increase at appalachia midstream investments, reflecting higher volumes due to increased customer production.
northeast g&p modified ebitda increased primarily due to the absence of impairment of certain assets in 2017, and higher service revenues and proportional modified ebitda of equity-method investments.
service revenues - commodity consideration increased as a result of implementing asc 606 using a modified retrospective approach. these revenues represent consideration we receive in the form of commodities as full or partial payment for gathering and processing services provided. most of these ngl volumes are sold within the month processed and therefore are offset in processing commodity expenses.
product sales decreased primarily due to $31 million lower marketing sales, driven by lower non-ethane volumes and prices. the changes in marketing sales are offset by similar changes in marketing purchases, reflected above as product costs. the decrease in product sales is partially offset by $21 million in higher system management gas sales. system management gas sales are offset in product costs and therefore have no impact on modified ebitda.
proportional modified ebitda of equity-method investments increased primarily due to a $33 million increase at appalachia midstream investments reflecting our increased ownership acquired in late first-quarter 2017 and higher volumes. improvements at aux sable and caiman ii also contributed to the increase.

west modified ebitda increased primarily due to lower impairment of certain assets and lower other segment costs and expenses, partially offset by a lower gain on sale of certain assets in 2019, lower service revenues, and lower commodity margins.
•   a $218 million decrease associated with asset divestitures and deconsolidations during 2018 and 2019, including our former four corners area assets, certain delaware basin assets that were contributed to our brazos permian ii equity-method investment, and our jackalope assets which were deconsolidated in second-quarter 2018 and subsequently sold in second-quarter 2019;
•   a $57 million decrease driven by lower deferred revenue amortization and mvc deficiency fee revenues in the barnett shale region primarily associated with the expiration of a certain mvc agreement;
•   a $15 million decrease associated with lower processing rates primarily driven by lower commodity pricing in the piceance region;
•   a $15 million decrease associated with lower gathering rates primarily in the mid-continent and haynesville shale regions;
•   an $8 million increase associated with the resolution of a prior period performance obligation.
the net sum of service revenues - commodity consideration, product sales, product costs, and processing commodity expenses comprise our commodity margins. our commodity margins associated with our equity ngls decreased $127 million primarily due to:
•   a $98 million decrease associated with lower sales volumes, consisting of $54 million related to the absence of our former four corners area assets and $44 million due to 12 percent lower non-ethane volumes and 33 percent lower ethane sales volumes primarily due to higher ethane rejection in 2019, natural declines, less producer drilling activity, and more severe weather conditions in first-quarter 2019;
•   a $66 million decrease associated with lower sales prices primarily due to 29 percent and 48 percent lower average net realized per-unit non-ethane and ethane sales prices, respectively;
•   a $37 million increase related to lower natural gas purchases associated with lower equity ngl production volumes and lower natural gas prices, including $9 million related to the absence of our former four corners area assets.
additionally, the decrease in product sales includes a $447 million decrease in marketing sales, which is due to lower sales prices, partially offset by higher sales volumes, and a $36 million decrease related to the sale of other products. these decreases are substantially offset in product costs. marketing margins increased by $27 million primarily due to favorable changes in prices.
other segment costs and expenses decreased primarily due to a $127 million reduction associated with the absences of our former four corners area assets and from the jackalope deconsolidation in second-quarter 2018, the absence of a 2018 unfavorable charge of $12 million for a regulatory liability associated with a decrease in northwest pipeline's estimated deferred state income tax rate following the wpz merger, $12 million favorable settlements in 2019, as well as $10 million lower ad valorem taxes. these decreases were partially offset by an unfavorable charge in 2019 for severance and related costs primarily associated with our vsp of $17 million.
impairment of certain assets decreased primarily due to the absence of the $1,849 million barnett impairment in 2018, partially offset by various 2019 impairments (see note 18 - fair value measurements, guarantees, and concentration of credit risk of notes to consolidated financial statements).
the decrease in gain on sale of certain assets and businesses reflects the absence of the gain from the sale of our four corners area assets recorded in the fourth quarter of 2018 (see note 3 - acquisitions and divestitures of notes to consolidated financial statements).
proportional modified ebitda of equity-method investments increased primarily due to the additions of the rmm and brazos permian ii equity-method investments in the second half of 2018, partially offset by the sale of our jackalope investment in second-quarter 2019.
west modified ebitda decreased primarily due to the increase in impairment of certain assets and lower service revenues. these decreases were partially offset by the  gain on sale of certain assets and businesses in 2018, the absence of regulatory charges associated with the impact of tax reform, and higher ngl margins driven by higher ngl prices and lower realized natural gas prices, partially offset by lower ngl volumes.
•   a $64 million decrease primarily associated with implementing the new revenue guidance under asc 606 including a $118 million decrease related to lower amortization of deferred revenue associated with the up-front cash payments received in conjunction with the fourth quarter 2016 barnett shale and mid-continent contract restructurings, partially offset by a $54 million increase related to other deferred revenue amortization primarily in the permian basin;
•   a $42 million decrease associated with the sale of our four corners area assets in october 2018;
•   a $30 million decrease at northwest pipeline primarily due to the reduction of its rates as a result of a rate case settlement that became effective january 1, 2018;
•   a $21 million increase associated with higher gathering and processing rates in the piceance region driven by higher ngl prices as well as higher average gathering and processing rates across most other areas, partially offset by lower contract rates primarily in the haynesville shale region.
service revenues - commodity consideration increased as a result of implementing asc 606 using a modified retrospective approach. these revenues represent consideration we receive in the form of commodities as full or partial payment for gathering and processing services provided. most of these ngl volumes are sold within the month processed and therefore are offset in product costs below.
•   a $373 million increase in marketing sales primarily due to increases in realized ngl prices including a 14 percent increase in average non-ethane per-unit sales prices and a 25 percent increase in ethane prices, in addition to a 15 percent increase in ethane volumes (more than offset by higher product costs);
•   a $47 million increase in sales associated with the production of our equity ngls, as further described below as part of our commodity margins;
•   an $18 million increase in system management gas sales due to a change in presentation in accordance with asc 606, which are more than offset in product costs and, therefore, have little impact on modified ebitda.
the increase in product costs includes the impact of asc 606 in which costs reflected in this line item for 2018 include volumes acquired as commodity consideration for ngl processing services, a $381 million increase in marketing purchases (substantially offset in product sales), a $19 million increase in system management gas purchases (substantially offset in product sales), partially offset by the absence of natural gas purchases associated with the production of equity ngls, which are now reported in processing commodity expenses in conjunction with the implementation of asc 606.
processing commodity expenses presents the natural gas purchases associated with the production of equity ngls as previously described in conjunction with the implementation of asc 606.
the net sum of service revenues - commodity consideration, product sales, product costs, and processing commodity expenses comprise our commodity margins. our commodity margins increased primarily due to a $40 million increase in ngl product margins partially offset by an $8 million decrease in marketing margins. ngl margins are driven by $56 million in higher ethane and non-ethane per-unit prices, reflecting 19 percent higher realized non-ethane per-unit sales prices and 50 percent higher realized ethane per-unit sales prices. these increases were partially offset by $18 million in lower volumes primarily due to the sale of our four corners area assets in october 2018.
other segment costs and expenses decreased primarily due to $57 million lower operating and maintenance and general and administrative costs. this reduction in costs is due primarily to the four corners area sale in october 2018, ongoing cost containment efforts, and the deconsolidation of our jackalope interest in second-quarter 2018. these reductions are partially offset by a $24 million regulatory charge associated with northwest pipeline's approved rates related to tax reform, the absence of a $15 million gain from contract settlements and terminations in 2017, and a $12
million charge for a regulatory liability associated with a decrease in northwest pipeline's estimated deferred state income tax rate following the wpz merger.
impairment of certain assets increased primarily due to the $1.849 billion impairment of certain assets in the barnett shale region in 2018, partially offset by the absence of a $1.019 billion impairment of certain gathering operations in the mid-continent region in 2017 (see note 18 - fair value measurements, guarantees, and concentration of credit risk of notes to consolidated financial statements).
regulatory charges resulting from tax reform decreased primarily due to the absence of the $220 million initial regulatory charge associated with the impact of tax reform at northwest pipeline in 2017 (see note 1 - general, description of business, basis of presentation, and summary of significant accounting policies of notes to consolidated financial statements).
proportional modified ebitda of equity-method investments increased primarily due to the deconsolidation of our jackalope interest, which is accounted for as an equity-method investment beginning in the second quarter of 2018.
other modified ebitda   $6                  $(29      )         $997
other modified ebitda increased primarily due to:
•   the absence of a $35 million charge in 2018 associated with a charitable contribution of preferred stock to the williams companies foundation, inc. (a not-for-profit corporation) (see note 16 - stockholders' equity of notes to consolidated financial statements);
•   the absence of $20 million in costs in 2018 associated with the wpz merger (see note 1 - general, description of business, basis of presentation, and summary of significant accounting policies of notes to consolidated financial statements);
•   an $8 million increase related to the absence of 2018 unfavorable modified ebitda associated with the results of certain of our former gulf coast area operations sold in 2018;
•   the absence of a $37 million benefit of establishing a regulatory asset associated with an increase in transco's estimated deferred state income tax rate following the wpz merger in 2018 and a subsequent unfavorable $12 million adjustment in the first quarter of 2019;
•   a $26 million decrease in income associated with a regulatory asset related to deferred taxes on equity funds used during construction;
•   the absence of a $20 million gain on the sale of certain assets and operations located in the gulf coast area in 2018 (see note 3 - acquisitions and divestitures of notes to consolidated financial statements).
modified ebitda changed unfavorably primarily due to:
•   the absence of a $1.095 billion gain on the sale of our geismar interest in 2017 (see note 3 - acquisitions and divestitures of notes to consolidated financial statements);
•   the absence of $54 million of modified ebitda associated with the results of our former geismar olefins and rgp splitter plants subsequent to their sale in july 2017;
•   a $35 million charge in 2018 associated with a charitable contribution of preferred stock to the williams companies foundation, inc. (a not-for-profit corporation), as previously mentioned;
•   a $26 million decrease in income associated with a regulatory asset related to deferred taxes on equity funds used during construction;
•   $20 million in costs in 2018 associated with the wpz merger, as previously mentioned;
•   the absence of a $12 million gain on the sale of the refinery grade propylene splitter in 2017 (see note 7 - other income and expenses of notes to consolidated financial statements).
•   the absence of a $68 million impairment for a certain ngl pipeline asset in the third quarter of 2017 and a$23 million impairment of an olefins pipeline project in the gulf coast region in the second quarter of 2017, partially offset by a $66 million impairment of certain idle pipelines in the second quarter of 2018 (see note 18 - fair value measurements, guarantees, and concentration of credit risk of notes to consolidated financial statements);
•   $40 million of lower costs, driven by the absence of expenses associated with severance and related costs, financial repositioning, and strategic alternative costs;
•   a $37 million increase associated with the benefit of establishing a regulatory asset associated with an increase in transco's estimated deferred state income tax rate following the wpz merger, as previously mentioned;
•   a $30 million favorable change in the settlement charge expense related to the program to pay out certain deferred vested pension benefits of employees associated with former operations (see note 10 - employee benefit plans of notes to consolidated financial statements);
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and liquidity overview as previously discussed, we have continued to focus on earnings and cash flow growth, while continuing to improve leverage metrics and control operating costs. in 2019, we acquired the remaining outstanding ownership interests in ueom for $728 million and subsequently formed a new partnership which includes ueom and our ohio valley midstream business. our partner purchased a 35 percent ownership interest in the partnership for $1.3 billion. also, during the second quarter of 2019 we sold our 50 percent ownership interest in jackalope for $485 million. see also the following table of sources (uses) of cash.
outlook as previously discussed in company outlook, our growth capital and investment expenditures in 2020 are currently expected to be in a range from $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion. growth capital spending in 2020 includes transco expansions, all of which are fully contracted with firm transportation agreements, and our bluestem ngl pipeline project in the mid-continent region. in addition to growth capital and investment expenditures, we also remain committed to projects that maintain our assets for safe and reliable operations, as well as projects that meet legal, regulatory, and/or contractual commitments. we intend to fund substantially all of our planned 2020 capital spending with cash available after paying dividends. we retain the flexibility to adjust planned levels of growth capital and investment expenditures in response to changes in economic conditions or business opportunities.
as of december 31, 2019, we have $2.121 billion of long-term debt maturing in 2020. our potential sources of liquidity available to address these maturities include proceeds from refinancing at attractive long-term rates or from our credit facility, as well as proceeds from asset monetizations.
liquidity based on our forecasted levels of cash flow from operations and other sources of liquidity, we expect to have sufficient liquidity to manage our businesses in 2020. our potential material internal and external sources and uses of liquidity are as follows:
cash and cash equivalents on hand cash generated from operations distributions from our equity-method investees utilization of our credit facility and/or commercial paper program cash proceeds from issuance of debt and/or equity securities proceeds from asset monetizations contributions from noncontrolling interests uses:
working capital requirements capital and investment expenditures quarterly dividends to our shareholders debt service payments, including payments of long-term debt distributions to noncontrolling interests potential risks associated with our planned levels of liquidity discussed above include those previously discussed in company outlook.
as of december 31, 2019, we had a working capital deficit of $2.388 billion, including cash and cash equivalents and long-term debt due within one year. our available liquidity is as follows:
available liquidity                                                                                                                         december 31, 2019
capacity available under our $4.5 billion credit facility, less amounts outstanding under our $4 billion commercial paper program (1)           4,500
(1)   in managing our available liquidity, we do not expect a maximum outstanding amount in excess of the capacity of our credit facility inclusive of any outstanding amounts under our commercial paper program. we had no commercial paper outstanding as of december 31, 2019. the highest amount outstanding under our commercial paper program and credit facility during 2019 was $1.226 billion. at december 31, 2019, we were in compliance with the financial covenants associated with our credit facility. see note 15 - debt and banking arrangements of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on our credit facility and commercial paper program.
registrations in february 2018, we filed a shelf registration statement as a well-known seasoned issuer. in august 2018, we filed a prospectus supplement for the offer and sale from time to time of shares of our common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $1 billion. these sales are to be made over a period of time and from time to time in transactions at then-current prices. such sales are to be made pursuant to an equity distribution agreement between us and certain entities who may act as sales agents or purchase for their own accounts as principals at a price agreed upon at the time of the sale.
distributions from equity-method investees the organizational documents of entities in which we have an equity-method investment generally require distribution of their available cash to their members on a quarterly basis. in each case, available cash is reduced, in part, by reserves appropriate for operating their respective businesses. see note 6 - investing activities of notes to consolidated financial statements for our more significant equity-method investees.
credit ratings the interest rates at which we are able to borrow money are impacted by our credit ratings. the current ratings are as follows:
fitch ratings               rating watch positive   bbb-
these credit ratings are included for informational purposes and are not recommendations to buy, sell, or hold our securities, and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. no assurance can be given that the credit rating agencies will continue to assign us investment-grade ratings even if we meet or exceed their current criteria
for investment-grade ratios. a downgrade of our credit ratings might increase our future cost of borrowing and would require us to provide additional collateral to third parties, negatively impacting our available liquidity.

operating activities the factors that determine operating activities are largely the same as those that affect net income (loss), with the exception of noncash items such as depreciation and amortization, provision (benefit) for deferred income taxes, equity (earnings) losses, gain on disposition of equity-method investments, impairment of equity-method investments, (gain) on sale of certain assets and businesses, impairment of certain assets, (gain) loss on deconsolidation of businesses, and regulatory charges resulting from tax reform.
our net cash provided (used) by operating activities in 2019 increased from 2018 primarily due to the net favorable changes in operating working capital in 2019, including the collection of transco's filed rates subject to refund and the receipt of an income tax refund, as well as higher operating income (excluding noncash items as previously discussed) in 2019, partially offset by the impact of decreased distributions from unconsolidated affiliates in 2019.
our net cash provided (used) by operating activities in 2018 increased from 2017 primarily due to higher operating income (excluding noncash items as previously discussed) in 2018, partially offset by the impact of decreased distributions from unconsolidated affiliates in 2018.
off-balance sheet arrangements and guarantees of debt or other commitments we have various other guarantees and commitments which are disclosed in note 4 - variable interest entities, note 12 - property, plant, and equipment, note 18 - fair value measurements, guarantees, and concentration of credit risk, and note 19 - contingent liabilities and commitments of notes to consolidated financial statements. we do not believe these guarantees and commitments or the possible fulfillment of them will prevent us from meeting our liquidity needs.
contractual obligations the table below summarizes the maturity dates of our contractual obligations at december 31, 2019:
(1)   includes any borrowings outstanding under credit facilities, but does not include any related variable-rate interest payments.
•   an estimated $589 million long-term mixed ngls purchase obligation with index-based pricing terms that is reflected in this table at december 31, 2019 prices;
•   an estimated $193 million long-term ethane purchase obligation with index-based pricing terms that primarily supplies third parties at their plants and is reflected in this table at a value calculated using december 31, 2019 prices. any excess purchased volumes may be sold at comparable market prices;
•   an estimated $163 million long-term ethane purchase obligation with index-based pricing terms that primarily supplies a third party for consumption at their plant and is reflected in this table at a value calculated using december 31, 2019 prices. any excess purchased volumes may be sold at comparable market prices;
•   an estimated $149 million long-term ethane purchase obligation with index-based pricing terms that is reflected in this table at december 31, 2019 prices. this obligation is part of an overall exchange agreement whereby volumes we transport on oppl are sold at a third-party fractionator near conway, kansas, and we are subsequently obligated to purchase ethane volumes at mont belvieu. the purchased ethane volumes may be utilized or sold at comparable prices in the mont belvieu market;
•   an estimated $129 million long-term mixed ngls purchase obligation with index-based pricing terms that is reflected in this table at december 31, 2019 prices.
in addition, we have not included certain natural gas life-of-lease contracts for which the future volumes are indeterminable. we have not included commitments, beyond purchase orders, for the acquisition or construction of property, plant, and equipment or expected contributions to our jointly owned investments. (see company outlook - expansion projects.)
(3)   does not include estimated contributions to our pension and other postretirement benefit plans. we made contributions to our pension and other postretirement benefit plans of $68 million in 2019 and $93 million in 2018. in 2020, we expect to contribute approximately $19 million to these plans (see note 10 - employee benefit plans of notes to consolidated financial statements). tax-qualified pension plans are required to meet minimum contribution requirements. in the past, we have contributed amounts to our tax-qualified pension plans in excess of the minimum required contribution. these excess amounts can be used to offset future minimum contribution requirements. during 2019, we contributed $60 million to our tax-qualified pension plans. in addition to these contributions, a portion of the excess contributions was used to meet the minimum contribution requirements. during 2020, we expect to contribute approximately $10 million to our tax-qualified pension plans and use excess amounts to satisfy minimum contribution requirements, if needed. additionally, estimated future minimum funding requirements may vary significantly from historical requirements if actual results differ significantly from estimated results for assumptions such as returns on plan assets, interest rates, retirement rates, mortality, and other significant assumptions or by changes to current legislation and regulations.
(4)   we have not included income tax liabilities in the table above. see note 8 - provision (benefit) for income taxes of notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of income taxes, including our contingent tax liability reserves.
effects of inflation our operations have historically not been materially affected by inflation. approximately 49 percent of our gross property, plant, and equipment is comprised of our interstate natural gas pipeline assets. they are subject to regulation, which limits recovery to historical cost. while amounts in excess of historical cost are not recoverable under current ferc practices, we anticipate being allowed to recover and earn a return based on increased actual cost incurred to replace existing assets. cost-based regulations, along with competition and other market factors, may limit our ability to recover such increased costs. for our gathering and processing assets, operating costs are influenced to a greater extent by both competition for specialized services and specific price changes in crude oil and natural gas and related commodities than by changes in general inflation. crude oil, natural gas, and ngl prices are particularly sensitive to the market perceptions concerning the supply and demand balance in the near future, as well as general economic conditions. however, our exposure to certain of these price changes is reduced through the fee-based nature of certain of our services and the use of hedging instruments.
environmental we are a participant in certain environmental activities in various stages including assessment studies, cleanup operations, and/or remedial processes at certain sites, some of which we currently do not own (see note 19 - contingent liabilities and commitments of notes to consolidated financial statements). we are monitoring these sites in a coordinated effort with other potentially responsible parties, the epa, or other governmental authorities. we are jointly and severally liable along with unrelated third parties in some of these activities and solely responsible in others. current estimates of the most likely costs of such activities are approximately $31 million, all of which are included in accrued liabilities and regulatory liabilities, deferred income, and other in the consolidated balance sheet at december 31, 2019. we will seek recovery of the accrued costs related to remediation activities by our interstate gas pipelines totaling approximately $4 million through future natural gas transmission rates. the remainder of these costs will be funded from operations. during 2019, we paid approximately $6 million for cleanup and/or remediation and monitoring activities. we expect to pay approximately $8 million in 2020 for these activities. estimates of the most likely costs of cleanup are generally based on completed assessment studies, preliminary results of studies, or our experience with other similar cleanup operations. at december 31, 2019, certain assessment studies were still in process for which the ultimate outcome may yield different estimates of most likely costs. therefore, the actual costs incurred will depend on the final amount, type, and extent of contamination discovered at these sites, the final cleanup standards mandated by the epa or other governmental authorities, and other factors.
the epa and various state regulatory agencies routinely promulgate and propose new rules and issue updated guidance to existing rules. these rulemakings include, but are not limited to, rules for reciprocating internal combustion engine and combustion turbine maximum achievable control technology, air quality standards for one-hour nitrogen dioxide emissions, and volatile organic compound and methane new source performance standards impacting design and operation of storage vessels, pressure valves, and compressors. the epa previously issued its rule regarding national ambient air quality standards for ground-level ozone. we are monitoring the rule's implementation as it will trigger additional federal and state regulatory actions that may impact our operations. implementation of the regulations is expected to result in impacts to our operations and increase the cost of additions to property, plant, and equipment - net in the consolidated balance sheet for both new and existing facilities in affected areas. we are unable to reasonably estimate the cost of additions that may be required to meet the regulations at this time due to uncertainty created by various legal challenges to these regulations and the need for further specific regulatory guidance.
our interstate natural gas pipelines consider prudently incurred environmental assessment and remediation costs and the costs associated with compliance with environmental standards to be recoverable through rates.

item 1a.    risk factors the following discussion describes certain risk factors that we believe could affect our business and prospects. these risk factors are in addition to those set forth elsewhere in this report. our business operations could also be affected by additional factors that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider not to be material. the reader should not consider this list to be a complete statement of all risks and uncertainties.
in fiscal 2019, we continued to experience unfavorable brand and generic pharmaceutical pricing trends, which negatively impacted our pharmaceutical distribution services reportable segment profit and our consolidated operating earnings. we expect these trends to continue in fiscal 2020, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.
our contractual arrangements with pharmaceutical manufacturers for the purchase of brand pharmaceutical products generally use wholesale acquisition cost ("wac") as the reference price. we sell brand pharmaceutical products to many of our customers using wac as the reference price and to other customers based on their negotiated contract price. if manufacturers change their pricing policies or practices with regard to wac or if prices charged by manufacturers do not align with prices negotiated to be paid by our customers, and we are unable to negotiate alternative ways to be compensated by manufacturers or customers for the value of our services, our results of operations could be adversely affected. additionally, there are a number of policy initiatives being considered which, if enacted, could directly or indirectly regulate or impact wac list prices. if such initiatives are passed and we are unable to negotiate equitable changes with our suppliers and/or customers, our results of operations could be adversely impacted.
the pharmaceutical products that we purchase are also subject to price inflation and deflation. additionally, certain distribution service agreements that we have entered into with brand and generic pharmaceutical manufacturers have a price appreciation component to them. as a result, our gross profit from brand-name and generic pharmaceuticals continues to be subject to fluctuation based upon the timing and extent of manufacturer price increases, which we do not control. if the frequency or rate of brand and generic pharmaceutical price increases slows, whether due to regulatory mandates, the implementation of legislative proposals, policy initiatives or voluntary manufacturer actions, our results of operations could be adversely affected. in addition, generic pharmaceuticals are also subject to price deflation. if the frequency or rate of generic pharmaceutical price deflation accelerates, the negative impact on our results of operations will be greater.
competition and industry consolidation may erode our profit.
as described in greater detail in the "competition" section beginning on page 5, the industries in which we operate are highly competitive. in addition, in recent years the healthcare industry has been subject to increasing consolidation, including among pharmaceutical manufacturers, retail pharmacies, and health insurers, which may create further competitive pressures on our pharmaceutical distribution business. if we do not compete successfully, it could have a material and adverse effect on our business and results of operations. the impact on us will be greater if consolidation among our customers, suppliers, and competitors gives the resulting enterprises greater bargaining power, which could lead to greater pressure on us to reduce prices for our products and services.
increasing governmental efforts to regulate the pharmaceutical supply channel and pharmaceutical compounding may increase our costs and reduce our profitability.
the healthcare industry in the united states is highly regulated at the federal and state levels. there have been increasing efforts by congress and state and federal agencies, including state boards of pharmacy, departments of health, and the fda, to regulate the pharmaceutical distribution system and pharmacy compounding activities. regulation of pharmaceutical distribution is intended to prevent diversion and the introduction of counterfeit, adulterated, and/or mislabeled drugs into the pharmaceutical distribution system. consequently, we are subject to the risk of changes in various federal and state laws, which include operating and security standards of the dea, the fda, various state boards of pharmacy and comparable agencies. in recent years, some states have passed or proposed laws and regulations that are intended to protect the safety and security of the supply channel but that also may substantially increase the costs and burden of pharmaceutical distribution and pharmaceutical compounding.
at the federal level, the dqsa establishes federal traceability standards requiring drugs to be labeled and tracked at the bottle level, preempts state drug pedigree requirements, and will require all supply-chain stakeholders to participate in an electronic, interoperable prescription drug traceability system by november 2023. the dqsa also established requirements for drug wholesale distributors and third-party logistics providers, including licensing requirements applicable in states that had not previously licensed third-party logistics providers. in addition, the dqsa established 503b outsourcing facilities as a category for providers of csps, allowing such facilities to voluntarily register with the fda. our csp business locations have registered with the fda as 503b outsourcing facilities and have implemented policies and procedures to achieve compliance with current federal and state requirements for such facilities.
there can be no assurance that we are fully compliant with the dqsa requirements, or with additional related state regulatory and licensing requirements, and any failure to comply may result in suspension or delay of certain operations and additional costs to bring our facilities into compliance. moreover, we expect that the fda will continue to issue draft and final guidance and to promulgate regulations in its efforts to implement the requirements in the dqsa, including those relating to current good manufacturing practices ("cgmps") and other matters related to 503b outsourcing facilities, which may require changes to our business, some of which may be significant. additional details on risks related to our 503b outsourcing facilities and implementation of cgmps are described below.
as discussed in the risk factor below about public concern over the abuse of opioid medications, certain governmental and regulatory agencies, as well as state and local jurisdictions, are focused on the abuse of opioid medications in the united states. in addition to conducting investigations and participating in litigation related to the misuse of prescription opioid medications, federal, state and local governmental and regulatory agencies are considering legislation and regulatory measures to limit opioid prescriptions and more closely monitor product distribution, prescribing, and dispensing of these drugs.
complying with the dqsa requirements and other chain of custody and pharmaceutical distribution and compounding requirements, including follow-on actions related to current public concern over the abuse of opioid medications, could result in suspension or delays in our production and distribution activities which may increase our costs and could otherwise adversely affect our results of operations.
legal, regulatory, and legislative changes with respect to reimbursement, pricing, and contracting may adversely affect our business and results of operations, including through declining reimbursement rates.
both our business and our customers' businesses may be adversely affected by laws and regulations reducing reimbursement rates for pharmaceuticals and/or medical treatments or services, changing the methodology by which reimbursement levels are determined, or regulating pricing, contracting, and discounting practices with respect to medical products and services. additionally, on occasion, price increases and pricing practices with respect to certain brand and generic pharmaceuticals have been the subject of u.s. congressional inquiries, federal and state investigations and private litigation. any law or regulation impacting pharmaceutical pricing or reimbursement, such as pricing controls or indexing models at the federal or state level, could adversely affect our operations.
subsequent legislation has made additional changes to federal drug payment policies, including the bipartisan budget act of 2018, which increased the medicaid rebate due with respect to line extensions of single source or innovator multiple source oral solid dosage form drugs. the federal government and state governments could take other actions in the future that impact medicaid reimbursement and rebate amounts or the cost of drugs. any reduction in the medicaid reimbursement rates to our customers may indirectly impact the prices that we can charge our customers for multiple source pharmaceuticals and cause corresponding declines in our profitability.
there can be no assurance that recent or future changes in medicaid prescription drug reimbursement policies will not have an adverse impact on our business. unless we are able to successfully advocate to prevent or mitigate the impact of these legislative and regulatory changes, these changes in reimbursement and related reporting requirements could adversely affect our results of operations.
our businesses also sell specialty and other drugs to physicians, hospitals, community oncology practices and other providers that are reimbursed under part b of the medicare program. the centers of medicare & medicaid services ("cms") published a final rule on november 13, 2017 that reduces medicare outpatient hospital reimbursement for separately payable drugs (other than vaccines) purchased through the 340b drug discount program from average sales price ("asp") plus 6% to asp minus 22.5% (with certain exceptions), effective january 1, 2018. on december 27, 2018, the united states district court for the district of columbia concluded that this policy exceeded cms statutory authority (with regard to 2018 payments). while the appeals process is still underway, cms solicited comments in the proposed calendar year 2020 medicare outpatient prospective payment system rule on appropriate payment for such 340b-acquired drugs, potentially including a reduced rate of asp plus 3%
the federal government may adopt measures in the future that would further reduce medicare and/or medicaid spending or impose additional requirements on healthcare entities. notably, the trump administration and members of congress proposed numerous amendments to part b drug distribution and payment models during 2018 and have continued to do so throughout 2019. some of these proposals could have significant effects on our business, including a potential proposal to create an "international pricing index" payment model that would modify distribution methods for part b drugs and tie reimbursement rates to international drug pricing metrics. any future reductions in medicare reimbursement rates or modifications to medicare drug pricing regulations such as asp calculations could negatively impact our customers' businesses and their ability to continue to purchase such drugs from us, or could indirectly affect the structure of our relationships with manufacturers and our customers. at this time, we can provide no assurances that future medicare and/or medicaid payment or policy changes, if adopted, would not have a material adverse effect on our business.
finally, federal and state governments may adopt policies affecting drug pricing and contracting practices outside of the context of federal programs such as medicare and medicaid, which may adversely affect our business. for example, several states have adopted laws that require drug manufacturers to provide advance notice of certain price increases and to report information relating to those price increases, while others have taken legislative or administrative action to establish prescription drug affordability boards or multi-payer purchasing pools to reduce the cost of prescription drugs. on july 31, 2019, the department of health and human services announced a "safe importation action plan" that outlines two potential pathways to allow importation of certain drugs from foreign markets. there can be no assurances that future changes to drug reimbursement policies, drug pricing and contracting practices outside of federal healthcare programs, or to government drug price regulation programs such as the medicaid rebate, asp, or 340b program will not have an adverse impact on our business.
if we fail to comply with laws and regulations in respect of healthcare fraud and abuse, we could suffer penalties or be required to make significant changes to our operations.
we are subject to extensive and frequently changing federal and state laws and regulations relating to healthcare fraud and abuse. the federal government continues to strengthen its scrutiny of practices potentially involving healthcare fraud affecting medicare, medicaid and other government healthcare programs. our relationships with healthcare providers and pharmaceutical manufacturers subject our business to laws and regulations on fraud and abuse which, among other things, (i) prohibit persons from soliciting, offering, receiving or paying any remuneration in order to induce the referral of a patient for treatment or the ordering or purchasing of items or services that are in any way paid for by medicare, medicaid or other government-sponsored healthcare programs and (ii) impose a number of restrictions upon referring physicians and providers of designated health services under medicare and medicaid programs. legislative provisions relating to healthcare fraud and abuse give federal enforcement personnel substantially increased funding, powers and remedies to pursue suspected fraud and abuse, and these enforcement authorities were further expanded by the aca. while we believe that we are in compliance with applicable laws and regulations, many of the regulations applicable to us, including those relating to marketing incentives offered in connection with pharmaceutical sales, are vague or indefinite, and have not been interpreted by the courts. they may be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial, regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that could require us to make changes in our operations. if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations, we could be subject to civil and criminal penalties, including the loss of licenses or our ability to participate in medicare, medicaid, and other federal and state healthcare programs.
certain governmental and regulatory agencies, as well as state and local jurisdictions, are focused on the abuse of opioid medications in the united states. federal, state and local governmental and regulatory agencies are conducting investigations of us and others in the supply chain, including pharmaceutical manufacturers and other pharmaceutical wholesale distributors, regarding the distribution of opioid medications. in addition, a significant number of lawsuits have been filed against us, other pharmaceutical wholesale distributors, and others in the supply chain. the lawsuits against us and other pharmaceutical wholesale distributors allege, among other claims, that we failed to provide effective controls and procedures to guard against the diversion of controlled substances, acted negligently by distributing controlled substances to pharmacies that serve individuals who abuse controlled substances, and failed to report suspicious orders of controlled substances in accordance with regulations. additional governmental and regulatory entities have indicated an intent to sue and may conduct investigations of us in the future. we are deeply committed to diversion control efforts, have sophisticated systems in place to identify orders placed warranting further review to determine if they are suspicious (including through the use of data analytics), and engage in significant due diligence and ongoing monitoring of customers. while we are vigorously defending ourselves in these lawsuits, the allegations may negatively affect our business in various ways, including through increased costs and harm to our reputation.
we are currently engaged in discussions with the objective of reaching potential terms for a global resolution of the multi-district opioid litigation and other related state court litigation described in note 13 of the notes to consolidated financial statements. given the large number of parties involved, the complexity and difficulty of the underlying issues, and the resulting uncertainty of achieving a potential global resolution, we continue to litigate and prepare for trial in the cases pending in the multi-district opioid litigation as well as in state courts where lawsuits have been filed, and intend to continue to vigorously defend ourselves in all such cases. since these matters are still developing, we are unable to predict the outcome, but the result of these lawsuits could include excessive monetary verdicts and/or injunctive relief that may affect how we operate our business, or we may enter into settlements of claims that may also include monetary payments and/or injunctive relief. the adverse resolution of any of these lawsuits or investigations could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and cash flows and could result in a lower than historical level of capital available for deployment, including a lower level of capital returned to stockholders.
legislative, regulatory or industry measures to address the misuse of prescription opioid medications may also affect our business in ways that we are not be able to predict. for example, new york has instituted an opioid excise tax, which went into effect on july 1, 2019, and taxes entities that make the initial sale or distribution of opioid medications into the state. in addition, rhode island and delaware have enacted opioid taxes, minnesota has enacted increased licensure fees, and other states are considering legislation that could require entities to pay an assessment or tax on the sale or distribution of opioid medications in those states. if additional state or local jurisdictions enact legislation that taxes or assesses the sale or distribution of opioid medications and we are not able to mitigate the impact on our business through operational changes or commercial arrangements where permitted, such legislation in the aggregate may have a material adverse effect on the company's results of operations, cash flows, or financial condition.
we conduct our operations through a variety of businesses, including the distribution of pharmaceuticals, the dispensing of healthcare products, and the provision of services to the pharmaceutical industry. each of our businesses may cause us to become involved in legal disputes or proceedings involving healthcare fraud and abuse, the false claims act, antitrust, class action, commercial, employment, environmental, intellectual property, licensing, and various other claims, including claims related to opioid medications as discussed in the above risk factor. litigation is costly, time-consuming, and disruptive to ordinary business operations. the defense and resolution of these current and future proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. violations of various federal and state laws, including with respect to the marketing, sale, purchase, and dispensing of pharmaceutical products and the provision of services to the pharmaceutical industry, can result in criminal, civil, and administrative liability for which there can be significant financial damages, criminal and civil penalties, and possible exclusion from participation in federal and state health programs. any settlement, judgment or fine could materially adversely affect our results of operations.
statutory and/or regulatory violations could also form the basis for qui tam complaints. the qui tam provisions of the federal and various state civil false claims acts authorize a private person, known as a relator, to file civil actions under these statutes on behalf of the federal and state governments. under false claims acts, the filing of a qui tam complaint by a relator imposes obligations on government authorities to investigate the allegations and determine whether or not to intervene in the action. such cases may involve allegations around the marketing, sale, purchase, and/or dispensing of brand and/or generic pharmaceutical products or the provision of services to the pharmaceutical industry. such complaints are filed under seal and remain sealed until the applicable court orders otherwise. our business and results of operations could be adversely affected if qui tam complaints are filed against us for alleged violations of any health laws and regulations and damages arising from resultant false claims, if the litigation proceeds whether or not government authorities decide to intervene in any such matters, and/or if we are found liable for all or any portion of violations alleged in any such matters.
in fiscal 2018, we resolved potential civil claims and administrative action by entering into, among other things, a corporate integrity agreement (see note 13 of the notes to consolidated financial statements). the corporate integrity agreement has a five-year term. failure to comply with obligations under the corporate integrity agreement could lead to monetary or other penalties.
wba accounted for approximately 34% of our revenue in the fiscal year ended september 30, 2019. express scripts accounted for approximately 13% of our revenue in the fiscal year ended september 30, 2019. our top ten customers, including governmental agencies and gpos, represented approximately 64% of revenue in the fiscal year ended september 30, 2019. we may lose a significant customer or gpo relationship if any existing contract with such customer or gpo expires without being extended, renewed, renegotiated or replaced or is terminated by the customer or gpo prior to expiration, to the extent such early termination is permitted by the contract. a number of our contracts with significant customers or gpos are typically subject to expiration each year and we may lose any of these customers or gpo relationships if we are unable to extend, renew, renegotiate or replace the contracts. the loss of any significant customer or gpo relationship could adversely affect our revenue, results of operations, and cash flows. additionally, from time to time, significant contracts may be renewed prior to their expiration date. if those contracts are renewed at less favorable terms, they may also negatively impact our revenue, results of operations, and cash flows.
the anticipated ongoing strategic and financial benefits of our relationship with wba may not be realized.
in may 2016, we extended to 2026 our strategic arrangement with wba - specifically, our distribution agreement under which we distribute drugs to walgreens pharmacies and our generics purchasing services arrangement under which walgreens boots alliance development gmbh ("wbad") provides a variety of services, including negotiating acquisition pricing with generic manufacturers on our behalf. this reflected our expectation that partnering strategically with wba would result in various benefits including, among other things, continued cost savings as a result of our generics purchasing services arrangement with wbad, as well as the potential for exploring innovation together and sharing best practices. the processes and initiatives needed to achieve and maintain these benefits are complex, costly, and time-consuming. achieving the anticipated benefits from the arrangement on an ongoing basis is subject to a number of significant challenges and uncertainties, including: the potential inability to realize and/or delays in realizing potential benefits resulting from participation in our generics purchasing services arrangement with wbad, including improved generic drug pricing and terms, improved service fees from generic manufacturers, cost savings, innovations, or other benefits due to its inability to negotiate successfully with generic manufacturers or otherwise to perform as expected; the potential disruption of our plans and operations as a result of the terms under which we extended the duration of the distribution agreement and generics purchasing services agreement, including any disruption of our cash flow and ability to return value to our stockholders in accordance with our past practices and any reduction in our operational, strategic or financial flexibility; potential changes in supplier relationships and terms; unexpected or unforeseen costs, fees, expenses and charges incurred by us related to the transaction or the overall strategic relationship; unforeseen changes in the economic terms under which we distribute pharmaceuticals to wba; and any potential issues that could impede our ability to continue to work collaboratively with wba in an efficient and effective manner in furtherance of the anticipated strategic and financial benefits of the relationship.
in addition, wba has the right, but not the obligation, under the transactions contemplated by the framework and shareholder agreements dated march 18, 2013 to make certain additional investments in our common stock. wba also has the right to sell any of the shares of our common stock that it has acquired so long as wba has held the shares beyond the requisite dates specified in the shareholder agreement. any sales in the public market of common stock currently held by wba or acquired by wba pursuant to open market purchases could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock. we could also encounter unforeseen costs, circumstances, or issues with respect to the transactions and collaboration we anticipate pursuing with wba. many of these potential circumstances are outside of our control and any of them could result in increased costs, decreased revenue, decreased benefits and the diversion of management time and attention. if we are unable to achieve our objectives within the anticipated time frame, or at all, the expected future benefits may not be realized fully or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
a disruption in our distribution or generic purchasing services arrangements with wba could adversely affect our business and financial results.
we are the primary distributor of pharmaceutical products for wba. our generic pharmaceutical program has also benefited from the generics purchasing services arrangement with wba. if the operations of wba are seriously disrupted for any reason, whether by natural disaster, labor disruption, regulatory or governmental action, or otherwise, it could adversely affect our business and our sales and profitability. if the generics purchasing services arrangement does not continue to be successful, our margins and results of operations could also be adversely affected.
if our operations are seriously disrupted for any reason, we may have an obligation to pay or credit wba for failure to supply products. in addition, upon the expiration or termination of the distribution agreement or generics purchasing services arrangement, there can be no assurance that we or wba will be willing to renew, on terms favorable to us or at all.
in addition, our business may be adversely affected by any operational, financial, or regulatory difficulties that wba experiences, including any disruptions of certain of its existing distribution facilities or retail pharmacies resulting from ongoing inspections by the dea and/or state regulatory agencies and possible revocation of the controlled substance registrations for those facilities and pharmacies.
tax legislation or challenges to our tax positions could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
we are a large corporation with operations in the united states and select global markets. as such, we are subject to tax laws and regulations of the u.s. federal, state and local governments, and of various foreign jurisdictions. from time to time, various legislative initiatives, such as the repeal of last-in, first-out ("lifo") treatment or the promulgation of state opioid taxes and fees, may be proposed that could adversely affect our tax positions and/or our tax liabilities. there can be no assurance that our effective tax rate or tax payments will not be adversely affected by legislation resulting from these initiatives. we believe that our historical tax positions are consistent with applicable laws, regulations, and existing precedent. in addition, u.s. federal, state and local, as well as foreign, tax laws and regulations, are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations. there can be no assurance that our tax positions will not be challenged by relevant tax authorities or that we would be successful in any such challenge.
on december 22, 2017, the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 (the "2017 tax act") was enacted and contains significant changes to u.s. income tax law. due to the potential for changes to tax laws and regulations or changes to the interpretation thereof (including regulations and interpretations pertaining to the 2017 tax act), the ambiguity of tax laws and regulations, the subjectivity of factual interpretations, the complexity of our business and intercompany arrangements, uncertainties regarding the geographic mix of earnings in any particular period, and other factors, material adjustments to our tax estimates may impact our provision for income taxes and our earnings per share, as well as our cash flows, in the period in which any such adjustments would be made.
the suspension or revocation by federal or state authorities of any of the registrations that must be in effect for our distribution and 503b outsourcing facilities to purchase, compound, store, and/or distribute pharmaceuticals and controlled substances, the refusal by such authorities to issue a registration to any such facility, or any enforcement action or other litigation that arises out of our failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations governing distribution and 503b outsourcing facilities may adversely affect our reputation, our business, and our results of operations.
the dea, fda, doj, and various other federal and state authorities regulate the distribution of pharmaceuticals and controlled substances and the compounding of pharmaceuticals that contain controlled substances. we are required to hold valid dea and state-level licenses, meet various security and operating standards, and comply with the controlled substances act and its implementing regulations governing the sale, marketing, packaging, compounding, holding and distribution of controlled substances. government authorities may from time to time investigate whether we are in compliance with various security and operating standards applicable to the distribution of controlled substances including whether we are adequately detecting and preventing the illegal diversion of controlled substances. although we have procedures in place that are intended to ensure compliance with such laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that a regulatory agency or tribunal would conclude that our operations are compliant with applicable laws and regulations. if we were found to be non-compliant with such laws and regulations, federal and state authorities have broad enforcement powers, including (i) the ability to suspend our distribution centers' and 503b outsourcing facilities' licenses to distribute and compound pharmaceutical products (including controlled substances), (ii) seize or recall products, and (iii) impose significant criminal, civil and administrative sanctions for violations of these laws and regulations, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, and results of operations.
we have received, and may in the future receive, requests for information, letters, and subpoenas from the dea, fda, various u.s. attorneys' offices of the doj, and/or state attorneys general and state regulatory authorities and agencies related to our distribution of controlled substances and our order monitoring program, which is designed to prevent and detect the illegal diversion of controlled substances, or other matters. we generally respond to subpoenas, requests, letters, and other authority and/or agency correspondence in a thorough and timely manner. these responses require time and effort and can result in considerable costs being incurred by us, such as costs related to addressing the observations listed on fda form 483 reports. such subpoenas, requests and letters can also lead to the assertion of claims or the commencement of civil, criminal, or regulatory legal proceedings against us, as well as to settlements and the suspension or revocation of registrations required by our distribution and 503b outsourcing facilities, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business and results of operations.
in december 2017, following fda inspections of our 503b outsourcing facilities, we voluntarily suspended production activities at our largest 503b outsourcing facility located in memphis, tennessee. in may 2019, pharmedium reached an agreement on the terms of a consent decree (the "consent decree") with the fda and the consumer protection branch of the civil division of the doj. the consent decree permits commercial operations to continue at pharmedium's dayton, new jersey, and sugar land, texas compounding facilities and administrative operations to continue at its lake forest, illinois headquarters subject to compliance with the requirements set forth therein. as required by the consent decree, we have completed audit inspections by an independent cgmp expert at the dayton and sugar land facilities to determine that the facilities are being operated in conformity with cgmp. additional audit inspections by the independent cgmp expert of the sugar land and dayton facilities are also required at least annually for a period of four years.
the consent decree also establishes requirements that must be satisfied prior to the resumption of commercial operations at the memphis, tennessee facility. through fiscal 2019, our results of operations were adversely impacted by the memphis suspension. our results of operations will continue to be adversely impacted until the memphis facility resumes commercial distribution and we cannot predict if or when the fda will permit pharmedium to resume commercial distribution at the memphis facility.
separately, we have agreed in several state regulatory matters to consent orders or temporary licensing suspensions regarding certain of our 503b outsourcing facilities. certain other states have requested information concerning the status of operations at some or all of our 503b outsourcing facilities. these state regulatory matters preclude us from commercially distributing into certain states, which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations.
additionally, the fda may from time to time issue form 483 reports and warning letters in connection with their oversight of 503b outsourcing facilities. prior to our acquisition of the business, pharmedium received a warning letter from the fda in 2014 and a series of form 483 reports were issued in 2015 and 2016 following up on the 2014 letter. we cannot be assured that the fda and doj will be satisfied with the sufficiency or timing of pharmedium's corrective actions in response to this warning letter or the form 483 reports. a failure to comply with the consent decree or to address observations identified by the fda in form 483 reports or any warning letters issued by the fda or observations identified by any other federal and state regulatory authority, including a failure to resolve the observations identified by the 2014 warning letter and subsequent form 483 reports, could lead to the suspension of facilities currently in operation, an enforcement action, monetary penalties, and/or license revocation, each of which could have an adverse effect on our reputation, business and results of operations.
the products compounded by our csp business are administered by our customers to patients intravenously, and failures or errors in production, labeling, or packaging could contribute to patient harm or death, which may subject us to significant liabilities and reputational harm.
the production, labeling, and packaging of csps is inherently risky. our csp business sells csps to acute care hospitals, freestanding hospital outpatient departments, and ambulatory surgery centers, who then administer the csps to patients intravenously or through other injectable routes of administration. there are a number of factors that could result in the injury or death of a patient who receives one of our csps, including quality issues, manufacturing or labeling flaws, improper packaging, or unanticipated or improper uses of the products, any of which could result from human or other error. any of these situations could lead to a recall of, or safety alert relating to, one or more of our products. in addition, in the ordinary course of business, we may voluntarily recall or retrieve products. any recall or retrieval, whether voluntary or requested by the fda or state regulatory authorities, could result in significant costs and negative publicity. negative publicity, including regarding a quality or safety issue, whether accurate or inaccurate, could reduce market acceptance of our products, harm our reputation, decrease demand for our products, result in the loss of customers, lead to product withdrawals, and harm our ability to successfully launch new products and services. these problems could also result in enforcement actions by state and federal authorities or other healthcare self-regulatory bodies, or product liability claims or lawsuits, including those brought by individuals or groups seeking to represent a class or establish multidistrict litigation proceedings. any such action, litigation, recall, or reputational harm resulting from patient harm or death caused by csps prepared by a competitor or a hospital pharmacy could result in a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. our current or future insurance coverage may prove insufficient to cover any liability claims brought against us. changes in the commercial insurance market may impair or prohibit our ability to obtain insurance coverage that will be adequate to satisfy any liability that may arise.
our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected if we undertake acquisitions of or investments in businesses that do not perform as we expect or that are difficult for us to integrate.
as part of our strategy we seek to pursue acquisitions of and investments in other companies. at any particular time, we may be in various stages of assessment, discussion, and negotiation with regard to one or more potential acquisitions or investments, not all of which will be consummated. we make public disclosure of pending and completed acquisitions when appropriate and required by applicable securities laws and regulations.
acquisitions involve numerous risks and uncertainties and may be of businesses in which we lack operational or market experience. if we complete one or more acquisitions, our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by a number of factors, including: regulatory or compliance issues that could arise; changes in regulations and laws; the failure of the acquired businesses to achieve the results we have projected in either the near or long term; the assumption of unknown liabilities, including litigation risks; the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed not being properly estimated; the difficulties of imposing adequate financial and operating controls on the acquired companies and their management and the potential liabilities that might arise pending the imposition of adequate controls; the difficulties in the integration of the operations, technologies, services and products of the acquired companies; and the failure to achieve the strategic objectives of these acquisitions.
as previously disclosed, we have commenced a comprehensive strategic and financial review of pharmedium, which remains ongoing. the review includes consideration of the ongoing regulatory, operational, and financial challenges that face pharmedium as a result of the consent decree, state regulatory actions, and related matters. while we are unable to predict the outcome of the review, if we are unable to achieve our objectives within the anticipated time frame, or at all, it could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, results of operations, or financial condition.
our business and results of operations may be adversely affected if we fail to manage and complete divestitures.
we regularly evaluate our portfolio in order to determine whether an asset or business may no longer help us meet our objectives. when we decide to sell assets or a business, we may encounter difficulty finding buyers or alternative exit strategies, which could delay the achievement of our strategic objectives. the impact of a divestiture on our results of operations could also be greater than anticipated.
violations of anti-bribery, anti-corruption, and/or international trade laws to which we are subject could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, and results of operations.
we are subject to laws concerning our business operations and marketing activities in foreign countries where we conduct business. for example, we are subject to the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act (the "fcpa"), u.s. export control and trade sanction laws, and similar anti-corruption and international trade laws in certain foreign countries, such as the u.k. bribery act, any violation of which could create substantial liability for us and also cause a loss of reputation in the market. the fcpa generally prohibits u.s. companies and their officers, directors, employees, and intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business abroad or otherwise obtaining favorable treatment. the fcpa also requires that u.s. public companies maintain books and records that fairly and accurately reflect transactions and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls. if we are found to have violated the fcpa, we may face sanctions including civil and criminal fines, disgorgement of profits, and suspension or debarment of our ability to contract with government agencies or receive export licenses. from time to time, we may face audits or investigations by one or more domestic or foreign government agencies relating to our international business activities, compliance with which could be costly and time-consuming, and could divert our management and key personnel from our business operations. an adverse outcome under any such investigation or audit could subject us to fines or other penalties, which could adversely affect our business, financial position, and results of operations.
our results of operations and our financial condition may be adversely affected by our global operations.
our operations in jurisdictions outside of the united states are subject to various risks inherent in global operations. we currently have operations in over 50 countries. we may conduct business in additional foreign jurisdictions in the future, which may carry operational risks in addition to the risks of acquisition described above. at any particular time, our global operations may be affected by local changes in laws, regulations, and the political and economic environments, including inflation, recession, currency volatility, and competition. changes or uncertainty in u.s. or foreign policy, including any changes or uncertainty with respect to u.s. or international trade policies or tariffs, also can disrupt our global operations, as well as our customers and suppliers, in a particular location and may require us to spend more money to source certain products or materials that we purchase. any of these factors could adversely affect our business, financial position, and results of operations.
our stock price and our ability to access credit markets may be adversely affected by financial market volatility and disruption or a downgrade in our credit ratings.
if the capital and credit markets experience significant disruption and volatility in the future, there can be no assurance that we will not experience downward movement in our stock price without regard to our financial condition or results of operations or an adverse effect, which may be material, on our ability to access credit. although we believe that our operating cash flow and existing credit arrangements give us the ability to meet our financing needs, there can be no assurance that disruption and volatility will not increase our costs of borrowing, impair our liquidity, or adversely impact our business.
additionally, rating agencies continually review the ratings they have assigned to us and our outstanding debt securities. to maintain our ratings, we are required to meet certain financial performance ratios. liabilities related to litigation or any significant related settlements, an increase in our debt or a decline in our earnings could result in downgrades in our credit ratings. actual or anticipated changes or downgrades in our credit ratings, including any announcement that our ratings are under review for a downgrade or have been assigned a negative outlook, could limit our access to public debt markets, limit the institutions willing to provide credit to us, result in more restrictive financial and other covenants in our public and private debt, and would likely increase our overall borrowing costs and adversely affect our earnings.
our results of operations may suffer upon the bankruptcy, insolvency, or other credit failure of a significant supplier.
our relationships with pharmaceutical suppliers give rise to substantial amounts that are due to us from the suppliers, including amounts owed to us for returned goods or defective goods, chargebacks, and amounts due to us for services provided to the suppliers. volatility of the capital and credit markets, general economic conditions, pending litigation, and regulatory changes may adversely affect the solvency or creditworthiness of our suppliers. the bankruptcy, insolvency, or other credit failure of any supplier at a time when the supplier has a substantial account payable balance due to us could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
our revenue and results of operations may suffer upon the bankruptcy, insolvency, or other credit failure of a significant customer.
most of our customers buy pharmaceuticals and other products and services from us on credit. credit is made available to customers based upon our assessment and analysis of creditworthiness. although we often try to obtain a security interest in assets and other arrangements intended to protect our credit exposure, we generally are either subordinated to the position of the primary lenders to our customers or substantially unsecured. volatility of the capital and credit markets, general economic conditions, and regulatory changes, including changes in reimbursement, may adversely affect the solvency or creditworthiness of our customers. the bankruptcy, insolvency, or other credit failure of any customer that has a substantial amount owed to us could have a material adverse effect on our operating revenue and results of operations. as of september 30, 2019, our two largest trade receivable balances due from customers represented approximately 49% and 8% of accounts receivable, net.
recently, one of our customers, diplomat pharmacy, inc. ("diplomat"), indicated in a public filing that it believes it is probable it will need to obtain waivers as of december 31, 2019 for breach of certain financial debt covenants in its credit agreement. diplomat's quarterly report on form 10-q for the quarter ended september 30, 2019 (the "diplomat 10-q") also reflected management's assessment that there is uncertainty regarding its ability to maintain liquidity sufficient to operate its business effectively, which raises substantial doubt as to diplomat's ability to continue as a going concern.
the diplomat 10-q stated that if diplomat violates its covenants and access to its credit facility is terminated or its indebtedness thereunder is accelerated, it may be unable to repay its obligations due under the credit agreement, which would have a material adverse impact on its liquidity and business. as a result of the foregoing, including the consequences of the going concern assessment of diplomat's management, we may be unable to recover amounts owed to us and to continue the relationship on our current terms. as of november 15, 2019, our trade receivable balance due from this customer was approximately $109.6 million, none of which was past due as of such date.
risks generally associated with our sophisticated information systems may adversely affect our business and results of operations.
our businesses rely on sophisticated information systems to obtain, rapidly process, analyze, and manage data to facilitate the purchase and distribution of thousands of inventory items from numerous distribution centers; to receive, process, and ship orders on a timely basis; to account for other product and service transactions with customers; to manage the accurate billing and collections for thousands of customers; and to process payments to suppliers. we continue to make substantial investments in data centers and information systems, including, but not limited to, a program to enhance and upgrade our information technology systems. third-party service providers are also responsible for managing a portion of our information systems. to the extent our information systems are not successfully implemented or fail, or to the extent there are data center interruptions, our business and results of operations may be adversely affected. our business and results of operations may also be adversely affected if a third-party service provider does not perform satisfactorily, or if the information systems are interrupted or damaged by unforeseen events, including due to the actions of third parties.
information security risks have generally increased in recent years because of the proliferation of cloud-based infrastructure and other services, new technologies, and the increased sophistication and activities of perpetrators of cyber attacks. a failure, interruption, or breach of our operational or information security systems, or those of our third-party service providers, as a result of cyber attacks or information security breaches could disrupt our business, result in the disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information or personal data, damage our reputation, increase our costs, and/or cause losses. as a result, cyber security and the continued development and enhancement of the controls and processes designed to protect our systems, computers, software, data, and networks from attack, damage, or unauthorized access remain a priority for us. although we believe that we have robust information security procedures and other safeguards in place, as cyber threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend additional resources to continue to enhance our information security measures and/or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities.
risks generally associated with data privacy regulation and the international transfer of personal data.
we are required to comply with increasingly complex and changing data privacy regulations both in the united states and beyond that regulate the collection, use, security, processing, and transfer of personal data, including particularly the transfer of personal data between or among countries. many of these regulations also grant rights to individuals. many foreign data privacy regulations (including gdpr in the european union and the personal information protection and electronic documents act in canada) and certain state regulations (including california's ccpa) are more stringent than those enacted under united states federal law. we may also face audits or investigations by one or more domestic or foreign government agencies relating to our compliance with these regulations. an adverse outcome under any such investigation or audit could subject us to fines or other penalties. that or other circumstances related to our collection, use, and transfer of personal data could cause a loss of reputation in the market and/or adversely affect our business and financial position.
our goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets, or long-lived assets may become impaired, which may require us to record a further significant charge to earnings in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
u.s. generally accepted accounting principles ("gaap") require us to test our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if indicators for potential impairment exist. indicators that are considered include significant changes in performance relative to expected operating results, significant negative industry or economic trends, or a significant decline in our stock price and/or market capitalization for a sustained period of time. in addition, we periodically review our intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. factors that may be considered a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of our long-lived assets may not be recoverable include slower growth rates, the loss of a significant customer, or divestiture of a business or asset for below its carrying value. the testing required by gaap involves estimates and judgments by management.
as a result of the suspension of production activities at pharmedium's compounding facility located in memphis, tennessee and the entry into the consent decree, the company performed a recoverability assessment of pharmedium's long-lived assets and recorded an impairment loss in fiscal year 2019 for the amount that the carrying value of the pharmedium asset group exceeded its fair value. although we believe our assumptions and estimates are reasonable and appropriate, any changes in key assumptions, including a failure to meet business plans or other unanticipated events and circumstances such as a rise in interest rates, may affect the accuracy or validity of such estimates. we may be required to record a further significant charge to earnings in our consolidated financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets, or long-lived assets is determined. any such charge could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.
natural disasters or other unexpected events may disrupt our operations, adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition, and may not be covered by insurance.
the occurrence of one or more unexpected events, including fires, tornadoes, tsunamis, hurricanes, earthquakes, floods, and other severe hazards or accidents in the united states or in other countries in which we operate or are located could adversely affect our operations and financial performance. extreme weather, natural disasters, power outages, or other unexpected events could result in physical damage to and complete or partial closure of one or more of distribution centers or outsourcing facilities, temporary or long-term disruption in the supply of products, delay in the delivery of products to our distribution centers, and/or disruption of our ability to deliver products to customers. current or future insurance arrangements may not provide protection for costs that may arise from such events, particularly if such events are catastrophic in nature or occur in combination. further, the long-term effects of climate change on general economic conditions and the pharmaceutical distribution industry in particular are unclear, and changes in the supply, demand, or available sources of energy and the regulatory and other costs associated with energy production and delivery may affect the availability or cost of goods and services, including natural resources, necessary to run our businesses. any long-term disruption in our ability to service our customers from one or more distribution centers or outsourcing facilities could have a material adverse effect on our operations.
declining economic conditions could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
our operations and performance depend on economic conditions in the united states and other countries where we do business. deterioration in general economic conditions could adversely affect the amount of prescriptions that are filled and the amount of pharmaceutical products purchased by consumers and, therefore, could reduce purchases by our customers, which would negatively affect our revenue growth and cause a decrease in our profitability. negative trends in the general economy, including interest rate fluctuations, financial market volatility, or credit market disruptions, may also affect our customers' ability to obtain credit to finance their businesses on acceptable terms and reduce discretionary spending on health products. reduced purchases by our customers or changes in payment terms could adversely affect our revenue growth and cause a decrease in our cash flow from operations. bankruptcies or similar events affecting our customers may cause us to incur bad debt expense at levels higher than historically experienced. declining economic conditions may also increase our costs. if the economic conditions in the united states or in the countries where we do business do not improve or deteriorate, our results of operations or financial condition could be adversely affected.
item 7.    management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto contained herein.
pharmaceutical distribution services segment the pharmaceutical distribution services reportable segment distributes a comprehensive offering of brand-name, specialty brand-name and generic pharmaceuticals, over-the-counter healthcare products, home healthcare supplies and equipment, outsourced compounded sterile preparations, and related services to a wide variety of healthcare providers, including acute care hospitals and health systems, independent and chain retail pharmacies, mail order pharmacies, medical clinics, long-term care and alternate site pharmacies, and other customers. through a number of operating businesses, the pharmaceutical distribution services reportable segment provides pharmaceutical distribution (including plasma and other blood products, injectible pharmaceuticals, vaccines, and other specialty pharmaceutical products) and additional services to physicians who specialize in a variety of disease states, especially oncology, and to other healthcare providers, including hospitals and dialysis clinics. additionally, the pharmaceutical distribution services reportable segment provides data analytics, outcomes research, and additional services for biotechnology and pharmaceutical manufacturers. the pharmaceutical distribution services reportable segment also provides pharmacy management, staffing and additional consulting services, and supply management software to a variety of retail and institutional healthcare providers. additionally, it delivers packaging solutions to institutional and retail healthcare providers.
mwi is a leading animal health distribution company in the united states and in the united kingdom. mwi sells pharmaceuticals, vaccines, parasiticides, diagnostics, micro feed ingredients, and various other products to customers in both the companion animal and production animal markets. additionally, mwi offers demand-creating sales force services to manufacturers. abcs, through a number of operating businesses, provides a full suite of integrated manufacturer services that range from clinical trial support to product post-approval and commercialization support. world courier, which operates in over 50 countries, is a leading global specialty transportation and logistics provider for the biopharmaceutical industry.
•   pharmaceutical distribution services' gross profit increased 6.2% from the prior fiscal year primarily due to the increase in revenue largely due to strong specialty product sales, the january 2018 consolidation of profarma, and the january 2018 acquisition of h.d. smith and was negatively impacted by our pharmaceutical compounding operations as production at our memphis facility has been suspended since december 2017. gross profit in other increased 4.3% from the prior fiscal year primarily due to growth at world courier and mwi, the january 2018 consolidation of the specialty joint venture in brazil, and abcs's growth in its canadian operations. total gross profit in the current fiscal year was favorably impacted primarily by increases in gains from antitrust litigation settlements, a last-in, first-out ("lifo") credit in the current year in comparison to a lifo expense in the prior year, and the reversal of a previously-estimated assessment related to the new york state opioid stewardship act;
•   distribution, selling, and administrative expenses increased 8.3% from the prior fiscal year as the pharmaceutical distribution services' segment expenses increased by 10.2% from the prior fiscal year primarily due to an increase in costs to support the increase in revenue, the january 2018 consolidation of profarma, and the january 2018 acquisition of h.d. smith;
•   operating income decreased 23.0% in the current fiscal year primarily due to a $570.0 million impairment of pharmedium's long-lived assets (see note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements), and an increase in employee severance, litigation, and other costs, offset in part by increases in gains from antitrust litigation settlements, a lifo credit in the current fiscal year, and an increase in total operating segment income;
•   our effective tax rates were 11.7% and (37.2)% in the fiscal years ended september 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. our effective tax rate in the fiscal year ended september 30, 2019 was primarily impacted by the $570.0 million impairment of long-lived assets (see note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements) and legal settlements, which changed the mix of domestic and international income. the effective tax rate in the fiscal year ended september 30, 2019 was also impacted by a $37.0 million decrease to the company's transition tax related to the tax cuts and jobs act (the "2017 tax act"). our effective tax rate in the fiscal year ended september 30, 2018 was primarily impacted by the effect of 2017 tax act. our total income tax benefit in the fiscal year ended september 30, 2018 of $438.5 million reflects $612.6 million of tax benefits recognized and a reduction in the u.s. federal income tax rate from 35% to 21%, both resulting from the 2017 tax act. additionally, during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, a portion of a 2017 legal settlement charge was determined to be deductible, which favorably impacted our effective tax rate for the fiscal year ended september 30, 2018. our effective tax rates for the fiscal years ended september 30, 2019 and 2018 were favorably impacted by the company's international businesses in switzerland and ireland, which have lower income tax rates, and the benefit from stock option exercises and restricted stock vesting; and
•   net income and earnings per share were significantly lower in the current fiscal year primarily due to the $570.0 million impairment of long-lived assets and the significant income tax benefit recognized in the prior fiscal year as a result of the 2017 tax act.
we currently expect our revenue growth percentage to be in the mid to high-single digits in fiscal 2020. our future revenue growth will continue to be affected by various factors, such as industry growth trends, including drug utilization, the introduction of new, innovative brand therapies (including biosimilars), the likely increase in the number of generic drugs that will be available over the next few years as a result of the expiration of certain drug patents held by brand-name pharmaceutical manufacturers and the rate of conversion from brand products to those generic drugs, price inflation and price deflation, general economic conditions in the united states, competition within the industry, customer consolidation, changes in pharmaceutical manufacturer pricing and distribution policies and practices, increased downward pressure on government and other third-party reimbursement rates to our customers, and changes in federal government rules and regulations.
the pharmaceutical distribution services segment grew its revenue by 6.9% from the prior fiscal year, primarily due to the growth of some of its largest customers, continued strong specialty product sales, and overall market growth. in addition, revenue increased in the current fiscal year due to the january 2018 consolidation of profarma and the january 2018 acquisition of h.d. smith.
revenue in other increased 8.5% from the prior fiscal year, primarily due to abcs's growth in its canadian operations, growth at mwi, growth at world courier, and the january 2018 consolidation of the specialty joint venture in brazil.
a number of our contracts with customers, including group purchasing organizations, are typically subject to expiration each year. we may lose a significant customer if an existing contract with such customer expires without being extended, renewed, or replaced. during the fiscal year ended september 30, 2019, no significant contracts expired. over the next twelve months, there are no significant contracts scheduled to expire. additionally, from time to time, significant contracts may be terminated in accordance with their terms or extended, renewed, or replaced prior to their expiration dates. if those contracts are extended, renewed, or replaced at less favorable terms, they may also negatively impact our revenue, results of operations, and cash flows.

gross profit increased 11.4%, or $526.0 million, from the prior fiscal year. gross profit in the current fiscal year was favorably impacted primarily by the increase in gross profit in pharmaceutical distribution services, the increase in gross profit in other, an increase in gains from antitrust litigation settlements, the lifo credit in the current year in comparison to a lifo expense in the prior year, and the reversal of a previously-estimated assessment related to the new york state opioid stewardship act.
our cost of goods sold includes a lifo provision that is affected by manufacturer pricing practices, which may be impacted by market and other external influences, changes in inventory quantities, and product mix, many of which are difficult to predict. changes to any of the above factors may have a material impact to our annual lifo provision. the lifo credit in the current fiscal year was primarily driven by lower brand inflation, offset in part by lower generic deflation in comparison to the prior fiscal year.
after fda inspections of our compounding facilities, we voluntarily suspended production activities in december 2017 at our largest compounding facility located in memphis pending execution of certain remedial measures (see notes 1 and 13 of the notes to consolidated financial statements). we continue to incur remediation costs in connection with our compounding operations. additionally, in april 2019, we ceased production at our compounding facility in cleveland, mississippi.
new york state ("nys") enacted the opioid stewardship act ("osa"), which went into effect on july 1, 2018. the osa established an annual $100 million opioid stewardship fund (the "fund") and required manufacturers, distributors, and importers licensed in nys to ratably source the fund. the ratable share of the assessment for each licensee was to be based upon opioids sold or distributed to or within nys. in september 2018, we accrued $22.0 million as an estimate of our liability under the osa for the period from january 1, 2017 through september 30, 2018. in december 2018, the osa was ruled unconstitutional by the u.s. district court for the southern district of new york, and, as a result, we reversed the $22.0 million accrual in the quarter ended december 31, 2018. nys filed an appeal of the court decision on january 17, 2019; however, we do not believe a loss contingency is probable.
pharmaceutical distribution services gross profit increased 6.2%, or $216.0 million, from the prior fiscal year primarily due to the increase in revenue largely due to strong specialty product sales, the january 2018 consolidation of profarma, and the january 2018 acquisition of h.d. smith and was negatively impacted by our pharmaceutical compounding operations as production at our memphis facility has been suspended since december 2017. as a percentage of revenue, pharmaceutical distribution services gross profit margin of 2.13% in the current fiscal year remained relatively flat compared to the prior fiscal year.
gross profit in other increased 4.3%, or $53.7 million, from the prior fiscal year primarily due to growth at world courier and mwi, the january 2018 consolidation of the specialty joint venture in brazil, and abcs's growth in its canadian operations. as a percentage of revenue, gross profit margin in other of 19.13% in the current fiscal year decreased from 19.90% in the prior fiscal year.
we recognized gains from antitrust litigation settlements with pharmaceutical manufacturers of $145.9 million and $35.9 million during the fiscal years ended september 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. the gains were recorded as reductions to cost of goods sold (see note 14 of the notes to consolidated financial statements).

distribution, selling, and administrative expenses increased 8.3%, or $203.2 million, from the prior fiscal year. as a percentage of revenue, distribution, selling, and administrative expenses were 1.48% in the current fiscal year, and represents a 2 basis point increase compared to the prior fiscal year. pharmaceutical distribution services' segment expenses increased by 10.2% from the prior fiscal year primarily due to an increase in costs to support revenue growth, the january 2018 consolidation of profarma, and the january 2018 acquisition of h.d. smith. distribution, selling, and administrative expenses in other increased by 2.7% in the current fiscal year due to an increase in costs to support revenue growth at mwi, and the january 2018 consolidation of the specialty joint venture in brazil, offset in part by a reduction in distribution, selling, and administrative expenses at abcs.
depreciation expense increased 3.9% from the prior fiscal year primarily due to the january 2018 acquisition of h.d. smith and the january 2018 consolidation of profarma. amortization expense decreased 7.6% from the prior fiscal year primarily due to the impairment of pharmedium intangible assets recorded in march 2019, offset in part by the amortization of intangible assets originating from our january 2018 acquisition of h.d. smith and the january 2018 consolidation of profarma.
employee severance, litigation, and other in the fiscal year ended september 30, 2019 included $34.1 million of severance costs primarily related to pharmedium restructuring activities, position eliminations resulting from our business transformation efforts and the integration of h.d. smith, and restructuring activities related to our consulting business, $185.1 million of litigation costs that consisted of legal settlements totaling $116.7 million and legal fees in connection with opioid lawsuits and investigations, $55.4 million related to our business transformation efforts, $43.2 million of acquisition-related deal and integration costs (primarily related to the integration of h.d. smith), and $12.6 million of other restructuring initiatives.
employee severance, litigation, and other in the fiscal year ended september 30, 2018 included $36.7 million of severance costs primarily related to position eliminations resulting from our business transformation efforts and restructuring activities related to our consulting business, $61.5 million of litigation costs primarily related to legal fees in connection with opioid lawsuits and investigations, and related initiatives, $33.9 million of acquisition-related deal and integration costs (primarily related to h.d. smith), $33.0 million related to our business transformation efforts, and $18.4 million of other restructuring initiatives.

pharmaceutical distribution services operating income increased 2.7%, or $44.5 million, from the prior fiscal year primarily due to the increase in gross profit, offset in part by an increase in operating expenses. as a percentage of revenue, pharmaceutical distribution services operating income margin decreased 4 basis points from the prior fiscal year primarily due to a lower contribution from our pharmaceutical compounding operations.
operating income in other increased 7.2%, or $25.6 million, from the prior fiscal year primarily due to the increase in gross profit, offset in part by an increase in operating expenses.
we recorded a $13.7 million gain on the sale of an equity investment in other (income) loss in the fiscal year ended september 30, 2019.
interest expense, net decreased 9.7%, or $16.9 million, from the prior fiscal year. the decrease in interest expense, net from the prior fiscal year was due to an increase in interest income due to a $752 million increase in our average invested cash balance during the current fiscal year and an increase in investment interest rates, offset in part by an increase in interest expense due to the december 2017 issuance of senior notes to finance our january 2018 acquisition of h.d. smith and the january 2018 consolidation of profarma's debt and related interest expense.
our interest expense in future periods may vary significantly depending upon changes in net borrowings, interest rates, amendments to our current borrowing facilities, and strategic decisions to deploy our invested cash.
for the fiscal year ended september 30, 2018, we recorded a $42.3 million loss in connection with the january 2018 consolidations of profarma and the specialty joint venture in brazil and a $23.8 million loss on the early retirement of our $400 million of 4.875% senior notes that were due in 2019. the loss on the early retirement of the debt included a $22.3 million prepayment premium and $1.5 million of an unamortized debt discount and unamortized debt issuance costs.
our effective tax rates were 11.7% and (37.2)% in the fiscal years ended september 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. our effective tax rate in the fiscal year ended september 30, 2019 was primarily impacted by the $570.0 million impairment of long-lived assets (see note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements) and legal settlements, which changed the mix of domestic and international income. the effective tax rate in the fiscal year ended september 30, 2019 was also impacted by a $37.0 million decrease to the company's transition tax related to the 2017 tax act. our effective tax rate in the fiscal year ended september 30, 2018 was primarily impacted by the effect of 2017 tax act. our total income tax benefit in the fiscal year ended september 30, 2018 of $438.5 million reflects $612.6 million of tax benefits recognized and a reduction in the u.s. federal income tax rate from 35% to 21%, both resulting from the 2017 tax act. additionally, during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, a portion of a 2017 legal settlement charge was determined to be deductible, which favorably impacted our effective tax rate for the fiscal year ended september 30, 2018. our effective tax rates for the fiscal years ended september 30, 2019 and 2018 were also favorably impacted by the company's international businesses in switzerland and ireland, which have lower income tax rates, and the benefit from stock option exercises and restricted stock vesting.
net income and earnings per share were significantly lower in the current fiscal year primarily due to the $570.0 million impairment of long-lived assets and the significant income tax benefit recognized in the prior fiscal year as a result of the 2017 tax act.
the pharmaceutical distribution services segment grew its revenue by 9.7% from the prior fiscal year primarily due to the growth of some of its largest customers, overall market growth, and especially strong oncology product sales. in addition, revenue increased in the prior fiscal year due to the january 2018 acquisition of h.d. smith and the january 2018 consolidation of profarma.
revenue in other increased 10.2% from the prior fiscal year, primarily due to the january 2018 consolidation of the specialty joint venture in brazil, abcs's growth in its canadian operations, and increased revenue from mwi and world courier, offset in part by a decrease in revenue at abcs's lash consulting group.

gross profit increased 1.5%, or $66.3 million, from the prior fiscal year. gross profit in the fiscal year ended september 30, 2018 was favorably impacted by increases in gross profit in pharmaceutical distribution services and other and an increase in gains from antitrust litigation settlements. gross profit was negatively impacted by an increase in lifo expense in comparison to the prior fiscal year, pharmedium remediation costs, and an estimated assessment related to the new york state opioid stewardship act.
pharmaceutical distribution services gross profit increased 8.9%, or $284.1 million, from the prior fiscal year primarily due to the increase in revenue, the january 2018 consolidation of profarma, and the january 2018 acquisition of h.d. smith, offset in part by a lower contribution from our pharmaceutical compounding operations as it shipped fewer units as we voluntarily suspended production in december 2017 at our memphis facility. as a percentage of revenue, pharmaceutical distribution services gross profit margin of 2.14% in the fiscal year ended september 30, 2018 decreased 2 basis points from the prior fiscal year. the decrease in gross profit margin from the prior fiscal year was primarily due to a lower contribution from our pharmaceutical compounding operations and due to increased sales to our larger customers, which typically have lower gross profit margins, offset in part by the january 2018 consolidation of profarma and the january 2018 acquisition of h.d. smith.
gross profit in other increased 4.6%, or $55.9 million, from the prior fiscal year primarily due to world courier and the january 2018 consolidation of the specialty joint venture in brazil, offset in part by lower gross profit at abcs, specifically the lash consulting group. as a percentage of revenue, gross profit margin in other of 19.90% in the fiscal year ended september 30, 2018 decreased from 20.96% in the prior fiscal year. the decline in gross profit margin from the prior fiscal year was primarily due to the decrease in gross profit margin at abcs, specifically the lash consulting group.
we recognized gains from antitrust litigation settlements with pharmaceutical manufacturers of $35.9 million and $1.4 million during the fiscal years ended september 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. the gains were recorded as reductions to cost of goods sold (see note 14 of the notes to consolidated financial statements).
employee severance, litigation, and other             183,520                   959,327
distribution, selling, and administrative expenses decreased 15.6%, or $331.6 million, from the prior fiscal year as the pharmaceutical distribution services' segment expenses increased by 19.4% from the prior fiscal year primarily due to the january 2018 consolidation of profarma, the january 2018 acquisition of h.d. smith, and the duplicate costs resulting from the implementation of new information technology systems. distribution, selling, and administrative expenses in other increased by 8.2% in the fiscal year ended september 30, 2018 primarily to support its revenue growth, the january 2018 consolidation of the specialty joint venture in brazil, and due to duplicate costs resulting from the implementation of new information technology systems. as a percentage of revenue, distribution, selling, and administrative expenses were 1.46% in the fiscal year ended september 30, 2018, and represents a 7 basis point increase compared to the prior fiscal year. the increase in expense as a percentage of revenue in comparison to the prior fiscal year was primarily due to the january 2018 consolidation of profarma and the specialty joint venture in brazil.
depreciation expense increased 19.8% from the prior fiscal year due to an increase in the amount of property and equipment placed into service relating to our distribution infrastructure and various technology assets. amortization expense increased 12.9% from the prior fiscal year primarily due to the amortization of intangible assets originating from our january 2018 acquisition of h.d. smith and the january 2018 consolidation of profarma.
employee severance, litigation, and other in the fiscal year ended september 30, 2018 included $36.7 million of severance costs primarily related to position eliminations resulting from our business transformation efforts and restructuring activities related to our consulting business, $61.5 million of litigation costs primarily related to legal fees in connection with opioid lawsuits and investigations, and related initiatives, $33.9 million of acquisition-related deal and integration costs (primarily related to h.d. smith), $33.0 million related to our business transformation efforts, and $18.4 million of other restructuring initiatives.
employee severance, litigation, and other in the fiscal year ended september 30, 2017 included $7.8 million of employee severance costs primarily related to position eliminations as we began to reorganize to further align our organization to our customers' needs, $917.6 million of litigation costs primarily related to litigation settlements and accruals, $17.0 million of acquisition-related deal and integration costs, $13.3 million of other restructuring initiatives, and $3.7 million related to our business transformation efforts.

pharmaceutical distribution services operating income decreased 1.0%, or $16.9 million, from the prior fiscal year primarily due to an increase in operating expenses, offset in part by an increase in gross profit. as a percentage of revenue, pharmaceutical distribution services operating income margin decreased 10 basis points from the prior fiscal year primarily due to a lower contribution from our pharmaceutical compounding operations as it shipped fewer units as we voluntarily suspended production in december 2017 at our memphis facility.
we recorded a $59.7 million goodwill impairment charge at our profarma reporting unit in connection with our annual goodwill impairment assessment.
interest expense, net increased 20.3%, or $29.5 million, from the prior fiscal year. the increase in interest expense, net from the prior fiscal year was primarily due to the december 2017 issuance of senior notes to finance our january 2018 acquisition of h.d. smith and the january 2018 consolidation of profarma's debt and related interest expense. average borrowings increased by $519.8 million in the current fiscal year in comparison to the prior fiscal year.
in connection with our incremental brazil investments, we adjusted the carrying values of our previously held equity interests in profarma and the specialty joint venture to equal their fair values. the adjustments resulted in a loss of $42.3 million, which was comprised of foreign currency translation adjustments from accumulated other comprehensive loss of $45.9 million, a $12.4 million gain on the remeasurement of profarma's previously held interest, and an $8.8 million loss on the remeasurement of the specialty joint venture's previously held equity interest (see note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements).
our effective tax rates were (37.2)% and 60.3% in the fiscal years ended september 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. our effective tax rate in the fiscal year ended september 30, 2018 was primarily impacted by the effect of the 2017 tax act. our total income tax benefit in the fiscal year ended september 30, 2018 of $438.5 million reflects $612.6 million of tax benefits recognized and a reduction in the u.s. federal income tax rate from 35% to 21%, both resulting from the 2017 tax act. additionally, during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, a portion of a 2017 legal settlement charge was determined to be deductible, which favorably impacted our effective tax rate for the fiscal year ended september 30, 2018. the effective tax rate for the fiscal year ended september 30, 2017 was negatively impacted by non-deductible legal settlement charges. our effective tax rates for the fiscal years ended september 30, 2018 and 2017 were favorably impacted by our international businesses in switzerland and ireland, which have lower income tax rates, and the benefit from stock option exercises and restricted stock vesting.
critical accounting policies and estimates critical accounting policies are those policies that involve accounting estimates and assumptions that can have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations and require the use of complex and subjective estimates based upon past experience and management's judgment. actual results may differ from these estimates due to uncertainties inherent in such estimates. below are those policies applied in preparing our financial statements that management believes are the most dependent upon the application of estimates and assumptions. for a complete list of significant accounting policies, see note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements.
allowances for returns and doubtful accounts trade receivables are primarily comprised of amounts owed to us for our pharmaceutical distribution and services activities and are presented net of an allowance for customer sales returns and an allowance for doubtful accounts. our customer sales return policy generally allows customers to return products only if the products can be resold at full value or returned to suppliers for full credit. we record an accrual for estimated customer sales returns at the time of sale to the customer based upon historical customer return trends. the allowance for returns as of september 30, 2019 and 2018 was $1,147.5 million and $988.8 million, respectively.
in determining the appropriate allowance for doubtful accounts, we consider a combination of factors, such as the aging of trade receivables, industry trends, and our customers' financial strength, credit standing, and payment and default history. changes in the aforementioned factors, among others, may lead to adjustments in our allowance for doubtful accounts. the calculation of the required allowance requires judgment by our management as to the impact of these and other factors on the ultimate realization of our trade receivables. each of our business units performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers' financial condition and maintains reserves for probable bad debt losses based upon historical experience and for specific credit problems when they arise. we write off balances against the reserves when collectability is deemed remote. each business unit performs formal, documented reviews of the allowance at least quarterly, and our largest business units perform such reviews monthly. there were no significant changes to this process during the fiscal years ended september 30, 2019, 2018, and 2017, and bad debt expense was computed in a consistent manner during these periods. the bad debt expense for any period presented is equal to the changes in the period end allowance for doubtful accounts, net of write-offs, recoveries, and other adjustments.
business combinations the assets acquired and liabilities assumed upon the acquisition or consolidation of a business are recorded at fair value, with the residual of the purchase price allocated to goodwill. we engage third-party appraisal firms to assist management in determining the fair values of certain assets acquired and liabilities assumed. such valuations require management to make significant judgments, estimates, and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. management makes estimates of fair value based upon assumptions it believes to be reasonable. these estimates are based upon historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain. critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets include, but are not limited to: discount rates and expected future cash flows from and economic lives of customer relationships, trade names, existing technology, and other intangible assets. unanticipated events and circumstances may occur, which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions or estimates.
goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill arises from acquisitions or consolidations of specific operating companies and is assigned to the reporting unit in which a particular operating company resides. we identify our reporting units based upon our management reporting structure, beginning with our operating segments. we aggregate two or more components within an operating segment that have similar economic characteristics. we evaluate whether the components within our operating segments have similar economic characteristics, which include the similarity of long-term gross margins, the nature of the components' products, services, and production processes, the types of customers and the methods by which products or services are delivered to customers, and the components' regulatory environment. our reporting units include pharmaceutical distribution services, profarma, abcs, world courier, and mwi.
goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives, such as certain trademarks and trade names, are not amortized; rather, they are tested for impairment at least annually. for the purpose of these impairment tests, we can elect to perform a qualitative assessment to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair values of its reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets are less than the respective carrying values of those reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets, respectively. such qualitative factors can include, among other, industry and market conditions, overall financial performance, and relevant entity-specific events. if we conclude based on our qualitative assessment that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, we perform a quantitative analysis. we elected to perform a qualitative impairment assessment of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, with the exception of our testing in the profarma reporting unit. in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 and 2017, we elected to bypass performing the qualitative assessment and went directly to performing our annual quantitative assessments of the goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets.
the quantitative goodwill impairment test requires us to compare the carrying value of the reporting unit's net assets to the fair value of the reporting unit. if the fair value exceeds the carrying value, no further evaluation is required, and no impairment loss is recognized. if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, the difference between the carrying value and the fair value is recorded as an impairment loss, the amount of which may not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit.
when performing a quantitative impairment assessment, we utilize an income-based approach to value our reporting units, with the exception of the profarma reporting unit, the fair value of which is based upon its publicly-traded stock price, plus an estimated control premium. the income-based approach relies on a discounted cash flow analysis, which considers forecasted cash flows discounted at an appropriate discount rate, to determine the fair value of each reporting unit. we generally believe that market participants would use a discounted cash flow analysis to determine the fair value of our reporting units in a sale transaction. the annual goodwill impairment test requires us to make a number of assumptions and estimates concerning future levels of revenue growth, operating margins, depreciation, amortization, capital expenditures, and working capital requirements, which are based upon our long-range plan. the discount rate is an estimate of the overall after-tax rate of return required by a market participant whose weighted average cost of capital includes both debt and equity, including a risk premium. while we use the best available information to prepare our cash flows and discount rate assumptions, actual future cash flows and/or market conditions could differ significantly resulting in future impairment charges related to recorded goodwill balances. while there are always changes in assumptions to reflect changing business and market conditions, our overall methodology and the population of assumptions used have remained unchanged.
the quantitative impairment test for indefinite-lived intangibles other than goodwill (certain trademarks and trade names) consists of a comparison of the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset to the carrying value of the asset as of the impairment testing date. we estimate the fair value of our indefinite-lived intangibles using the relief from royalty method. we believe the relief from royalty method is a widely used valuation technique for such assets. the fair value derived from the relief from royalty method is measured as the discounted cash flow savings realized from owning such indefinite-lived trademarks and trade names and not having to pay a royalty for their use.
we completed our required annual impairment tests of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets in the fourth quarter of the fiscal years ended september 30, 2019, 2018, and 2017. we recorded a goodwill impairment of $59.7 million in our profarma reporting unit in connection with our fiscal 2018 annual impairment test (see note 5 of the notes to consolidated financial statements). no goodwill impairments were recorded in the fiscal years ended september 30, 2019 and 2017. no indefinite-lived intangible impairments were recorded in the fiscal years ended september 30, 2019, 2018, and 2017.
we perform a recoverability assessment of our long-lived assets when impairment indicators are present.
pharmedium's long-lived assets were tested for recoverability in fiscal 2019 and 2018 due to the existence of impairment indicators. after u.s. food and drug administration ("fda") inspections of pharmedium compounding facilities, we voluntarily suspended production activities in december 2017 at our largest compounding facility located in memphis, tennessee pending execution of certain remedial measures. on may 17, 2019, pharmedium reached an agreement on the terms of a consent decree (the "consent decree") with the fda and the consumer protection branch of the civil division of the department of justice ("doj") that was entered by the united states district court for the northern district of illinois on may 22, 2019. the consent decree permits commercial operations to continue at pharmedium's dayton, new jersey and sugar land, texas compounding facilities and administrative operations to continue at its lake forest, illinois headquarters subject to compliance with requirements set forth therein. as required by the consent decree, initial audit inspections were conducted by an independent cgmp expert of the dayton and sugar land facilities. the cgmp expert has notified the fda that all of the short-term corrective actions taken are acceptable. pharmedium has submitted to the fda several additional longer-term corrective actions, and the independent cgmp expert will assess the effectiveness of the implementation of these items in future audits. additional audit inspections by the independent cgmp expert of the sugar land and dayton facilities are also required at least annually for a period of four years.
the consent decree also establishes requirements that must be satisfied prior to the resumption of commercial operations at the memphis, tennessee facility. the requirements include a work plan approved by the fda and an audit inspection and certification by an independent cgmp expert that the facilities, methods and controls at the memphis facility and pharmedium's lake forest, illinois headquarters comply with the consent decree. if pharmedium receives written notification from the fda of compliance with the requirements to resume operations at the memphis facility, additional audit inspections are required for five years, during which time pharmedium must correct any deviations from the consent decree observed by the independent cgmp expert.
after five years, pharmedium may petition the district court for full relief from the consent decree, or for specific relief with regard to one or more facilities. if, at the time of such petition, all obligations under the consent decree with respect to the specific facilities for which pharmedium is seeking relief have been satisfied, and there has been continuous compliance with the consent decree for at least five years, the federal government will not oppose the petition, and pharmedium may request that the district court grant such relief.
as a result of the suspension of production activities at pharmedium's compounding facility located in memphis, tennessee and the aforementioned regulatory matters, we performed a recoverability assessment of pharmedium's long-lived assets and recorded a $570.0 million impairment loss in the quarter ended march 31, 2019 for the amount that the carrying value of the pharmedium asset group exceeded its fair value. prior to the impairment, the carrying value of the asset group was $792 million. the fair value of the asset group was $222 million as of march 31, 2019. the pharmedium asset group is included in the pharmaceutical distribution services reportable segment. significant assumptions used in estimating the fair value of pharmedium's asset group included (i) a 15% discount rate, which contemplated a higher risk at pharmedium; (ii) the period in which pharmedium will resume production at or near capacity; and (iii) the estimated ebitda (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) margins when considering the likelihood of higher operating and compliance costs. we believe that our fair value assumptions were representative of market participant assumptions; however, the forecasted cash flows used to estimate fair value and measure the related impairment are inherently uncertain and include assumptions that could differ from actual results in future periods. this represents a level 3 nonrecurring fair value measurement. we allocated $522.1 million of the impairment to finite-lived intangibles ($420.8 million of customer relationships, $79.9 million of a trade name, and $21.4 million of software technology) and $47.9 million of the impairment to property and equipment.
we updated our recoverability assessment of pharmedium's long-lived assets as of september 30, 2019. we concluded that pharmedium's long-lived assets were recoverable as of september 30, 2019.
income taxes our income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities, and uncertain tax positions reflect management's assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid on items in the financial statements. deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between financial reporting and tax reporting bases of assets and liabilities, as well as net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards for tax purposes.
we have established a valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets for which the ultimate realization of future benefits is uncertain. expiring carryforwards and the required valuation allowances are adjusted annually. after application of the valuation allowances described above, we anticipate that no limitations will apply with respect to utilization of any of the other deferred income tax assets described above.
we prepare and file tax returns based upon our interpretation of tax laws and regulations and record estimates based upon these judgments and interpretations. in the normal course of business, our tax returns are subject to examination by various taxing authorities. such examinations may result in future tax and interest assessments by these taxing authorities. inherent uncertainties exist in estimates of tax contingencies due to changes in tax law resulting from legislation, regulation, and/or as concluded through the various jurisdictions' tax court systems. significant judgment is exercised in applying complex tax laws and regulations across multiple global jurisdictions where we conduct our operations. we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes, based upon the technical merits of the position.
we believe that our estimates for the valuation allowances against deferred tax assets and the amount of benefits recognized in our financial statements for uncertain tax positions are appropriate based upon current facts and circumstances. however, others applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances could develop a different estimate and the amount ultimately paid upon resolution of issues raised may differ from the amounts accrued.
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. cost for approximately 75% of our inventories as of september 30, 2019 and 2018 has been determined using the lifo method. if we had used the first-in, first-out method of inventory valuation, which approximates current replacement cost, inventories would have been approximately $1,511.8 million and $1,534.4 million higher than the amounts reported as of september 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. we recorded lifo credits of $22.5 million and $157.8 million in the fiscal years ended september 30, 2019 and 2017, respectively. we recorded lifo expense of $67.3 million in the fiscal year ended september 30, 2018. the annual lifo provision is affected by changes in inventory quantities, product mix, and manufacturer pricing practices, which may be impacted by market and other external influences, many of which are difficult to predict. changes to any of the above factors can have a material impact to our annual lifo provision.
loss contingencies in the ordinary course of business, we become involved in lawsuits, administrative proceedings, government subpoenas, government investigations, and other disputes, including antitrust, commercial, environmental, product liability, intellectual property, regulatory, employment discrimination, and other matters. significant damages or penalties may be sought in some matters, and some matters may require years to resolve. we record a liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable. we also perform an assessment of the materiality of loss contingencies where a loss is either not probable or it is reasonably possible that a loss could be incurred in excess of amounts accrued. if a loss or an additional loss has at least a reasonable possibility of occurring and the impact on the financial statements would be material, we provide disclosure of the loss contingency in the footnotes to our financial statements. we review all contingencies at least quarterly to determine whether the likelihood of loss has changed and to assess whether a reasonable estimate of the loss or the range of the loss can be made. among the loss contingencies we considered in accordance with the foregoing in connection with the preparation of the accompanying financial statements were the opioid matters described in note 13 of the notes to consolidated financial statements. although we are not able to predict the outcome or reasonably estimate a range of possible losses in these matters, an adverse judgment or negotiated resolution in any of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, consolidated financial position, cash flows or liquidity.
liquidity and capital resources the following illustrates our debt structure as of september 30, 2019, including availability under the multi-currency revolving credit facility, the receivables securitization facility, the revolving credit note, and the overdraft facility:
(in thousands)                                            outstandingbalance   additionalavailability fixed-rate debt:
revolving credit note                                             -            75,000
overdraft facility due 2021 (£30,000)                        32,573            4,314
receivables securitization facility due 2022                350,000            1,100,000
multi-currency revolving credit facility due 2024                 -            1,400,000
our operating results have generated cash flows, which, together with availability under our debt agreements and credit terms from suppliers, have provided sufficient capital resources to finance working capital and cash operating requirements, and to fund capital expenditures, acquisitions, repayment of debt, the payment of interest on outstanding debt, dividends, and repurchases of shares of our common stock.
our primary ongoing cash requirements will be to finance working capital, fund the repayment of debt, fund the payment of interest on debt, fund repurchases of our common stock, fund the payment of dividends, finance acquisitions, and fund capital expenditures and routine growth and expansion through new business opportunities. future cash flows from operations and borrowings are expected to be sufficient to fund our ongoing cash requirements.
as discussed in the risk factors and in note 13 of the notes to consolidated financial statements, we are a party to discussions with the objective of reaching potential terms of a broad resolution of the remaining opioid-litigation and claims. although we are not able to predict the outcome or reasonably estimate a range of possible losses in these matters, an adverse judgment or negotiated resolution in any of these matters could have a material adverse impact on our financial position, cash flows or liquidity.
as of september 30, 2019 and 2018, our cash and cash equivalents held by foreign subsidiaries were $826.8 million and $842.5 million, respectively, and are generally based in u.s. dollar denominated holdings. our position is that we are not permanently reinvested with respect to foreign subsidiaries whose undistributed earnings are able to be repatriated with minimal to no additional tax impact. in fiscal year ended september 30, 2019, we repatriated $350.0 million of cash held by foreign subsidiaries to use for general corporate purposes.
we have increased seasonal needs related to our inventory build during the december and march quarters that, depending on our cash balance, may require the use of our credit facilities to fund short-term capital needs. our cash balance in the fiscal years ended september 30, 2019 and 2018 needed to be supplemented by intra-period credit facility borrowings to cover short-term working capital needs. the largest amount of intra-period borrowings under our revolving and securitization credit facilities that was outstanding at any one time during the fiscal years ended september 30, 2019 and 2018 was $240.6 million and $1,508.2 million, respectively. we had $606.0 million, $25,115.3 million, and $9,324.7 million of cumulative intra-period borrowings that were repaid under our credit facilities during the fiscal years ended september 30, 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively.
we used the proceeds from the 2027 notes and the 2047 notes to finance the early retirement of our $400 million of 4.875% senior notes that were due in 2019, including the payment of a $22.3 million prepayment premium, and to finance the acquisition of h.d. smith, which was completed in january 2018.
we have a $1.4 billion multi-currency senior unsecured revolving credit facility ("multi-currency revolving credit facility") with a syndicate of lenders, which was scheduled to expire in october 2023. in september 2019, we entered into an amendment to, among other things, extend the maturity to september 2024. interest on borrowings under the multi-currency revolving credit facility accrues at specified rates based upon our debt rating and ranges from 70 basis points to 112.5 basis points over cdor/libor/euribor/bankers acceptance stamping fee, as applicable (91 basis points over cdor/libor/euribor/bankers acceptance stamping fee as of september 30, 2019) and from 0 basis points to 12.5 basis points over the alternate base rate and canadian prime rate, as applicable. we pay facility fees to maintain the availability under the multi-currency revolving credit facility at specified rates based upon our debt rating, ranging from 5 basis points to 12.5 basis points, annually, of the total commitment (9 basis points as of september 30, 2019). we may choose to repay or reduce our commitments under the multi-currency revolving credit facility at any time. the multi-currency revolving credit facility contains covenants, including compliance with a financial leverage ratio test, as well as others that impose limitations on, among other things, indebtedness of subsidiaries and asset sales, with which we were compliant as of september 30, 2019.
we have a commercial paper program whereby we may from time to time issue short-term promissory notes in an aggregate amount of up to $1.4 billion at any one time. amounts available under the program may be borrowed, repaid, and re-borrowed from time to time. the maturities on the notes will vary, but may not exceed 365 days from the date of issuance. the notes will bear interest, if interest bearing, or will be sold at a discount from their face amounts. the commercial paper program does not increase our borrowing capacity as it is fully backed by our multi-currency revolving credit facility. there were no borrowings outstanding under our commercial paper program as of september 30, 2019 and 2018.
we have a $1,450 million receivables securitization facility ("receivables securitization facility"), which was scheduled to expire in october 2021. in september 2019, we entered into an amendment to extend the maturity to september 2022. we have available to us an accordion feature whereby the commitment on the receivables securitization facility may be increased by up to $250 million, subject to lender approval, for seasonal needs during the december and march quarters. interest rates are based upon prevailing market rates for short-term commercial paper or libor plus a program fee. we pay a customary unused fee at prevailing market rates, annually, to maintain the availability under the receivables securitization facility. the receivables securitization facility contains similar covenants to the multi-currency revolving credit facility, with which we were compliant as of september 30, 2019.
in april 2019, we elected to repay $150.0 million of our outstanding receivables securitization facility balance prior to the scheduled maturity date.
in connection with the receivables securitization facility, amerisourcebergen drug corporation sells on a revolving basis certain accounts receivable to amerisource receivables financial corporation, a wholly-owned special purpose entity, which in turn sells a percentage ownership interest in the receivables to financial institutions and commercial paper conduits sponsored by financial institutions. amerisourcebergen drug corporation is the servicer of the accounts receivable under the receivables securitization facility. as sold receivables are collected, additional receivables may be sold up to the maximum amount available under the facility. we use the facility as a financing vehicle because it generally offers an attractive interest rate relative to other financing sources.
we have an uncommitted, unsecured line of credit available to us pursuant to a revolving credit note ("revolving credit note"). the revolving credit note provides us with the ability to request short-term unsecured revolving credit loans from time to time in a principal amount not to exceed $75 million. the revolving credit note may be decreased or terminated by the bank or us at any time without prior notice. we also have a £30 million uncommitted u.k. overdraft facility ("overdraft facility"), which expires in february 2021, to fund short-term, normal trading cycle fluctuations related to our mwi business.
in october 2018, we refinanced $400 million of outstanding term loans by issuing a new $400 million variable-rate term loan ("october 2018 term loan"), which matures in october 2020. the october 2018 term loan bears interest at a rate equal to a base rate or libor, plus a margin of 65 basis points. the october 2018 term loan contains similar covenants to the multi-currency revolving credit facility, with which we were compliant as of september 30, 2019
in addition to the 2027 notes and the 2047 notes, both of which were issued in the fiscal year ended september 30, 2018, we have $500 million of 3.50% senior notes due november 15, 2021, $500 million of 3.40% senior notes due may 15, 2024, $500 million of 3.25% senior notes due march 1, 2025, and $500 million of 4.25% senior notes due march 1, 2045 (collectively, the "notes"). interest on the notes is payable semiannually in arrears.
nonrecourse debt is comprised of short-term and long-term debt belonging to the brazil subsidiaries and is repaid solely from the brazil subsidiaries' cash flows and such debt agreements provide that the repayment of the loans (and interest thereon) is secured solely by the capital stock, physical assets, contracts, and cash flows of the brazil subsidiaries.
in september 2016, we entered into an accelerated share repurchase ("asr") transaction with a financial institution and paid $400.0 million for shares of our common stock. the initial payment of $400.0 million funded stock purchases of $380.0 million and a share holdback of $20.0 million. the asr transaction was settled in november 2016, at which time the financial institution delivered additional shares to us. the number of shares ultimately received was based upon the volume-weighted average price of our common stock during the term of the asr. we applied the $400.0 million asr to the may 2016 share repurchase program. during the fiscal year ended september 30, 2017, we purchased an additional $118.8 million of our common stock to complete our authorization under this program.
in november 2016, our board of directors authorized a share repurchase program allowing us to purchase up to $1.0 billion in shares of our common stock, subject to market conditions. during the fiscal year ended september 30, 2017, we purchased $211.1 million under this share repurchase program. during the fiscal year ended september 30, 2018, we purchased $663.1 million of our common stock under this program, which included $24.0 million of september 2018 purchases that cash settled in october 2018. during the fiscal year ended september 30, 2019, we purchased $125.8 million of our common stock under this program, which excluded $24.0 million of september 2018 purchases that cash settled in october 2018, to complete our authorization under this program.
in october 2018, our board of directors authorized a new share repurchase program allowing us to purchase up to $1.0 billion of our shares of common stock, subject to market conditions. during the fiscal year ended september 30, 2019, we purchased $538.9 million of our common stock under this program, which included $14.8 million of september 2019 purchases that cash settled in october 2019. as of september 30, 2019, we had $461.1 million of availability remaining under this program.
the following is a summary of our contractual obligations for future principal and interest payments on our debt, minimum rental payments on our noncancelable operating leases and financing obligations, and minimum payments on our other commitments as of september 30, 2019:
payments due by period (in thousands)                                               debt, including interest payments                                                                operating leases                                                         financing obligations 1                                                               other commitments                                                                           total within 1 year                                                                            $260,630                                                                         $94,958                                                                         $22,468                                                                        $107,167                                                                        $485,223
1 represents the portion of future minimum lease payments relating to facility leases where we were determined to be the accounting owner (see note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements). these payments are recognized as reductions to the financing obligation and as interest expense and exclude the future non-cash termination of the financing obligation.
the 2017 tax act requires a one-time transition tax to be recognized on historical foreign earnings and profits. we currently estimate that our liability related to the transition tax is $182.6 million, net of overpayments and tax credits, as of september 30, 2019, which is payable in installments over a six-year period commencing in january 2021. the transition tax commitment is included in "other commitments" in the above table.
our liability for uncertain tax positions was $124.2 million (including interest and penalties) as of september 30, 2019. this liability represents an estimate of tax positions that we have taken in our tax returns which may ultimately not be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities. since the amount and timing of any future cash settlements cannot be predicted with reasonable certainty, the estimated liability has been excluded from the above contractual obligations table.
during the fiscal years ended september 30, 2019 and 2018, our operating activities provided cash of $2,344.0 million and $1,411.4 million, respectively. cash provided by operations in the fiscal year ended september 30, 2019 was principally the result of an increase in accounts payable of $1,561.0 million, non-cash items of $1,120.7 million, and net income of $854.1 million, offset in part by an increase in accounts receivable of $1,241.9 million. the increase in accounts payable was primarily driven by the timing of scheduled payments to suppliers. non-cash items were comprised primarily of a $570 million impairment of pharmedium's long-lived assets (see note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements), $321.1 million of depreciation expense, and $176.4 million of amortization expense. the increase in accounts receivable was the result of our revenue growth and the timing of payments from our customers.
deterioration of general economic conditions, among other factors, could adversely affect the number of prescriptions that are filled and the amount of pharmaceutical products purchased by consumers and, therefore, could reduce purchases by our customers. in addition, volatility in financial markets may also negatively impact our customers' ability to obtain credit to finance their businesses on acceptable terms. reduced purchases by our customers or changes in the ability of our customers to remit payments to us could adversely affect our revenue growth, our profitability, and our cash flow from operations.
we use days sales outstanding, days inventory on hand, and days payable outstanding to evaluate our working capital performance. the below financial metrics are calculated based upon an annual average and can be impacted by the timing of cash receipts and disbursements, which can vary significantly depending upon the day of the week in which the month ends.
our cash flows from operating activities can vary significantly from period to period based upon fluctuations in our period end working capital. additionally, any changes to payment terms with a significant customer or manufacturer supplier could have a material impact to our cash flows from operations. operating cash flows during the fiscal year ended september 30, 2019 included $167.4 million of interest payments and $117.7 million of income tax payments, net of refunds. operating cash flows during the fiscal year ended september 30, 2018 included $162.1 million of interest payments and $104.0 million of income tax payments, net of refunds. operating cash flows during the fiscal year ended september 30, 2017 included $125.3 million of interest payments and $105.0 million of income tax payments, net of refunds.
during the fiscal years ended september 30, 2018 and 2017, our operating activities provided cash of $1,411.4 million and $1,504.1 million, respectively. cash provided by operations in the fiscal year ended september 30, 2018 was principally the result of net income of $1,615.9 million, an increase in accounts payable of $859.0 million, an increase in income taxes payable of $209.9 million, offset in part by an increase in accounts receivable of $657.8 million and a decrease in accrued expenses and other liabilities of $551.1 million. the increase in accounts payable was primarily driven by the timing of scheduled payments to our suppliers. the increase in income taxes payable was primarily driven by a one-time transition tax on historical foreign earnings and profits through december 31, 2017 in connection with tax reform. the decrease in accrued expenses was primarily driven by the payment of a legal settlement of $625.0 million, plus interest (see note 13 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements). the increase in accounts receivable was the result of our revenue growth and the timing of payments from our customers. non-cash items were comprised primarily of a $795.5 million deferred income tax benefit, $318.5 million of depreciation expense, and $191.6 million of amortization expense. the deferred income tax benefit was primarily the result of applying a lower u.s. federal income tax rate to our net deferred tax liabilities as of december 31, 2017 in connection with tax reform.
capital expenditures in the fiscal years ended september 30, 2019, 2018, and 2017 were $310.2 million, $336.4 million, and $466.4 million, respectively. significant capital expenditures in fiscal 2019 included costs associated with the construction of a new support facility and technology initiatives, including costs related to enhancing and upgrading our information technology systems. significant capital expenditures in fiscal 2018 and 2017 included technology initiatives, including costs related to enhancing and upgrading our information technology systems and costs associated with expanding distribution capacity.
we currently expect to spend approximately $400 million for capital expenditures during fiscal 2020. larger 2020 capital expenditures will include costs related to new facilities and various technology initiatives.
we acquired businesses to support our animal health business for $54.0 million and $70.0 million in the fiscal years ended september 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. in the fiscal year ended september 30, 2018, we acquired h.d. smith, the largest independent pharmaceutical wholesaler in the united states, for $815.0 million. in addition, we made incremental investments in brazil totaling $78.1 million. the cash used for the above investments was offset by $179.6 million of cash consolidated in connection with the brazil investments (see note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements).
net cash used in financing activities in the fiscal year ended september 30, 2019 principally resulted from $674.0 million in purchases of our common stock, and $339.0 million in cash dividends paid on our common stock.
net cash used in financing activities in the fiscal year ended september 30, 2018 principally included the early retirement of the $400 million of 4.875% senior notes, $639.2 million in purchases of our common stock, and $333.0 million in cash dividends paid on our common stock, offset in part by the issuance of $750.0 million of 3.45% senior notes and $500 million of 4.3% senior notes.
net cash provided by financing activities in the fiscal year ended september 30, 2017 primarily included the $600.0 million repayment of our 1.15% senior notes, $329.9 million in purchases of our common stock, and $320.3 million in cash dividends paid on our common stock.
we anticipate that we will continue to pay quarterly cash dividends in the future. however, the payment and amount of future dividends remain within the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon our future earnings, financial condition, capital requirements, and other factors.
market risk we have market risk exposure to interest rate fluctuations relating to our debt. we manage interest rate risk by using a combination of fixed-rate and variable-rate debt. the amount of variable-rate debt fluctuates during the year based on our working capital requirements. we had $0.9 billion of variable-rate debt outstanding as of september 30, 2019. we periodically evaluate financial instruments to manage our exposure to fixed and variable interest rates. however, there are no assurances that such instruments will be available in the combinations we want and/or on terms acceptable to us. there were no such financial instruments in effect as of september 30, 2019.
we have minimal exposure to foreign currency and exchange rate risk from our non-u.s. operations. our largest exposure to foreign exchange rates exists primarily with the euro, the u.k. pound sterling, the canadian dollar, and the brazilian real. revenue from our foreign operations is approximately two percent of our consolidated revenue. we may utilize foreign currency denominated forward contracts to hedge against changes in foreign exchange rates. we may use derivative instruments to hedge our foreign currency exposure, but not for speculative or trading purposes.

item 1a.   risk factors the company faces a number of uncertainties and risks that are difficult to predict and many of which are outside of the company's control. in addition to the other information in this report and the company's other filings with the sec, investors should consider carefully the factors set forth below. investors should be aware that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors and that the following is not meant to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties. if known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize, the company's business, results of operations or financial condition could be adversely affected, potentially in a material way.
global sales in the company's pharmaceutical and medical devices segments may be negatively impacted by healthcare reforms and increasing pricing pressures.
sales of the company's pharmaceutical and medical device products are significantly affected by reimbursements by third-party payers such as government healthcare programs, private insurance plans and managed care organizations. as part of various efforts to contain healthcare costs, these payers are putting downward pressure on prices at which products will be reimbursed. in the u.s., increased purchasing power of entities that negotiate on behalf of medicare, medicaid, and private sector beneficiaries, in part due to continued consolidation among health care providers, could result in further pricing pressures. in addition, increased political scrutiny could result in additional pricing pressures. outside the u.s., numerous major markets, including the eu and japan, have pervasive government involvement in funding healthcare and, in that regard, directly or indirectly impose price controls, limit access to, or reimbursement for, the company's products, or reduce the value of its intellectual property protection.
in the ordinary course of business, johnson & johnson and its subsidiaries are subject to numerous claims and lawsuits involving various issues such as patent disputes, product liability and claims that their product sales, marketing and pricing practices violate various antitrust, unfair trade practices and/or consumer protection laws. the most significant of these proceedings are described in note 21, "legal proceedings" under notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report. litigation, in general, and securities, derivative action, class action and multi-district litigation, in particular, can be expensive and disruptive. some of these matters may include thousands of plaintiffs or may be determined to be class actions and may involve parties seeking large and/or indeterminate amounts, including punitive or exemplary damages, and may remain unresolved for several years. for example, the company is a defendant in numerous lawsuits arising out of the use of body powders containing talc, primarily johnsonsÂ® baby powder, and the company's sale, manufacturing and marketing of opioids. while the company believes it has substantial defenses in these matters, it is not feasible to predict the ultimate outcome of litigation. the company could in the future be required to pay significant amounts as a result of settlements or judgments in these matters, potentially in excess of accruals, including matters where the company could be held jointly and severally liable among other defendants. the resolution of, or increase in accruals for, one or more of these matters in any reporting period could have a material adverse effect on the company's results of operations and cash flows for that period. furthermore, as a result of cost and availability factors, effective november 1, 2005, the company ceased purchasing third-party product liability insurance.
product reliability, safety and effectiveness concerns can have significant negative impacts on sales and results of operations, lead to litigation and cause reputational damage.
concerns about product safety, whether raised internally or by litigants, regulators or consumer advocates, and whether or not based on scientific evidence, can result in safety alerts, product recalls, governmental investigations, regulatory action on the part of the fda (or its counterpart in other countries), private claims and lawsuits, payment of fines and settlements, declining sales and reputational damage. these circumstances can also result in damage to brand image, brand equity and consumer trust in the company's products. product recalls have in the past, and could in the future, prompt government investigations and inspections, the shutdown of manufacturing facilities, continued product shortages and related sales declines, significant remediation costs, reputational damage, possible civil penalties and criminal prosecution.
changes in tax laws or exposures to additional tax liabilities could negatively impact the company's operating results.
changes in tax laws or regulations around the world could negatively impact the company's effective tax rate and results of operations. a change in statutory tax rate in any country would result in the revaluation of the company's deferred tax assets and liabilities related to that particular jurisdiction in the period in which the new tax law is enacted. this change would result in an expense or benefit recorded to the company's consolidated statement of earnings. the company closely monitors these proposals as they arise in the countries where it operates. changes to the statutory tax rate may occur at any time, and any related expense or benefit recorded may be material to the fiscal quarter and year in which the law change is enacted.
in fiscal year 2019, switzerland enacted the federal act on tax reform and ahv financing (traf) which became effective on january 1, 2020. as of december 29, 2019, certain cantons where the company operates have not yet enacted portions of the tax reform as stipulated in the swiss federal law. these enactments and future possible guidance from the applicable taxing authorities may have a material impact on the company's operating results.
see note 8 on income taxes for additional information.
the company conducts business and files tax returns in numerous countries and is addressing tax audits and disputes with many tax authorities. in connection with the organization for economic cooperation and development base erosion and profit shifting (beps) project, companies are required to disclose more information to tax authorities on operations around the world, which may lead to greater audit scrutiny of profits earned in other countries. the company regularly assesses the likely outcomes of its tax audits and disputes to determine the appropriateness of its tax reserves. however, any tax authority could take a position on tax treatment that is contrary to the company's expectations, which could result in tax liabilities in excess of reserves.
the company may not be able to successfully secure and defend intellectual property rights essential to the company's businesses.
the company owns or licenses a significant number of patents and other proprietary rights, determined by patent offices, courts and lawmakers in various countries, relating to its products and manufacturing processes. these rights are essential to the company's businesses and materially important to the company's results of operations. public policy, both within and outside the u.s., has become increasingly unfavorable toward intellectual property rights. the company cannot be certain that it will obtain adequate patent protection for new products and technologies in the u.s. and other important markets or that such protections, once granted, will last as long as originally anticipated.
competitors routinely challenge the validity or extent of the company's owned or licensed patents and proprietary rights through litigation, interferences, oppositions and other proceedings. these proceedings absorb resources and can be protracted as well as unpredictable. in addition, challenges that the company's products infringe the patents of third parties could result in the need to pay past damages and future royalties and adversely affect the competitive position and sales of the products in question.
the company has faced increasing patent challenges from third parties seeking to manufacture and market generic and biosimilar versions of the company's key pharmaceutical products prior to expiration of the applicable patents covering those products. in the u.s., manufacturers of generic versions of innovative human pharmaceutical products may challenge the validity, or claim non-infringement, of innovator products through the abbreviated new drug application, or anda, process with the fda. the biologics price competition and innovation act (bpcia), enacted in 2010, which created a new regulatory pathway for the approval by the fda of biosimilar alternatives to innovator-developed biological products, also created mechanisms for biosimilar applicants to challenge the patents on the innovator biologics. the inter partes review (ipr) process with the uspto, created under the 2011 america invents act, is also being used by competitors to challenge patents held by the company's subsidiaries.
in the event the company is not successful in defending its patents against such challenges, or upon the "at-risk" launch (despite pending patent infringement litigation) by the generic or biosimilar firm of its product, the company can lose a major portion of revenues for the referenced product in a very short period of time. current legal proceedings involving the company's patents and other intellectual property rights are described in note 21, "legal proceedings-intellectual property" of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report.
the company's businesses operate in highly competitive product markets and competitive pressures could adversely affect the company's earnings.
the company faces substantial competition in all three operating segments and in all geographic markets. the company's businesses compete with companies of all sizes on the basis of cost-effectiveness, technological innovations, intellectual property rights, product performance, real or perceived product advantages, pricing and availability and rate of reimbursement. the company also competes with other market participants in securing rights to acquisitions, collaborations and licensing agreements with third parties. competition for rights to product candidates and technologies may result in significant investment and acquisition costs and onerous agreement terms for the company. competitors' development of more effective or less costly products, and/or their ability to secure patent and other intellectual property rights and successfully market products ahead of the company, could negatively impact sales of the company's existing products as well as its ability to bring new products to market despite significant prior investment in the related product development.
for the company's pharmaceutical businesses, loss of patent exclusivity for a product often is followed by a substantial reduction in sales as competitors gain regulatory approval for generic and other competing products and enter the market. similar competition can be triggered by the loss of exclusivity for a biological product. for the company's medical device businesses, technological innovation, product quality, reputation and customer service are especially important to competitiveness. development by other companies of new or improved products, processes and technologies could threaten to make the company's products or technologies less desirable, less economical or obsolete. the company's consumer businesses face intense competition from other branded products and retailers' private-label brands. if the company fails to sufficiently differentiate and market its brand name consumer products, this could adversely affect revenues and profitability of those products.
significant challenges or delays in the company's innovation and development of new products, technologies and indications could have an adverse impact on the company's long-term success.
the company's continued growth and success depends on its ability to innovate and develop new and differentiated products and services that address the evolving health care needs of patients, providers and consumers. development of successful products and technologies is also necessary to offset revenue losses when the company's existing products lose market share due to various factors such as competition and loss of patent exclusivity. new products introduced within the past five years accounted for approximately 25% of 2019 sales. the company cannot be certain when or whether it will be able to develop, license or otherwise acquire companies, products and technologies, whether particular product candidates will be granted regulatory approval, and, if approved, whether the products will be commercially successful.
the company pursues product development through internal research and development as well as through collaborations, acquisitions, joint ventures and licensing or other arrangements with third parties. in all of these contexts, developing new products, particularly pharmaceutical and biotechnology products and medical devices, requires significant investment of resources over many years. only a very few biopharmaceutical research and development programs result in commercially viable products. the process depends on many factors including the ability to discern patients' and health care providers' future needs; develop promising new compounds, strategies and technologies; achieve successful clinical trial results; secure effective intellectual property protection; obtain regulatory approvals on a timely basis; and, if and when they reach the market, successfully differentiate the company's products from competing products and approaches to treatment. new products or enhancements to existing products may not be accepted quickly or significantly in the marketplace due to product and price competition, changes in customer preferences or healthcare purchasing patterns, resistance by healthcare providers or uncertainty over third-party reimbursement. even following initial regulatory approval, the success of a product can be adversely impacted by safety and efficacy findings in larger real world patient populations, as well as market entry of competitive products.
the company faces increasing regulatory scrutiny which imposes significant compliance costs and exposes the company to government investigations, legal actions and penalties.
like other companies in the healthcare industry, the company is subject to extensive regulation, investigations and legal action, by national, state and local government agencies in the u.s. and other countries in which they operate. regulatory issues regarding compliance with good manufacturing practices (cgmp) (and comparable quality regulations in foreign countries) by manufacturers of drugs, devices and consumer products can lead to fines and penalties, product recalls, product shortages, interruptions in production, delays in new product approvals and litigation. in addition, the marketing, pricing and sale of the company's products are subject to regulation, investigations and legal actions including under the federal food, drug, and cosmetic act, the medicaid rebate program, federal and state false claims acts, state unfair trade practices acts and consumer protection laws. increased scrutiny of health care industry business practices in recent years by government agencies and state attorneys general in the u.s., and any resulting investigations and prosecutions, carry risk of significant civil and criminal penalties including, but not limited to, debarment from participation in government healthcare programs. any such debarment could have a material adverse effect on the company's business and results of operations. the most significant current investigations and litigation brought by government agencies are described in note 21, "legal proceedings-government proceedings" under notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report.
the company faces a variety of risks associated with conducting business internationally.
the company's extensive operations and business activity outside the u.s. are accompanied by certain financial, economic and political risks, including those listed below.
foreign currency exchange: in fiscal 2019, approximately 49% of the company's sales occurred outside of the u.s., with approximately 23% in europe, 7% in the western hemisphere, excluding the u.s., and 19% in the asia-pacific and africa region. changes in non-u.s. currencies relative to the u.s. dollar impact the company's revenues and expenses. while the company uses financial instruments to mitigate the impact of fluctuations in currency exchange rates on its cash flows, unhedged exposures continue to be subject to currency fluctuations. in addition, the weakening or strengthening of the u.s. dollar may result in significant favorable or unfavorable translation effects when the operating results of the company's non-u.s. business activity are translated into u.s. dollars.
inflation and currency devaluation risks: the company faces challenges in maintaining profitability of operations in economies experiencing high inflation rates. the company has accounted for operations in argentina (beginning in the fiscal third quarter of 2018) and venezuela as highly inflationary, as the prior three-year cumulative inflation rate surpassed 100%. while the company strives to maintain profit margins in these areas through cost reduction programs, productivity improvements and periodic price increases, it might experience operating losses as a result of continued inflation. in addition, the impact of currency devaluations in countries experiencing high inflation rates or significant currency exchange fluctuations could negatively impact the company's operating results.
illegal importation of pharmaceutical products: the illegal importation of pharmaceutical products from countries where government price controls or other market dynamics result in lower prices may adversely affect the company's sales and profitability in the u.s. and other countries in which the company operates. with the exception of limited quantities of prescription drugs for personal use, foreign imports of pharmaceutical products are illegal under current u.s. law. however, the volume of illegal imports continues to rise as the ability of patients and other customers to obtain the lower-priced imports has grown significantly.
anti-bribery and other regulations: the company is subject to various federal and foreign laws that govern its international business practices with respect to payments to government officials. those laws include the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act (fcpa), which prohibits u.s. publicly traded companies from promising, offering, or giving anything of value to foreign officials with the corrupt intent of influencing the foreign official for the purpose of helping the company obtain or retain business or gain any improper advantage. the company's business is heavily regulated and therefore involves significant interaction with foreign officials. also, in many countries outside the u.s., the health care providers who prescribe human pharmaceuticals are employed by the government and the purchasers of human pharmaceuticals are government entities; therefore, the company's interactions with these prescribers and purchasers are subject to regulation under the fcpa. in addition to the u.s. application and enforcement of the fcpa, various jurisdictions in which the company operates have laws and regulations, including the u.k bribery act 2010, aimed at preventing and penalizing corrupt and anticompetitive behavior. enforcement activities under these laws could subject the company to additional administrative and legal proceedings and actions, which could include claims for civil penalties, criminal sanctions, and administrative remedies, including exclusion from health care programs.
other legal, social and political risks. other risks inherent in conducting business globally include:
â¢   protective economic policies taken by governments such as trade protection measures and import/export licensing requirements;
â¢   compliance with local regulations and laws including, in some countries, regulatory requirements restricting the company's ability to manufacture or sell its products in the relevant market;
â¢   potential nationalization or expropriation of the company's foreign assets; and
â¢   disruptions to markets due to war, armed conflict, terrorism, social upheavals or pandemics.
interruptions and delays in manufacturing operations could adversely affect the company's business, sales and reputation.
the company's manufacture of products requires the timely delivery of sufficient amounts of complex, high-quality components and materials. the company's subsidiaries operate 97 manufacturing facilities as well as sourcing from hundreds of suppliers around the world. the company has in the past, and may in the future, face unanticipated interruptions and delays in manufacturing through its internal or external supply chain. manufacturing disruptions can occur for many reasons including regulatory action, production quality deviations or safety issues, labor disputes, site-specific incidents (such as fires), natural disasters such as hurricanes and other severe weather events, raw material shortages, political unrest and terrorist attacks. such delays and difficulties in manufacturing can result in product shortages, declines in sales and reputational impact as well as significant remediation and related costs associated with addressing the shortage.
the company relies on third parties to manufacture certain of our products. any failure by or loss of a third party manufacturer could result in delays and increased costs, which may adversely affect our business.
the company relies on third parties to manufacture certain of our products. we depend on these third party manufacturers to allocate to us a portion of their manufacturing capacity sufficient to meet our needs, to produce products of acceptable quality and at acceptable manufacturing yields and to deliver those products to us on a timely basis and at acceptable prices. however, we cannot guarantee that these third party manufacturers will be able to meet our near-term or long-term manufacturing requirements, which could result in lost sales and have an adverse effect on our business.
other risks associated with our reliance on third parties to manufacture these products include, reliance on the third party for regulatory compliance and quality assurance, misappropriation of the company's intellectual property, limited ability to manage our inventory, possible breach of the manufacturing agreement by the third party and the possible termination or nonrenewal of the manufacturing agreement by the third party at a time that is costly or inconvenient for us. moreover, if any of our third party manufacturers suffer any damage to facilities, lose benefits under material agreements, experience power outages, encounter financial difficulties, are unable to secure necessary raw materials from their suppliers or suffer any other reduction in efficiency, the company may experience significant business disruption. in the event of any such disruption, the company would need to seek and source other qualified third party manufacturers, likely resulting in further delays and increased costs which could affect our business adversely.
counterfeit versions of our products could harm our patients and have a negative impact on our revenues, earnings, reputation and business.
our industry continues to be challenged by the vulnerability of distribution channels to illegal counterfeiting and the presence of counterfeit products in a growing number of markets and over the internet. third parties may illegally distribute and sell counterfeit versions of our products, which do not meet our rigorous manufacturing and testing standards. to distributors and patients, counterfeit products may be visually indistinguishable from the authentic version. counterfeit medicines pose a risk to patient health and safety because of the conditions under which they are manufactured-often in unregulated, unlicensed, uninspected and unsanitary sites-as well as the lack of regulation of their contents.
the industry's failure to mitigate the threat of counterfeit medicines could adversely impact our business and reputation by impacting patient confidence in our authentic products, potentially resulting in lost sales, product recalls, and an increased threat of litigation. in addition, diversion of our products from their authorized market into other channels may result in reduced revenues and negatively affect our profitability.
an information security incident, including a cybersecurity breach, could have a negative impact to the company's business or reputation to meet business objectives, the company relies on both internal information technology (it) systems and networks, and those of third parties and their vendors, to process and store sensitive data, including confidential research, business plans, financial information, intellectual property, and personal data that may be subject to legal protection. the extensive information security and cybersecurity threats, which affect companies globally, pose a risk to the security and availability of these it systems and networks, and the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the company's sensitive data. the company continually assesses these threats and makes investments to increase internal protection, detection, and response capabilities, as well as ensure the company's third party providers have required capabilities and controls, to address this risk. to date, the company has not experienced any material impact to the business or operations resulting from information or cybersecurity attacks; however, because of the frequently changing attack techniques, along with the increased volume and sophistication of the attacks, there is the potential for the company to be adversely impacted. this impact could result in reputational, competitive, operational or other business harm as well as financial costs and regulatory action. the company maintains cybersecurity insurance in the event of an information security or cyber incident, however, the coverage may not be sufficient to cover all financial losses.
item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition organization and business segments description of the company and business segments johnson & johnson and its subsidiaries (the company) have approximately 132,200 employees worldwide engaged in the research and development, manufacture and sale of a broad range of products in the health care field. the company conducts business in virtually all countries of the world with the primary focus on products related to human health and well-being.
the company is organized into three business segments: consumer, pharmaceutical and medical devices. the consumer segment includes a broad range of products used in the baby care, oral care, beauty, over-the-counter pharmaceutical, women's health and wound care markets. these products are marketed to the general public and sold both to retail outlets and distributors throughout the world. the pharmaceutical segment is focused on six therapeutic areas, including immunology, infectious diseases, neuroscience, oncology, pulmonary hypertension, and cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. products in this segment are distributed directly to retailers, wholesalers, hospitals and health care professionals for prescription use. the medical devices segment includes a broad range of products used in the orthopaedic, surgery, interventional solutions (cardiovascular and neurovascular) and eye health fields. these products are distributed to wholesalers, hospitals and retailers, and used principally in the professional fields by physicians, nurses, hospitals, eye care professionals and clinics.
the executive committee of johnson & johnson is the principal management group responsible for the strategic operations and allocation of the resources of the company. this committee oversees and coordinates the activities of the consumer, pharmaceutical and medical devices business segments.
in all of its product lines, the company competes with other companies both locally and globally, throughout the world. competition exists in all product lines without regard to the number and size of the competing companies involved. competition in research, involving the development and the improvement of new and existing products and processes, is particularly significant. the development of new and innovative products, as well as protecting the underlying intellectual property of the company's product portfolio, is important to the company's success in all areas of its business. the competitive environment requires substantial investments in continuing research. in addition, the development and maintenance of customer demand for the company's consumer products involves significant expenditures for advertising and promotion.
management's objectives with "our credo" as the foundation, the company's purpose is to blend heart, science and ingenuity to profoundly change the trajectory of health for humanity. the company is committed to bringing its full breadth and depth to ensure health for people today and for future generations. united around this common ambition, the company is poised to fulfill its purpose and successfully meet the demands of the rapidly evolving markets in which it competes.
the company is broadly based in human healthcare, and is committed to creating value by developing accessible, high quality, innovative products and services. new products introduced within the past five years accounted for approximately 25% of 2019 sales. in 2019, $11.4 billion was invested in research and development and $5.8 billion spent on acquisitions, reflecting management's commitment to create life-enhancing innovations and to create value through partnerships that will profoundly change the trajectory of health for humanity.
a critical driver of the company's success is the 132,200 diverse employees worldwide. employees are empowered and inspired to lead with the company's our credo and purpose as guides. this allows every employee to use the company's reach and size to advance the company's purpose, and to also lead with agility and urgency. leveraging the extensive resources across the enterprise, enables the company to innovate and execute with excellence. this ensures the company can remain focused on addressing the unmet needs of society every day and invest for an enduring impact, ultimately delivering value to its patients, consumers and healthcare professionals, employees, communities and shareholders.
results of operations analysis of consolidated sales for discussion on results of operations and financial condition pertaining to the fiscal years 2018 and 2017 see the company's annual report on form 10-k for the fiscal year ended december 30, 2018, item 7. management's discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition.
in 2019, worldwide sales increased 0.6% to $82.1 billion as compared to an increase of 6.7% in 2018. these sales changes consisted of the following:
the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures on the worldwide sales growth was a negative impact of 1.7% in 2019 and a positive impact of 0.8% in 2018.
the five-year compound annual growth rates for worldwide, u.s. and international sales were 2.0%, 3.9% and 0.2%, respectively. the ten-year compound annual growth rates for worldwide, u.s. and international sales were 2.9%, 3.1% and 2.6%, respectively.
in 2019, sales by companies in europe experienced a sales decline of 1.5% as compared to the prior year, which included operational growth of 3.8% offset by a negative currency impact of 5.3%. sales by companies in the western hemisphere (excluding the u.s.) experienced a sales decline of 2.8% as compared to the prior year, which included operational growth of 5.7% offset by a negative currency impact of 8.5%. sales by companies in the asia-pacific, africa region achieved growth of 4.9% as compared to the prior year, including operational growth of 6.9% partially offset by a negative currency impact of 2.0%.
in 2019, the company utilized three wholesalers distributing products for all three segments that represented approximately 15.0%, 12.0% and 11.0% of the total consolidated revenues. in 2018, the company had three wholesalers distributing products for all three segments that represented approximately 14.0%, 11.0% and 11.0% of the total consolidated revenues.
analysis of sales by business segments consumer segment consumer segment sales in 2019 were $13.9 billion, an increase of 0.3% from 2018, which included 3.0% operational growth and a negative currency impact of 2.7%. u.s. consumer segment sales were $5.8 billion, an increase of 1.4%. international sales were $8.1 billion, a decrease of 0.4%, which included 4.2% operational growth and a negative currency impact of 4.6%. in 2019, acquisitions and divestitures had a net positive impact of 1.6% on the operational sales growth of the worldwide consumer segment.

the beauty franchise sales of $4.6 billion increased 4.8% as compared to the prior year. growth was primarily driven by incremental sales from the acquisition of ci:z holdings co., ltd., (dr.ci:labo) in japan as well as market growth and share gains of neutrogenaÂ® and aveenoÂ® products. growth was partially offset by the divestitures of rocÂ® and nizoralÂ® in the fiscal year 2018.
the over-the-counter (otc) franchise sales of $4.4 billion increased 2.5% as compared to the prior year. growth was primarily driven by incremental sales from the acquisition of zarbeesÂ®. additional contributors to the growth were tylenolÂ®, children's motrinÂ®, digestive health products and anti-smoking aids.
the baby care franchise sales were $1.7 billion in 2019, a decrease of 9.9% compared to the prior year, primarily due to johnson'sÂ® competitive pressures coupled with comparisons to prior year relaunch activities and the baby center divestiture.
the wound care/other franchise sales were $0.7 billion in 2019, a decrease of 0.6% as compared to the prior year. the decline was primarily driven by the divestiture of compeedÂ® outside the u.s. and the negative impact of currency.
pharmaceutical segment pharmaceutical segment sales in 2019 were $42.2 billion, an increase of 3.6% from 2018, which included operational growth of 5.8% and a negative currency impact of 2.2%. u.s. sales were $23.9 billion, an increase of 2.5%. international sales were $18.3 billion, an increase of 5.0%, which included 10.1% operational growth and a negative currency impact of 5.1%. in 2019, the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures on the pharmaceutical segment operational sales growth was negligible. adjustments to previous reserve estimates, as compared to the prior year, positively impacted the pharmaceutical segment operational growth by approximately 1.3%, primarily in the immunology and cardiovascular/metabolism/other therapeutic areas.

immunology products sales were $14.0 billion in 2019, representing an increase of 6.3% as compared to the prior year. growth was driven by strong uptake of stelaraÂ® (ustekinumab) in crohn's disease, and tremfyaÂ® (guselkumab) in psoriasis, expanded indications of simponiÂ®/simponi ariaÂ® (golimumab), and the u.s. immunology market growth. immunology was negatively impacted by lower sales of remicadeÂ® (infliximab) due to increased discounts/rebates and biosimilar competition.
the patents for remicadeÂ® (infliximab) in certain countries in europe expired in february 2015. biosimilar versions of remicadeÂ® have been introduced in certain markets outside the u.s., resulting in a reduction in sales of remicadeÂ® in those markets. additional biosimilar competition will likely result in a further reduction in remicadeÂ® sales in markets outside the united states. in the u.s., a biosimilar version of remicadeÂ® was introduced in 2016, and additional competitors continue to enter the market. continued infliximab biosimilar competition in the u.s. market will result in a further reduction in u.s. sales of remicadeÂ®. see note 21 to the consolidated financial statements for a description of legal matters regarding the remicadeÂ® patents.
infectious disease products sales were $3.4 billion in 2019, representing an increase of 3.3% as compared to the prior year. strong sales of symtuzaÂ® and the launch of julucaÂ® (dolutegravir/rilpivirine) were partially offset by lower sales of prezistaÂ® and prezcobixÂ®/rezolstaÂ® (darunavir/cobicistat) due to increased competition and loss of exclusivity of prezistaÂ® in certain countries outside the u.s.
neuroscience products sales were $6.3 billion, representing an increase of 4.1% as compared to the prior year. strong sales of long-acting injectables invega trinzaÂ®/trevictaÂ®(paliperidone palmitate) and invega sustennaÂ®/xeplionÂ® were partially offset by cannibalization of risperdal constaÂ® (risperidone).
oncology products achieved sales of $10.7 billion in 2019, representing an increase of 8.6% as compared to the prior year. contributors to the growth were strong sales of darzalexÂ® (daratumumab) with continued market growth and share gain, imbruvicaÂ® (ibrutinib) due to increased patient uptake globally. additionally, sales from the launch of erleadatm (apalutamide) contributed to the growth. growth was negatively impacted from a decline in u.s. sales of zytigaÂ® (abiraterone acetate) driven by generic competition partially offset by increased sales outside the u.s. lower sales of velcadeÂ® (bortezomib) were also due to generic competition.
pulmonary hypertension products achieved sales of $2.6 billion, representing an increase of 1.9% as compared to the prior year. sales of opsumitÂ® (macitentan) and uptraviÂ® (selexipag) were due to continued market growth and increased share gains while sales of tracleerÂ® (bosentan) were negatively impacted by generics and cannibalization from opsumitÂ®.
cardiovascular/metabolism/other products sales were $5.2 billion, a decline of 10.7% as compared to the prior year. xareltoÂ® (rivaroxaban) sales volume growth was offset by higher discounts and rebates. lower sales of invokanaÂ®/invokametÂ® (canagliflozin) were due to share loss from competitive pressure and a safety label update in the u.s. and lower sales of procritÂ®/ eprexÂ® (epoetin alfa) were due to biosimilar competition.

% change
*percentage greater than 100% or not meaningful the surgery franchise sales were $9.5 billion in 2019, a decrease of 4.0% from 2018. growth in advanced surgery was primarily driven by endocutter, biosurgery and energy products. the decline in general surgery was primarily driven by the negative impact of currency partially offset by growth of wound closure products. the decline in specialty surgery was primarily driven by the divestiture of the sterilization business (asp) partially offset by growth of aesthetic products.
the orthopaedics franchise sales were $8.8 billion in 2019, a decrease of 0.5%, including operational growth of 1.2% offset by a negative currency impact of 1.7% as compared to the prior year. the growth in hips was driven by leadership position in the anterior approach, strong market demand for the actisÂ® stem and the kincisetm surgical automated system. knees grew outside the u.s. from new products coupled with continued global uptake of attuneÂ® revision, offset by a negative currency impact. growth in trauma was due to strong market growth coupled with continued uptake of new products. the decline in spine & other was primarily driven by base business declines in spine partially offset by growth in sports which was led by new products, monoviscÂ® in the u.s. and growth in asia pacific.
the vision franchise achieved sales of $4.6 billion in 2019, an increase of 1.6% from 2018. growth was primarily driven by the strength of daily disposable lenses in the acuvueÂ® oasys contact lenses category. the surgical operational growth was primarily driven by the strength of cataracts outside the u.s. partially offset by competitive pressures in the u.s.
the interventional solutions franchise achieved sales of $3.0 billion in 2019, an increase of 13.3% from 2018. strong growth in the electrophysiology business was driven by atrial fibrillation procedure growth and with strong thermocool smarttouchÂ® sf contact force sensing catheter and diagnostic catheter sales.

in 2019, cost of products sold as a percent to sales increased to 33.6% from 33.2% as compared to the same period a year ago primarily driven by the negative impact of currency in the pharmaceutical business as well as increased intangible asset amortization expense. intangible asset amortization expense of $4.5 billion was included in cost of products sold for 2019 as compared to $4.4 billion in 2018. there was a decrease in the percent to sales of selling, marketing and administrative expenses in 2019 as compared to the prior year, primarily due to favorable segment mix with a higher percentage of sales coming from the pharmaceutical business, planned prioritization and reduced brand marketing expense in the consumer business partially offset by increased selling and marketing investments in the medical devices business.
research and development expense: research and development expense by segment of business was as follows:

in-process research and development (ipr&d): in the fiscal first quarter of 2019, the company recorded an ipr&d charge of $0.9 billion for the remaining intangible asset value related to the development program of al-8176, an investigational drug for the treatment of respiratory syncytial virus (rsv) and human metapneumovirus (hmpv) acquired with the 2014 acquisition of alios biopharma inc. the impairment charge was based on additional information, including clinical data, which became available and led to the company's decision to abandon the development of al-8176. in the fiscal third quarter of 2018, the company recorded an impairment charge of $1.1 billion which included a partial impairment charge of $0.8 billion related to the development program of al-8176 and an impairment charge of $0.3 billion for the discontinuation of the development project for an anti-thrombin antibody associated with the 2015 acquisition of xo1 limited.
other (income) expense, net: other (income) expense, net is the account where the company records gains and losses related to the sale and write-down of certain investments in equity securities held by johnson & johnson innovation - jjdc, inc. (jjdc), unrealized gains and losses on investments, gains and losses on divestitures, certain transactional currency gains and losses, acquisition-related costs, litigation accruals and settlements, as well as royalty income.
the change in other (income) expense, net for the fiscal year 2019 was additional net expense of $1.1 billion primarily attributable to litigation expense of $5.1 billion in 2019, primarily related to the agreement in principle to settle opioid litigation of $4.0 billion, as compared to litigation expense of $2.0 billion in 2018. this was partially offset by divestiture gains in 2019 of $2.2 billion of which $2.0 billion related to the divestiture of the asp business. in addition, the fiscal year 2019 included higher unrealized gains on securities of $0.7 billion, an equity step-up gain of $0.3 billion related to the company's previously held equity investment in dr. ci:labo, and lower restructuring related expense of $0.2 billion as compared to the same period a year ago. divestiture gains were approximately $1.2 billion in 2018 and included the lifescan business, nizoralÂ®, rocÂ® and certain non-strategic pharmaceutical products. additionally, 2018 included a reversal of a contingent liability of $0.2 billion.
interest (income) expense: the fiscal year 2019 included net interest income as compared to an expense in the fiscal year 2018. this was primarily due to the positive effect of net investment hedging arrangements and certain cross currency swaps, and a lower average debt balance. cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $19.3 billion at the end of 2019, and averaged $19.5 billion as compared to the cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities total of $19.7 billion and $19.0 billion average cash balance in 2018. the total debt balance at the end of 2019 was $27.7 billion with an average debt balance of $29.1 billion as compared to $30.5 billion at the end of 2018 and an average debt balance of $32.5 billion. the decrease in debt was due to the retirement of long-term debt.

consumer segment: in 2019, the consumer segment income before tax as a percent to sales was 14.8%, versus 16.7% in 2018. the decrease in the income before tax as a percent of sales in 2019 as compared to 2018 was primarily attributable to higher expenses for litigation of $0.1 billion, intangible asset amortization of $0.1 billion and restructuring of $0.1 billion in the fiscal year 2019 as compared to the fiscal year 2018. this was partially offset by planned prioritization and brand marketing expense reductions. the fiscal year 2019 included a gain of $0.3 billion related to the company's previously held equity investment in dr. ci:labo. divestiture gains for the fiscal year of 2018 included a gain of $0.3 billion from the divestiture of nizoralÂ®.
pharmaceutical segment: in 2019, the pharmaceutical segment income before tax as a percent to sales was 20.9% versus 30.9% in 2018. the decrease in the income before tax as a percent of sales was primarily due to higher litigation expense of $4.3 billion, primarily due to the agreement in principle to settle opioid litigation of $4.0 billion, increased spending in research and development, including a $0.3 billion upfront payment to argenx. this was partially offset by $0.8 billion of higher unrealized gains on securities, a lower in-process research and development charge of $0.2 billion, and lower actelion acquisition and integration related costs as compared to the fiscal year 2018. in addition, the fiscal year 2018 included a contingent liability reversal of $0.2 billion and higher divestiture gains of $0.2 billion.
medical devices segment: in 2019, the medical devices segment income before tax as a percent to sales was 28.1% versus 16.3% in 2018. the increase in the income before tax as a percent to sales was primarily attributable to higher divestiture gains in 2019. divestiture gains in the fiscal 2019 included a gain of $2.0 billion related to the asp business. divestiture gains for the fiscal year of 2018 included a gain of $0.5 billion related to lifescan. additionally, the fiscal year 2019 included lower litigation expense of $1.3 billion, lower restructuring charges of $0.2 billion and lower intangible asset amortization expense of $0.1 billion as compared to the fiscal year 2018. this was partially offset by increased investment in robotics and digital solutions.
restructuring: in the fiscal second quarter of 2018, the company announced plans to implement actions across its global supply chain that are intended to enable the company to focus resources and increase investments in critical capabilities, technologies and solutions necessary to manufacture and supply its product portfolio of the future, enhance agility and drive growth. the company expects these supply chain actions will include expanding its use of strategic collaborations, and bolstering its initiatives to reduce complexity, improving cost-competitiveness, enhancing capabilities and optimizing its network.  discussions regarding specific future actions are ongoing and are subject to all relevant consultation requirements before they are finalized. in total, the company expects these actions to generate approximately $0.6 to $0.8 billion in annual pre-tax cost savings that will be substantially delivered by 2022. the company expects to record pre-tax restructuring charges of approximately $1.9 to $2.3 billion. the company estimates that approximately 70% of the cumulative pre-tax costs will result in cash outlays. in 2019, the company recorded a pre-tax charge of $0.6 billion, which is included on the following lines of the consolidated statement of earnings, $0.3 billion in restructuring, $0.2 billion in other (income) expense and $0.1 billion in cost of products sold. total project costs of approximately $0.8 billion have been recorded since the restructuring was announced.

on september 28, 2018 the swiss parliament approved the federal act on tax reform and ahv financing (traf). on may 19, 2019 a public referendum was held in switzerland that approved the federal reform proposals. in the fiscal third quarter of 2019, the swiss federal council enacted traf which became effective on january 1, 2020. on february 9, 2020 a public referendum on the legislative change was held in the last remaining canton where the company has significant operations. the legislation was approved by the voters and formal enactment is expected in the fiscal first half of 2020. the company has not yet elected the transitional provision in this canton. however, the net financial benefit is estimated to be between $0.2 billion and $0.5 billion in the fiscal first half of 2020. the company does not believe that traf will have a material impact to the company's ongoing consolidated effective tax rate beginning in fiscal year 2020.
liquidity and capital resources liquidity & cash flows cash and cash equivalents were $17.3 billion at the end of 2019 as compared to $18.1 billion at the end of 2018. the primary sources and uses of cash that contributed to the $0.8 billion decrease were approximately $23.4 billion of cash generated from operating activities. this was offset by $6.2 billion net cash used by investing activities and $18.0 billion net cash used by financing activities. in addition, the company had $2.0 billion in marketable securities at the end of 2019 and $1.6 billion at the end of 2018. see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for additional details on cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities.
cash flow from operations of $23.4 billion was the result of $15.1 billion of net earnings and $9.1 billion of non-cash expenses and other adjustments for depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, assets write-downs (primarily related to the alios ipr&d asset), and favorable increases in accounts payable, accrued liabilities and other liabilities of $5.5 billion. this was reduced by $1.6 billion related to an increase in accounts receivable, inventories, other current and non-current assets. as well as non-cash expenses and other adjustments of $2.5 billion for the increase in the deferred tax provision and a net gain on sale of assets/businesses of $2.2 billion (primarily related to the asp divestiture).
investing activities use of $6.2 billion of cash was primarily used for acquisitions of $5.8 billion primarily related to the acquisitions of auris health, inc. and dr. ci:labo, additions to property, plant and equipment of $3.5 billion and $0.5 billion from the net purchases of investments. investing activities also included a source of $3.3 billion of proceeds from the disposal of assets/businesses, primarily the asp divestiture, and proceeds from credit support agreements of $0.3 billion.
financing activities use of $18.0 billion of cash was primarily used for dividends to shareholders of $9.9 billion, the repurchase of common stock of $6.7 billion and the net retirement of short and long term debt of $2.9 billion. financing activities also included sources of $1.5 billion from proceeds of stock options exercised/employee withholding tax on stock awards, and other financing activities.
on december 17, 2018, the company announced that its board of directors approved a share repurchase program, authorizing the company to purchase up to $5.0 billion of the company's shares of common stock. shares acquired are available for general corporate purposes. the company financed the share repurchase program through available cash. as of september 29, 2019, $5.0 billion was repurchased under the program and the program was completed.
as of december 29, 2019, the company's notes payable and long-term debt was in excess of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. as of december 29, 2019, the net debt position was $8.4 billion as compared to the prior year of $10.8 billion. there was a decrease in the net debt position due to retirement of debt. the debt balance at the end of 2019 was $27.7 billion as compared to $30.5 billion in 2018. in 2019, the company continued to have access to liquidity through the commercial paper market. additionally, as a result of the tcja, the company has access to its cash outside the u.s. at a significantly reduced cost. the company anticipates that operating cash flows, the ability to raise funds from external sources, borrowing capacity from existing committed credit facilities and access to the commercial paper markets will continue to provide sufficient resources to fund operating needs, including the agreement in principle to settle opioid litigation to be potentially paid over the next two to three years. as discussed in note 8 to the consolidated financial statements, the internal revenue service (irs) has completed its audit for the tax years through 2009 and is currently auditing the tax years 2010-2012. the company currently expects completion of this audit and settlement of the related tax liabilities in the fiscal year 2020. as of december 29, 2019, the company has classified unrecognized tax benefits and related interest of approximately $0.9 billion as a current liability in the "accrued taxes on income" line in the consolidated balance sheet. this is the amount expected to be paid over the next 12 months with respect to the irs audit. subsequent to december 29, 2019, the company made a payment for approximately $0.6 billion to the u.s. treasury related to the estimated 2010-2012 tax audit liability in anticipation of the final settlement later in fiscal 2020. the completion of this tax audit may result in additional adjustments to the company's unrecognized tax benefit liability that may have a material impact on the company's future operating results or cash flows in the period that the audit is substantially completed.
the company monitors the global capital markets on an ongoing basis and from time to time may raise capital when market conditions are favorable. the company filed a shelf registration on february 27, 2017, which will enable it to issue debt securities on a timely basis and will be updated as required. for additional details on borrowings, see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements.
financing and market risk the company uses financial instruments to manage the impact of foreign exchange rate changes on cash flows. accordingly, the company enters into forward foreign exchange contracts to protect the value of certain foreign currency assets and liabilities and to hedge future foreign currency transactions primarily related to product costs. gains or losses on these contracts are offset by the gains or losses on the underlying transactions. a 10% appreciation of the u.s. dollar from the december 29, 2019 market rates would increase the unrealized value of the company's forward contracts by $271 million. conversely, a
10% depreciation of the u.s. dollar from the december 29, 2019 market rates would decrease the unrealized value of the company's forward contracts by $331 million. in either scenario, the gain or loss on the forward contract would be offset by the gain or loss on the underlying transaction, and therefore, would have no impact on future anticipated earnings and cash flows.
the company hedges the exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, and the effect on certain assets and liabilities in foreign currency, by entering into currency swap contracts. a 1% change in the spread between u.s. and foreign interest rates on the company's interest rate sensitive financial instruments would either increase or decrease the unrealized value of the company's swap contracts by approximately $1,043 million. in either scenario, at maturity, the gain or loss on the swap contract would be offset by the gain or loss on the underlying transaction, and therefore, would have no impact on future anticipated cash flows.
the company does not enter into financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. further, the company has a policy of only entering into contracts with parties that have at least an investment grade credit rating. the counter-parties to these contracts are major financial institutions and there is no significant concentration of exposure with any one counter-party. management believes the risk of loss is remote. during the fiscal second quarter of 2017, the company entered into credit support agreements (csa) with certain derivative counterparties establishing collateral thresholds based on respective credit ratings and netting agreements. see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for additional details on credit support agreements.
the company invests in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning securities which carry a degree of interest rate risk. the fair market value of fixed rate securities may be adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than predicted if interest rates fall. a 1% (100 basis points) change in spread on the company's interest rate sensitive investments would either increase or decrease the unrealized value of cash equivalents and current marketable securities by approximately $7 million.
the company has access to substantial sources of funds at numerous banks worldwide. in september 2019, the company secured a new 364-day credit facility. total credit available to the company approximates $10 billion, which expires on september 10, 2020. interest charged on borrowings under the credit line agreement is based on either bids provided by banks, the prime rate, london interbank offered rates (libor), or other applicable market rate as allowed under the terms of the agreement, plus applicable margins. commitment fees under the agreement are not material.
total borrowings at the end of 2019 and 2018 were $27.7 billion and $30.5 billion, respectively. the decrease in borrowings was due to the retirement of debt in 2019. in 2019, net debt (cash and current marketable securities, net of debt) was $8.4 billion compared to net debt of $10.8 billion in 2018. total debt represented 31.8% of total capital (shareholders' equity and total debt) in 2019 and 33.8% of total capital in 2018. shareholders' equity per share at the end of 2019 was $22.59 compared to $22.44 at year-end 2018.
a summary of borrowings can be found in note 7 to the consolidated financial statements.
contractual obligations and commitments the company's contractual obligations are primarily for the recently enacted tax legislation, leases, debt and unfunded retirement plans. there are no other significant obligations. to satisfy these obligations, the company will use cash from operations. the following table summarizes the company's contractual obligations and their aggregate maturities as of december 29, 2019 (see notes 7, 8, 10 and 16 to the consolidated financial statements for further details):
for tax matters, see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements. for other retirement plan and post-employment medical benefit information, see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements. the table does not include activity related to business combinations.
dividends the company increased its dividend in 2019 for the 57th consecutive year. cash dividends paid were $3.75 per share in 2019 and $3.54 per share in 2018.
other information critical accounting policies and estimates management's discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition are based on the company's consolidated financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the u.s. (gaap). the preparation of these financial statements requires that management make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported for revenues, expenses, assets, liabilities and other related disclosures. actual results may or may not differ from these estimates. the company believes that the understanding of certain key accounting policies and estimates are essential in achieving more insight into the company's operating results and financial condition. these key accounting policies include revenue recognition, income taxes, legal and self-insurance contingencies, valuation of long-lived assets, assumptions used to determine the amounts recorded for pensions and other employee benefit plans and accounting for stock based awards.
revenue recognition: the company recognizes revenue from product sales when obligations under the terms of a contract with the customer are satisfied; generally, this occurs with the transfer of control of the goods to customers. the company's global payment terms are typically between 30 to 90 days. provisions for certain rebates, sales incentives, trade promotions, coupons, product returns and discounts to customers are accounted for as variable consideration and recorded as a reduction in sales. see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for the accounting standards update related to revenue which was adopted in 2018.
product discounts granted are based on the terms of arrangements with direct, indirect and other market participants, as well as market conditions, including consideration of competitor pricing. rebates are estimated based on contractual terms, historical experience, patient outcomes, trend analysis and projected market conditions in the various markets served. the company evaluates market conditions for products or groups of products primarily through the analysis of wholesaler and other third-party sell-through and market research data, as well as internally generated information.
sales returns are estimated and recorded based on historical sales and returns information. products that exhibit unusual sales or return patterns due to dating, competition or other marketing matters are specifically investigated and analyzed as part of the accounting for sales return accruals.
sales returns allowances represent a reserve for products that may be returned due to expiration, destruction in the field, or in specific areas, product recall. the sales returns reserve is based on historical return trends by product and by market as a percent to gross sales. in accordance with the company's accounting policies, the company generally issues credit to customers for returned goods. the company's sales returns reserves are accounted for in accordance with the u.s. gaap guidance for revenue recognition when right of return exists. sales returns reserves are recorded at full sales value. sales returns in the consumer and pharmaceutical segments are almost exclusively not resalable. sales returns for certain franchises in the medical devices segment are typically resalable but are not material. the company infrequently exchanges products from inventory for returned products. the sales returns reserve for the total company has been approximately 1.0% of annual net trade sales during the fiscal reporting years 2019 and 2018.
promotional programs, such as product listing allowances and cooperative advertising arrangements, are recorded in the same period as related sales. continuing promotional programs include coupons and volume-based sales incentive programs. the redemption cost of consumer coupons is based on historical redemption experience by product and value. volume-based incentive programs are based on the estimated sales volumes for the incentive period and are recorded as products are sold. these arrangements are evaluated to determine the appropriate amounts to be deferred or recorded as a reduction of revenue. the company also earns profit-share payments through collaborative arrangements of certain products, which are included in sales to customers. for all years presented, profit-share payments were approximately 2.0% of the total revenues and are included in sales to customers.
in addition, the company enters into collaboration arrangements that contain multiple revenue generating activities. amounts due from collaborative partners for these arrangements are recognized as each activity is performed or delivered, based on the relative selling price. upfront fees received as part of these arrangements are deferred and recognized over the performance period. see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for additional disclosures on collaborations.
reasonably likely changes to assumptions used to calculate the accruals for rebates, returns and promotions are not anticipated to have a material effect on the financial statements. the company currently discloses the impact of changes to assumptions in the quarterly or annual filing in which there is a material financial statement impact.
below are tables that show the progression of accrued rebates, returns, promotions, reserve for doubtful accounts and reserve for cash discounts by segment of business for the fiscal years ended december 29, 2019 and december 30, 2018.

(2)   certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to current year presentation.
income taxes: income taxes are recorded based on amounts refundable or payable for the current year and include the results of any difference between u.s. gaap accounting and tax reporting, recorded as deferred tax assets or liabilities. the company estimates deferred tax assets and liabilities based on enacted tax regulations and rates. future changes in tax laws and rates may affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities.
the company has unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions. the company follows u.s. gaap, which prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. management believes that changes in these estimates would not have a material effect on the company's results of operations, cash flows or financial position.
the company has recorded deferred tax liabilities on all undistributed earnings prior to december 31, 2017 from its international subsidiaries. the company has not provided deferred taxes on the undistributed earnings subsequent to january 1, 2018 from certain international subsidiaries where the earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested. the company intends to continue to reinvest these earnings in those international operations. if the company decides at a later date to repatriate these earnings to the u.s., the company would be required to provide for the net tax effects on these amounts. the company estimates that the total tax effect of this repatriation would be approximately $0.8 billion under current enacted tax laws and regulations and at current currency exchange rates.
see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding income taxes.
legal and self insurance contingencies: the company records accruals for various contingencies, including legal proceedings and product liability claims as these arise in the normal course of business. the accruals are based on management's judgment as to the probability of losses and, where applicable, actuarially determined estimates. the company has self insurance through a wholly-owned captive insurance company. in addition to accruals in the self insurance program, claims that exceed the insurance coverage are accrued when losses are probable and amounts can be reasonably estimated.
the company follows the provisions of u.s. gaap when recording litigation related contingencies. a liability is recorded when a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated. the best estimate of a loss within a range is accrued; however, if no estimate in the range is better than any other, the minimum amount is accrued.
see notes 1 and 21 to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding product liability and legal proceedings.
long-lived and intangible assets: the company assesses changes in economic conditions and makes assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows in evaluating the value of the company's property, plant and equipment, goodwill and intangible assets. as these assumptions and estimates may change over time, it may or may not be necessary for the company to record impairment charges.
employee benefit plans: the company sponsors various retirement and pension plans, including defined benefit, defined contribution and termination indemnity plans, which cover most employees worldwide. these plans are based on assumptions for the discount rate, expected return on plan assets, mortality rates, expected salary increases, health care cost trend rates and attrition rates. see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for further details on these rates and the effect a rate change to the health care cost trend would have on the company's results of operations.
stock based compensation: the company recognizes compensation expense associated with the issuance of equity instruments to employees for their services. based on the type of equity instrument, the fair value is estimated on the date of grant using either the black-scholes option valuation model or a combination of both the black-scholes option valuation model and monte carlo valuation model, and is expensed in the financial statements over the service period. the input assumptions used in determining fair value are the expected life, expected volatility, risk-free rate and expected dividend yield. for performance share units the fair market value is calculated for each of the three component goals at the date of grant. the fair values for the sales and earnings per share goals of each performance share unit were estimated on the date of grant using the fair market value of the shares at the time of the award, discounted for dividends, which are not paid on the performance share units during the vesting period. the fair value for the relative total shareholder return goal of each performance share unit was estimated on the date of grant using the monte carlo valuation model. see note 17 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
new accounting pronouncements refer to note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for recently adopted accounting pronouncements and recently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted as of december 29, 2019.
economic and market factors the company is aware that its products are used in an environment where, for more than a decade, policymakers, consumers and businesses have expressed concerns about the rising cost of health care. in response to these concerns, the company has a long-standing policy of pricing products responsibly. for the period 2009 - 2019, in the u.s., the weighted average compound annual growth rate of the company's net price increases for health care products (prescription and over-the-counter drugs, hospital and professional products) was below the u.s. consumer price index (cpi).
the company operates in certain countries where the economic conditions continue to present significant challenges. the company continues to monitor these situations and take appropriate actions. inflation rates continue to have an effect on worldwide economies and, consequently, on the way companies operate. the company has accounted for operations in argentina (beginning in the fiscal third quarter of 2018) and venezuela as highly inflationary, as the prior three-year cumulative inflation rate surpassed 100%. this did not have a material impact to the company's results in the period. in the face of increasing costs, the company strives to maintain its profit margins through cost reduction programs, productivity improvements and periodic price increases.
in june 2016, the united kingdom (u.k.) held a referendum in which voters approved an exit from the european union (e.u.), commonly referred to as "brexit" and on january 31, 2020, the u.k. formally exited the e.u. given the lack of comparable precedent, it is unclear what the ultimate financial, trade, regulatory and legal implications the withdrawal of the u.k. from the e.u. will have. brexit creates global political and economic uncertainty, which may cause, among other consequences, volatility in exchange rates and interest rates, additional cost containment by third-party payors and changes in regulations.  however, the company currently does not believe that these and other related effects will have a material impact on the company's consolidated financial position or operating results. as of december 29, 2019, the business of the company's u.k. subsidiaries represented less than 3% of both the company's consolidated assets and fiscal twelve months revenues, respectively.
the company is exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. a 1% change in the value of the u.s. dollar as compared to all foreign currencies in which the company had sales, income or expense in 2019 would have increased or decreased the translation of foreign sales by approximately $390 million and net income by approximately $120 million.
governments around the world consider various proposals to make changes to tax laws, which may include increasing or decreasing existing statutory tax rates. a change in statutory tax rate in any country would result in the revaluation of the company's deferred tax assets and liabilities related to that particular jurisdiction in the period in which the new tax law is enacted.  this change would result in an expense or benefit recorded to the company's consolidated statement of earnings.  the company closely monitors these proposals as they arise in the countries where it operates. changes to the statutory tax rate may occur at any time, and any related expense or benefit recorded may be material to the fiscal quarter and year in which the law change is enacted. for discussion on federal act on tax reform and ahv financing (swiss tax reform) see provision for taxes on income in management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.
the company faces various worldwide health care changes that may continue to result in pricing pressures that include health care cost containment and government legislation relating to sales, promotions and reimbursement of health care products.
changes in the behavior and spending patterns of purchasers of health care products and services, including delaying medical procedures, rationing prescription medications, reducing the frequency of physician visits and foregoing health care insurance coverage, as a result of the current global economic downturn, may continue to impact the company's businesses.
the company also operates in an environment increasingly hostile to intellectual property rights. firms have filed abbreviated new drug applications or biosimilar biological product applications with the fda or otherwise challenged the coverage and/or validity of the company's patents, seeking to market generic or biosimilar forms of many of the company's key pharmaceutical products prior to expiration of the applicable patents covering those products. in the event the company is not successful in defending the patent claims challenged in the resulting lawsuits, generic or biosimilar versions of the products at issue will be introduced to the market, resulting in the potential for substantial market share and revenue losses for those products, and which may result in a non-cash impairment charge in any associated intangible asset. there is also a risk that one or more competitors could launch a generic or biosimilar version of the product at issue following regulatory approval even though one or more valid patents are in place. for further information, see the discussion on "remicadeÂ® related cases" and "litigation against filers of abbreviated new drug applications" in note 21 to the consolidated financial statements.
legal proceedings johnson & johnson and certain of its subsidiaries are involved in various lawsuits and claims regarding product liability, intellectual property, commercial and other matters; governmental investigations; and other legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of business.
the company records accruals for loss contingencies associated with these legal matters when it is probable that a liability will be incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. as of december 29, 2019, the company has determined that the liabilities associated with certain litigation matters are probable and can be reasonably estimated. the company has accrued for these matters and will continue to monitor each related legal issue and adjust accruals as might be warranted based on new information and further developments in accordance with asc 450-20-25. for these and other litigation and regulatory matters discussed below for which a loss is probable or reasonably possible, the company is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss beyond the amounts already accrued. amounts accrued for legal contingencies often result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties that rely heavily on estimates and assumptions including timing of related payments. the ability to make such estimates and judgments can be affected by various factors including, among other things, whether damages sought in the proceedings are unsubstantiated or indeterminate; scientific and legal discovery has not commenced or is not complete; proceedings are in early stages; matters present legal uncertainties; there are significant facts in dispute; procedural or jurisdictional issues; the uncertainty and unpredictability of the number of potential claims; or there are numerous parties involved. to the extent adverse verdicts have been rendered against the company, the company does not record an accrual until a loss is determined to be probable and can be reasonably estimated.
in the company's opinion, based on its examination of these matters, its experience to date and discussions with counsel, the ultimate outcome of legal proceedings, net of liabilities accrued in the company's balance sheet, is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the company's financial position. however, the resolution of, or increase in accruals for, one or more of these matters in any reporting period may have a material adverse effect on the company's results of operations and cash flows for that period.
see note 21 to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding legal proceedings.
common stock the company's common stock is listed on the new york stock exchange under the symbol jnj. as of february 12, 2020, there were 135,953 record holders of common stock of the company.

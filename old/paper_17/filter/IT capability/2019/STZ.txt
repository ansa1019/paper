item 1a. risk factors in addition to information discussed elsewhere in this report, you should carefully consider the following factors which could materially affect our business, liquidity, financial condition, and/or results of operations. the risks described below are not the only risks we face. additional factors not presently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, financial condition, and/or results of operations in future periods.
operational risks pandemics, such as the current global covid-19 virus, outbreaks of communicable infections or diseases, or other public health concerns in the markets in which our consumers or employees live and/or in which we or our distributors, retailers, and suppliers operate disease outbreaks and other public health conditions could result in disruptions and damage to our business caused by potential negative consumer purchasing behavior as well as disruption to our supply chains, production processes, and operations. consumer purchasing behavior may be impacted by reduced consumption by consumers who may not be able to leave home or otherwise shop in a normal manner as a result of quarantines or other cancellations of public events and other opportunities to purchase our products, from bar and restaurant closures, or from a reduction in consumer discretionary income due to reduced or limited work and layoffs. supply disruption may result from restrictions on the ability of employees and others in the supply chain to travel and work, such as caused by quarantine or individual illness, or which may result from border closures imposed by governments to deter the spread of communicable infection or disease, or determinations by us or our suppliers or distributors to temporarily suspend operations in affected areas, or other actions which restrict the ability to distribute our products or which may otherwise negatively impact our ability to produce, bottle and ship our product, for our distributors to distribute our products, or for our suppliers to provide us our raw materials. ports or channels of entry may be closed or operate at only a portion of capacity, or transportation of product within a region or country may be limited, if workers are unable to report to work due to travel restrictions or personal illness. our operations and the operations of our suppliers may become less efficient or otherwise become negatively impacted if our executive leaders or other personnel critical to our operations are unable to work or if a significant percentage of the workforce is unable to work or is required to work from home. our cyber-security could be compromised if persons who are forced to work from home do not maintain adequate information security. a prolonged quarantine or border closure could result in temporary or longer-term disruptions of sales patterns, consumption and trade patterns, supply chains, production processes, and operations. a widespread health crisis, such as the covid-19 pandemic, could negatively affect the economies and financial markets of many countries resulting in a global economic downturn which could negatively impact demand for our products and our ability to borrow money. any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, financial condition, and/or results of operations.
international operations, worldwide and domestic economic trends and financial market conditions, geopolitical uncertainty, or changes to international trade agreements and tariffs, import and excise duties, other taxes, or other governmental rules and regulations our products are produced and sold in numerous countries, we have employees in various countries, and we have production facilities currently in the u.s., mexico, new zealand, and italy.
risks associated with international operations, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, financial condition, and/or results of operations, include:
•   changes in local political, economic, social, and labor conditions;
•   restrictions on foreign ownership and investments or on repatriation of cash earned in countries outside the u.s.;
•   import and export requirements and border accessibility;
•   currency exchange rate fluctuations;
constellation brands, inc. fy 2020 form 10-k   #worthreachingfor i part i   item 1a. risk factors
•   a less developed and less certain legal and regulatory environment in some countries, which, among other things, can create uncertainty regarding contract enforcement, intellectual property rights, privacy obligations, real property rights, and liability issues; and
•   inadequate levels of compliance with applicable anti-bribery laws, including the foreign corrupt practices act.
unfavorable global or regional economic conditions, including economic slowdown and the disruption, volatility and tightening of credit and capital markets, as well as unemployment, tax increases, governmental spending cuts, or a return of high levels of inflation, could affect consumer spending patterns and purchases of our products. these could also create or exacerbate credit issues, cash flow issues, and other financial hardships for us and our suppliers, distributors, retailers, and consumers. the inability of suppliers, distributors, and retailers to access liquidity could impact our ability to produce and distribute our products.
we are also exposed to risks associated with interest rate fluctuations. we could experience changes in our ability to manage fluctuations in interest rates and, accordingly, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in reducing those risks.
we could also be affected by nationalization of our international operations, unstable governments, unfamiliar or biased legal systems, intergovernmental disputes or animus against the united states. any determination that our operations or activities did not comply with applicable u.s. or foreign laws or regulations could result in the imposition of fines and penalties, interruptions of business, terminations of necessary licenses and permits, and other legal and equitable sanctions.
the u.s. and other countries in which we operate impose duties, excise taxes, and/or other taxes on beverage alcohol products, and/or on certain raw materials used to produce our beverage alcohol products, in varying amounts. the u.s. federal government or other governmental bodies may propose changes to international trade agreements, tariffs, taxes, and other government rules and regulations. significant increases in import and excise duties or other taxes on, or that impact, beverage alcohol products could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, financial condition, and/or results of operations. any such tariffs, particularly on imports from mexico and any retaliatory tariffs imposed by the mexican government, may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, including our sales and profitability.
in addition, federal, state, provincial, local, and foreign governmental agencies extensively regulate the beverage alcohol products industry concerning such matters as licensing, warehousing, trade and pricing practices, permitted and required labeling, advertising and relations with wholesalers and retailers. certain federal, state, or local regulations also require warning labels and signage. new or revised regulations or increased licensing fees, requirements, or taxes could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, financial condition, and/or results of operations. additionally, various jurisdictions may seek to adopt significant additional product labeling or warning requirements or limitations on the marketing or sale of our products because of what our products contain or allegations that our products cause adverse health effects. if these types of requirements become applicable to one or more of our major products under current or future environmental or health laws or regulations, they may inhibit sales of such products.
these international, economic, and political uncertainties and regulatory changes could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, financial condition, and/or results of operations, especially to the extent these matters, or the decisions, policies or economic strength of our suppliers and distributors, affect our business, liquidity, financial condition, and/or results of operations.
dependence on limited facilities for production of our mexican beer brands, and expansion and construction issues we are dependent on our nava and obregon breweries as our sole sources of supply to fulfill our mexican beer brands product requirements, both now as well as for the near term.
constellation brands, inc. fy 2020 form 10-k   #worthreachingfor i part i   item 1a. risk factors we are expanding our obregon brewery and our joint venture with owens-illinois expanded its glass plant with an additional furnace having become operational in february 2020. these are multi-million-dollar expansion activities, which could have the potential risk of completion delays and cost overruns. abandonment of our expansion and construction activities could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.
expansion of current production facilities and construction of new production facilities are subject to various regulatory and developmental risks, including but not limited to: (i) our ability to obtain timely certificate authorizations, necessary approvals and permits from regulatory agencies and on terms that are acceptable to us; (ii) potential changes in federal, state, and local statutes and regulations, including environmental requirements, that prevent a project from proceeding or increase the anticipated cost of the project; (iii) inability to acquire rights-of-way or land or water rights on a timely basis on terms that are acceptable to us; (iv) inability to acquire the necessary energy supplies, including electricity, natural gas, and diesel fuel; or (v) a temporary halt in construction activities due to covid-19. any of these events could delay the expansion or construction of our production facilities. recently, in a public consultation process in mexicali, baja california, mexico, voters voiced opposition to the construction of our mexicali brewery. we are currently working with local authorities, government officials and members of the community in mexicali on next steps related to that brewery construction project and options elsewhere in mexico.
we may not be able to satisfy our product supply requirements for the mexican beer brands in the event of a significant disruption, partial destruction, or total destruction of the nava or obregon breweries or the glass plant, or difficulty shipping raw materials and product into or out of the united states, or temporary inability to produce our product due to closure or lower production levels of one or more of our mexican breweries as a result of covid-19. also, if the contemplated expansions of the obregon brewery and the glass plant and construction of additional brewery capacity in mexico are not completed by their targeted completion dates, we may not be able to produce sufficient quantities of our mexican beer to satisfy our needs. under such circumstances, we may be unable to obtain our mexican beer at a reasonable price from another source, if at all. a significant disruption at our nava or obregon breweries, or the glass plant, even on a short-term basis, could impair our ability to produce and ship products to market on a timely basis. alternative facilities with sufficient capacity or capabilities may not readily be available, may cost substantially more or may take a significant time to start production, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, financial condition, and/or results of operations.
operational disruptions or catastrophic loss to breweries, wineries, other production facilities, or distribution systems all of our mexican beer brands product supply is currently produced at our breweries in nava, coahuila, mexico and obregon, sonora, mexico. many of the workers at these breweries are covered by collective bargaining agreements. the glass plant currently has five operational glass furnaces which supply approximately 55% of the total annual glass bottle supply for our mexican beer brands. several of our vineyards and production and distribution facilities, including certain california wineries and our planned mexicali brewery, are in areas prone to seismic activity. additionally, we have various vineyards and wineries in the state of california which has recently experienced wildfires and landslides.
if any of these or other of our properties and production facilities were to experience a significant operational disruption or catastrophic loss, it could delay or disrupt production, shipments, and revenue, and result in potentially significant expenses to repair or replace these properties. also, our production facilities are asset intensive. as our operations are concentrated in a limited number of production and distribution facilities, we are more likely to experience a significant operational disruption or catastrophic loss in any one location from acts of war or terrorism, fires, floods, earthquakes, hurricanes, pandemics, labor strike, or other labor activities, cyber-attacks, and other attempts to penetrate our information technology systems or the information technology used by our employees who work from home during the covid-19 pandemic, unavailability of raw or packaging materials, or other natural or man-made constellation brands, inc. fy 2020 form 10-k   #worthreachingfor i part i   item 1a. risk factors events. if a significant operational disruption or catastrophic loss were to occur, we could breach agreements, our reputation could be harmed, and our business, liquidity, financial condition, and/or results of operations could be adversely affected due to higher maintenance charges, unexpected capital spending, or product supply constraints.
our insurance policies do not cover certain types of catastrophes and may not cover certain events such as pandemics. economic conditions and uncertainties in global markets may adversely affect the cost and other terms upon which we are able to obtain property damage and business interruption insurance. if our insurance coverage is adversely affected, or to the extent we have elected to self-insure, we may be at greater risk that we may experience an adverse impact to our business, liquidity, financial condition, and/or results of operations. if one or more significant uninsured or under-insured events occur, we could suffer a major financial loss.
supply of quality water, agricultural, and other raw materials, certain raw materials and packaging materials purchased under short-term supply contracts, limited group of suppliers of glass bottles the quality and quantity of water available for use is important to the supply of our agricultural raw materials and our ability to operate our business. water is a limited resource in many parts of the world and if climate patterns change and droughts become more severe, there may be a scarcity of water or poor water quality which may affect our production costs or impose capacity constraints. we are dependent on sufficient amounts of quality water for operation of our breweries, our wineries, and our distilleries, as well as to irrigate our vineyards and conduct our other operations. the suppliers of the agricultural raw materials we purchase are also dependent upon sufficient supplies of quality water for their vineyards and fields. if water available to our operations or the operations of our suppliers becomes scarce or the quality of that water deteriorates, we may incur increased production costs or face manufacturing constraints. in addition, water purification and waste treatment infrastructure limitations could increase costs or constrain operation of our production facilities and vineyards. a substantial reduction in water supplies could result in material losses of grape crops and vines or other crops, such as barley or hops, which could lead to a shortage of our product supply.
we have substantial brewery operations in the country of mexico, brewery operations in the states of texas, virginia, and florida and we currently have substantial wine operations in the state of california as well. in the past, california had endured an extended period of drought and instituted restrictions on water usage. a recurrence of severe drought conditions in california could have an adverse effect upon those operations, which effect could become more significant depending upon actual future drought conditions. our mexico brewery operations currently receive allocations of water sufficient for their operations. although we anticipate our operations will have adequate sources of water to support their on-going requirements, there is no guarantee that the sources of water, methods of water delivery, or water requirements will not change materially in the future.
our breweries, the glass plant, our wineries, and our distilleries use a large volume of agricultural and other raw materials to produce their products. these include corn starch and sugars, malt, hops, fruits, yeast, and water for our breweries; soda ash and silica sand for the glass plant; grapes and water for our wineries; and grain and water for our distilleries. our breweries, wineries, and distilleries all use large amounts of various packaging materials, including glass, aluminum, cardboard, and other paper products. our production facilities also use electricity, natural gas, and diesel fuel in their operations. certain raw materials and packaging materials are purchased under contracts of varying maturities. the supply and price of raw materials, packaging materials, and energy can be affected by many factors beyond our control, including market demand, global geopolitical events (especially as to their impact on crude oil prices), droughts, and other weather conditions or natural or man-made events, economic factors affecting growth decisions, inflation, plant diseases, and theft.
our breweries, wineries, and distilleries are also dependent upon an adequate supply of glass bottles. glass bottle costs are one of our largest components of cost of product sold. we currently have a small number of suppliers of glass bottles for our mexican beer brands. in the u.s., glass bottles have only a small number of producers. currently, one producer supplies most of our glass container constellation brands, inc. fy 2020 form 10-k   #worthreachingfor i part i   item 1a. risk factors requirements for our u.s. wine and spirits operations and two producers supply our glass bottles for our craft beer.
to the extent any of the foregoing factors increases the costs of our finished products or lead to a shortage of our product supply, we could experience a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, financial condition, and/or results of operations.
reliance on wholesale distributors, major retailers, and government agencies local market structures and distribution channels vary worldwide. within our primary market in the u.s., we offer a range of beverage alcohol products across the beer, wine, and spirits categories, with generally separate distribution networks utilized for our beer portfolio and our wine and spirits portfolio. in the u.s., we sell our products principally to wholesalers for resale to retail outlets and directly to government agencies, and we have entered into exclusive arrangements with certain wholesalers that generate a large portion of our u.s. wine and spirits net sales. wholesalers and retailers of our products offer products which compete directly with our products for retail shelf space, promotional support and consumer purchases, and wholesalers or retailers may give higher priority to products of our competitors. the replacement or poor performance of our major wholesalers, retailers, or government agencies could result in temporary or longer-term sales disruptions or could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, financial condition, and/or results of operations.
reliance upon complex information systems and third party global networks, cyber-attacks, and design and ongoing implementation of our new global enterprise resource planning system ("erp")
we depend on information technology to enable us to operate efficiently and interface with customers and suppliers, as well as maintain financial accuracy and efficiency, and effect accurate and timely governmental reporting. if we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build and sustain the proper technology infrastructure, we could be subject to transaction errors, processing inefficiencies, the loss of customers, business disruptions, the loss of or damage to intellectual property through security breach, or penalties associated with the failure to timely file governmental reports. we recognize that many groups on a world-wide basis have experienced increases in security breaches, cyber-attacks, and other hacking activities such as denial of service, malware, and ransomware. as with all large information technology systems, our systems could be penetrated by increasingly sophisticated outside parties intent on extracting confidential or proprietary information, corrupting our information, disrupting our business processes, or engaging in the unauthorized use of strategic information about us or our employees, customers, or consumers. such unauthorized access could disrupt our operations and could result in the loss of assets or revenues, litigation, remediation costs, damage to our reputation, or the failure by us to retain or attract customers following such an event.
we have outsourced various functions to third-party service providers and may outsource other functions in the future. we rely on those third-party service providers to provide services on a timely and effective basis. however, we do not ultimately control their performance. their failure to perform as expected or as required by contract could result in significant disruptions and costs to our operations.
we are in the process of a multi-year implementation of a new erp system. on december 1, 2019, we replaced the portion of our erp system servicing our mexican operations. the erp system for the balance of our business is scheduled to be replaced in fiscal 2022. we are designing the erp system to accurately maintain our financial records, enhance operational functionality, and provide timely information to our management team related to the operation of the business. we expect the implementation process will continue to require the investment of significant personnel and financial resources. companies which implement new erp systems may experience delays, increased costs, and other difficulties. if we are not successful in designing and implementing our erp system as planned or if it does not operate as intended, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting could be adversely affected, our ability to assess those controls adequately could be delayed, or we may not be able to operate our business.
constellation brands, inc. fy 2020 form 10-k   #worthreachingfor i part i   item 1a. risk factors to the extent any of the foregoing factors result in significant disruptions and costs to our operations, or reduce the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, we could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, financial condition, and/or results of operations.
contamination and degradation of product quality from diseases, pests, and weather conditions our success depends upon the positive image that consumers have of our brands and of the safety and quality of our products. contamination, whether arising accidentally or through deliberate third-party action, or other events that harm the integrity or consumer support for our brands, could adversely affect their sales. various diseases, pests, fungi, viruses, drought, frosts, and certain other weather conditions could affect the quality and quantity of barley, hops, grapes, and other agricultural raw materials available, decreasing the supply and quality of our products. we cannot guarantee that our grape suppliers or our suppliers of other agricultural raw materials will succeed in preventing contamination in existing vineyards or fields or that we will succeed in preventing contamination in our existing vineyards or future vineyards we may acquire. future government restrictions regarding the use of certain materials used in growing grapes or other agricultural raw materials may increase vineyard costs and/or reduce production of grapes or other crops. it is also possible that a supplier may not provide materials or product components which meet our required standards or may falsify documentation associated with the fulfillment of those requirements.
product contamination or tampering or the failure to maintain our standards for product quality, safety, and integrity, including with respect to raw materials, naturally occurring compounds, packaging materials, or product components obtained from suppliers, may also reduce demand for our products or cause production and delivery disruptions. contaminants or other defects in raw materials, packaging materials, or product components purchased from third parties and used in the production of our beer, wine, or spirits products, or defects in the fermentation or distillation process could lead to low beverage quality as well as illness among, or injury to, consumers of our products and may result in reduced sales of the affected brand or all our brands.
if any of our products become unsafe or unfit for consumption, are misbranded, or cause injury, we may have to engage in a product recall and/or be subject to liability and incur additional costs. a widespread product recall, multiple product recalls, or a significant product liability judgment could cause our products to be unavailable for a period, which could further reduce consumer demand and brand equity.
climate change and environmental regulatory compliance our business depends upon agricultural activity and natural resources. there has been much public discussion related to concerns that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere may have an adverse impact on global temperatures, weather patterns, and the frequency and severity of extreme weather and natural disasters. severe weather events, such as drought or flooding in california or a prolonged cold winter in new york, and climate change may negatively affect agricultural productivity in the regions from which we presently source our various agricultural raw materials. decreased availability of our raw materials may increase the cost of goods for our products. severe weather events or changes in the frequency or intensity of weather events can also disrupt our supply chain, which may affect production operations, insurance cost and coverage, as well as delivery of our products to wholesalers, retailers, and consumers. natural disasters such as floods and earthquakes may also negatively impact the ability of consumers to purchase our products.
we may experience significant future increases in the costs associated with environmental regulatory compliance, including fees, licenses, and the cost of capital improvements for our operating facilities to meet environmental regulatory requirements. in addition, we may be party to various environmental remediation obligations arising in the normal course of our business or relating to historical activities of businesses we acquire. due to regulatory complexities, uncertainties inherent in litigation, and the risk of unidentified contaminants in our current and former properties, the potential exists for remediation, liability, and indemnification costs to differ materially from the costs that we have estimated. we may incur costs associated with environmental compliance arising from events we cannot constellation brands, inc. fy 2020 form 10-k   #worthreachingfor i part i   item 1a. risk factors control, such as unusually severe floods, hurricanes, earthquakes, or fires. we cannot assure that our costs in relation to these matters will not exceed our projections or otherwise have a material adverse effect upon our business, liquidity, financial condition, or results of operations.
cannabis is currently illegal under u.s. federal law and in other jurisdictions; we do not control canopy's business or operations the ability of canopy to achieve its business objectives is contingent, in part, upon the legality of the cannabis industry, canopy's compliance with regulatory requirements enacted by various governmental authorities, and canopy obtaining all regulatory approvals, where necessary, for the production and sale of its products. the laws and regulations governing medical and recreational cannabis are still developing, including in ways that we may not foresee. although the agriculture improvement act of 2018 has taken hemp and hemp derived cannabinoids out of the most restrictive class of controlled substances, marijuana is a schedule-1 controlled substance in the u.s. and is currently illegal under u.s. federal law. even in those u.s. states in which the recreational use of marijuana has been legalized, its use remains a violation of u.s. federal law. since u.s. federal laws criminalizing the use of marijuana preempt state laws that legalize its use, continuation of u.s. federal law in its current state regarding marijuana would likely limit the expansion of canopy's business into the u.s. similar issues of illegality apply in other countries. any amendment to or replacement of existing laws to make them more onerous, or delays in amending or replacing existing laws to liberalize the legal possession and use of cannabis, or delays in obtaining, or the failure to obtain, any necessary regulatory approvals may significantly delay or impact negatively canopy's markets, products, and sales initiatives and could have a material adverse effect on canopy's business, liquidity, financial condition, and/or results of operations. were that to occur, we may not be able to recover the value of our investments in canopy.
we have the right to nominate four members of the canopy board of directors. while we do not control canopy's business or operations, we do rely on canopy's internal controls and procedures for operation of that business. nevertheless, our financing arrangements require us to certify, among other things, that to our knowledge (i) canopy is properly licensed and operating in accordance with canadian laws in all material respects; (ii) canopy does not knowingly or intentionally purchase, manufacture, distribute, import, and/or sell marijuana, or any other controlled substance in or from the united states of america or any other jurisdiction, in each case, where such purchase, manufacture, distribution, importation, or sale of marijuana or such other controlled substance is illegal, except in compliance with all applicable federal, state, local, or foreign laws, rules and regulations; and (iii) canopy does not knowingly or intentionally partner with, invest in, or distribute marijuana or any other controlled substance to any third-party that knowingly or intentionally purchases, sells, manufactures, or distributes marijuana or any other controlled substance in the united states of america or any other jurisdiction, in each case, where such purchase, sale, manufacture, or distribution of marijuana or such other controlled substance is illegal, except in compliance with all applicable federal, state, local, or foreign laws, rules and regulations. were we to know that canopy was knowingly or intentionally violating any of these applicable laws, we would be unable to make the required certification under our financing arrangements, which could lead to a default under those financing arrangements.
strategic risks competition we are in a highly competitive industry and our sales could be negatively affected by numerous factors including:
•   our inability to maintain or increase prices;
•   new entrants in our market or categories;
•   the decision of wholesalers, retailers, or consumers to purchase competitors' products instead of ours; or
•   a general decline in beverage alcohol consumption due to consumer dietary preference changes or consumers substituting legalized marijuana or other similar products in lieu of beverage alcohol.
constellation brands, inc. fy 2020 form 10-k   #worthreachingfor i part i   item 1a. risk factors sales could also be affected by pricing, purchasing, financing, operational, advertising, or promotional decisions made by wholesalers, state and other local agencies, and retailers which could affect their supply of, or consumer demand for, our products. we could also experience higher than expected selling, general, and administrative expenses if we find it necessary to increase the number of our personnel or our advertising or marketing expenditures to maintain our competitive position or for other reasons. we cannot guarantee that we will be able to increase our prices to pass along to our customers any increased costs we incur.
potential decline in the consumption of products we sell; dependence on sales of our mexican beer brands our business depends upon consumers' consumption of our beer, wine, and spirits brands, and sales of our mexican beer brands in the u.s. are a significant portion of our business. accordingly, a decline in the growth rate, amount, or profitability of our sales of the mexican beer brands in the u.s. could adversely affect our business. further, consumer preferences and tastes may shift due to, among other reasons, changing taste preferences, demographics, or perceived value. consequently, any material shift in consumer preferences and taste in our major markets away from our beer, wine, and spirits brands, and our mexican beer brands in particular, or from the categories in which they compete could have a negative impact on our business, liquidity, financial condition, and/or results of operations. consumer preferences may shift due to a variety of factors, including changes in demographic or social trends, public health policies may be put into effect to deal with the spread of covid-19, and changes in leisure, dining, and beverage consumption patterns. a limited or general decline in consumption in one or more of our product categories could occur in the future due to a variety of factors, including:
•   a general decline in economic or geopolitical conditions;
•   the increased activity of anti-alcohol groups;
•   increased federal, state, provincial, and foreign excise, or other taxes on beverage alcohol products and possible restrictions on beverage alcohol advertising and marketing;
•   increased regulation placing restrictions on the purchase or consumption of beverage alcohol products or increasing prices due to the imposition of duties or excise tax or changes to international trade agreements or tariffs;
acquisition, divestiture, investment, and new product development strategies from time to time, we acquire businesses, assets, or securities of companies that we believe will provide a strategic fit with our business. we integrate acquired businesses with our existing operations; our overall internal control over financial reporting processes; and our financial, operations, and information systems. if the financial performance of our business, as supplemented by the assets and businesses acquired, does not meet our expectations, it may make it more difficult for us to service our debt obligations and our results of operations may fail to meet market expectations. we may not effectively assimilate the business or product offerings of acquired companies into our business or within the anticipated costs or timeframes, retain key customers and suppliers or key employees of acquired businesses, or successfully implement our business plan for the combined business. in addition, our final determinations and appraisals of the estimated fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in our acquisitions may vary materially from earlier estimates and we may fail to realize fully anticipated cost savings, growth opportunities or other potential synergies. we cannot assure that the fair value of acquired businesses or investments will remain constant.
constellation brands, inc. fy 2020 form 10-k   #worthreachingfor i part i   item 1a. risk factors we may also divest ourselves of businesses, assets, or securities of companies that we believe no longer provide a strategic fit with our business. we may provide various indemnifications in connection with the divestiture of businesses or assets. divestitures of portions of our business may also result in costs stranded in our remaining business. delays in developing or implementing plans to address such costs could delay or prevent the accomplishment of our financial objectives.
we have also acquired or retained ownership interests in companies which we do not control, such as our joint venture to operate a glass plant adjacent to our nava brewery, our interest in canopy, and investments made through our corporate ventures capital function, and have acquired control of companies which we do not wholly own, such as our 75% interest in nelson's green brier. our joint venture partners or the other parties that hold the remaining ownership interests in companies which we do not control may at any time have economic, business, or legal interests or goals that are inconsistent with our goals or the goals of the joint ventures or those companies. our joint venture arrangements and the arrangements through which we acquired or hold our other equity or membership interests may require us, among other matters, to pay certain costs, to make capital investments, to fulfill alone our joint venture partners' obligations, or to purchase other parties' interests. the internal control over financial reporting of entities which we consolidate but either do not control or do not wholly own, may not be as robust as our internal controls.
in calendar 2018 we increased our investment in canopy and through exercise of our warrants in canopy we may further increase our investment in the future. while we will not develop, distribute, manufacture, or sell cannabis products in the u.s., or anywhere else in the world, unless it is legally permissible to do so at all governmental levels in the particular jurisdiction, this investment could affect consumer perception of our existing brands and our reputation with various constituencies.
in addition, our continued success depends, in part, on our ability to develop new products such as our corona hard seltzer. the launch and ongoing success of new products are inherently uncertain, especially with respect to consumer appeal. the launch of a new product can give rise to a variety of costs and an unsuccessful launch, among other things, can affect consumer perception of existing brands, and our reputation. unsuccessful implementation or short-lived popularity of our product innovations may result in inventory write-offs and other costs.
we cannot assure that we will realize the expected benefits of acquisitions, divestitures, or investments. we also cannot assure that our acquisitions, investments, or joint ventures will be profitable or that forecasts regarding acquisition, divestiture, or investment activities will be accurate or that the internal control over financial reporting of entities which we must consolidate as a result of our investment activities will be as robust as the internal control over financial reporting for our wholly-owned entities. our failure to adequately manage the risks associated with acquisitions or divestitures, or the failure of an entity in which we have an equity or membership interest, could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, financial condition, and/or results of operations.
sale of a portion of our wine and spirits business and sale of a portion of our craft beer business as previously announced, we sold our black velvet canadian whisky business on november 1, 2019, and on march 2, 2020, we sold our ballast point craft beer brand and certain related assets, including a number of its associated production facilities and brewpubs. we also plan to enter into a revised definitive agreement to sell a portion of our wine and spirits business, including approximately 30 lower-margin, lower-growth wine and spirits brands, wineries, vineyards, offices, and facilities. we also plan to sell our nobilo wine brand, our paul masson brand and our concentrate business. the divestiture of these portions of our business will enable us to focus on our higher-margin, higher-growth wine and spirits brands. the new wine and spirits transactions and other wine and spirits transactions are each subject to the satisfaction of certain closing conditions, including receipt of required regulatory clearances and governmental approvals, and the nobilo wine transaction is subject to the closing of the revised wine and spirits transaction. we cannot guarantee any of these transactions will occur on the terms, conditions, or timetables that we currently anticipate. we intend to use the net proceeds from these transactions primarily to reduce our outstanding borrowings. a delay in completing these constellation brands, inc. fy 2020 form 10-k   #worthreachingfor i part i   item 1a. risk factors transactions, or the failure to complete these transactions, could delay the accomplishment of our strategic and financial objectives and divert the attention of our management and other employees from their day to day business and operations in preparation for the transactions. moreover, the new wine and spirits transactions and other wine and spirits transactions will reduce the diversification of our portfolio. we may not fully realize the expected benefits of a portfolio of higher-end wine and spirits brands if we are not able to align our cost structures and operate the brand portfolio we have following the consummation of these transactions.
our canopy investments are dependent upon an emerging market and legal sales of cannabis products the legal cannabis market is an emerging market. the legislative framework pertaining to the canadian cannabis market, as well as cannabis markets in other countries, is uncertain. the success of the canopy transactions will depend on, among other things, the ability of canopy to create a strong platform for us to operate successfully in the cannabis market space and the presence of sufficient retail outlets. there are also concerns about health issues associated with certain types of form factors for cannabis products, such as those used in vaping. these issues may result in a less robust consumer demand for certain form factors. there is no assurance a robust cannabis consumer market will develop consistent with our expectations or that consumers will purchase any canopy products.
a failure in the demand for canopy's products to materialize as a result of competition, consumer desire, competition from legal and illegal market entrants or other products, or other factors could have a material adverse effect on canopy's business, liquidity, financial condition, and/or results of operations. we have evaluated the canopy equity method investment as of february 29, 2020, and determined that there was not an other-than-temporary-impairment. were that to occur, we may have to write-down the value of our investments in canopy. as of february 29, 2020, the fair value indicates that the investment was impaired by $595.4 million. the changing legal landscape and the lack of consumer market data makes it difficult to predict the pace at which the cannabis market may grow, if at all, and the products that consumers will purchase in the cannabis marketplace.
for example, the canadian cannabis act prohibits testimonials, lifestyle branding and packaging that is appealing to youth. the restrictions on advertising, marketing, and the use of logos and brand names could have a material adverse effect on canopy's business, liquidity, financial condition, and/or results of operations, and our investment in canopy.
additionally, canopy must rely on its own market research to forecast sales as detailed forecasts may not be fully available at this early stage in the cannabis industry in canada and globally. market research relating to the adult-use recreational legal cannabis industry is in its early stages and, as such, trends can only be forecasted.
dependence upon trademarks and proprietary rights, failure to protect our intellectual property rights our future success depends significantly on our ability to protect our current and future brands and products and to defend our intellectual property rights. we have been granted numerous trademark registrations covering our brands and products and have filed, and expect to continue to file, trademark applications seeking to protect newly developed brands and products. we cannot be sure that trademark registrations will be issued with respect to any of our trademark applications. we could also, by omission, fail to timely renew or protect a trademark and our competitors could challenge, invalidate, or circumvent any existing or future trademarks issued to, or licensed by, us.
financial risks indebtedness we have incurred indebtedness to finance investments and acquisitions, fund beer operations expansion and construction activities and repurchase shares of our common stock. in the future, we may continue to incur additional indebtedness to finance investments and acquisitions, repurchase shares of our stock, and fund other general corporate purposes, including beer operations expansion and construction activities. we cannot assure that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations to meet all our debt service requirements; return value to shareholders such as through constellation brands, inc. fy 2020 form 10-k   #worthreachingfor i part i   item 1a. risk factors payment of dividends or repurchase of shares of our common stock; and fund our general corporate and capital requirements.
•   our ability to obtain financing for future working capital needs or investments/acquisitions or other purposes may be limited;
•   our funds available for operations, expansions and construction, dividends, or other distributions, or stock repurchases may be reduced because we dedicate a significant portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness;
•   our ability to conduct our business could be limited by restrictive covenants; and
•   our vulnerability to adverse economic conditions may be greater than less leveraged competitors and, thus, our ability to withstand competitive pressures may be limited.
additionally, any failure to meet required payments on our debt, or failure to comply with any covenants in the instruments governing our debt, could result in an event of default under the terms of those instruments and a downgrade to our credit ratings. a downgrade in our credit ratings would increase our borrowing costs and could affect our ability to issue commercial paper. certain of our debt facilities also contain change of control provisions which, if triggered, may result in an acceleration of our obligation to repay the debt. in addition, certain of our current and future debt and derivative financial instruments have, or in the future, could have interest rates that are tied to reference rates, such as libor or sofr. the volatility and availability of such reference rates, including establishment of alternative reference rates, is out of our control. changes to or the unavailability of such rates or the manner for calculation of such reference rates, could result in increases to the cost of our debt.
if we fail to comply with the obligations contained in our senior credit facility, our existing or future indentures, or other loan agreements, we could be in default under such debt facilities or agreements. in the event of a default, the holders of our debt could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under such instrument to be due and payable. a default could also require the immediate repayment of outstanding obligations under other debt facilities or agreements that contain cross-acceleration or cross-default provisions. if that were to occur, we might not have available funds to satisfy such repayment obligations.
changes to tax laws, fluctuations in our effective tax rate, accounting for tax positions and the resolution of tax disputes, and changes to accounting standards, elections, or assertions the u.s. federal budget and individual state, provincial, local municipal budget deficits, or deficits in other governmental entities, could result in increased taxes on our products, business, customers, or consumers. various proposals to increase taxes on beverage alcohol products have been made at the federal and state levels or at other governmental bodies in recent years. federal, state, provincial, local, or foreign governmental entities may consider increasing taxes upon beverage alcohol products as they explore available alternatives for raising funds.
in addition, significant judgment is required to determine our effective tax rate and evaluate our tax positions. our provision for income taxes includes a provision for uncertain tax positions. fluctuations in federal, state, local, and foreign taxes or a change to uncertain tax positions, including related interest and penalties, may impact our effective tax rate and our financial results. when tax matters arise, several years may elapse before such matters are audited and finally resolved. unfavorable resolution of any tax matter could increase our effective tax rate and resolution of a tax issue may require the use of cash in the year of resolution.
u.s. tax changes or changes in how international corporations are taxed, including changes in how existing tax laws are interpreted or enforced, or changes to accounting standards, elections or assertions could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, financial condition, and/or results of operations.
constellation brands, inc. fy 2020 form 10-k   #worthreachingfor i part i   item 1a. risk factors securities measured at fair value the value of the warrants and convertible debt we hold in canopy through our subsidiaries is subject to the volatility of the market price of canopy's common stock. this volatility subjects our financial statements to volatility. the market price of canopy's common stock has experienced significant volatility, and that volatility may continue in the future and may also be subject to wide fluctuations in response to many factors beyond the control of canopy, or of us. these factors include, but are not limited to:
•   recommendations by securities analysts;
•   impact of covid-19 on canopy's operations and revenues, on canopy's ability to access financial markets, and on the cannabis industry generally;
•   changes in the market valuations of companies in the industry in which canopy operates;
•   announcement of developments and material events by canopy or its competitors;
•   fluctuations in the costs of vital production materials and services;
•   addition or departure of canopy executive officers or other key personnel;
•   news reports relating to trends, concerns, technological, or competitive developments, regulatory changes and other related issues in canopy's industry or target markets;
•   regulatory changes affecting the cannabis industry generally and canopy's business and operations; and
•   administrative obligations associated with health canada requirements and compliance with all associated rules and regulations including, but not limited to, the canadian cannabis act.
we modified the terms of certain warrants we hold in canopy to, among other things, extend the expiry of those warrants and extend the time period through which the value of those warrants and our financial statements are subject to the volatility of the market price of canopy's common stock. we currently account for our shares in canopy under the equity method. we recognize our equity in canopy's earnings on a two-month lag primarily because of the availability of canopy's financial results since canopy's fiscal year ends annually march 31 while our fiscal year ends annually on the last day of february.
intangible assets, such as goodwill and trademarks we have a significant amount of intangible assets such as goodwill and trademarks and may acquire more intangible assets in the future. intangible assets are subject to a periodic impairment evaluation under applicable accounting standards. we recently wrote down a portion of our craft beer business. the write-down of any of these intangible assets could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, financial condition, and/or results of operations.
canopy's corporate governance canopy's business is subject to evolving corporate governance and public disclosure regulations that may from time to time increase both canopy's compliance costs and the risk of its non-compliance. these include changing rules and regulations promulgated by a number of governmental and self-regulated organizations, including, but not limited to, the canadian securities administrators, the tsx, the international accounting standards board, the sec, and the nyse. these rules continue to evolve in scope and complexity creating new requirements for canopy. canopy was previously exempt from certain nyse corporate governance requirements because it was a foreign private issuer listed on the nyse and registered with the sec and was subject to canadian requirements. when canopy originally registered with the sec, it did not need to test its internal control procedures to satisfy the requirements pursuant to section 404 of the sarbanes-oxley act of 2002 ("sox") that require management of canopy to perform an annual assessment of the effectiveness of canopy's internal control over financial reporting and its registered public accounting firm to provide an attestation report as to the effectiveness of such controls. as of september 30, 2019, canopy no longer met the test to qualify as a foreign private issuer and, effective april 1, 2020, canopy must comply with all the nyse corporate governance requirements and the sox internal control procedures. the application of sox to canopy will require management of canopy to perform an annual assessment of canopy's internal control over financial reporting and its constellation brands, inc. fy 2020 form 10-k   #worthreachingfor i part i   item 1a. risk factors registered public accounting firm to conduct an independent assessment of the effectiveness of such controls. canopy has disclosed a material weakness in internal controls over financial reporting. canopy may not be able to remediate the material weakness timely. also, canopy's internal controls may not be adequate, or canopy may not be able to maintain adequate internal controls as required by sox. canopy may not be able to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting on an ongoing basis if standards are modified, supplemented, or amended from time to time. if canopy does not satisfy sox requirements on an ongoing and timely basis, investors could lose confidence in the reliability of its financial statements, which could harm canopy's business and have a negative impact on the trading price or market value of canopy securities. in addition, we record as equity in earnings our proportional share of canopy's results. we could have a material weakness in the event the proportional share of canopy's results that we record contains an error as a result of an error in canopy's financial statements that we do not detect.
although we do not control canopy, we do have significant influence over canopy. our amended and restated investor rights agreement gives us the right to nominate four members of the canopy board of directors. if we controlled canopy, we would have to consolidate canopy into our financial statements even though we do not wholly-own canopy. if we have to consolidate canopy into our financial statements and canopy had a material weakness, we would inherit canopy's material weakness through consolidation. in such an event, even if canopy's financial statements were correct, the fact that canopy had a material weakness could result in a material weakness for us.
other risks damage to our reputation the success of our brands depends upon the positive image that consumers have of those brands and maintaining a good reputation is critical to selling our branded products. contamination, whether arising accidentally or through deliberate third-party action, or other events that harm the integrity or consumer support for our brands, could adversely affect their sales and our reputation. our reputation could also be impacted negatively by public perception, adverse publicity (whether or not valid, such as the similarity of the name of certain of our brands or trademarks and a type of virus), negative comments in social media, or our responses relating to:
•   a perceived failure to maintain high ethical and environmental, social and governance ("esg") standards and practices for all our operations and activities;
•   a perceived failure to address concerns relating to the quality, safety, or integrity of our products;
•   allegations that we, or persons associated with us or formerly associated with us, have violated applicable laws or regulations, including but not limited to those related to safety, employment, discrimination, harassment, whistle-blowing, privacy, corporate citizenship, improper business practices, or cyber-security;
•   our environmental impact, including use of agricultural materials, packaging, water and energy use, and waste management; or
•   efforts that are perceived as insufficient to promote the responsible use of alcohol or cannabis.
failure to comply with federal, state, or local laws and regulations, maintain an effective system of internal controls, provide accurate and timely financial statement information, or protect our information systems against service interruptions, misappropriation of data, or breaches of security, could also hurt our reputation. damage to our reputation or loss of consumer confidence in our products for any of these or other reasons could result in decreased demand for our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, financial condition and/or results of operations, as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation, competitive position and brand equity and renew investor confidence.

control by the sands family our class b common stock is principally held by members of the sands family, either directly or through entities controlled by members of the sands family. holders of class a common stock are entitled to one vote per share and holders of class b common stock are entitled to 10 votes per share. holders of class 1 common stock generally do not have voting rights. the stock ownership of the sands family and entities controlled by members of the sands family represents a majority of the combined voting power of all classes of our common stock as of april 15, 2020, voting as a single class. consequently, the sands family has the power to elect a majority of our directors and approve actions requiring the approval of the stockholders of the company voting as a single class. in addition, if significant stock indices decide to prohibit the inclusion of companies with dual class structures, the price of our class a common stock could be negatively impacted and could become more volatile.

item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction we have elected to omit discussion on the earliest of the three years covered by the consolidated financial statement presented. refer to item 7. "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" and "financial liquidity and capital resources" located in our form 10-k for the fiscal year ended february 28, 2019, filed on april 23, 2019, for reference to discussion of the fiscal year ended february 28, 2018, the earliest of the three fiscal years presented. this md&a, which should be read in conjunction with our financial statements, provides additional information on our businesses, current developments, financial condition, cash flows, and results of operations. it is organized as follows:
•   overview. this section provides a general description of our business, which we believe is important in understanding the results of our operations, financial condition, and potential future trends.
•   strategy. this section provides a description of our strategy and a discussion of recent developments, significant investments, acquisitions, and divestitures.

•   critical accounting estimates and policies. this section identifies those accounting policies that are considered important to our results of operations and financial condition, require significant judgment and involve significant management estimates. our significant accounting policies, including those considered to be critical accounting policies, are summarized in note 1 of the notes to the financial statements.
overview we are an international beverage alcohol company with a broad portfolio of consumer-preferred high-end imported beer brands, and higher-end wine and spirits brands. many of our products are recognized as leaders in their respective categories. we are one of the leading u.s. growth drivers at retail among beverage alcohol suppliers. in the u.s. market, we are the third-largest beer company and a leading higher-end wine company.
through february 28, 2019, our internal management financial reporting consisted of two business divisions: (i) beer and (ii) wine and spirits. beginning march 1, 2019, as a result of our november 2018 canopy investment and a change in our codm on march 1, 2019, we have changed our internal management financial reporting to consist of three business divisions: (i) beer, (ii) wine and spirits, and (iii) canopy. consequently, beginning with the first quarter of fiscal 2020, we report our operating results in four segments: (i) beer, (ii) wine and spirits, (iii) corporate operations and other, and (iv) canopy. our canopy equity method investment makes up the canopy segment.
in the beer segment, our portfolio consists of high-end imported and craft beer and alternative beverage alcohol brands. we have an exclusive perpetual brand license to import, market, and sell our constellation brands, inc. fy 2020 form 10-k   #worthreachingfor i part ii   item 7. md&amp;a mexican beer portfolio in the u.s. in the wine and spirits segment, our portfolio includes higher-margin, higher-growth wine brands complemented by certain higher-end spirits brands. amounts included in the corporate operations and other segment consist of costs of executive management, corporate development, corporate finance, corporate growth and strategy, human resources, internal audit, investor relations, legal, public relations, and information technology, as well as our investments made through our corporate venture capital function. all costs included in the corporate operations and other segment are general costs that are applicable to the consolidated group and are therefore not allocated to the other reportable segments. all costs reported within the corporate operations and other segment are not included in our codm's evaluation of the operating income (loss) performance of the other reportable segments. the new business segments reflect how our operations are managed, how resources are allocated, how operating performance is evaluated by senior management, and the structure of our internal financial reporting.
strategy our overall strategy is to drive industry-leading growth, build unrivaled shareholder value, and shape the future of our industry by building brands that people love. we believe sharing a toast, unwinding after a day, celebrating milestones, and helping people connect, is worth reaching for. we position our portfolio to benefit from the consumer-led trend towards premiumization, which we believe will continue to result in faster growth rates in the higher-end of the beer, wine, and spirits categories. we focus on developing our expertise in consumer insights and category management, as well as our strong distributor network, which provides an effective route-to-market. additionally, we leverage our scale across the total beverage alcohol market and our level of diversification hedges our portfolio risk. in addition to growing our existing business, we focus on targeted acquisitions of, and investments in, businesses that are higher-margin, higher-growth, consumer-led, have a low integration risk, and/or fill a gap in our portfolio. we also strive to identify, meet, and stay ahead of evolving consumer trends and market dynamics (see "investments, acquisitions, and divestitures - canopy investments" below).
we strive to strengthen our portfolio of higher-end beer, wine, and spirits brands and differentiate ourselves through:
•   leveraging our leading position in total beverage alcohol and our scale with wholesalers and retailers to expand distribution of our product portfolio;
•   strengthening relationships with wholesalers and retailers by providing consumer and beverage alcohol insights;
•   investing in brand building and innovation activities;
•   positioning ourselves for success with consumer-led products that identify, meet, and stay ahead of evolving consumer trends and market dynamics;
•   realizing operating efficiencies through expanding and enhancing production capabilities and maximizing asset utilization; and
•   developing employees to enhance performance in the marketplace.
our business strategy for the beer segment focuses on leading the high-end segment of the u.s. beer market and includes continued focus on growing our beer portfolio in the u.s. through expanding distribution for key brands, as well as new product development and innovation within the existing portfolio of brands, and continued expansion, construction, and optimization activities for our mexico beer operations. additionally, in an effort to more fully compete in growing sectors of the high-end segment of the u.s. beer market, we have leveraged our innovation capabilities to introduce new brands that align with consumer trends. we continue to refine our options to optimize the value of our beer segment and drive increased focus on our high-performing import portfolio and upcoming new product introductions. see "recent developments - ballast point transaction" below.
in connection with our business strategy for the beer segment, we have more than tripled the production capacity of our brewery located in nava, coahuila, mexico since its june 2013 acquisition.
constellation brands, inc. fy 2020 form 10-k   #worthreachingfor i part ii   item 7. md&amp;a additionally, we are continuing to invest to expand our brewery operations in obregon, sonora, mexico, where expansion is expected to be completed by the end of fiscal 2021, although containment actions associated with covid-19 may alter that timeline. see "capital expenditures" below for discussion of a recent public consultation on construction of a new brewery in mexicali, baja california, mexico. expansion, construction, and optimization efforts continue under our previously-announced mexico beer expansion projects (as defined below in "capital expenditures") to align with our anticipated future growth expectations (see "capital expenditures" below).
our business strategy for the wine and spirits segment is to build an industry-leading portfolio of higher-end wine and spirits brands. we are investing to meet the evolving needs of consumers; building brands through consumer insights, sensory expertise, and innovation; and refreshing existing brands, as we continue to focus on moving our branded wine and spirits portfolio towards a higher-margin, higher-growth portfolio of brands. we dedicate a large share of our sales and marketing resources to well-known wine and spirits brands sold in the u.s., which comprise the u.s. power brands as they represent a majority of our u.s. wine and spirits revenue and profitability, and generally hold strong positions in their respective price categories. we focus our innovation and investment dollars on those brands within our portfolio which position us to benefit from the consumer-led trend towards premiumization. additionally, in connection with the new wine and spirits transactions, other wine and spirits transactions, and the black velvet divestiture, we expect to optimize the value of our wine and spirits portfolio by driving increased focus on our higher-end power brands to accelerate growth and improve overall operating margins. in markets where it is feasible, we entered into contractual arrangements to consolidate our u.s. distribution network in order to obtain dedicated distributor selling resources which focus on our u.s. wine and spirits portfolio to drive organic growth. this consolidated u.s. distribution network currently represents about 70% of our branded wine and spirits volume in the u.s. throughout the terms of these contracts, we generally expect shipments on an annual basis to these distributors to essentially equal the distributors' shipments to retailers.
marketing, sales, and distribution of our products are managed on a geographic basis in order to fully leverage leading market positions. in addition, market dynamics and consumer trends vary across each of our markets. within our primary market in the u.s., we offer a range of beverage alcohol products across the imported beer, craft beer, branded wine, and spirits categories, with generally separate distribution networks utilized for (i) our beer portfolio and (ii) our wine and spirits portfolio. the environment for our products is competitive in each of our markets.
we complemented our total beverage alcohol strategy in an adjacent category by making investments in canopy, a world-leading, diversified cannabis company. these investments are consistent with our long-term strategy to identify, meet, and stay ahead of evolving consumer trends and market dynamics, and they represent a significant expansion of our strategic relationship to position canopy as a global leader in cannabis production, branding, intellectual property, and retailing.
we remain committed to our long-term financial model of: growing sales, expanding margins, and increasing cash flow in order to achieve earnings per share growth, maintain our targeted leverage ratio, and deliver returns to shareholders through the payment of quarterly cash dividends and periodic share repurchases.
recent developments covid-19
we have an existing crisis management committee that has been closely monitoring the impact of the novel strain of a virus, covid-19, on our company and our workforce since january 2020. in march 2020, the world health organization ("who") recognized covid-19 as a pandemic. covid-19 has severely restricted the level of economic activity around the world. in response to covid-19, the governments of many countries, states, cities, and other geographic regions have taken preventative or protective actions, such as imposing restrictions on travel and business operations and advising or requiring individuals to constellation brands, inc. fy 2020 form 10-k   #worthreachingfor i part ii   item 7. md&amp;a limit or forgo their time outside of their homes. temporary closures of businesses have been ordered and numerous other businesses have temporarily closed voluntarily. further, individuals' ability to travel has been curtailed through mandated travel restrictions and may be further limited through additional voluntary or mandated closures of travel-related businesses. in most of our locations, the beverage alcohol industry has been classified as an essential business and as such we are still able to produce and sell our products. covid-19 has affected us primarily in the reduction of depletion volume on our products in the on-premise business due to shelter in place mandates and bar and restaurant closures. the on-premise business has historically been about 10% to 15% of our depletion volume for beer, wine, and spirits.
currently, our major breweries, wineries, and bottling facilities are still operating but, in some instances, at lower production levels than planned. we have closed all hospitality, tasting rooms, retail, restaurants, and other non-essential public facilities. however, our supply chains and distribution channels have not been materially impacted and we have adequate supply of products to meet forecasted demand. the march 2020 closure of the u.s. and mexico border to non-essential travel does not impact the movement of commercial products including the products we manufacture in mexico and import to the u.s.
we have implemented various measures to reduce the spread of the virus including working from home, restricting visitors to our production locations, splitting our production workforces, reducing the on-site production workforce levels, screening workers before they enter facilities, implementing social distancing, and encouraging employees to adhere to prevention measures recommended by the center for disease control ("cdc") and the who. since our non-production workforce is able to work remotely using various technology tools, we are able to maintain our operations and internal controls over financial reporting and disclosures.
at this time, we are not able to estimate the long-term impact of covid-19 on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and/or cash flow. we believe we have sufficient liquidity available from operating cash flow, cash on hand, and availability under our $2.0 billion revolving credit facility. we expect to have continued access to capital markets and to continue to return value to shareholders.
new wine and spirits transactions in april 2019, we entered into a definitive agreement with e. & j. gallo winery ("gallo") to sell a portion of our wine and spirits business, including approximately 30 lower-margin, lower-growth wine and spirits brands, wineries, vineyards, offices, and facilities.
in december 2019, we agreed to revise and supersede the wine and spirits transaction. the revisions to the transaction address competitive concerns raised by the ftc specifically related to the sparkling wine, brandy, dessert wine, and concentrate categories. as a result, the brands cook's california champagne, j. roget american champagne, paul masson grande amber brandy, and our concentrate business will be excluded from the transaction with gallo resulting in an adjusted transaction price of approximately $843 million, with the potential to earn an incremental $250 million of contingent consideration if certain brand performance provisions are met over a two-year period after closing. the revised wine and spirits transaction is expected to close around the end of first quarter of fiscal 2021, and is subject to required regulatory clearances and governmental review and approval. additionally, in a separate, but related, transaction we agreed that upon execution and delivery of a definitive agreement for the revised wine and spirits transaction, we would enter into an agreement to sell the new zealand-based nobilo wine brand and certain related assets for $130 million to gallo. the nobilo wine transaction is expected to close by the end of second quarter of fiscal 2021 and is subject to ftc and new zealand regulatory review and approval. completion of the nobilo transaction is also conditioned on completion of the revised wine and spirits transaction. we expect to use the net cash proceeds from the new wine and spirits transactions primarily to reduce outstanding borrowings. the new wine and spirits transactions are consistent with our strategic focus on higher-margin, higher-growth brands.
constellation brands, inc. fy 2020 form 10-k   #worthreachingfor i part ii   item 7. md&amp;a we have communicated our intent to retain the brands cook's california champagne and j. roget american champagne contemplated under the wine and spirits transaction and the ftc is currently reviewing our business plans to support these brands in the future.
other wine and spirits transactions we are pursuing other opportunities to divest the paul masson grande amber brandy brand and concentrate business excluded from the revised wine and spirits transaction to companies with more aligned business strategies.
in connection with the new wine and spirits transactions and the other wine and spirits transactions, we have wine and spirits net assets of $1,072.4 million that have met the held for sale criteria as of february 29, 2020.
selected financial information included in our results of operations for the portion of the business that we expect will no longer be part of our consolidated results after the closing of the new wine and spirits transactions and other wine and spirits transactions is as follows:
net sales         gross profit         marketing (1)
wine and spirits segment results   $875              $336                 $18
(1)   this expense is included in selling, general, and administrative expenses within our consolidated results of operations.
for additional information regarding the new wine and spirits transactions and the other wine and spirits transactions, refer to note 2 of the notes to the financial statements.
ballast point transaction in march 2020, we sold the ballast point craft beer business, including a number of its associated production facilities and brewpubs. this divestiture is consistent with our strategic focus on our high-performing import portfolio and upcoming new product introductions. for additional information regarding the ballast point transaction, refer to note 2 of the notes to the financial statements.
primarily in connection with the ballast point transaction, we have beer net assets of $45.3 million that met the held for sale criteria as of february 29, 2020.
canopy production optimization in march 2020, canopy announced its plans to close two canadian greenhouse facilities as part of its efforts to align supply and demand while improving production efficiencies over time. in april 2020, canopy announced its plans to close an additional canadian greenhouse facility, exit its operations in africa, and reduce latin america and united states cultivation activities. canopy expects to record an estimated pre-tax loss of approximately c$700 million to c$800 million in their fourth quarter fiscal 2020 results from the facilities closures as well as other changes related to its organizational and strategic review. we will record our proportional share of canopy's estimated pre-tax loss of approximately c$245 million to c$280 million, in our first quarter fiscal 2021 results.

june 2018                    convertible debt securities   (94.6         )                55.5
(1)   accounted for at fair value from the date of investment in november 2017 through october 31, 2018. accounted for under the equity method from november 1, 2018 (see note 10 of the notes to the financial statements).
(2)   includes $17.2 million of direct acquisition costs capitalized under the equity method cost accumulation model. excludes $7.3 million of direct acquisition costs associated with the investment in warrants which are expensed as incurred in selling, general, and administrative expenses.
(3)   in june 2019, the canopy shareholders approved the modification of the terms of the november 2018 canopy warrants. for additional information refer to note 10 of the notes to the financial statements. fiscal 2020 includes a $1,176.0 million unrealized gain resulting from the june 2019 warrant modification.
we expect the value of the canopy investments accounted for at fair value to be volatile in future periods. we evaluated the canopy investments as of february 29, 2020, and determined that there was not an other-than-temporary-impairment. additionally, since november 1, 2018, we recognize equity in earnings (losses) and related activities for our canopy equity method investment on a two-month lag. accordingly, we recognized our share of canopy's earnings (losses) from january through december 2019, in our fiscal 2020 results. we recognized our share of canopy's losses from november and december 2018, in our fiscal 2019 results. we expect canopy's earnings to be volatile in future periods.
as of february 29, 2020, the conversion of canopy equity securities held by its employees and/or held by other third parties, excluding our november 2017 canopy warrants, new november 2018 canopy warrants, canopy debt securities, and the acreage call option, would not have a significant effect on our share of canopy's reported earnings or losses. additionally, under an amended and restated investor constellation brands, inc. fy 2020 form 10-k   #worthreachingfor i 36
part ii   item 7. md&amp;a rights agreement, we have the option to purchase additional common shares of canopy at the then-current price of the underlying equity security to allow us to maintain our relative ownership interest. if we exercised all of our outstanding november 2017 canopy warrants and new november 2018 canopy warrants, it could have a significant effect on our share of canopy's reported earnings or losses and our ownership interest in canopy would be expected to increase to greater than 50 percent. in connection with the acreage transaction, canopy has the acreage call option, which would require the issuance of canopy shares. if canopy exercised the acreage call option it could have a significant effect on our share of canopy's reported earnings or losses and our ownership interest in canopy would decrease and no longer be expected to be greater than 50 percent.
as previously noted, these investments are consistent with our long-term strategy to identify, meet, and stay ahead of evolving consumer trends and market dynamics, and they represent a significant expansion of our strategic relationship to position canopy as a global leader in cannabis production, branding, intellectual property, and retailing.
beer segment four corners acquisition in july 2018, we acquired four corners, which primarily included the acquisition of operations, goodwill, property, plant, and equipment, and trademarks. this acquisition included a portfolio of high-quality, dynamic, and bicultural, texas-based craft beers which further strengthened our position in the high-end segment of the u.s. beer market. the results of operations of four corners are reported in the beer segment and have been included in our consolidated results of operations from the date of acquisition.
wine and spirits segment black velvet divestiture on november 1, 2019, we sold the black velvet canadian whisky business and the brand's associated production facility, along with a subset of canadian whisky brands produced at that facility, and related inventory at a transaction value of $266.3 million. accordingly, our consolidated results of operations include the results of operations of our canadian whisky business through the date of divestiture. we received cash proceeds of $269.7 million, subject to estimated working capital adjustments. this divestiture is consistent with our strategic focus on higher-margin, higher-growth brands. we recognized a net gain of $74.1 million on the sale of the business for the year ended february 29, 2020.
nelson's green brier acquisition in may 2019, we increased our ownership interest in nelson's green brier to 75%, resulting in consolidation of the business and recognition of a 25% noncontrolling interest. this acquisition included a portfolio of award-winning, tennessee-based craft bourbon and whiskey products. the preliminary fair value of the business combination was allocated primarily to goodwill, trademarks, inventory, and property, plant, and equipment. the results of operations of nelson's green brier are reported in the wine and spirits segment and have been included in our consolidated results of operations from the date of acquisition.
sale of accolade wine investment in may 2018, we completed the sale of our remaining interest in our previously-owned australian and european business for a$149.1 million, or $113.6 million. we received cash proceeds, net of direct costs to sell, of $111.7 million. this interest consisted of an investment accounted for under the cost method and afs debt securities. we recognized net gains of $0.4 million and $99.8 million in connection with this transaction for the years ended february 29, 2020, and february 28, 2019, respectively. these net gains are included in income from unconsolidated investments.
for additional information on these recent developments, investments, acquisitions, and divestitures refer to notes 2, 7, and 10 of the notes to the financial statements.
constellation brands, inc. fy 2020 form 10-k   #worthreachingfor i part ii   item 7. md&amp;a results of operations financial highlights references to organic throughout the following discussion exclude the impact of divested brand activity in connection with the black velvet divestiture (wine and spirits), as appropriate.
financial highlights for fiscal 2020:
•   our results of operations were negatively impacted by (i) an unrealized net loss from the changes in fair value of our investments in canopy, (ii) equity in losses from canopy's results of operations and related activities, and (iii) an impairment of long-lived assets held for sale primarily in connection with the new wine and spirits transactions, partially offset by (i) an unrealized gain resulting from the june 2019 modification of the terms of the november 2018 canopy warrants and (ii) the continued improvements within the beer segment.
•   net sales increased 3% primarily due to an increase in beer net sales driven predominantly by volume growth and a favorable impact from pricing within our mexican beer portfolio, partially offset by a decrease in wine and spirits net sales led by branded volume decline largely from brands to be divested.
•   operating income (loss) decreased 11% largely due to an impairment of long-lived assets held for sale primarily in connection with the new wine and spirits transactions and restructuring and other strategic business development costs incurred in connection with ongoing efforts to gain efficiencies and reduce our cost structure primarily within the wine and spirits segment, partially offset by the net sales volume growth and favorable impact from pricing within our mexican beer portfolio and a net gain related to the black velvet divestiture.
•   net income (loss) attributable to cbi and diluted net income (loss) per common share attributable to cbi decreased significantly primarily due to an unrealized net loss on our investments in canopy for fiscal 2020, as compared with an unrealized net gain from the changes in fair value on our investments for fiscal 2019, partially offset by a net income tax benefit recognized as a result of tax reform enacted in switzerland.
comparable adjustments management excludes items that affect comparability from its evaluation of the results of each operating segment as these comparable adjustments are not reflective of core operations of the segments. segment operating performance and segment management compensation are evaluated based on core segment operating income (loss). as such, the performance measures for incentive compensation purposes for segment management do not include the impact of these comparable adjustments.

cost of product sold strategic business development costs we recognized costs primarily in connection with losses on write-downs of excess inventory, bulk wine sales, and contract terminations resulting from our ongoing efforts to optimize our portfolio, gain efficiencies, and reduce our cost structure within the wine and spirits segment.
undesignated commodity derivative contracts net gain (loss) on undesignated commodity derivative contracts represents a net gain (loss) from the changes in fair value of undesignated commodity derivative contracts. the net gain (loss) is reported outside of segment operating results until such time that the underlying exposure is recognized in the segment operating results. at settlement, the net gain (loss) from the changes in fair value of the undesignated commodity derivative contracts is reported in the appropriate operating segment, allowing the results of our operating segments to reflect the economic effects of the commodity derivative contracts without the resulting unrealized mark to fair value volatility.
accelerated depreciation we recognized accelerated depreciation for certain assets primarily in connection with our current multi-year implementation of a new erp system which is intended to replace our existing operating and financial systems.

recovery of (loss on) inventory write-down we recognized a reimbursement from our insurance carriers for losses recognized on the write-down of certain bulk wine inventory as a result of smoke damage sustained during the fall 2017 california wildfires (fiscal 2020). we recognized a loss on the write-down of certain bulk wine inventory as a result of smoke damage sustained during the fall 2017 california wildfires (fiscal 2019). for additional information, refer to note 17 of the notes to the financial statements.
selling, general, and administrative expenses restructuring and other strategic business development costs we recognized costs primarily in connection with (i) costs from our ongoing efforts to gain efficiencies and reduce our cost structure in connection with a program intended to optimize the wine and spirits segment (fiscal 2020) and (ii) costs recognized in connection with the development of a program specifically intended to identify opportunities for further streamlining of processes and improving capabilities, linking strategy with execution, prioritizing resources, and enabling a new erp system.
impairment of intangible assets we recognized trademark impairment losses related to our beer segment's ballast point craft beer trademark asset. for additional information, refer to note 7 of the notes to the financial statements.
transaction, integration, and other acquisition-related costs we recognized transaction, integration, and other acquisition-related costs in connection with our acquisitions, divestitures, and investments.
net gain (loss) on foreign currency derivative contracts associated with acquisition of investment we recognized a net loss in connection with the settlement of foreign currency option contracts entered into to fix the u.s. dollar cost of the november 2018 canopy transaction.
deferred compensation we recognized an adjustment related to prior periods to correct for previously unrecognized deferred compensation costs associated with certain employment agreements.
other gains (losses)
we recognized other gains (losses) primarily in connection with (i) a gain on the remeasurement of our previously held equity interest in nelson's green brier to the acquisition-date fair value (fiscal 2020), (ii) an increase in estimated fair value of a contingent liability associated with a prior period acquisition (fiscal 2020), (iii) recognition of previously deferred gain upon release of a related guarantee (fiscal 2020), and (iv) a gain primarily in connection with the sale of certain non-core assets (fiscal 2019).
impairment of assets held for sale we recognized an impairment of long-lived assets held for sale in connection with the new wine and spirits transactions, other wine and spirits transactions, and the ballast point transaction.
gain (loss) on sale of business we recognized a net gain on sale of the black velvet canadian whisky business.
income (loss) from unconsolidated investments we recognized an unrealized gain (loss) primarily from (i) the changes in fair value of our securities measured at fair value, (ii) the increase in fair value resulting from the june 2019 modification constellation brands, inc. fy 2020 form 10-k   #worthreachingfor i 40

canopy segmentour ownership interest in canopy allows us to exercise significant influence, but not control, and, therefore, we account for our investment in canopy under the equity method. amounts included for the canopy segment represent 100% of canopy's reported results on a two-month lag, prepared in accordance with u.s. gaap, and converted from canadian dollars to u.s. dollars. although we own less than 100% of the outstanding shares of canopy, 100% of the canopy results are included and subsequently eliminated in order to reconcile to our consolidated financial statements. canopy segment amounts reflect twelve months of activity for fiscal 2020 as compared with two months of activity for fiscal 2019, due to the timing of the november 2018 canopy investment. see "income (loss) from unconsolidated investments" below for a discussion of canopy's net sales, gross profit (loss), selling, general, and administrative expenses, and operating income (loss).

the increase in beer is primarily due to $183.4 million of volume growth, $118.4 million of favorable impact from pricing, and $17.5 million of lower cost of product sold for our mexican beer business, partially offset by a decline of $14.0 million in our craft beer portfolio. the lower cost of product sold is largely due to foreign currency transactional benefits of $24.2 million and decreased operational costs of $3.9 million, partially offset by increased warehousing and transportation costs of $10.6 million.
the decrease in wine and spirits is largely due to (i) $83.1 million of decline in branded wine and spirits volume, (ii) $27.2 million higher cost of product sold, and (iii) $12.3 million decrease in gross profit from the black velvet divestiture, partially offset by $27.3 million of favorable product mix shift. the higher cost of product sold is largely attributable to higher grape raw material and processing costs as well as increased transportation costs.
gross profit as a percent of net sales decreased to 49.8% for fiscal 2020 compared with 50.3% for fiscal 2019. this was largely due to an unfavorable change of 155 basis points in comparable adjustments and higher cost of product sold within the wine and spirits segment, which resulted in approximately 30 basis points of rate decline, partially offset by rate growth from (i) the favorable impact from beer pricing in select markets, which contributed approximately 70 basis points, (ii) favorable impact from wine and spirits product mix shift, which resulted in 20 basis points, (iii) lower cost of product sold within the beer segment, which resulted in 20 basis points of rate growth, and (iv) favorable volume growth from beer which resulted in approximately 20 basis points.

the increase in beer is primarily due to an increase of $76.0 million in marketing spend and $13.7 million in general and administrative expenses. the increase in marketing spend is due to planned investment to support the growth of our mexican beer portfolio, including support of the new product introductions. the increase in general and administrative expenses is largely driven by increased headcount supporting the growth of the business, partially offset by favorable foreign currency transaction gains.
the decrease in wine and spirits is largely due to a decrease of $19.4 million in general and administrative expenses. the decrease in general and administrative expenses is driven by certain cost saving initiatives including decreased compensation and benefits.
the increase in corporate operations and other is due to an increase of approximately $17 million in insurance related costs, $13 million in compensation and benefits, and higher information technology costs supporting the implementation of our new erp system, partially offset by a reduction in consulting costs.
selling, general, and administrative expenses as a percent of net sales decreased to 19.4% for fiscal 2020 as compared with 20.6% for fiscal 2019. the decrease is driven largely by (i) a favorable change of 170 basis points in comparable adjustments. the rate decline was offset by an increase in corporate operations and other and beer selling, general, and administrative expenses, which resulted in approximately 30 basis points and 10 basis points of rate growth, respectively.

constellation brands, inc. fy 2020 form 10-k   #worthreachingfor i 43
part ii   item 7. md&amp;a the decrease in wine and spirits was driven largely by the decline in branded wine and spirits volume, higher cost of product sold, and the impact from the black velvet divestiture partially offset by the favorable impact of product mix shift, lower general and administrative expenses, and the favorable impact from pricing.
as previously discussed, the corporate operations and other increase in operating loss is due to increased insurance, compensation and benefits, and information technology costs, partially offset by a reduction in consulting costs.
income (loss) from unconsolidated investments general income (loss) from unconsolidated investments decreased to $(2,668.6) million for fiscal 2020 from $2,101.6 million for fiscal 2019, a decrease of $4,770.2 million. this decrease is driven largely by an unrealized net loss of $2,126.4 million for fiscal 2020, which consists of an unrealized net loss from the changes in fair value of our securities measured at fair value of $3,302.4 million, partially offset by an unrealized gain of $1,176.0 million from the june 2019 modification of the terms of the november 2018 canopy warrants, as compared with an unrealized net gain of $1,971.2 million recognized for fiscal 2019. fiscal 2020 was also negatively impacted by $575.9 million of equity in losses from canopy's results of operations, and related activities, while fiscal 2019 benefited from a net gain in connection with the sale of our accolade wine investment of $99.8 million.
canopy segmentcanopy's fiscal 2020 net sales; gross profit (loss); selling, general, and administrative expenses; and operating income (loss) are not comparable against fiscal 2019 due the timing of the november 2018 canopy investment and recognizing equity in earnings (losses) and related activities on a two-month lag. we have recognized twelve months of activity for fiscal 2020 as compared with two months of activity for fiscal 2019.
interest expense interest expense increased to $428.7 million for fiscal 2020 from $367.1 million for fiscal 2019, an increase of $61.6 million, or 17%. this increase is predominantly due to higher average borrowings of approximately $1.7 billion primarily attributable to the november 2018 canopy transaction.
(provision for) benefit from income taxes our effective tax rate for fiscal 2020 was 102.3% of tax benefit as compared with 16.5% of tax expense for fiscal 2019. the change in effective tax rate was driven primarily by the recognition of a $547.4 million net income tax benefit resulting from the remeasurement of our deferred tax assets for fiscal 2020 in connection with the september 2019 enactment of tax reform in switzerland. the fiscal 2020 rate also benefited from (i) a higher effective rate of tax benefit from our foreign businesses including the tax benefits recorded on the net unrealized loss from the changes in fair value of our investments in canopy and the tax benefits recorded on the canopy equity in losses and related activities and (ii) recognition of net income tax benefits from stock-based compensation award activity.

we expect our reported effective tax rate for the next fiscal year to be in the range of 17% to 19%. this includes an estimated impact for (i) benefits related to the recognition of the income tax effect of stock-based compensation awards in the income statement when the awards vest or are settled and (ii) lower effective tax rates applicable to our foreign businesses. this range does not reflect (i) any potential impacts from covid-19, (ii) any future changes in the fair value of our canopy investments measured at fair value and any future equity in earnings (losses) and related activities from the canopy equity method investment, and (iii) any additional gain (loss) recognized in connection with the new wine and spirits transactions, other wine and spirits transactions, and the ballast point transaction since these estimates are not currently available.
constellation brands, inc. fy 2020 form 10-k   #worthreachingfor i part ii   item 7. md&amp;a net income (loss) attributable to cbi net income (loss) attributable to cbi decreased to $(11.8) million for fiscal 2020 from $3,435.9 million for fiscal 2019. this decrease of $3,447.7 million is largely attributable to the significant decrease in income (loss) from unconsolidated investments discussed above, an impairment of long-lived assets held for sale as well as the decline in operating performance from wine and spirits. these decreases were partially offset by solid operating performance from beer contributing an additional $205.0 million of operating income.
financial liquidity and capital resources general our ability to consistently generate cash flow from operating activities is one of our most significant financial strengths. our strong cash flows enable us to invest in our people and our brands, make appropriate capital investments, provide a quarterly cash dividend program, and from time-to-time, repurchase shares of our common stock and make strategic investments and acquisitions that we believe will enhance shareholder value. our primary source of liquidity has been cash flow from operating activities. our principal use of cash in our operating activities is for purchasing and carrying inventories and carrying seasonal accounts receivable. historically, we have used cash flow from operating activities to repay our short-term borrowings and fund capital expenditures. additionally, we have a commercial paper program which we use to fund our short-term borrowing requirements and to maintain our access to the capital markets. we will continue to use our short-term borrowings, including our commercial paper program, to support our working capital requirements and capital expenditures. covid-19 has negatively impacted the global economy and financial markets which could interfere with our ability to access sources of liquidity at favorable rates and generate operating cash flows. we are currently evaluating recent covid-19 related legislation and governmental initiatives and expect to take advantage of opportunities to temporarily defer some payments including certain excise and payroll taxes.
we have maintained adequate liquidity to meet working capital requirements, fund capital expenditures, and repay scheduled principal and interest payments on debt. absent deterioration of market conditions, we believe that cash flows from operating activities and financing activities, primarily short-term borrowings, will provide adequate resources to satisfy our working capital, scheduled principal and interest payments on debt, anticipated dividend payments, periodic share repurchases, and anticipated capital expenditure requirements for both our short-term and long-term capital needs.
we have plans to sell a portion of our u.s. wine and spirits business. we expect to use the net cash proceeds from closing these transactions primarily to reduce outstanding borrowings.
the november 2017 canopy warrants with an exercise price of c$12.98 per warrant share will expire on may 1, 2020. we will evaluate exercise of the warrants immediately prior to expiration. if a decision is made to exercise the november 2017 canopy warrants, we expect to fund the c$245 million transaction with cash from operations.

constellation brands, inc. fy 2020 form 10-k   #worthreachingfor i part ii   item 7. md&amp;a operating activities the increase in net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2020 is largely due to strong cash flow from the beer segment driven primarily by the segment's solid operating results, combined with the timing of collections for recoverable value-added taxes. net cash provided by operating activities also benefited from lower income tax payments largely due to a change in estimated taxable income and the receipt of a higher federal tax refund for fiscal 2020 as compared with fiscal 2019. the increase in net cash provided by operating activities was partially offset by higher cash outflows from accounts payable primarily attributable to the timing of payments for the wine and spirits segment.
investing activities net cash used in investing activities for fiscal 2020 decreased primarily due to the $3,869.9 million november 2018 canopy transaction, proceeds of $269.7 million from the november 2019 black velvet divestiture, and lower fiscal 2020 capital expenditures of $159.8 million. the decrease in net cash used in investing activities was partially offset by proceeds received in fiscal 2019 of $110.2 million from the may 2018 sale of our accolade wine investment.

we do not have purchase commitments from buyers for our commercial paper and, therefore, our ability to issue commercial paper is subject to market demand. if the commercial paper market is not available to us for any reason when outstanding commercial paper borrowings mature, we will utilize unused commitments under our revolving credit facility under our 2018 credit agreement to repay commercial paper borrowings. we do not expect that fluctuations in demand for commercial paper will affect our liquidity given our borrowing capacity available under our revolving credit facility under our 2018 credit agreement.
we had the following borrowing capacity available under our 2018 credit agreement:

the financial institutions participating in our 2018 credit agreement have complied with prior funding requests and we believe such financial institutions will comply with any future funding requests. however, there can be no assurances that any particular financial institution will continue to do so.
we and our subsidiaries are subject to covenants that are contained in the 2018 credit agreement, including those restricting the incurrence of additional indebtedness (including guarantees of indebtedness) by subsidiaries, additional liens, mergers and consolidations, transactions with affiliates, and sale and leaseback transactions, in each case subject to numerous conditions, exceptions, and thresholds. the financial covenants are limited to a minimum interest coverage ratio and a maximum net constellation brands, inc. fy 2020 form 10-k   #worthreachingfor i part ii   item 7. md&amp;a leverage ratio, both as defined in the 2018 credit agreement. as of february 29, 2020, under the 2018 credit agreement, the minimum interest coverage ratio was 2.5x and the maximum net leverage ratio was 5.0x.
the representations, warranties, covenants, and events of default set forth in our term credit agreement and our 2019 term credit agreement are substantially similar to those set forth in our 2018 credit agreement.

constellation brands, inc. fy 2020 form 10-k   #worthreachingfor i 50
part ii   item 7. md&amp;a capital expenditures during fiscal 2020, we incurred $726.5 million for capital expenditures, including $571.7 million for the beer segment primarily for (i) our obregon brewery optimization and expansion, (ii) our nava brewery and glass production plant expansions, and (iii) our mexicali brewery construction (collectively, the "mexico beer expansion projects"). management reviews the capital expenditure program periodically and modifies it as required to meet current business needs. we do not believe it is prudent at this time to provide capital expenditure guidance for fiscal 2021 as we are not able to estimate the long-term impact of covid-19, including the demand for our products and the impact on the timeframes for completion of our mexico beer expansion projects.
in fiscal 2017, we began construction of the mexicali brewery. in march 2020, a public consultation on the construction of our mexicali brewery was held. we have initiated early stage discussions with government officials in mexico regarding next steps for our brewery construction project and options elsewhere in the country following the result of the public consultation. these discussions have been positive and we will continue working with government officials to mutually agree upon a path forward. in the medium-term, we have ample capacity, based on current growth forecasts and production capabilities at the nava and obregon breweries, to meet consumer needs. as of february 29, 2020, we recognized approximately $700 million of capital expenditures for construction in progress related to the mexicali brewery.
effects of inflation and changing prices our results of operations and financial condition have not been significantly affected by inflation and changing prices. we intend to pass along rising costs through increased selling prices, subject to normal competitive conditions. there can be no assurances, however, that we will be able to pass along rising costs through increased selling prices. in addition, we continue to identify on-going cost savings initiatives.
critical accounting estimates and policies our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note 1 of the notes to the financial statements. however, certain of our accounting policies are particularly important to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations and require the application of significant judgment by management; as a result, they are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. in applying those policies, management uses its judgment to determine the appropriate assumptions to be used in the determination of certain estimates. those estimates are based on our historical experience, our observance of trends in the industry, information provided by our customers and information available from other outside sources, as appropriate. on an ongoing basis, we review our estimates to ensure that they appropriately reflect changes in our business. our critical accounting estimates include:
•   fair value of financial instruments. certain inputs and assumptions to models used to determine fair value measurements require judgment, considering factors specific to the asset or liability. the use of certain inputs may include information derived through extrapolation or interpolation which involves management assumptions as well as valuation constellation brands, inc. fy 2020 form 10-k   #worthreachingfor i part ii   item 7. md&amp;a techniques. the fair values of our financial instruments that require the application of significant judgment by management are as follows:
canopy investments equity securities, warrants - estimated using the black-scholes option-pricing model (level 2 fair value measurement) and monte carlo simulations (level 2 fair value measurement). these valuation models use various market-based inputs, including stock price, remaining contractual term, expected volatility, risk-free interest rate, and expected dividend yield, as applicable. management applies significant judgment in its determination of expected volatility. we consider both historical and implied volatility levels of the underlying equity security and apply limited consideration of historical peer group volatility levels.
debt securities, convertible - estimated using a binomial lattice option-pricing model (level 2 fair value measurement), which includes an estimate of the credit spread based on the implied spread as of the issuance date of the notes. this valuation model uses various market-based inputs, including stock price, remaining term, expected volatility, risk-free interest rate, and expected dividend yield, as applicable.
management's estimate of fair value requires significant management judgment and is subject to a high degree of variability based upon market conditions, the availability of specific information and management's assumptions.
•   goodwill and other intangible assets. we account for goodwill and other intangible assets by classifying intangible assets into three categories: (i) intangible assets with definite lives subject to amortization, (ii) intangible assets with indefinite lives not subject to amortization, and (iii) goodwill. for intangible assets with definite lives, impairment testing is required if conditions exist that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. for intangible assets with indefinite lives and for goodwill, impairment testing is required at least annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that these assets might be impaired. we perform annual impairment tests and re-evaluate the useful lives of other intangible assets with indefinite lives at the annual impairment test measurement date of january 1 or when circumstances arise that indicate a possible impairment or change in useful life might exist.
the guidance for goodwill impairment testing allows an entity to assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount or to proceed directly to performing a quantitative impairment test. under the quantitative assessment, the estimated fair value of each reporting unit is compared to its carrying value, including goodwill. the estimate of fair value of the reporting unit is generally calculated based on an income approach using the discounted cash flow method. if the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value of the reporting unit, a goodwill impairment will be recognized. the amount of impairment charge for goodwill is equal to the excess of the carrying value of the goodwill over the implied fair value of the goodwill. our reporting units with goodwill include the beer segment and the wine and spirits segment. in estimating the fair value of the reporting units, management must make assumptions and projections regarding such items as future cash flows, future revenues, future earnings, and other factors. the assumptions used in the estimate of fair value are based on historical trends and the projections and assumptions that are used in current strategic operating plans. these assumptions reflect management's estimates of future economic and competitive conditions and are, therefore, subject to change as a result of changing market conditions. if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future, we may be required to recognize an impairment loss for these assets. the recognition of any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our financial statements.
constellation brands, inc. fy 2020 form 10-k   #worthreachingfor i part ii   item 7. md&amp;a in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, we performed our annual goodwill impairment analysis using the quantitative assessment. no indication of impairment was noted for any of our reporting units, as the estimated fair value of each of our reporting units with goodwill exceeded their carrying value. based on this analysis, the reporting unit with the lowest amount of estimated fair value in excess of its carrying value was the wine and spirits reporting unit with approximately 107% excess fair value. for fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018, as a result of our annual goodwill impairment analyses, we concluded that there were no indications of impairment for either of our reporting units.
the most significant assumptions used in the discounted cash flow calculation to determine the estimated fair value of our reporting units in connection with the impairment testing are: (i) the discount rate, (ii) the expected long-term growth rate, and (iii) the annual cash flow projections. as of january 1, 2020, if we used a discount rate that was 50 basis points higher or used an expected long-term growth rate that was 50 basis points lower or used annual cash flow projections that were 100 basis points lower in our impairment testing of goodwill, then the changes individually would not have resulted in the carrying value of the respective reporting unit's net assets, including its goodwill, exceeding its estimated fair value, which would indicate the potential for impairment and the requirement to measure the amount of impairment, if any.
our other intangible assets consist primarily of customer relationships and trademarks obtained through business acquisitions. customer relationships are amortized over their estimated useful lives. the trademarks that were determined to have indefinite useful lives are not amortized. the guidance for indefinite lived intangible asset impairment testing allows an entity to assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances indicates that it is more likely than not that the indefinite lived intangible asset is impaired or to proceed directly to performing the quantitative impairment test. under the quantitative assessment, our trademarks are evaluated for impairment by comparing the carrying value of the trademarks to their estimated fair value. the estimated fair value of trademarks is calculated based on an income approach using the relief from royalty method. the estimate of fair value is then compared to the carrying value of each trademark. if the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value of the trademark, then an impairment charge is recognized to reduce the carrying value of the trademark to its estimated fair value. in estimating the fair value of the trademarks, management must make assumptions and projections regarding future cash flows based upon future revenues and other factors. the assumptions used in the estimate of fair value are consistent with historical trends and the projections and assumptions that are used in current strategic operating plans. these assumptions reflect management's estimates of future economic and competitive conditions and are, therefore, subject to change as a result of changing market conditions. if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future, we may be required to recognize an impairment loss for these assets. the recognition of any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our financial statements.
during the second quarter of fiscal 2020, certain continuing negative trends within our beer segment's ballast point craft beer portfolio, including increased rate of revenue decline and increased competition, indicated that it was more likely than not that the fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible asset associated with the ballast point craft beer trademarks might be below its carrying value. accordingly, we performed a quantitative assessment for impairment. as a result of this assessment, the ballast point craft beer trademark asset recognized an impairment loss of $11.0 million. for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, the beer segment's ballast point business recognized a trademark impairment loss of $108.0 million in connection with certain continuing negative trends within its craft beer portfolio and a change in strategy for this portfolio focused on improving profitability by rationalizing the number of product offerings while targeting distribution growth in select strategic markets. in the first constellation brands, inc. fy 2020 form 10-k   #worthreachingfor i part ii   item 7. md&amp;a quarter of fiscal 2018, the beer segment's ballast point business recognized a trademark impairment loss of $86.8 million in connection with certain negative trends within its craft beer portfolio.
the most significant assumptions used in the relief from royalty method to determine the estimated fair value of intangible assets with indefinite lives in connection with impairment testing are: (i) the estimated royalty rate, (ii) the discount rate, (iii) the expected long-term growth rate, and (iv) the annual revenue projections. as of january 1, 2020, if we used a royalty rate that was 50 basis points lower or used a discount rate that was 50 basis points higher or used an expected long-term growth rate that was 50 basis points lower or used annual revenue projections that were 100 basis points lower in our impairment testing of intangible assets with indefinite lives, then each change individually would not have resulted in any unit of accounting's carrying value exceeding its estimated fair value.
the guidance for divestitures requires that when some, but not all of a reporting unit is disposed of, some of the goodwill of the reporting unit should be allocated to the portion of the reporting unit being disposed of, if that portion constitutes a business. the allocation of goodwill shall be based on the relative fair values of the portion of the reporting unit being disposed of and the portion of the reporting unit remaining. this approach requires a determination of the fair value of both the business being disposed and the businesses retained within the reporting unit.
our estimate of fair value for the new wine and spirits transactions was determined based on the expected proceeds from the transactions. the components being sold are a part of the wine and spirits segment and were included in our wine and spirits reporting unit. accordingly, goodwill was allocated to the new wine and spirits transactions assets held for sale based on the relative fair value of the businesses being sold compared to the relative fair value of the reporting unit. goodwill not allocated to assets held for sale remains in the wine and spirits reporting unit.
•   accounting for income taxes. we estimate our deferred tax assets and liabilities, income taxes payable, provision for income taxes, and unrecognized tax benefit liabilities based upon various factors including, but not limited to, historical pretax operating income, future estimates of pretax operating income, differences between book and tax treatment of various items of income and expense, interpretation of tax laws, and tax planning strategies. we are subject to income taxes in canada, mexico, switzerland, the u.s., and other jurisdictions. we are regularly audited by federal, state, and foreign tax authorities, but a number of years may elapse before an uncertain tax position, is audited and finally resolved.
we believe that all tax positions are fully supported. however, we recognize tax assets and liabilities in accordance with the fasb guidance for income tax accounting. accordingly, we recognize a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination. we measure and recognize the tax benefit from such a position based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the unrecognized tax benefit liabilities. in addition, changes in existing tax laws or rates could significantly change our current estimate of our unrecognized tax benefit liabilities. these differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which they are determined. changes in current estimates, if significant, could have a material adverse impact on our financial statements.
we recognize our deferred tax assets and liabilities based upon the expected future tax outcome of amounts recognized in our results of operations. if necessary, we recognize a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that they will not be constellation brands, inc. fy 2020 form 10-k   #worthreachingfor i part ii   item 7. md&amp;a realized. we evaluate our ability to realize the tax benefits associated with deferred tax assets by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income, historical, and projected operating results, and the availability of prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. the realization of deferred tax assets is evaluated by jurisdiction and the realizability of these assets can vary based on the character of the tax attribute and the carryforward periods specific to each jurisdiction. we believe it is more likely than not that the results of future operations will generate sufficient taxable income to realize our existing deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowances. changes in the realizability of our deferred tax assets will be reflected in our effective tax rate in the period in which they are determined.

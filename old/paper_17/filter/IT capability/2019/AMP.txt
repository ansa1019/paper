item 1a. risk factors our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including those described below, that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations and could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline. we believe that the following information identifies the material factors affecting our company based on the information we currently know. however, the risks and uncertainties our company faces are not limited to those described below. additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business.
risks relating to our business and operations our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected by market fluctuations and by economic, political and other factors.
our financial condition and results of operations may be materially affected by market fluctuations and by economic and other factors. such factors, which can be global, regional, national or local in nature, include: (i) political, social, economic and market conditions; (ii) the availability and cost of capital; (iii) the level and volatility of equity prices, commodity prices and interest rates, currency values and other market indices; (iv) technological changes and events; (v) u.s. and foreign government fiscal and tax policies; (vi) u.s. and foreign government ability, real or perceived, to avoid defaulting on government securities; (vii) the availability and cost of credit; (viii) inflation; (ix) investor sentiment and confidence in the financial markets; (x) terrorism and armed conflicts; and (xi) natural disasters such as weather catastrophes and widespread health emergencies. furthermore, changes in consumer economic variables, such as the number and size of personal bankruptcy filings, the rate of unemployment, decreases in property values, and the level of consumer confidence and consumer debt, may substantially affect consumer loan levels and credit quality, which, in turn, could impact client activity in all of our businesses. these factors also may have an impact on our ability to achieve our strategic objectives.
declines and volatility in u.s. and global market conditions have impacted our businesses in the past and may do so again. our businesses have been, and in the future may be, adversely affected by u.s. and global capital market and credit crises, the repricing of credit risk, equity market volatility and decline and stress or recession in the u.s. and global economies generally. each of our segments operates in these markets with exposure for us and our clients in securities, loans, derivatives, alternative investments, seed capital and other commitments. it is difficult to predict when, how long and to what extent the aforementioned adverse conditions may exist, which of our markets, products and businesses will be directly affected in terms of revenues, management fees and investment valuations and earnings, and to what extent our clients may seek to bring claims arising out of investment performance that is affected by these conditions. as a result, these factors could materially adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.
our revenues are largely dependent upon the level and mix of assets we have under management and administration, which are subject to fluctuations based on market conditions and client activity. downturns and volatility in equity markets can have, and have had, an adverse effect on the revenues and returns from our asset management services, retail advisory accounts, variable annuity contracts and banking products. because the profitability of these products and services depends on fees related primarily to the value of assets under management, declines in the equity markets will reduce our revenues because the value of the investment assets we manage will be reduced. in addition, market downturns and volatility (as well as general regulatory or economic uncertainty, such as brexit) may cause, and have caused, potential new purchasers of our products to limit purchases of or to refrain from purchasing products such as mutual funds, oeics, sicavs, variable annuities and variable universal life insurance. downturns and uncertainty may also cause current shareholders in our mutual funds, oeics, sicavs, unit trusts and investment trusts, contractholders in our annuity products and policyholders in our protection products to withdraw cash values from those products.
most of our variable annuity products contain guaranteed minimum death benefits and guaranteed minimum withdrawal and accumulation benefits. a significant equity market decline or volatility in equity markets could result in guaranteed minimum benefits being higher than what current account values would support, which would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. although we have hedged a portion of the guarantees for the variable annuity contracts to mitigate the financial loss of equity market declines or volatility, there can be no assurance that such a decline or volatility would not materially impact the profitability of certain products or product lines or our financial condition or results of operations. further, the cost of hedging our liability for these guarantees has increased as a result of low interest rates and volatility in the equity markets and broad-based market and regulatory-driven changes in the collateral requirements of hedge trading counterparties. in addition, heightened volatility (and the transition away from libor as a widely-accepted interest rate reference) creates greater uncertainty for future hedging effectiveness.
we believe that investment performance is an important factor in the success of many of our businesses. poor investment performance could impair our revenues and earnings, as well as our prospects for growth. poor investment performance could also result in additional benefits paid under certain annuity products (such variable annuity living benefits and death benefits). a significant portion of our revenue is derived from investment management agreements with the columbia management family of mutual funds which are terminable on 60 days' notice. in addition, although some contracts governing investment management services are subject to termination for failure to meet performance benchmarks, institutional and individual clients can terminate their relationships with us or our financial advisors at will or on relatively short notice. our clients can also reduce the aggregate amount of managed assets or shift their funds to other types of accounts with different rate structures, for any number of reasons, including investment performance, changes in prevailing interest rates, changes in investment preferences or investment management strategy (for example, "active" or "passive" investing styles), changes in our (or our advisors') reputation in the marketplace, changes in client management or ownership, loss of key investment management personnel and financial market performance. a reduction in managed assets, and the associated decrease in revenues and earnings, could have a material adverse effect on our business. moreover, if our money market funds experience a decline in market value, we may choose to contribute capital to those funds without consideration, which would result in a loss.
during periods of unfavorable or stagnating market or economic conditions, the level of individual investor participation in the global markets may also decrease, which would negatively impact the results of our retail businesses. concerns about current market and economic conditions, declining real estate values and decreased consumer confidence have caused, and in the future may cause, some of our clients to reduce the amount of business they do with us. fluctuations in global market activity could impact the flow of investment capital into or from assets under management and the way customers allocate capital among money market, equity, fixed maturity or other investment alternatives, which could negatively impact our asset management, advice & wealth management and annuities businesses. if we are unable to offer appropriate product alternatives which encourage customers to continue purchasing in the face of actual or perceived market volatility, our sales and management fee revenues could decline. uncertain economic conditions and heightened market volatility may also increase the likelihood that clients or regulators present or threaten legal claims, that regulators may increase the frequency and scope of their examinations of us or the financial services industry generally, and that lawmakers may enact new requirements or taxation which can have a material impact on our revenues, expenses or statutory capital requirements.
changes in interest rates and prolonged periods of low interest rates may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
certain of our insurance, annuity, investment products and banking products are sensitive to interest rate fluctuations, and future impacts associated with such variations may differ from our historical costs. in addition, interest rate fluctuations could result in fluctuations in the valuation of certain minimum guaranteed benefits contained in some of our variable annuity products. although we typically hedge to mitigate some of the effect of such fluctuations, significant changes in interest rates could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.
during periods of increasing market interest rates, we may offer higher crediting rates on interest-sensitive products, such as universal life insurance, fixed annuities and face-amount certificates, and we may increase crediting rates on in force products to keep these products competitive. because yields on invested assets may not increase as quickly as current interest rates, we may have to accept a lower spread and thus lower profitability or face a decline in sales and greater loss of existing contracts and related assets. in addition, increases in market interest rates may cause increased policy surrenders, withdrawals from life insurance policies and annuity contracts and requests for policy loans, as policyholders and contractholders seek to shift assets to products with perceived higher returns. this process may lead to an earlier than expected outflow of cash from our business. these withdrawals and surrenders may require investment assets to be sold at a time when the prices of those assets are lower because of the increase in market interest rates, which may result in realized investment losses. also, increases in market interest rates may result in extension of certain cash flows from structured mortgage assets. increases in crediting rates, as well as surrenders and withdrawals, could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. an increase in policy surrenders and withdrawals also may require us to accelerate amortization of deferred acquisition costs ("dac") or other intangibles or cause an impairment of goodwill, which would increase our expenses and reduce our net earnings.
during periods of falling interest rates or stagnancy of low interest rates, our spread may be reduced or could become negative, primarily because some of our products have guaranteed minimum crediting rates. due to the long-term nature of the liabilities associated with certain of our businesses, such as long term care and universal life with secondary guarantees as well as fixed annuities and guaranteed benefits on variable annuities, sustained declines in or stagnancy of low long-term interest rates may subject us to reinvestment risks and increased hedging costs. in addition, reduced or negative spreads may require us to accelerate amortization of dac, which would increase our expenses and reduce our net earnings.
interest rate fluctuations also could have an adverse effect on the results of our investment portfolio. during periods of declining market interest rates or stagnancy of low interest rates, the interest we receive on variable interest rate investments decreases. in addition, during those periods, we are forced to reinvest the cash we receive as interest or return of principal on our investments in lower-yielding high-grade instruments or in lower-credit instruments to maintain comparable returns. issuers of certain callable fixed income securities also may decide to prepay their obligations in order to borrow at lower market rates, which increases the risk that we may have to reinvest the cash proceeds of these securities in lower-yielding or lower-credit instruments.
adverse capital and credit market conditions may significantly affect our ability to meet liquidity needs, our access to capital and our cost of capital.
the capital and credit markets may experience, and have experienced, varying degrees of volatility and disruption. in some cases, the markets have exerted downward pressure on availability of liquidity and credit capacity for certain issuers. we need liquidity to pay our operating expenses, interest expenses and dividends on our capital stock. without sufficient liquidity, we could be required to curtail our operations and our business would suffer.
our liquidity needs are satisfied primarily through our reserves and the cash generated by our operations. we believe the level of cash and securities we maintain, combined with expected cash inflows from investments and operations, is adequate to meet anticipated short-term and long-term payment obligations. in the event current resources are insufficient to satisfy our needs, we may access financing sources such as bank debt. the availability of additional financing would depend on a variety of factors such as market conditions, the general availability of credit, the volume of trading activities, the overall availability of credit to the financial services industry, our credit ratings and credit capacity, as well as the possibility that our shareholders, customers or lenders could develop a negative perception of our long- or short-term financial prospects if we incur large investment losses or if the level of our business activity decreases due to a market downturn. similarly, our access to funds may be rendered more costly or impaired if regulatory authorities or rating organizations take actions against us.
disruptions, uncertainty or volatility in the capital and credit markets may also limit our access to capital required to operate our business. such market conditions may limit our ability to satisfy statutory capital requirements, generate fee income and market-related revenue to meet liquidity needs and access the capital necessary to grow our business. as such, we may be forced to delay raising capital, issue different types of capital than we would otherwise, less effectively deploy such capital, or bear an unattractive cost of capital which could decrease our profitability and significantly reduce our financial flexibility.
a downgrade or a potential downgrade in our financial strength or credit ratings could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
financial strength ratings, which various rating organizations publish as a measure of an insurance company's ability to meet contractholder and policyholder obligations, are important to maintain public confidence in our products, the ability to market our products and our competitive position. a downgrade in our financial strength ratings, or the announced potential for a downgrade, could have a significant adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations in many ways, including: (i) reducing new sales of insurance and annuity products and investment products; (ii) adversely affecting our relationships with our advisors and third-party distributors of our products; (iii) materially increasing the number or amount of policy surrenders and withdrawals by contractholders and policyholders; (iv) requiring us to reduce prices for many of our products and services to remain competitive; and (v) adversely affecting our ability to obtain reinsurance or obtain reasonable pricing on reinsurance.
a downgrade in our credit ratings could also adversely impact our future cost and speed of borrowing and have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.
in view of the difficulties experienced in recent years by many financial institutions, including our competitors in the insurance industry, the rating organizations have heightened the level of scrutiny that they apply to such institutions and have requested additional information from the companies that they rate. they may increase the frequency and scope of their credit reviews, adjust upward the capital and other requirements employed in the rating organizations' models for maintenance of ratings levels, or downgrade ratings applied to particular classes of securities or types of institutions.
rating organizations may also become subject to tighter laws, regulations or scrutiny governing ratings, which may in turn impact ratings assigned to financial institutions.
we cannot predict what actions rating organizations may take, or what actions we may take in response to the actions of rating organizations, which could adversely affect our business. as with other companies in the financial services industry, our ratings could be changed at any time and without any notice by the rating organizations.
intense competition and the economics of changes in our product revenue mix and distribution channels could negatively impact our ability to maintain or increase our market share and profitability.
our businesses operate in intensely competitive industry segments. we compete based on a number of factors, including name recognition, service, the quality of investment advice, investment performance, product offerings and features, price, perceived financial strength, claims-paying ability and credit ratings. our competitors include broker-dealers, banks, asset managers, insurers and other financial institutions. certain of our competitors offer web-based or mobile-based financial services or discount brokerage services to individual clients. many of our businesses face competitors that have greater market share, offer a broader range of products, have greater financial resources, or have higher claims-paying ability or credit ratings than we do. some of our competitors may possess or acquire intellectual property rights that could provide a competitive advantage to them in certain markets or for certain products, which could make it difficult for us to introduce new products and services. some of our competitors' proprietary products or technology could be similar to our own, and this could result in disputes that could impact our financial condition or results of operations. in addition, over time certain sectors of the financial services industry have become considerably more concentrated, as financial institutions involved in a broad range of financial services have been acquired by or merged into other firms, or distribution firms (including our own) are seeking to limit the breadth of product offerings in order to simplify their regulatory and risk management. this convergence could result in our competitors gaining greater resources, and we may experience downward pressures on our pricing and market share as a result of these factors and as some of our competitors seek to increase market share by reducing prices. furthermore, the uncertain regulatory environment in the u.s. and around the world will cause various structural changes to the industry and other competitors may be better positioned to reap the benefits of that structural change and movement of assets around the industry depending on final regulations and trends among distributors and clients.
the offerings available to our advisor network include not only products issued by our riversource life and columbia threadneedle investments companies, but also products issued by unaffiliated insurance companies and asset managers. as a result of this and further openings of our advisor network to the products of other companies, we could experience lower sales of our companies' products, higher surrenders or redemptions, or other developments which might not be fully offset by higher distribution revenues or other benefits, possibly resulting in an adverse effect on our results of operations. in addition, some of our products, are made available through alliances with unaffiliated third parties. we could experience lower sales or incur higher distribution costs or other developments which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations if alliance relationships are discontinued or if the terms of our alliances change.
we face intense competition in attracting and retaining key talent.
our continued success depends to a substantial degree on our ability to attract and retain qualified people. we are dependent on our network of advisors to drive growth and results in our wealth management business and also for a significant portion of the sales of our mutual funds, annuities, face-amount certificates, banking and insurance products. in addition, the investment performance of our asset management products and services and the retention of our products and services by our clients are dependent upon the strategies and decisioning of our portfolio managers and analysts. the market for these financial advisors and portfolio managers is extremely competitive, as are the markets for qualified and skilled executives and marketing, finance, legal, compliance and other professionals. from time to time there are regulatory-driven or other trends and developments within the industry, such as changes around the protocol for broker recruiting, that could potentially impact the current competitive dynamics between us and our competitors. if we are unable to attract and retain qualified individuals or our recruiting and retention costs increase significantly, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely impacted.
the impairment or negative performance of other financial institutions could adversely affect us.
we have exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and we routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including broker-dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, hedge funds, insurers, reinsurers, investment funds and other institutions. the operations of u.s. and global financial services institutions are interconnected and a decline in the financial condition of one or more financial services institutions may expose us to credit losses or defaults, limit our access to liquidity or otherwise disrupt the operations of our businesses. while we regularly assess our exposure to different industries and counterparties, the performance and financial strength of specific institutions are subject to rapid change, the timing and extent of which cannot be known.
many transactions with and investments in the products and securities of other financial institutions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of our counterparty. with respect to secured transactions, our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral we hold cannot be realized upon or is liquidated at prices insufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivative exposure due to it. we also have exposure to financial institutions in the form of unsecured debt instruments, derivative transactions (including with respect to derivatives hedging our exposure on variable annuity contracts with guaranteed benefits), reinsurance, repurchase and underwriting arrangements and equity investments. there can be no assurance that any such losses or impairments to the carrying value of these assets would not materially and adversely impact our business and results of operations.
downgrades in the credit or financial strength ratings assigned to the counterparties with whom we transact or other adverse reputational impacts to such counterparties could create the perception that our financial condition will be adversely impacted as a result of potential future defaults by such counterparties. additionally, we could be adversely affected by a general, negative perception of financial institutions caused by the downgrade or other adverse impact to the reputation of other financial institutions.
accordingly, ratings downgrades or other adverse reputational impacts for other financial institutions could affect our market capitalization and could limit access to or increase our cost of capital.
a number of the products and services we make available to our clients are those offered by third parties, for which we may generate revenue based on the level of assets under management, the number of client transactions or otherwise. the poor performance of such products and services, or negative perceptions of the firms offering such products and services, may adversely impact our sales of such products and services and reduce our revenue. in addition, such failures or poor performance of products and services offered by other financial institutions could adversely impact consumer confidence in products and services that we offer. negative perceptions of certain financial products and services, or the financial industry in general, may increase the number of withdrawals and redemptions or reduce purchases made by our clients, which would adversely impact the levels of our assets under management, revenues and liquidity position.
a drop in our investment performance as compared to that of our competitors could negatively impact our revenues and profitability.
investment performance is a key competitive factor for our retail and institutional asset management products and services. strong investment performance helps to ensure the retention of our products and services by our clients and creates new sales of products and services. it may also result in higher ratings by ratings services such as morningstar or lipper, which may compound the foregoing effects. strong investment performance and its effects are important elements to our stated goals of growing assets under management and achieving economies of scale.
there can be no assurance as to how future investment performance will compare to our competitors or that historical performance will be indicative of future returns. any drop or perceived drop in investment performance as compared to our competitors could cause a decline in sales of our mutual funds and other investment products, an increase in redemptions and the termination of institutional asset management relationships. these impacts may reduce our aggregate amount of assets under management and reduce management fees. poor investment performance could also adversely affect our ability to expand the distribution of our products through unaffiliated third parties. further, any drop in market share of mutual funds sales by our advisors may further reduce profits as sales of other companies' mutual funds are less profitable than sales of our proprietary funds.
we distribute certain of our investment products through unaffiliated third-party advisors and financial institutions. maintaining and deepening relationships with these unaffiliated distributors is an important part of our growth strategy, as strong third-party distribution arrangements enhance our ability to market our products and to increase our assets under management, revenues and profitability. there can be no assurance that the distribution relationships we have established will continue, as our distribution partners may cease to operate or otherwise terminate their relationship with us. any such reduction in access to third-party distributors may have a material adverse effect on our ability to market our products and to generate revenue in our asset management and annuities segments.
access to distribution channels is subject to intense competition due to the large number of competitors and products in the investment advisory and annuities industries as well as regulatory and consumer trends driving escalating compliance, disclosure and risk management requirements for distributors. relationships with distributors are subject to periodic negotiation that may result in increased distribution costs and/or reductions in the amount of our products marketed, and the frequency or complexity of these negotiations is expected to increase in light of prevailing regulatory reforms and market volatility. any increase in the costs to distribute our products or reduction in the type or amount of products made available for sale may have a material effect on our revenues and profitability.
we face risks arising from acquisitions and divestitures.
we have made acquisitions and divestitures in the past and may pursue similar strategic transactions in the future. risks in acquisition transactions include difficulties in the integration of acquired businesses into our operations and control environment (including our risk management policies and procedures), difficulties in assimilating and retaining employees and intermediaries, difficulties in retaining the existing customers of the acquired entities, assumed or unforeseen liabilities that arise in connection with the acquired businesses, the failure of counterparties to satisfy any obligations to indemnify us against liabilities arising from the acquired businesses, and unfavorable market conditions that could negatively impact our growth expectations for the acquired businesses. fully integrating an acquired company or business into our operations (such as our recent acquisitions of lionstone investments and ipi) may take a significant amount of time. risks in divestiture transactions (such as our recent divestiture of our auto and home insurance business to american family insurance) include difficulties in the separation of the disposed business, retention or obligation to indemnify certain liabilities, the failure of counterparties to satisfy payment obligations, unfavorable market conditions that may impact any earnout or contingency payment due to us, if any, and unexpected difficulties in losing employees of the disposed business. we cannot assure you that we will be successful in overcoming these risks or any other problems encountered with acquisitions, divestitures and other strategic transactions. execution of our business strategies also may require certain regulatory approvals or consents, which may include approvals of the frb and other domestic and non-u.s. regulatory authorities. these regulatory authorities may impose conditions on the activities or transactions contemplated by our business strategies which may impact negatively our ability to realize fully the expected benefits of certain opportunities. these risks may prevent us from realizing the expected benefits from acquisitions or divestitures and could result in the failure to realize the full economic value of a strategic transaction or the impairment of goodwill and/or intangible assets recognized at the time of an acquisition. these risks could be heightened if we complete a large acquisition or multiple acquisitions within a short period of time.
third-party defaults, bankruptcy filings, legal actions and other events may limit the value of or restrict our access and our clients' access to cash and investments.
capital and credit market volatility can exacerbate, and has exacerbated, the risk of third-party defaults, bankruptcy filings, foreclosures, legal actions and other events that may limit the value of or restrict our access and our clients' access to cash and investments. although we are not required to do so, we have elected in the past, and we may elect in the future, to compensate clients for losses incurred in response to such events, provide clients with temporary credit or liquidity or other support related to products that we manage, or provide credit liquidity or other support to the financial products we manage. any such election to provide support may arise from factors specific to our clients, our products or industry-wide factors. if we elect to provide additional support, we could incur losses from the support we provide and incur additional costs, including financing costs, in connection with the support. these losses and additional costs could be material and could adversely impact our results of operations. if we were to take such actions we may also restrict or otherwise utilize our corporate assets, limiting our flexibility to use these assets for other purposes, and may be required to raise additional capital.
defaults in our fixed maturity securities portfolio or consumer credit holdings could adversely affect our earnings.
issuers of the fixed maturity securities that we own may default on principal and interest payments. as of december 31, 2019, 3.1% of our fixed maturity securities had ratings below investment-grade. moreover, economic downturns and corporate malfeasance can increase the number of companies, including those with investment-grade ratings, which default on their debt obligations. default-related declines in the value of our fixed maturity securities portfolio or consumer credit holdings could cause our net earnings to decline and could also cause us to contribute capital to some of our regulated subsidiaries, which may require us to obtain funding during periods of unfavorable market conditions.
our valuation of fixed maturity and equity securities may include methodologies, estimations and assumptions which are subject to differing interpretations and could result in changes to investment valuations that may materially adversely impact our results of operations or financial condition.
fixed maturity, equity, trading securities and short-term investments, which are reported at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets, represent the majority of our total cash and invested assets. the determination of fair values by management in the absence of quoted market prices is based on valuation methodologies, securities we deem to be comparable, and assumptions deemed appropriate given the circumstances. the fair value estimates are made at a specific point in time, based on available market information and judgments about financial instruments, including estimates of the timing and amounts of expected future cash flows and the credit standing of the issuer or counterparty. factors considered in estimating fair value include: coupon rate, maturity, estimated duration, call provisions, sinking fund requirements, credit rating, industry sector of the issuer, interest rates, credit spreads, and quoted market prices of comparable securities. the use of different methodologies and assumptions may have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts.
during periods of market disruption, including periods of significantly rising or high interest rates and rapidly widening credit spreads or illiquidity, it may be difficult to value certain of our securities. there may be certain asset classes that were in active markets with significant observable data that become illiquid due to the financial environment. in such cases, the valuation of certain securities may require additional subjectivity and management judgment. as such, valuations may include inputs and assumptions that are less observable and may require greater estimation as well as valuation methods that are more sophisticated, which may result in values less than the value at which the investments may be ultimately sold. further, rapidly changing and unexpected credit and equity market conditions could materially impact the valuation of securities as reported within our consolidated financial statements and the period-to-period changes in value could vary significantly. decreases in value may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.
the elimination of libor may adversely affect the interest rates on and value of certain derivatives and floating rate securities we hold, the activities we conduct, and any other assets or liabilities whose value is tied to libor.
the fca, which regulates the libor, has announced that it will not compel panel banks to contribute to libor after 2021. it is likely that banks will not continue to provide submissions for the calculation of libor after 2021 and possibly prior to then. it is expected that a transition away from the widespread use of libor to alternative rates will occur over the next two years. actions by regulators have resulted in the establishment of alternative reference rates to libor in most major currencies. the u.s. federal reserve, based on the recommendations of the new york federal reserve's alternative reference rate committee (constituted of major derivative market participants and their regulators), has begun publishing a secured overnight funding rate ("sofr") which is intended to replace u.s. dollar libor, and sofr-based investment products have been issued in the u.s. proposals for alternative reference rates for other currencies have also been announced or have already begun publication. markets are slowly developing in response to these new rates and questions around liquidity in these rates and how to appropriately adjust these rates to eliminate any economic value transfer at the time of transition remain a significant concern for us and others in the marketplace. although the full impact of transition remains unclear, this change may have an adverse impact on the value of, return on and trading markets for a broad array of financial products, including any libor-based securities, loans and derivatives that are included in our financial assets and liabilities. if libor is discontinued after 2021 as expected, there will be uncertainty or differences in the calculation of the applicable interest rate or payment amount depending on the terms of the governing instruments. there will be significant work required to transition to the new benchmark rates and implement necessary changes to our systems, processes and models. this may impact our existing transaction data, products, systems, operations, valuation and financial risk management processes. in addition, libor may perform differently during the phase-out period than in the past which could result in lower interest payments and a reduction in the value of certain assets. accordingly, it is difficult to predict the full impact of the transition away from libor on various derivatives, floating rate securities and other securities we hold, the activities we conduct in our various businesses, and any other assets or liabilities (as well as contractual rights and obligations) whose value is tied to libor. the value or profitability of these products and instruments, and our costs of operations, may be adversely affected until new reference rates and fallbacks for both legacy and new products, instruments and contracts are commercially accepted.
the determination of the amount of allowances and impairments taken on certain investments is subject to management's evaluation and judgment and could materially impact our results of operations or financial position.
the determination of the amount of allowances and impairments vary by investment type and is based upon our periodic evaluation and assessment of inherent and known risks associated with the respective asset class. such evaluations and assessments are revised as conditions change and new information becomes available. management updates its evaluations regularly and reflects changes in allowances and impairments in operations as such evaluations are revised. historical trends may not be indicative of future impairments or allowances.
the assessment of whether impairments have occurred is based on management's case-by-case evaluation of the underlying reasons for the decline in fair value that considers a wide range of factors about the security issuer or borrower, and management uses its best judgment in evaluating the cause of the decline in the estimated fair value of the security or loan and in assessing the prospects for recovery. inherent in management's evaluation of the security or loan are assumptions and estimates about the operations of the issuer and its future earnings potential.
we invest a portion of our owned assets in certain privately placed fixed income securities, mortgage loans, policy loans and limited partnership interests, all of which are relatively illiquid. these asset classes represented 12.9% of the carrying value of our investment portfolio as of december 31, 2019. if we require significant amounts of cash on short notice in excess of our normal cash requirements, we may have difficulty selling these investments in a timely manner or be forced to sell them for an amount less than we would otherwise have been able to realize, or both, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
our insurance companies are required by law to be members of the guaranty fund association in every state where they are licensed to do business. in the event of insolvency of one or more unaffiliated insurance companies, our insurance companies could be adversely affected by the requirement to pay assessments to the guaranty fund associations. uncertainty and volatility in the u.s. economy and financial markets in recent years, plus the repercussions of a heightened regulatory environment, have weakened or may weaken the financial condition of numerous insurers, including insurers currently in receiverships, increasing the risk of triggering guaranty fund assessments. for more information regarding assessments from guaranty fund associations, see note 26 to our consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k.
if the counterparties to our reinsurance arrangements or to the derivative instruments we use to hedge our business risks default or otherwise fail to fulfill their obligations, we may be exposed to risks we had sought to mitigate, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
we use reinsurance to mitigate our risks in various circumstances as described in item 1 of this annual report on form 10-k - "business - our segments - protection - reinsurance." reinsurance does not relieve us of our direct liability to our policyholders and contractholders, even when the reinsurer is liable to us. accordingly, we bear credit and performance risk with respect to our reinsurers, including commonwealth annuity and life insurance company as well as genworth life insurance company. in july 2016, we finalized various confidential enhancements with genworth life insurance company that have been shared, in the normal course of regular reviews, with our domiciliary regulators and rating agencies. a reinsurer's insolvency or its inability or unwillingness to make payments under the terms of our reinsurance agreement could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. see notes 2, 7 and 8 to our consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for additional information regarding reinsurance.
in addition, we use a variety of derivative instruments (including options, forwards, swaps and futures with a number of counterparties to hedge business risks. the amount and breadth of exposure to derivative counterparties, as well as the cost of derivative instruments, have increased significantly in connection with our strategies to hedge guaranteed benefit obligations under our variable annuity products. if our counterparties fail to honor their obligations under the derivative instruments in a timely manner, our hedges of the related risk will be ineffective. that failure could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. this risk of failure of our hedge transactions from counterparty default may be increased by capital market volatility.
we provide investment securities as collateral to our derivative counterparties which they may sell, pledge, or rehypothecate. we have exposure, under the relevant arrangement, if the collateral is not returned to us to the extent that the fair value of the collateral exceeds our liability. additionally, we may also accept investment securities as collateral from our derivative counterparties, which we may sell, pledge, or rehypothecate. if the counterparties that we pledge the collateral to are not able to return these investment securities under the terms of the relevant arrangements, we would be required to deliver alternative investments or cash to our derivative counterparty, which could impact our liquidity and could adversely impact our financial condition or results of operations.
if our reserves for future policy benefits and claims or for our bank lending portfolio or for future certificate redemptions and maturities are inadequate, we may be required to increase our reserve liabilities, which would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
we establish reserves as estimates of our liabilities to provide for future obligations under our insurance policies, annuities and investment certificate contracts. we also establish reserves as estimates of the potential for loan losses in our consumer lending portfolios. reserves do not represent an exact calculation of the liability but, rather, are estimates of contract benefits and related expenses we expect to incur over time. the assumptions and estimates we make in establishing reserves require certain judgments about future experience and, therefore, are inherently uncertain. we cannot determine with precision the actual amounts that we will pay for contract benefits, the timing of payments, or whether the assets supporting our stated reserves will increase to the levels we estimate before payment of benefits or claims. we monitor our reserve levels continually. if we were to conclude that our reserves are insufficient to cover actual or expected contract benefits, we would be required to increase our reserves and incur income statement charges for the period in which we make the determination, which would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. for more information on how we set our reserves, see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k.
morbidity rates, mortality rates or the severity or frequency of other insurance claims that differ significantly from our pricing expectations could negatively affect profitability.
we have historically set, and continue to set, prices for riversource life disability insurance (and historically ltc insurance) as well as some annuity products based upon expected claim payment patterns, derived from assumptions we make about our policyholders and contractholders, including morbidity and mortality rates. the long-term profitability of these products depends upon how our actual experience compares with our pricing assumptions. for example, if morbidity rates are higher, or mortality rates are lower, than our pricing assumptions, we could be required to make greater payments under disability income insurance policies, chronic care riders and immediate annuity contracts than we had projected. the same holds true for ltc policies we previously underwrote to the extent of the risks that we retained. if mortality rates are higher than our pricing assumptions, we could be required to make greater payments under our life insurance policies and annuity contracts with guaranteed minimum death benefits than we have projected.
the risk that our claims experience may differ significantly from our pricing assumptions is particularly significant for our ltc insurance products notwithstanding our ability to implement future price increases with regulatory approvals. as with life insurance, ltc insurance policies provide for long-duration coverage and, therefore, our actual claims experience will emerge over many years. however, as a relatively new product in the market, ltc insurance does not have the extensive claims experience history of life insurance and, as a result, our ability to forecast future claim rates for ltc insurance is more limited than for life insurance. we have sought to moderate these uncertainties to some extent by partially reinsuring ltc policies at the time the policies were underwritten and limiting our present stand-alone ltc insurance offerings to policies underwritten fully by unaffiliated third-party insurers, and we have also implemented rate increases on certain in force policies. certain estimates and assumptions used in setting our ltc reserves (which is an inherently uncertain and complex process) are described in item 1 of this annual report on form 10-k - "business - our segments - corporate & other - closed block long term care insurance." we may be required to implement additional rate increases in the future and may or may not receive regulatory approval for the full extent and timing of any rate increases that we may seek.
we may face losses if there are significant deviations from our assumptions regarding the future persistency of our insurance policies and annuity contracts.
the prices and expected future profitability of our life insurance and deferred annuity products are based in part upon assumptions related to persistency, which is the probability that a policy or contract will remain in force from one period to the next. economic and market dislocations may occur, and future consumer persistency behaviors could vary materially from the past. the effect of persistency on profitability varies for different products. for most of our life insurance and deferred annuity products, actual persistency that is lower than our persistency assumptions could have an adverse impact on profitability, especially in the early years of a policy or contract, primarily because we would be required to accelerate the amortization of expenses we deferred in connection with the acquisition of the policy or contract.
for our ltc insurance and universal life insurance policies with secondary guarantees, as well as variable annuities with guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefits, actual persistency that is higher than our persistency assumptions could have a negative impact on profitability. if these policies remain in force longer than we assumed, we could be required to make greater benefit payments than we had anticipated when we priced or partially reinsured these products. some of our ltc insurance policies have experienced higher persistency and poorer morbidity experience than we had assumed, which led us to increase premium rates on certain policies.
because our assumptions regarding persistency experience are inherently uncertain, reserves for future policy benefits and claims may prove to be inadequate if actual persistency experience is different from those assumptions. although some of our products permit us to increase premiums during the life of the policy or contract, we cannot guarantee that these increases would be sufficient to maintain profitability. additionally, some of these pricing changes require regulatory approval, which may not be forthcoming. moreover, many of our products do not permit us to increase premiums or limit those increases during the life of the policy or contract, while premiums on certain other products (primarily ltc insurance) may not be increased without prior regulatory approval. significant deviations in experience from pricing expectations regarding persistency could have an adverse effect on the profitability of our products.
dac represents the portion of costs which are incremental and direct to the acquisition of new or renewal business, principally direct sales commissions and other distribution and underwriting costs that have been deferred on the sale of annuity, life and disability income insurance and, to a lesser extent, distribution expenses for certain mutual fund products. for annuity and universal life products, dac are amortized based on projections of estimated gross profits over amortization periods equal to the approximate life of the business. for other insurance products, dac are generally amortized as a percentage of premiums over amortization periods equal to the premium-paying period. for certain mutual fund products, we generally amortize dac over fixed periods on a straight-line basis, adjusted for redemptions.
our projections underlying the amortization of dac for insurance and annuity products require the use of certain assumptions, including interest margins, mortality rates, persistency rates, maintenance expense levels and customer asset value growth rates for variable products. we periodically review and, where appropriate, adjust our assumptions. when we change our assumptions, we may be required to accelerate the amortization of dac or to record a charge to increase benefit reserves.
for more information regarding dac, see part ii, item 7 of this annual report on form 10-k under the heading "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - critical accounting estimates - deferred acquisition costs."
misconduct by our employees and advisors is difficult to detect and deter and could harm our business, results of operations or financial condition.
misconduct or errors by our employees and advisors could result in violations of law, regulatory sanctions and/or serious reputational or financial harm. misconduct or errors can occur in each of our businesses and could include: (i) binding us to transactions that exceed authorized limits; (ii) hiding unauthorized or unsuccessful activities resulting in unknown and unmanaged risks or losses; (iii) improperly or inadvertently using, disclosing or otherwise compromising confidential information, including client confidential information; (iv) recommending transactions that are not suitable; (v) engaging in fraudulent or otherwise improper activity, including the misappropriation of funds; (vi) engaging in unauthorized or excessive trading to the detriment of customers; or (vii) otherwise not complying with laws, regulations or our control procedures.
we cannot always deter misconduct by our employees and advisors, and the precautions we take to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective in all cases. preventing and detecting misconduct among our franchisee advisors who are not employees of our company presents additional challenges. we also cannot assure you that misconduct by our employees and advisors will not lead to a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.
our reputation is one of our most important assets. our ability to attract and retain customers, investors, employees and advisors is highly dependent upon external perceptions of our company. damage to our reputation could cause significant harm to our business and prospects. reputational damage may arise from numerous sources including litigation or regulatory actions, failing to deliver minimum standards of service and quality, compliance failures, any perceived or actual weakness in our financial strength or liquidity, technological, cybersecurity, or other security breaches (including attempted or inadvertent breaches) resulting in improper disclosure of client or employee personal information, unethical or improper behavior and the misconduct or error of our employees, advisors and counterparties. negative perceptions or publicity regarding these matters could damage our reputation among existing and potential customers, investors, employees and advisors. reputations may take decades to build, and any negative incidents can quickly erode trust and confidence, particularly if they result in adverse mainstream and social media publicity, governmental investigations or litigation. adverse developments with respect to our industry may also, by association, negatively impact our reputation or result in greater regulatory or legislative scrutiny or litigation against us.
our reputation is also dependent on our continued identification of and mitigation against conflicts of interest. as we have expanded the scope of our businesses and our client base, we increasingly have to identify and address potential conflicts of interest, including those relating to our proprietary activities and those relating to our sales of non-proprietary products from manufacturers that have agreed to provide us marketing, sales and account maintenance support. for example, conflicts may arise between our position as a provider of financial planning services and as a manufacturer and/or distributor or broker of asset accumulation, income or insurance products that one of our advisors may recommend to a financial planning client. we have procedures and controls that are designed to identify, address and appropriately disclose perceived conflicts of interest. however, identifying and appropriately addressing conflicts of interest is complex, and our reputation could be damaged if we fail, or appear to fail, to address conflicts of interest appropriately.
in addition, the sec and other federal and state regulators have increased their scrutiny of potential conflicts of interest. it is possible that potential or perceived conflicts could give rise to litigation or enforcement actions. also, it is possible that the regulatory scrutiny of, and litigation in connection with, conflicts of interest will make our clients less willing to enter into transactions in which such a conflict may occur, which would adversely affect our businesses.
our operational systems and networks have been, and will continue to be, subject to evolving cybersecurity or other technological risks, which could result in the disclosure of confidential client or employee information, loss of our proprietary information, damage to our reputation, additional costs to us, regulatory penalties and other adverse impacts. the same is true for systems, networks and operations that franchise advisors control locally.
our business is reliant upon internal and third-party technology systems and networks to process, transmit and store information, including sensitive client and proprietary information, and to conduct many of our business activities and transactions with our clients, advisors, vendors and other third parties. maintaining the security and integrity of this information and these systems and networks, and appropriately responding to any cybersecurity and privacy incidents (including attempts), is critical to the success of our business operations, including our reputation, the retention of our advisors and clients, and to the protection of our proprietary information and our clients' personal information. to date, we have not experienced any material breaches of or interference with our centrally controlled systems and networks, however, we routinely face and address such threats. for example, in past years we and other financial institutions experienced distributed denial of service attacks intended to disrupt the centrally controlled systems that provide clients with access to online systems and information. while we have been able to detect and respond to these incidents to date without loss of client assets or information, we enhanced our corporate security capabilities and cybersecurity incident response manual and will continue to assess our ability to monitor for, detect, prevent, mitigate, respond to and recover from such threats. in addition to the foregoing, our (and our advisors') experiences with cybersecurity and technology threats have included phishing and spear phishing scams, social engineering attacks, account takeovers, introductions of malware, attempts at electronic break-ins, and the submission of fraudulent payment requests. the number of attempted phishing attacks increased substantially in 2019, and we do not expect a reduction in the future. any successful breaches or interference (as well as attempted breaches or interference) by third parties or by insiders that may occur in the future could have a material adverse impact on our business, reputation, financial condition or results of operations.
on a corporate basis, we are subject to international, federal and state regulations, and in some cases contractual obligations, that require us to establish and maintain corporate policies and procedures designed to protect sensitive client, employee, contractor and vendor information and respond to cybersecurity incidents. we have implemented policies that require our franchisee advisors who control locally their own technology operations to do the same. we have implemented and maintain security measures designed to protect against breaches of corporate security and other interference with our corporate systems and networks resulting from attacks by third parties, including hackers, and from employee, advisor or service provider error or malfeasance. we also contractually require third-party vendors who, in the provision of services to us, are provided with access to our systems and information pertaining to our business or our clients, to meet certain physical and information security standards. we recommend through policies that franchise advisors do the same with their facilities, systems and third-party vendors. changes in our client base, the mix of assets under management or administration and business model or technology platform changes, such as an evolution to accommodate mobile computing, virtual interface and multi-device functionality, may also require corresponding changes in our systems, networks and data security and response measures. while accessing our products and services, our customers may use computers and other devices that sit outside of our security control. we provide tips for clients regarding safe online practices, but cannot be sure clients will adopt some or all such advice. in addition, the ever-increasing reliance on technology systems and networks and the occurrence and potential adverse impact of attacks on such systems and networks (including in recent well-publicized security breaches at other companies), both generally and in the financial services industry, have enhanced government and regulatory scrutiny of the measures taken by companies to protect against cybersecurity threats. as these threats, and government and regulatory oversight of associated risks, continue to evolve, we may be required to expend additional resources to enhance or expand upon the security and response measures we currently maintain or that we allow franchise advisors to maintain and control locally.
despite the measures we have taken and may in the future take to address and mitigate cybersecurity, privacy and technology risks, we cannot assure you that our systems and networks will not be subject to successful attacks, breaches or interference. nor can we always assure you that franchise advisors will comply with our policies and procedures in this regard, or that clients will engage in safe online practices. any such event may result in operational disruptions (including for example, various delays or mistakes in materials provided to our clients and shareholders in the columbia threadneedle investments funds, as well as impacts to pricing, calculation and trading operations for the columbia threadneedle investments funds and various operations for our other businesses), as well as unauthorized access to or the disclosure or loss of, our proprietary information or client or employee personal information, which in turn may result in legal claims, regulatory scrutiny and liability, reputational damage, the incurrence of costs to eliminate or mitigate further exposure, the loss of clients or advisors or other damage to our business. while we maintain cyber liability insurance that provides both third-party liability and first-party liability coverages, this insurance may not be sufficient to protect us against all cybersecurity-related losses. furthermore, we may be subject to indemnification costs and liability to third parties if we breach any confidentiality obligations regarding vendor data or for losses related to the data. in addition, the trend toward broad consumer and general-public notification of such incidents could exacerbate the harm to our business, reputation, financial condition or results of operations. even if we successfully protect our technology infrastructure and the confidentiality of sensitive data and conduct appropriate incident response, we may incur significant expenses in connection with our responses to any such attacks, as well as the adoption, implementation and maintenance of appropriate security measures. in addition, our regulators may seek to hold our company responsible for the acts or omissions of our franchise advisors even where they procure and control much of the physical office space and technology infrastructure they use to operate their businesses locally. we could also suffer harm to our business and reputation if attempted security breaches are publicized regardless of whether or not harm was actually done to any client or client information or employee or employee information. we cannot be certain that advances in criminal capabilities, discovery of new vulnerabilities, attempts to exploit vulnerabilities in our systems or third-party systems we or our franchise advisors use, data thefts, physical system or network break-ins or inappropriate access, or other developments will not compromise or breach the technology or other security measures protecting the networks and systems used in connection with our business.
protection from system interruptions and operating errors is important to our business. if we experience a sustained interruption to our telecommunications or data processing systems, or other failure in operational execution, it could harm our business.
operating errors and system or network interruptions could delay and disrupt our ability to develop, deliver or maintain our products and services, or to operate compliance or risk management functions, causing harm to our business and reputation and resulting in loss of our advisors, clients or revenue. interruptions could be caused by operational failures arising from service provider, employee or advisor error or malfeasance, interference by third parties, including hackers, our implementation of new technology, as well as from our maintenance of existing technology. our financial, accounting, data processing or other operating systems and facilities may fail to operate or report data properly, experience connectivity disruptions or otherwise become disabled as a result of events that are wholly or partially beyond our control, adversely affecting our ability to process transactions or provide products and services to our clients. these interruptions can include fires, floods, earthquakes and other natural disasters, power losses, equipment failures, attacks by third parties, failures of internal or vendor personnel, software, equipment or systems and other events beyond our control. although we have developed, regularly test and maintain a comprehensive business continuity plan and cybersecurity incident response manual that covers potential disruptions to centrally controlled systems and platforms and require our key technology vendors and service providers to do the same, there are inherent limitations in such plans and they might not, despite testing and monitoring, operate as designed in the event of an actual event or crisis. further, we cannot control the execution of any business continuity or incident response plans implemented by our service providers or our franchise advisors.
we rely on third-party service providers and vendors for certain communications, technology and business functions and other services, and we face the risk of operational failure (including, without limitation, failure caused by an inaccuracy, untimeliness or other deficiency in data reporting), technical or security failures, termination or capacity constraints of any of the clearing agents, exchanges, clearing houses or other third-party service providers that we use to facilitate or are component providers to our securities transactions and other product manufacturing and distribution activities. for example, many of our applications run on a technology infrastructure managed on an outsourced basis by ibm since 2002. under this arrangement, ibm is responsible for most mainframe, mid-range, computing network and storage operations, which includes a portion of our web hosting operations, and we are subject to the risks of any operational failure, termination or other restraints in this arrangement. these risks are heightened by our deployment in response to both investor interest and evolution in the financial markets of increasingly sophisticated products, such as those which incorporate automatic asset re-allocation, long/short trading strategies or multiple portfolios or funds, and business-driven hedging, compliance and other risk management or investment or financial management strategies. any such failure, termination or constraint or flawed response could adversely impact our ability to effect transactions, service our clients, manage our exposure to risk, or otherwise achieve desired outcomes.
risk management policies and procedures may not be fully effective in identifying or mitigating risk exposure in all market environments or against all types of risk, including employee and financial advisor misconduct.
we have devoted significant resources to develop our risk management policies and procedures and will continue to do so. nonetheless, our policies and procedures to identify, monitor and manage risks may not be fully effective in mitigating our risk exposure in all market environments or against all types of risk. many of our methods of managing risk and the associated exposures are based upon our use of observed historical market behavior or statistics based on historical models. during periods of market volatility, or due to unforeseen events, the historically-derived correlations upon which these methods are based may not be valid. as a result, these methods may not predict future exposures accurately, which could be significantly greater than what our models indicate. further some controls are manual and are subject to inherent limitations. this could cause us to incur investment losses or cause our hedging and other risk management strategies to be ineffective. other risk management methods depend upon the evaluation of information regarding markets, clients, catastrophe occurrence or other matters that are publicly available or otherwise accessible to us, which may not always be accurate, complete, up-to-date or properly evaluated.
moreover, we are subject to the risks of errors and misconduct by our employees and advisors, such as fraud, non-compliance with policies, recommending transactions that are not suitable, and improperly using or disclosing confidential information. these risks are difficult to detect in advance and deter, and could harm our business, results of operations or financial condition. we are further subject to the risk of nonperformance or inadequate performance of contractual obligations by third-party vendors of products and services that are used in our businesses. management of operational, legal and regulatory risks requires, among other things, policies and procedures to record properly and verify a large number of transactions and events, and these policies and procedures may not be fully effective in mitigating our risk exposure in all market environments or against all types of risk. insurance and other traditional risk-shifting tools may be held by or available to us in order to manage certain exposures, but they are subject to terms such as deductibles, coinsurance, limits and policy exclusions, as well as risk of counterparty denial of coverage, default or insolvency.
as a holding company, we depend on the ability of our subsidiaries to transfer funds to us to pay dividends and to meet our obligations.
we act as a holding company for our subsidiaries, through which substantially all of our operations are conducted. dividends from our subsidiaries and permitted payments to us under our intercompany arrangements with our subsidiaries are our principal sources of cash to pay shareholder dividends and to meet our other financial obligations. these obligations include our operating expenses and interest and principal on our borrowings. if the cash we receive from our subsidiaries pursuant to dividend payment and intercompany arrangements is insufficient for us to fund any of these obligations, we may be required to raise cash through the incurrence of additional debt, the issuance of additional equity or the sale of assets. if any of this happens, it could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.
insurance, banking and securities laws and regulations regulate the ability of many of our subsidiaries (such as our insurance, banking and brokerage subsidiaries and our face-amount certificate company) to pay dividends or make other permitted payments. further, the frb's 2019 proposal for a new capital framework for islhcs, termed the "building block approach", would create new capital requirements (even if there are any refinements to the proposal) which could potentially impact the way we structure our capital or manage our business. see item 1 of this annual report on form 10-k - "regulation" as well as the information contained in part ii, item 7 under the heading "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - liquidity and capital resources." in addition to the various regulatory restrictions and local law requirements that constrain our subsidiaries' ability to pay dividends or make other permitted payments to our company, the rating organizations impose various capital requirements on our company and our insurance company subsidiaries in order for us to maintain our ratings and the ratings of our insurance subsidiaries. the value of assets on the company-level balance sheets of our subsidiaries is a significant factor in determining these restrictions and capital requirements. as asset values decline, our and our subsidiaries' ability to pay dividends or make other permitted payments can be reduced. additionally, the various asset classes held by our subsidiaries, and used in determining required capital levels, are weighted differently or are restricted as to the proportion in which they may be held depending upon their liquidity, credit risk and other factors. volatility in relative asset values among different asset classes can alter the proportion of our subsidiaries' holdings in those classes, which could increase required capital and constrain our and our subsidiaries' ability to pay dividends or make other permitted payments. the regulatory capital requirements and dividend-paying ability of our subsidiaries may also be affected by a change in the mix of products sold by such subsidiaries. for example, fixed annuities typically require more capital than variable annuities, and an increase in the proportion of fixed annuities sold in relation to variable annuities could increase the regulatory capital requirements of our life insurance subsidiaries. this may reduce the dividends or other permitted payments which could be made from those subsidiaries in the near term without the rating organizations viewing this negatively. further, the capital requirements imposed upon our subsidiaries may be impacted by heightened regulatory scrutiny and intervention, which could negatively affect our and our subsidiaries' ability to pay dividends or make other permitted payments. additionally, in the past we have found it necessary and advisable to provide support to certain of our subsidiaries in order to maintain adequate capital for regulatory or other purposes and we may provide such support in the future. the provision of such support could adversely affect our excess capital, liquidity, and the dividends or other permitted payments received from our subsidiaries.
the operation of our business in foreign markets and our investments in non-u.s. denominated securities and investment products subjects us to exchange rate and other risks in connection with international operations and earnings and income generated overseas.
while we are a u.s.-based company, a significant portion of our business operations occurs outside of the u.s. and some of our investments are not denominated in u.s. dollars. as a result, we are exposed to certain foreign currency exchange risks that could reduce u.s. dollar equivalent earnings as well as negatively impact our general account and other proprietary investment portfolios. appreciation of the u.s. dollar could unfavorably affect net income from foreign operations, the value of non-u.s. dollar denominated investments and investments in foreign subsidiaries. in comparison, depreciation of the u.s. dollar could positively affect our net income from foreign operations and the value of non-u.s. dollar denominated investments, though such depreciation could also diminish investor, creditor and rating organizations' perceptions of our company compared to peer companies that have a relatively greater proportion of foreign operations or investments.
we may seek to mitigate these risks by employing various hedging strategies including entering into derivative contracts. currency fluctuations, including the effect of changes in the value of u.s. dollar denominated investments that vary from the amounts ultimately needed to hedge our exposure to changes in the u.s. dollar equivalent of earnings and equity of these operations, may adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.
in addition, conducting and increasing our international operations subjects us to new risks that, generally, we have not faced in the u.s., including: (i) unexpected changes in foreign regulatory requirements; (ii) difficulties in managing and staffing international operations; (iii) potentially adverse tax consequences, including the complexities of foreign value added tax systems and restrictions on the repatriation of earning; (iii) the localization of our solutions and related costs; (iv) the burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws and different legal standards, including laws and regulations; (v) increased financial accounting and reporting burdens and complexities; and (vi) local, regional and global political, social and economic instability abroad. the occurrence of any one of these risks could negatively affect our international business and, consequently, our results of operations generally. additionally, operating in international markets also requires significant management attention and financial resources. we cannot be certain that the investment and additional resources required in establishing, acquiring or integrating operations in other countries, or adjusting to changes in local or regional political environments (such as may result from brexit) will produce desired levels of revenues or profitability.
as an example, the full impact of brexit and its related consequences remain uncertain, including with respect to ongoing negotiations between the uk and eu and new trade agreements with global trading partners. during this period and beyond, the impact of any partial or complete dissolution of the eu on the uk and european economies and the broader global economy could be significant, resulting in negative impacts on currency and financial markets generally, such as increased volatility and illiquidity, and potentially lower economic growth in markets in the uk, europe and globally, which may adversely affect the value of the columbia threadneedle investments funds' portfolio investments. the uk has one of the largest economies in europe, and member countries of the eu are substantial trading partners of the uk. the uk financial service sector continues to face uncertainty over the uk's final relationship with the eu and globally as a result of brexit. for example, certain financial services operations may have to move outside of the uk following the end of the transition period on december 31, 2020 (e.g., currency trading, international settlement operations). additionally, depending on the final terms agreed with the eu during this transition period, certain financial services businesses may be forced to move staff and comply with two separate sets of rules, or lose business to firms in europe. furthermore, final terms may create the potential for decreased trade, the possibility of capital outflows, devaluation of the pound sterling, the cost of higher corporate bond spreads, and the risk that all the above could negatively impact business and consumer spending as well as foreign direct investment. as a result of brexit, the british economy and its currency may be negatively impacted by changes to the uk's economic and political relations with the eu and other countries. any further exits from the eu, or the possibility of such exits, would likely cause additional market disruption globally and introduce new legal and regulatory uncertainties. the impact of brexit in the near- and long-term is still unknown and could have additional adverse effects on economies, financial markets, currencies and asset valuations around the world.
the occurrence of natural or man-made disasters and catastrophes could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
the occurrence of natural disasters and catastrophes, including earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, tornadoes, fires, blackouts, severe winter weather, explosions, pandemic disease and man-made disasters, including acts of terrorism, insurrections and military actions, could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition. such disasters and catastrophes may damage our facilities, preventing our employees and financial advisors from performing their roles or otherwise disturbing our ordinary business operations and by impacting insurance claims, as described below. these impacts could be particularly severe to the extent they affect our computer-based data processing, transmission, storage and retrieval systems and destroy or release valuable data. such disasters and catastrophes may also impact us indirectly by changing the condition and behaviors of our customers, business counterparties and regulators, as well as by causing declines or volatility in the economic and financial markets.
the potential effects of natural and man-made disasters and catastrophes on certain of our businesses include but are not limited to the following: (i) a catastrophic loss of life may materially increase the amount of or accelerate the timing in which benefits are paid under our insurance policies; (ii) an increase in claims and any resulting increase in claims reserves caused by a disaster may harm the financial condition of our reinsurers, thereby impacting the cost and availability of reinsurance and the probability of default on reinsurance recoveries; and (iii) declines and volatility in the financial markets may decrease the value of our assets under management and administration, which could harm our financial condition and reduce our management fees.
we cannot predict the impact that changing climate conditions may have on the frequency and severity of natural disasters or on overall economic stability and sustainability. as such, we cannot be sure that our actions to identify and mitigate the risks associated with such disasters and catastrophes, including predictive modeling, establishing liabilities for expected claims, acquiring insurance and reinsurance and developing business continuity plans, will be effective.
we are, and in the future may be, subject to legal and regulatory actions in the ordinary course of our operations, both domestically and internationally. actions brought against us may result in awards, settlements, penalties, injunctions or other adverse results, including reputational damage. in addition, we may incur significant expenses in connection with our defense against such actions regardless of their outcome. various regulatory and governmental bodies have the authority to review our products and business practices and those of our employees and independent financial advisors and to bring regulatory or other legal actions against us if, in their view, our practices, or those of our employees or advisors, are improper. pending legal and regulatory actions include proceedings relating to aspects of our businesses and operations that are specific to us and proceedings that are typical of the industries and businesses in which we operate. some of these proceedings have been brought on behalf of various alleged classes of complainants. in certain of these matters, the plaintiffs are seeking large and/or indeterminate amounts, including punitive or exemplary damages. see item 3 of this annual report on form 10-k - "legal proceedings." in or as a result of turbulent times, the volume of claims and amount of damages sought in litigation and regulatory proceedings generally increase.
our businesses are regulated heavily, and changes to the laws and regulations applicable to our businesses may have an adverse effect on our operations, reputation and financial condition.
virtually all aspects of our business, including the activities of our parent company and our various subsidiaries, are subject to various federal, state and international laws and regulations. for a discussion of the regulatory framework in which we operate, see "business - regulation." included in part i, item 1 of this annual report on form 10-k. compliance with these applicable laws and regulations is time-consuming and personnel-intensive, and we have invested and will continue to invest substantial resources to ensure compliance by our parent company and our subsidiaries, directors, officers, employees, registered representatives and agents. any enforcement actions, investigations or other proceedings brought against us or our subsidiaries, directors, employees or advisors by our regulators may result in fines, injunctions or other disciplinary actions that could harm our reputation or impact our results of operations. further, any changes to the laws and regulations applicable to our businesses, as well as changes to the interpretation and enforcement of such laws and regulations, may affect our operations and financial condition. such changes may impact our operations and profitability and the practices of our advisors, including with respect to the scope of products and services provided, the manner in which products and services are marketed and sold and the incurrence of additional costs of doing business. ongoing changes to regulation and oversight of the financial industry may produce results, the full impact of which cannot be immediately ascertained. in addition, we expect the worldwide demographic trend of population aging will cause policymakers to continue to focus on the framework of u.s. and non-u.s. retirement systems, which may drive additional changes regarding the manner in which individuals plan for and fund their retirement, the extent of government involvement in retirement savings and funding, the regulation of retirement products and services and the oversight of industry participants. for example, we continue to see enhanced legislative and regulatory interest regarding retirement investing, financial advisors and investment professionals, and we will continue to closely review and monitor any legislative or regulatory proposals and changes. any incremental requirements, costs and risks imposed on us in connection with such current or future legislative or regulatory changes may constrain our ability to market our products and services to potential customers, and could negatively impact our profitability and make it more difficult for us to pursue our growth strategy.
certain examples of legislative and regulatory changes that may impact our businesses are described below. some of the changes could present operational challenges and increase costs. ultimately these complexities and increased costs could have an impact on our ability to offer cost-effective and innovative insurance products to our clients.
in june 2019 the sec adopted a package of rulemakings and interpretations related to the provision of advice by broker-dealers and investment advisers, including regulation best interest and the client relationship summary (form crs), effective june 30, 2020. among other things, regulation best interest requires a broker-dealer to act in the best interest of a retail customer when making a recommendation to that customer of any securities transaction or investment strategy involving securities. the regulation entails heightened standards for broker-dealers, and we anticipate incurring additional costs in order to review and modify our policies and procedures, as well as associated supervisory and compliance controls and the provision of form crs to clients.
furthermore, new york, massachusetts and several other states have either issued their own best interest or fiduciary rules or are considering doing so and those rules may be limited to certain types of products (e.g. insurance and annuities, financial planning, etc.) or may broadly cover all recommendations made by financial advisors. the department of labor ("dol") has included on its regulatory agenda fiduciary rulemaking regarding investment advice to clients who hold assets in iras and certain employer-sponsored retirement plan accounts. the certified financial planner board has updated its professional standards of conduct to include a fiduciary standard that applies to financial advisors who hold a certified financial planner designation. currently, ameriprise has approximately 4,100 financial advisors that hold a certified financial planner designation. considering the various fiduciary rules and regulations that have been proposed or finalized, we continue to exert significant efforts to evaluate and prepare to comply with each rule.
depending on the span and substance of any regulations and the timing of their applicability, the scope of any implementation could impact the way we compensate our advisors, particularly with respect to the sale of commission-based products, the access that representatives of affiliated and unaffiliated product manufacturers could have to our advisors and clients, and the manner and degree to which we and our advisors could have selling and marketing costs reimbursed by product manufacturers. we have incurred infrastructure costs in anticipation of compliance with these new regulations, and ongoing costs will be driven by how these regulations may evolve over the course of time. depending on the final regulations, we could be subject to both increased litigation risk and the possibility of overlapping or competing requirements from other regulators. our solutions may be different than some or all of our competitors which may lead us to having a competitive advantage or disadvantage as compared to our peers. how our advisors, prospective advisor recruits, distribution partners, competitors and the broader financial industry adapt to any final regulation, or how clients, prospective clients and regulators react to industry and business changes driven thereof, will evolve over the course of time.
mifid ii came into effect in january 2018 and is the most significant regulatory change eu investment firms have recently faced. mifid ii strengthened the requirement for investment firms to act in the client's best interest, in many areas including conflicts of interest (specifically, inducements and a prohibition on free research), strengthening of best execution requirements and increased costs and charges disclosure, in relation to all services provided to clients. in response to mifid ii, columbia threadneedle investments has implemented wide ranging changes to systems, policies and operating procedures across its business. implementation of our internal measures will have direct and indirect impacts on us and certain of our affiliates, including significant changes to client servicing models, distribution models, the fees we are able to charge to clients and the way that our affiliates execute investment decisions for client portfolios. mifid ii and similar regimes may result in existing flows of business moving to less profitable channels or even to competitors providing substitutable products outside the regime. the interpretation and implementation of the inducements rules has also resulted in major changes to how fund managers finance investment research with many firms opting to pay for third-party investment research for u.s. and non-u.s. client accounts regardless of whether such accounts were covered by mifid ii. there is no assurance we will continue to have access to the third-party broker-dealers, banks, investment advisers and other financial intermediaries that currently distribute our products, or continue to have the opportunity to offer all or some of our existing products through them. any inability to access and successfully sell our products to clients through third-party distribution channels could have a negative effect on our level of aum and overall business and financial condition.
effective may 2018, the eu's gdpr strengthened data protection rules for individuals within the eu. gdpr also addresses export of personal data outside the eu. compliance with the stringent rules under gdpr will require ongoing reviews of all of our global data processing systems, processes and procedures. a failure to comply with gdpr could result in fines up to 20 million euros or 4% of annual global revenues, whichever is higher. domestically, state-level laws and regulations continue to evolve creating a patchwork of rules to be examined and followed. most recently, california passed its california consumer privacy act of 2018, which became effective on january 1, 2020. other states may follow suit and promulgate their own privacy legislation.
after the conversion of ameriprise national trust bank into a federal savings bank in may 2019, ameriprise financial became subject to ongoing supervision by the frb, including supervision and prudential standards, requirements related to rbc, stress-testing, resolution planning, and certain risk management requirements. further, as a financial holding company, our activities are limited to those that are financial in nature, incidental to a financial activity or, with frb approval, complementary to a financial activity. in order to maintain ameriprise's status as a financial holding company, ameriprise bank, as ameriprise's sole insured depository institution subsidiary, is required to remain "well-capitalized" and "well-managed" under applicable regulations, and must have received at least a "satisfactory" rating in its most recent examination under the community reinvestment act ("cra"). in addition, ameriprise needs to remain "well-capitalized" and "well-managed" in order to maintain its status as a financial holding company. as a financial holding company, we depend on dividends, distributions and other payments from our subsidiaries in order to meet our obligations, including our debt service obligations. our subsidiaries are subject to laws and regulations that restrict dividend payments or authorize regulatory bodies to prevent or reduce the flow of funds from those subsidiaries to ameriprise. our broker-dealers and bank subsidiary are limited in their ability to lend or transact with affiliates and are subject to minimum regulatory capital and other requirements, as well as limitations on their ability to use funds deposited with them in brokerage or bank accounts to fund their businesses. these requirements may hinder our ability to access funds from our subsidiaries. we may also become subject to a prohibition or limitations on our ability to pay dividends or repurchase our common stock. the federal banking regulators, including the occ, the frb and the fdic, as well as the sec (through finra) have the authority and under certain circumstances, the obligation, to limit or prohibit dividend payments and stock repurchases by the banking organizations they supervise, including ameriprise and its bank subsidiaries.
failure to meet one or more of these requirements would mean, depending on the requirements not met, that ameriprise could not undertake new activities, continue certain activities, or make acquisitions other than those permitted generally for bank holding companies. compliance with bank holding company laws and regulations could impact the structure and availability of certain of our products and services and our costs in providing those products and services. costs of compliance may be driven by how these laws and regulations and the scale of ameriprise bank evolves over the course of time.
any mandated reductions or restructuring of the fees we charge for our products and services resulting from regulatory initiatives or proceedings could reduce our revenues and/or earnings. fees paid by mutual funds in accordance with plans and agreements of distribution adopted under rule 12b-1 promulgated under the investment company act and by other sources of managed products are commonly found as a means for product manufacturers and distribution platforms to address the costs of these products and investor education. the sec has in the past and could again propose measures that would establish a new framework to materially alter rule 12b-1. certain industry-wide reduction or restructuring of rule 12b-1 fees, or other servicing fees, could impact our ability to distribute our own mutual funds and/or the fees we receive for distributing other companies' mutual funds to our commission-based brokerage customers, which could, in turn, impact our revenues and/or earnings.
our insurance companies are subject to state regulation and must comply with statutory reserve and capital requirements. state regulators, as well as the naic, continually review and update these requirements and other requirements relating to the business operations of insurance companies, including their underwriting and sales practices and their use of affiliated captive insurers. changes in these requirements that are made for the benefit of the consumer sometimes lead to additional expense for the insurer and, thus, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. in december 2012, the naic adopted a new reserve valuation manual that applies principles-based reserve standards to life insurance products. the valuation manual has been adopted by the required number of states and the percentage of u.s. insurance premium threshold has been reached, therefore, the valuation manual was effective for companies domiciled in adopted states on january 1, 2017. minnesota adopted the valuation manual in 2016 and new york adopted the valuation manual in december 2018 to be effective january 2020. the riversource life companies have developed an implementation plan and riversource life reported principles-based reserves for a universal life product issued in 2019. the requirement for principles-based life insurance reserves may result in statutory reserves being more sensitive to changes in interest rates, policyholder behavior and other market factors. it is not possible at this time to estimate the potential impact of future changes in statutory reserve and capital requirements on our insurance businesses. further, we cannot predict the effect that proposed federal legislation may have on our businesses or competitors, such as the option of federally chartered insurers, a mandated federal systemic risk regulator, future initiatives of the fio within the department of the treasury or by any of the domiciliary regulators, the naic or the international association of insurance supervisors with respect to insurance holding company supervision, capital standards or systemic risk regulation. for additional discussion on the role and activities of the fio, see the information provided under the heading "regulation - insurance regulation" included in part i, item 1 of this annual report on form 10-k. as discussed earlier, the frb's 2019 proposal for a new capital framework for islhcs, would create new capital requirements (even if there are any refinements to the proposal) which could potentially impact the way we structure our capital or manage our business.
changes in the supervision and regulation of the financial industry, both domestically and internationally, could materially impact our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
the dodd-frank act, enacted into law in 2010 called for sweeping changes in the supervision and regulation of the financial services industry designed to provide for greater oversight of financial industry participants, reduce risk in banking practices and in securities and derivatives trading, enhance public company corporate governance practices and executive compensation disclosures, and provide greater protections to individual consumers and investors.
accordingly, while certain elements of these reforms could be further changed under the trump administration (such as through the may 2018 legislation that loosened aspects of the dodd-frank act), the dodd-frank act has impacted and is expected to further impact the manner in which we market our products and services, manage our company and its operations and interact with regulators, all of which could materially impact our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. certain provisions of the dodd-frank act that may impact our business include but are not limited to the establishment of a fiduciary standard for broker-dealers, the resolution authority granted to the fdic, changes in regulatory oversight and greater oversight over derivatives instruments and trading. after a conformance period, we will be required to comply with the volcker rule. the impact of this compliance, as well as recent changes to the volcker rule, may be operationally difficult to implement and thus may negatively impact our business. any changes to regulations or changes to the supervisory approach may also result in increased compliance costs to the extent we are required to modify our existing compliance policies, procedures and practices. we will need to respond to changes to the framework for the supervision of u.s. financial institutions, including the actions of the fsoc. to the extent the dodd-frank act or other new regulation of the financial services industry impacts the operations, financial condition, liquidity and capital requirements of unaffiliated financial institutions with whom we transact business, those institutions may seek to pass on increased costs, reduce their capacity to transact, or otherwise present inefficiencies in their interactions with us.
it is uncertain whether the dodd-frank act, the rules and regulations developed thereunder, or any future legislation designed to stabilize the financial markets, the economy generally, or provide better protections to consumers, will have the intended effect. any new domestic or international legislation or regulatory changes could require us to change certain business practices, impose additional costs, or otherwise adversely affect our business operations, regulatory reporting relationships, results of operations or financial condition. consequences may include substantially higher compliance costs as well as material effects on fee rates, interest rates and foreign exchange rates, which could materially impact our investments, results of operations and liquidity in ways that we cannot predict. in addition, prolonged government support for, and intervention in the management of, private institutions could distort customary and expected commercial behavior on the part of those institutions, adversely impacting us.
in recent years, other national and international authorities have also proposed measures intended to increase the intensity of regulation of financial institutions, requiring greater coordination among regulators and efforts to harmonize regulatory regimes. these measures have included enhanced rbc requirements, leverage limits, liquidity and transparency requirements, single counterparty exposure limits, governance requirements for risk management, stress-test requirements, debt-to-equity limits for certain companies, early remediation procedures, resolution and recovery planning and guidance for maintaining appropriate risk culture. our international operations and our worldwide consolidated operations are subject to the jurisdiction of certain of these non-u.s. authorities and may be materially adversely affected by their actions and decisions. potential measures taken by foreign and international authorities also include the nationalization or expropriation of assets, the imposition of limits on foreign ownership of local companies, changes in laws (including tax laws and regulations) and in their application or interpretation, imposition of large fines, political instability, dividend limitations, price controls, changes in applicable currency, currency exchange controls, or other restrictions that prevent us from transferring funds from these operations out of the countries in which they operate or converting local currencies we hold to u.s. dollars or other currencies. any of these changes or actions may negatively affect our business. a further result of our non-u.s. operations is that we are subject to regulation by non-u.s. regulators and u.s. regulators such as the department of justice and the sec with respect to the foreign corrupt practices act of 1977. we expect the scope and extent of regulation outside the u.s., as well as general regulatory oversight, to continue to increase.
a portion of our advisor force are independent contractors. legislative or regulatory action that redefines the criteria for determining whether a person is an employee or an independent contractor could materially impact our relationships with our advisors and our business, resulting in an adverse effect on our results of operations.
we are subject to the income tax laws of the u.s., its states and municipalities and those of the foreign jurisdictions in which we have significant business operations. these tax laws are complex and may be subject to different interpretations. we must make judgments and interpretations about the application of these inherently complex tax laws when determining the provision for income taxes and must also make estimates about when in the future certain items affect taxable income in the various tax jurisdictions. disputes over interpretations of the tax laws may be settled with the taxing authority upon examination or audit. in addition, changes to the internal revenue code, administrative rulings or court decisions could increase our provision for income taxes and reduce our earnings.
many of the products we issue or on which our businesses are based (including both insurance products and non-insurance products) receive favorable treatment under current u.s. federal income or estate tax law. changes in u.s. federal income or estate tax law could reduce or eliminate the tax advantages of certain of our products and thus make such products less attractive to clients or cause a change in client demand and activity.
we rely on a combination of contractual rights and copyright, trademark, patent and trade secret laws to establish and protect our intellectual property. although we use a broad range of measures to protect our intellectual property rights, third parties may infringe or misappropriate our intellectual property. we may have to litigate to enforce and protect our copyrights, trademarks, patents, trade secrets and know-how or to determine their scope, validity or enforceability, which represents a diversion of resources that may be significant in amount and may not prove successful. the loss of intellectual property protection or the inability to secure or enforce the protection of our intellectual property assets could have a material adverse effect on our business and our ability to compete.
we also may be subject to costly litigation in the event that another party alleges our operations or activities infringe upon or constitute misappropriation of such other party's intellectual property rights. third parties may have, or may eventually be issued, patents or other protections that could be infringed by our products, methods, processes or services or could otherwise limit our ability to offer certain product features. any party that holds such a patent could make a claim of infringement against us. we may also be subject to claims by third parties for breach of copyright, trademark, license usage rights, or misappropriation of trade secret rights. any such claims and any resulting litigation could result in significant liability for damages. if we were found to have infringed or misappropriated a third-party patent or other intellectual property rights, we could incur substantial liability, and in some circumstances could be enjoined from providing certain products or services to our customers or utilizing and benefiting from certain methods, processes, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets or licenses, or alternatively could be required to enter into costly licensing arrangements with third parties, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
changes in and the adoption of accounting standards or inaccurate estimates or assumptions in applying accounting policies could have a material impact on our financial statements; changes in the regulation of independent registered public accounting firms are present with increasing frequency in connection with broader market reforms.
our accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. some of these policies require use of estimates and assumptions that may affect the reported value of our assets or liabilities and results of operations and are critical because they require management to make difficult, subjective, and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain. if those assumptions, estimates or judgments were incorrectly made, we could be required to correct and restate prior period financial statements.
we prepare our financial statements in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles. the financial accounting standards board, the sec and other regulators often change the financial accounting and reporting standards governing the preparation of our financial statements. in addition, the conduct of our independent registered public accounting firm is overseen by the public company accounting oversight board ("pcaob"). these and other regulators may make additional inquiries regarding, or change their application of, existing laws and regulations regarding our independent auditor, financial statements or other financial reports and the possibility of such additional inquiries or changes is increasing in frequency in connection with broader market reforms. these changes are difficult to predict, and could impose additional governance, internal control and disclosure demands. in some cases, we could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively, resulting in our restating prior period financial statements. it is possible that the changes could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
the market price of our common stock may fluctuate widely, depending upon many factors, some of which may be beyond our control, including: (i) changes in expectations concerning our future financial performance and the future performance of the financial services industry in general, including financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts; (ii) differences between our actual financial and operating results and those expected by investors and analysts; (iii) our strategic moves and those of our competitors, such as acquisitions, divestitures or restructurings; (iv) changes in the regulatory framework of the financial services industry and regulatory action; (v) changes in and the adoption of accounting standards and securities and insurance rating agency processes and standards applicable to our businesses and the financial services industry; and (vi) changes in general economic or market conditions.
stock markets in general have experienced volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of a particular company. these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.
provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and of delaware law may prevent or delay an acquisition of our company, which could decrease the market value of our common stock.
our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and delaware law contain provisions intended to deter coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids by making them unacceptably expensive to the raider and to encourage prospective acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors rather than to attempt a hostile takeover. these provisions include, among others: (i) elimination of the right of our shareholders to act by written consent; (ii) rules regarding how shareholders may present proposals or nominate directors for election at shareholder meetings, either directly or through proxies; (iii) the right of our board of directors to issue preferred stock without shareholder approval; and (iv) limitations on the rights of shareholders to remove directors.
we believe these provisions protect our shareholders from coercive or otherwise unfair takeover tactics by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors and by providing our board of directors time to assess any acquisition proposal. they are not intended to make our company immune from takeovers. however, these provisions apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some shareholders and could delay or prevent an acquisition that our board of directors determines is not in the best interests of our company and our shareholders.
the issuance of additional shares of our common stock or other equity securities may result in a dilution of interest or adversely affect the price of our common stock.
our certificate of incorporation allows our directors to authorize the issuance of additional shares of our common stock, as well as other forms of equity or securities that may be converted into equity securities, without shareholder approval. we have in the past and may in the future issue additional equity or convertible securities in order to raise capital, in connection with acquisitions or for other purposes. any such issuance may result in a significant dilution in the interests of our current shareholders and adversely impact the market price of our common stock.
item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the "forward-looking statements," our consolidated financial statements and notes that follow and the "consolidated five-year summary of selected financial data" and the "risk factors" included in our annual report on form 10-k. references to "ameriprise financial," "ameriprise," the "company," "we," "us," and "our" refer to ameriprise financial, inc. exclusively, to our entire family of companies, or to one or more of our subsidiaries.
overview ameriprise is a diversified financial services company with a 125-year history of providing financial solutions. we are a long-standing leader in financial planning and advice with $973 billion in assets under management and administration as of december 31, 2019. we offer a broad range of products and services designed to achieve individual and institutional clients' financial objectives. for additional discussion of our businesses, see part i, item 1 of this annual report on form 10-k.
the products and services we provide retail clients and, to a lesser extent, institutional clients, are the primary source of our revenues and net income. revenues and net income are significantly affected by investment performance and the total value and composition of assets we manage and administer for our retail and institutional clients as well as the distribution fees we receive from other companies. these factors, in turn, are largely determined by overall investment market performance and the depth and breadth of our individual client relationships.
financial markets and macroeconomic conditions have had and will continue to have a significant impact on our operating and performance results. in addition, the business, political and regulatory environments in which we operate are subject to elevated uncertainty and substantial, frequent change. accordingly, we expect to continue focusing on our key strategic objectives and obtaining operational and strategic leverage from our core capabilities. the success of these and other strategies may be affected by the factors discussed in item 1a of this annual report on form 10-k - "risk factors" - and other factors as discussed herein.
equity price, credit market and interest rate fluctuations can have a significant impact on our results of operations, primarily due to the effects they have on the asset management and other asset-based fees we earn, the "spread" income generated on our fixed deferred annuities, fixed insurance, deposit products and the fixed portion of variable annuities and variable insurance contracts, the value of deferred acquisition costs ("dac") and deferred sales inducement costs ("dsic") assets, the values of liabilities for guaranteed benefits associated with our variable annuities and the values of derivatives held to hedge these benefits.
earnings, as well as adjusted operating earnings, will be negatively impacted by the ongoing low interest rate environment should it continue. in addition to continuing spread compression in our interest sensitive product lines, a sustained low interest rate environment may result in increases to our reserves and changes in various rate assumptions we use to amortize dac and dsic, which may negatively impact our adjusted operating earnings. for additional discussion on our interest rate risk, see item 7a. "quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk."
in the third quarter, we update our market-related assumptions and implement model changes related to our living benefit valuation. in addition, we conduct our annual review of life insurance and annuity valuation assumptions relative to current experience and management expectations including modeling changes. these aforementioned changes are collectively referred to as unlocking. we also review our active life future policy benefit reserve adequacy for our long term care ("ltc") business in the third quarter. see our consolidated and segment results of operations sections for the pretax impacts on our revenues and expenses attributable to unlocking and ltc loss recognition.
on october 1, 2019, we completed the sale of our ameriprise auto & home insurance business ("aah") to american family insurance mutual holding company (american family insurance). see note 19 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on the sale of aah. this sale is consistent with our focus on our core growth areas of advice & wealth management and asset management.
in 2018, we made the strategic decision to expand the banking products and services we can provide directly to our clients, and commenced the process to convert ameriprise national trust bank into a federal savings bank with the capabilities to offer fdic insured deposits and a range of lending products. we completed that process, received regulatory approvals and converted ameriprise national trust bank to a federal savings bank in may 2019.
we consolidate certain variable interest entities for which we provide asset management services. these entities are defined as consolidated investment entities ("cies"). while the consolidation of the cies impacts our balance sheet and income statement, our exposure to these entities is unchanged and there is no impact to the underlying business results. for further information on cies, see note 5 to our consolidated financial statements. the results of operations of the cies are reflected in the corporate & other segment. on a consolidated basis, the management fees we earn for the services we provide to the cies and the related general and administrative expenses are eliminated and the changes in the fair value of assets and liabilities related to the cies, primarily syndicated loans and debt, are reflected in net investment income. we include the fees from these entities in the management and financial advice fees line within our asset management segment.
while our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles ("gaap"), management believes that adjusted operating measures, which exclude net realized investment gains or losses, net of the related dsic and dac amortization, unearned revenue amortization and the reinsurance accrual; the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed benefits, net of hedges and the related dsic and dac amortization; the market impact on indexed universal life ("iul") benefits, net of hedges and the related dac amortization, unearned revenue amortization and the reinsurance accrual; the market impact on fixed index annuity benefits, net of hedges and the related dac amortization; mean reversion related impacts; the market impact of hedges to offset interest rate changes on unrealized gains or losses for certain investments; gain or loss on disposal of a business that is not considered discontinued operations; integration and restructuring charges; income (loss) from discontinued operations; and the impact of consolidating cies, best reflect the underlying performance of our core operations and facilitate a more meaningful trend analysis. management uses these non-gaap measures to evaluate our financial performance on a basis comparable to that used by some securities analysts and investors. also, certain of these non-gaap measures are taken into consideration, to varying degrees, for purposes of business planning and analysis and for certain compensation-related matters. throughout our management's discussion and analysis, these non-gaap measures are referred to as adjusted operating measures. these non-gaap measures should not be viewed as a substitute for u.s. gaap measures. effective first quarter of 2019, management has excluded mean reversion related impacts from our adjusted operating measures. prior periods have been updated to reflect this change to be consistent with the current period presentation. the mean reversion related impact is defined as the impact on variable annuity and variable universal life ("vul") products for the difference between assumed and updated separate account investment performance on dac, dsic, unearned revenue amortization, reinsurance accrual and additional insurance benefit reserves. the updated separate account investment performance includes actual investment performance in the current period and the impact of changes in financial market conditions on the assumptions for future investment performance.
it is management's priority to increase shareholder value over a multi-year horizon by achieving our on-average, over-time financial targets.

(2)   adjusted operating return on equity, excluding aoci is calculated using adjusted operating earnings in the numerator and ameriprise financial shareholders' equity, excluding aoci and the impact of consolidating investment entities using a five-point average of quarter-end equity in the denominator. after-tax is calculated using the statutory rate of 21%.
critical accounting estimates the accounting and reporting policies that we use affect our consolidated financial statements. certain of our accounting and reporting policies are critical to an understanding of our consolidated results of operations and financial condition and, in some cases, the application of these policies can be significantly affected by the estimates, judgments and assumptions made by management during the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. the accounting and reporting policies and estimates we have identified as fundamental to a full understanding of our consolidated results of operations and financial condition are described below. see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for further information about our accounting policies.
valuation of investments the most significant component of our investments is our available-for-sale securities, which we carry at fair value within our consolidated balance sheets. see note 15 to our consolidated financial statements for discussion of the fair value of our available-for-sale securities. financial markets are subject to significant movements in valuation and liquidity, which can impact our ability to liquidate and the selling price that can be realized for our securities and increases the use of judgment in determining the estimated fair value of certain investments.
deferred acquisition costs see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for discussion of our dac accounting policy.
non-traditional long-duration products for our non-traditional long-duration products (including variable and fixed deferred annuity contracts, universal life ("ul") and vul insurance products), our dac balance at any reporting date is based on projections that show management expects there to be estimated gross profits ("egps") after that date to amortize the remaining balance. these projections are inherently uncertain because they require management to make assumptions about financial markets, mortality levels and contractholder and policyholder behavior over periods extending well into the future. projection periods used for our annuity products are typically 30 to 50 years and for our ul insurance products 50 years or longer.
egps vary based on persistency rates (assumptions at which contractholders and policyholders are expected to surrender, make withdrawals from and make deposits to their contracts), mortality levels, client asset value growth rates (based on equity and bond market performance), variable annuity benefit utilization and interest margins (the spread between earned rates on invested assets and rates credited to contractholder and policyholder accounts). changes in these assumptions can be offsetting and we are unable to predict their movement or offsetting impact over time. when assumptions are changed, the percentage of egps used to amortize dac might also change. a change in the required amortization percentage is applied retrospectively; an increase in amortization percentage will result in a decrease in the dac balance and an increase in dac amortization expense, while a decrease in amortization percentage will result in an increase in the dac balance and a decrease in dac amortization expense. the effect on the dac balance that would result from the realization of unrealized gains (losses) on securities is recognized with an offset to accumulated other comprehensive income on the consolidated balance sheet.
the client asset value growth rates are the rates at which variable annuity and vul insurance contract values invested in separate accounts are assumed to appreciate in the future. the rates used vary by equity and fixed income investments. the long-term client asset value growth rates are based on assumed gross annual returns of 9% for equity funds and 6.9% for fixed income funds. we typically use a five-year mean reversion process as a guideline in setting near-term equity fund growth rates based on a long-term view of financial market performance as well as recent actual performance. the suggested near-term equity fund growth rate is reviewed quarterly to ensure consistency with management's assessment of anticipated equity market performance.
a decrease of 100 basis points in separate account fund growth rate assumptions is likely to result in an increase in dac amortization and an increase in benefits and claims expense for variable annuity and vul insurance contracts. the following table presents the estimated impact to current period pretax income:
dac amortization                                                                                                   benefits and claims expense         total
decrease in future near-term equity fund growth returns by 100 basis points                   $(26          )               $(52              )              $(78        )
decrease in future long-term equity fund growth returns by 100 basis points                   (18           )               (36               )              (54         )
decrease in future near- and long-term equity fund growth returns by 100 basis points         $(44          )               $(88              )              $(132       )
an assessment of sensitivity associated with changes in any single assumption would not necessarily be an indicator of future results.
traditional long-duration products for our traditional long-duration products (including traditional life and disability income ("di") insurance products), our dac balance at any reporting date is based on projections that show management expects there to be adequate premiums after the date to amortize the remaining balance. these projections are inherently uncertain because they require management to make assumptions over periods extending well into the future. these assumptions include interest rates, persistency rates and mortality and morbidity rates and are not modified (unlocked) unless recoverability testing determines that reserves are inadequate. projection periods used for our traditional life insurance are up to 30 years. projection periods for our di products are up to 45 years. we may experience accelerated amortization of dac if policies terminate earlier than projected or a slower rate of amortization of dac if policies persist longer than projected.
for traditional life and di insurance products, the assumptions provide for adverse deviations in experience and are revised only if management concludes experience will be so adverse that dac are not recoverable. if management concludes that dac are not recoverable, dac are reduced to the amount that is recoverable based on best estimate assumptions.
future policy benefits and claims we establish reserves to cover the risks associated with non-traditional and traditional long-duration products. non-traditional long-duration products include variable annuity contracts, fixed annuity contracts and ul and vul policies. traditional long-duration products include term life, whole life, di and ltc insurance products.
guarantees accounted for as insurance liabilities include gmdb, ggu, gmib and the life contingent benefits associated with gmwb. in addition, ul and vul policies with product features that result in profits followed by losses are accounted for as insurance liabilities.
guarantees accounted for as embedded derivatives include gmab and the non-life contingent benefits associated with gmwb. in addition, the portion of indexed annuities and iul policies allocated to the indexed account is accounted for as an embedded derivative.
the establishment of reserves is an estimation process using a variety of methods, assumptions and data elements. if actual experience is better than or equal to the results of the estimation process, then reserves should be adequate to provide for future benefits and expenses. if actual experience is worse than the results of the estimation process, additional reserves may be required.
non-traditional long-duration products, including embedded derivatives ul and vul a portion of our ul and vul policies have product features that result in profits followed by losses from the insurance component of the contract. these profits followed by losses can be generated by the cost structure of the product or secondary guarantees in the contract. the secondary guarantee ensures that, subject to specified conditions, the policy will not terminate and will continue to provide a death benefit even if there is insufficient policy value to cover the monthly deductions and charges. the liability for these future losses is determined using actuarial models to estimate the death benefits in excess of account value and the expected assessments (e.g. cost of insurance charges, contractual administrative charges, similar fees and investment margin). significant assumptions made in projecting future benefits and assessments relate to client asset value growth rates, mortality, persistency and investment margins and are consistent with those used for dac valuation for the same contracts. see note 12 to our consolidated financial statements for information regarding the liability for contracts with secondary guarantees.
variable annuities we have approximately $80 billion of variable annuity account value that has been issued over a period of more than fifty years. the diversified variable annuity block consists of $29 billion of account value with no living benefit guarantees and $51 billion of account value with living benefit guarantees, primarily guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit ("gmwb") provisions. the business is predominately issued through the ameriprise financial® advisor network. the majority of the variable annuity contracts offered by us contain gmdb provisions. we also offer variable annuities with death benefit provisions that gross up the amount payable by a certain percentage of contract earnings which are referred to as gain gross-up ("ggu") benefits. in addition, we offer contracts with gmwb and guaranteed minimum accumulation benefit ("gmab") provisions and, until may 2007, we offered contracts containing guaranteed minimum income benefit ("gmib") provisions. see note 12 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our variable annuity contracts.
in determining the liabilities for gmdb, ggu, gmib and the life contingent benefits associated with gmwb, we project these benefits and contract assessments using actuarial models to simulate various equity market scenarios. significant assumptions made in projecting future benefits and assessments relate to customer asset value growth rates, mortality, persistency, benefit utilization and investment margins and are consistent with those used for dac valuation for the same contracts. as with dac, management reviews, and where appropriate, adjusts its assumptions each quarter. unless management identifies a material deviation over the course of quarterly monitoring, management reviews and updates these assumptions annually in the third quarter of each year.
regarding the exposure to variable annuity living benefit guarantees, the source of behavioral risk is driven by changes in policyholder surrenders and utilization of guaranteed withdrawal benefits. we have extensive experience studies and analysis to monitor changes and trends in policyholder behavior. a significant volume of company-specific policyholder experience data is available and provides management with the ability to regularly analyze policyholder behavior. on a monthly basis, actual surrender and benefit utilization experience is compared to expectations. experience data includes detailed policy information providing the opportunity to review impacts of multiple variables. the ability to analyze differences in experience, such as presence of a living benefit rider, existence of surrender charges, and tax qualifications provide us an effective approach in quickly detecting changes in policyholder behavior.
at least annually, we perform a thorough policyholder behavior analysis to validate the assumptions included in our benefit reserve, embedded derivative and dac balances. the variable annuity assumptions and resulting reserve computations reflect multiple policyholder variables. differentiation in assumptions by policyholder age, existence of surrender charges, guaranteed withdrawal utilization, and tax qualification are examples of factors recognized in establishing management's assumptions used in reserve calculations. the extensive data derived from our variable annuity block informs management in confirming previous assumptions and revising the variable annuity behavior assumptions. changes in assumptions are governed by a review and approval process to ensure an appropriate measurement of all impacted financial statement balances.
see the table in the previous discussion of "deferred acquisition costs" for the estimated impact to benefits and claims expense related to variable annuity and vul insurance contracts resulting from a decrease of 100 basis points in separate account fund growth rate assumptions.
embedded derivatives the fair value of embedded derivatives related to gmab and the non-life contingent benefits associated with gmwb provisions fluctuate based on equity, interest rate and credit markets which can cause these embedded derivatives to be either an asset or a liability. the fair value of embedded derivatives related to indexed annuities and iul fluctuate based on equity markets and interest rates and is a liability. in addition, embedded derivatives are impacted by an estimate of our nonperformance risk adjustment. this estimate includes a spread over the libor swap curve as of the balance sheet date. as our estimate of this spread over libor widens or tightens, the liability will decrease or increase.
additionally, our corporate actuarial department calculates the fair value of the embedded derivatives on a monthly basis. during this process, control checks are performed to validate the completeness of the data. actuarial management approves various components of the valuation along with the final results. the change in the fair value of the embedded derivatives is reviewed monthly with senior management.
traditional long-duration products liabilities for unpaid amounts on reported di and ltc claims include any periodic or other benefit amounts due and accrued, along with estimates of the present value of obligations for continuing benefit payments. these unpaid amounts are calculated using anticipated claim continuance rates based on established industry tables, adjusted as appropriate for our experience. the discount rates used to calculate present values are based on average interest rates earned on assets supporting the liability for unpaid amounts.
liabilities for estimates of benefits that will become payable on future claims on term life, whole life and di policies are based on the net level premium and ltc policies are based on a gross premium valuation reflecting management's current best estimate assumptions. net level premium includes anticipated premium payments, mortality and morbidity rates, policy persistency and interest rates earned on assets supporting the liability. gross premium valuation includes expected premium rate increases, benefit reductions, morbidity rates, policy persistency and interest rates earned on assets supporting the liability. anticipated mortality and morbidity rates are based on established industry mortality and morbidity tables, with modifications based on our experience. anticipated premium payments and persistency rates vary by policy form, issue age, policy duration and certain other pricing factors.
derivative instruments and hedging activities we use derivative instruments to manage our exposure to various market risks. all derivatives are recorded at fair value. the fair value of our derivative instruments is determined using either market quotes or valuation models that are based upon the net present value of estimated future cash flows and incorporate current market observable inputs to the extent available.
for further details on the types of derivatives we use and how we account for them, see note 2, note 15 and note 17 to our consolidated financial statements. for discussion of our market risk exposures and hedging program and related sensitivity testing, see item 7a. "quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk."
recent accounting pronouncements for information regarding recent accounting pronouncements and their expected impact on our future consolidated results of operations and financial condition, see note 3 to our consolidated financial statements.
sources of revenues and expenses management and financial advice fees management and financial advice fees relate primarily to fees earned from managing mutual funds, private funds, separate account and wrap account assets and institutional investments, as well as fees earned from providing financial advice, administrative services (including transfer agent and administration fees earned from providing services to retail mutual funds) and other custodial services. management and financial advice fees include performance-based incentive management fees, which we may receive on certain management contracts. management and financial advice fees also include mortality and expense risk fees.
distribution fees distribution fees primarily include point-of-sale fees (such as mutual fund front-end sales loads) and asset-based fees (such as 12b-1 distribution and shareholder service fees). distribution fees also include amounts received under marketing support arrangements for sales of mutual funds and other companies' products, such as through our wrap accounts, as well as surrender charges on annuities and ul and vul insurance.
net investment income net investment income primarily includes interest income on fixed maturity securities classified as available-for-sale, mortgage loans, policy loans, margin loans, other investments, cash and cash equivalents and investments of consolidated investment entities ("cies"); the changes in fair value of trading securities, certain derivatives and certain assets and liabilities of cies; the pro rata share of net income or loss on equity method investments; and realized gains and losses on the sale of investments and charges for other-than-temporary impairments of investments related to credit losses.
premiums premiums include premiums on auto and home insurance, traditional life, di and ltc insurance and immediate annuities with a life contingent feature and are net of reinsurance premiums. we sold aah on october 1, 2019.
other revenues other revenues primarily include variable annuity guaranteed benefit rider charges and ul and vul insurance charges, which consist of cost of insurance charges (net of reinsurance premiums and cost of reinsurance for ul insurance products) and administrative charges.
for discussion of our accounting policies on revenue recognition, see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements.
banking and deposit interest expense banking and deposit interest expense primarily includes interest expense related to investment certificates and banking deposits. the changes in fair value of stock market certificate embedded derivatives and the derivatives hedging stock market certificates are included within banking and deposit interest expense.
distribution expenses distribution expenses primarily include compensation paid to our financial advisors, registered representatives, third-party distributors and wholesalers. the portion of these costs which are incremental and direct to the acquisition of a new or renewal insurance policy or annuity contract issued by the riversource life companies are deferred. the amounts capitalized and amortized are based on actual distribution costs. the majority of these costs, such as advisor and wholesaler compensation, vary directly with the level of sales. distribution expenses also include marketing support and other distribution and administration related payments made to affiliated and unaffiliated distributors of products provided by our affiliates. the majority of these expenses vary with the level of sales, or assets held, by these distributors, and the remainder is fixed. distribution expenses also include wholesaling costs.
interest credited to fixed accounts interest credited to fixed accounts represents amounts earned by contractholders and policyholders on fixed account values associated with ul and vul insurance and annuity contracts. the changes in fair value of indexed annuity and iul embedded derivatives and the derivatives hedging these products are also included within interest credited to fixed accounts.
benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses consist of amounts paid and changes in liabilities held for anticipated future benefit payments under insurance policies and annuity contracts, along with costs to process and pay such amounts. amounts are net of benefit payments recovered or expected to be recovered under reinsurance contracts. benefits under variable annuity guarantees include the changes in fair value of gmwb and gmab embedded derivatives and the derivatives hedging these benefits, as well as the changes in fair value of derivatives hedging gmdb provisions. benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses also include amortization of dsic.
amortization of dac direct sales commissions and other costs capitalized as dac are amortized over time. for annuity and ul/vul contracts, dac are amortized based on projections of egps over amortization periods equal to the approximate life of the business. for other insurance products, dac are generally amortized as a percentage of premiums over amortization periods equal to the premium-paying period.
interest and debt expense interest and debt expense primarily includes interest on corporate debt and cie debt, the impact of interest rate hedging activities and amortization of debt issuance costs.
general and administrative expense general and administrative expense includes compensation, share-based awards and other benefits for employees (other than employees directly related to distribution, such as financial advisors), professional and consultant fees, information technology, facilities and equipment, advertising and promotion, legal and regulatory and corporate related expenses.
assets under management and administration assets under management ("aum") include external client assets for which we provide investment management services, such as the assets of the columbia threadneedle investments funds, institutional clients and clients in our advisor platform held in wrap accounts as well as assets managed by sub-advisors selected by us. aum also includes certain assets on our consolidated balance sheets for which we provide investment management services and recognize management fees in our asset management segment, such as the assets of the general account and the variable product funds held in the separate accounts of our life insurance subsidiaries and cies. these assets do not include assets under advisement, for which we provide advisory services such as model portfolios but do not have full discretionary investment authority.
assets under administration ("aua") include assets for which we provide administrative services such as client assets invested in other companies' products that we offer outside of our wrap accounts. these assets include those held in clients' brokerage accounts. we generally record revenues received from administered assets as distribution fees. we do not exercise management discretion over these assets and do not earn a management fee. these assets are not reported on our consolidated balance sheets. aua also includes certain assets on our consolidated balance sheets for which we do not provide investment management services and do not recognize management fees, such as investments in non-affiliated funds held in the separate accounts of our life insurance subsidiaries. these assets do not include assets under advisement, for which we provide advisory services such as model portfolios but do not have full discretionary investment authority.
total aum increased $123.9 billion, or 19%, to $778.1 billion as of december 31, 2019 compared to $654.2 billion as of december 31, 2018 due to a $65.3 billion increase in advice & wealth management aum driven by market appreciation and wrap account net inflows and a $63.5 billion increase in asset management aum driven by market appreciation, partially offset by net outflows and retail fund distributions. see our segment results of operations discussion for additional information on changes in our aum.

•   the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed benefits (net of hedges and the related dsic and dac amortization) was an expense of $579 million for the year ended december 31, 2019 compared to an expense of $31 million for the prior year.
•   the market impact of hedges on investments was an expense of $35 million for the year ended december 31, 2019 compared to a benefit of $11 million for the prior year.
•   higher mark-to-market impact on advisor deferred compensation expense and investments in recruiting experienced advisors.
•   a positive impact from higher average equity markets and higher average short-term interest rates.
•   the mean reversion related impact was a benefit of $57 million for the year ended december 31, 2019 compared to an expense of $33 million for the prior year.
•   the unfavorable impact of unlocking and ltc loss recognition was $16 million for the year ended december 31, 2019 compared to $53 million for the prior year.
the following table presents the total pretax impacts on our revenues and expenses attributable to unlocking and ltc loss recognition for the years ended december 31:
benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses:

(1) includes a $4 million and $5 million net benefit related to the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed benefits for the years ended december 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, which is excluded from adjusted operating earnings. refer to results of operations by segment for the impact to pretax adjusted operating earnings attributable to unlocking and ltc loss recognition.
the unfavorable unlocking impact in 2019 primarily reflected the impact from updates to our interest rate assumptions and lower surrenders on annuity contracts with a withdrawal benefit partially offset by a benefit from changes in equity market volatility and correlation assumptions on variable annuities. the unfavorable unlocking impact in the prior year primarily reflected unfavorable mortality experience on universal life ("ul") and vul insurance products and lower surrender rate assumptions on variable annuities partially offset by the impact from updates to assumptions on utilization of guaranteed withdrawal benefits.
the unfavorable ltc unlocking and loss recognition in 2019 was primarily due to the impact from updates to our interest rates assumptions and changes in morbidity experience partially offset by higher approved and expected premium rate increases and benefit reductions. the unfavorable ltc unlocking and loss recognition in the prior year was primarily due to changes in morbidity experience partially offset by approved, pending and future expected premium rate increases.
the unfavorable impact of updates to our interest rate assumptions noted above for unlocking and ltc loss recognition was $118 million. based on the significant recent interest rate dislocation, we extended the grading period one year to reach our ultimate 10-year treasury rate of 5% by assuming rates remain flat for six months and then grade to our long-term rate over the next three years.
management and financial advice fees increased $239 million, or 4%, to $7.0 billion for the year ended december 31, 2019 compared to $6.8 billion for the prior year primarily due to higher average equity markets, wrap account net inflows and a $57 million increase in performance fees, partially offset by asset management net outflows and a $27 million negative foreign currency translation impact.
distribution fees increased $42 million, or 2%, to $1.9 billion for the year ended december 31, 2019 compared to the prior year reflecting higher average equity markets and higher earnings on brokerage cash due to an increase in average short-term interest rates, partially offset by asset management net outflows.
•   the unfavorable impact of fixed annuity net outflows and the fixed annuities reinsurance transaction.
other revenues increased $30 million, or 2%, to $1.3 billion for the year ended december 31, 2019 compared to $1.2 billion for the prior year primarily due to accretion on our fixed annuities reinsurance deposit receivable, an increase in variable annuity guaranteed benefit rider charges, a $7 million gain on the sale of real estate in the third quarter of 2019 and a $7 million expense in the prior year related to a modification of costs within a reinsurance contract, partially offset by the impact of unlocking. other revenues for 2019 included a $5 million favorable impact from unlocking compared to a $78 million favorable impact in the prior year. the unlocking impact for 2019 reflected updates to our interest rate assumptions. the primary driver of the unlocking impact for the prior year was higher projected gains on reinsurance contracts resulting from unfavorable mortality experience on ul and vul insurance products.
gain on disposal of business of $213 million for the year ended december 31, 2019 was recognized on the sale of aah, net of an affinity partner payment of $100 million.
banking and deposit interest expense increased $47 million, or 53%, to $136 million for the year ended december 31, 2019 compared to $89 million for the prior year due to interest expense on banking deposits, higher average certificate balances and higher average crediting rates on certificates.
distribution expenses increased $173 million, or 5%, to $3.8 billion for the year ended december 31, 2019 compared to $3.6 billion for the prior year reflecting higher advisor compensation due to wrap account net inflows, higher average markets, higher mark-to-market impact on advisor deferred compensation expense and investments in recruiting experienced advisors, partially offset by the impact of asset management net outflows.
benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses increased $274 million, or 12%, to $2.6 billion for the year ended december 31, 2019 compared to $2.3 billion for the prior year primarily reflecting the following items:
•   a $425 million increase in expense from the unhedged nonperformance credit spread risk adjustment on variable annuity guaranteed benefits. the unfavorable impact of the nonperformance credit spread was $175 million for the year ended december 31, 2019 compared to a favorable impact of $250 million for the prior year. as the estimate of the nonperformance credit spread over the libor swap curve tightens or widens, the embedded derivative liability will increase or decrease. as the embedded derivative liability on which the nonperformance credit spread is applied increases (decreases), the impact of the nonperformance credit spread is favorable (unfavorable) to expense.
•   a $228 million increase in expense from other market impacts on variable annuity guaranteed benefits, net of hedges in place to offset those risks and the related dsic amortization. this increase was the result of a favorable $315 million change in the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed living benefits reserves, an unfavorable $549 million change in the market impact on derivatives hedging the variable annuity guaranteed benefits and a favorable $6 million change in the dsic offset. the main market drivers contributing to these changes are summarized below:
•   equity market impact on the variable annuity guaranteed living benefits liability net of the impact on the corresponding hedge assets resulted in a higher expense for the year ended december 31, 2019 compared to the prior year.
•   interest rate impact on the variable annuity guaranteed living benefits liability net of the impact on the corresponding hedge assets resulted in a higher expense for the year ended december 31, 2019 compared to the prior year.
•   volatility impact on the variable annuity guaranteed living benefits liability net of the impact on the corresponding hedge assets resulted in a higher expense for the year ended december 31, 2019 compared to the prior year.
•   other unhedged items, including the difference between the assumed and actual underlying separate account investment performance, fixed income credit exposures, transaction costs and various contractholder behavioral items, were a net favorable impact compared to the prior year.
•   the impact of unlocking excluding ltc was a benefit of $1 million for the year ended december 31, 2019 compared to an expense of $112 million for the prior year. the unlocking impact for 2019 primarily reflected a benefit from changes in equity market volatility and correlation assumptions on variable annuities, partially offset by updates to our interest rate assumptions and lower surrenders on annuity contracts with a withdrawal benefit. the unlocking impact for the prior year primarily reflected unfavorable mortality experience on ul and vul insurance products and lower surrender rate assumptions on variable annuities, partially offset by a favorable impact from updates to assumptions on utilization of guaranteed withdrawal benefits.
•   our annual review of ltc active life future policy benefit reserve adequacy in 2019 resulted in unlocking and loss recognition of $8 million compared to $52 million in the prior year. the unlocking and loss recognition in 2019 was primarily due to the impact from updates to our interest rates assumptions and changes in morbidity experience, partially offset by higher approved and expected premium rate increases and benefit reductions. the unlocking and loss recognition in the prior year was primarily due to changes in morbidity experience, partially offset by approved, pending and future expected premium rate increases.
•   the mean reversion related impact was a benefit of $26 million for the year ended december 31, 2019 compared to an expense of $12 million for the prior year.
amortization of dac decreased $143 million, or 44%, to $179 million for the year ended december 31, 2019 compared to $322 million for the prior year primarily reflecting the following items:
•   the dac offset to the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed benefits was a benefit of $82 million for the year ended december 31, 2019 compared to an expense of $23 million for the prior year.
•   the mean reversion related impact was a benefit of $31 million for the year ended december 31, 2019 compared to an expense of $21 million for the prior year.
•   a favorable impact from normal year over year experience differences for variable annuities.
•   the impact of unlocking in 2019 was an expense of $14 million and reflected updates to our interest rate assumptions, partially offset by a favorable impact from lower surrenders on annuity contracts with a withdrawal benefit. the impact of unlocking in the prior year was a benefit of $33 million and primarily reflected updated mortality assumptions on ul and vul insurance products and lower surrender rate assumptions on variable annuities, partially offset by an unfavorable impact from updates to assumptions on utilization of guaranteed withdrawal benefits.
general and administrative expense increased $116 million, or 4%, to $3.3 billion for the year ended december 31, 2019 compared to $3.2 billion for the prior year primarily due to a $49 million unfavorable change in the mark-to-market impact on share-based compensation expenses, a $28 million increase in compensation related to higher performance fees, bank-related expenses, investments in business growth and a $13 million increase in severance, partially offset by a $15 million positive foreign currency translation impact and a $25 million decrease in auto and home expenses primarily reflecting the sale of aah.
income taxes our effective tax rate was 15.2% for the year ended december 31, 2019 compared to 15.5% for the prior year. net excess tax benefits related to employee share-based payments was a benefit of $15 million for the year ended december 31, 2019 compared to $25 million for the prior year. see note 24 to our consolidated financial statements for additional discussion on income taxes.
adjusted operating earnings is the measure of segment profit or loss management uses to evaluate segment performance. adjusted operating earnings should not be viewed as a substitute for gaap pretax income. we believe the presentation of segment adjusted operating earnings as we measure it for management purposes enhances the understanding of our business by reflecting the underlying performance of our core operations and facilitating a more meaningful trend analysis. see note 28 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on the presentation of segment results and our definition of adjusted operating earnings.

our advice & wealth management segment pretax adjusted operating earnings, which exclude net realized investment gains or losses, increased $120 million, or 9%, to $1.5 billion for the year ended december 31, 2019 compared to $1.4 billion for the prior year reflecting wrap account net inflows, average equity market appreciation and higher earnings on brokerage cash, partially offset by higher expenses from continued investments for growth and higher mark-to-market impact on advisor deferred compensation expenses. pretax adjusted operating margin was 22.9% for the year ended december 31, 2019 compared to 22.4% for the prior year.
we launched ameriprise bank, fsb in the second quarter of 2019 and continued to add deposits during the year, with $3.8 billion of cash sweep balances as of december 31, 2019. in the third quarter of 2019, we purchased the existing ameriprise portfolio of credit card accounts from a third party bank.
distribution fees increased $40 million, or 2%, to $2.3 billion for the year ended december 31, 2019 compared to $2.2 billion for the prior year reflecting higher earnings on brokerage cash due to an increase in average short-term interest rates, partially offset by decreased transactional activity and lower sales of variable annuities. we earned 198 basis points on brokerage cash balances for the year ended december 31, 2019 compared to 164 basis points for the prior year.
banking and deposit interest expense increased $47 million, or 53%, to $136 million for the year ended december 31, 2019 compared to $89 million for the prior year due to interest expense on banking deposits, higher average certificate balances and higher average crediting rates on certificates.
distribution expenses increased $193 million, or 5%, to $3.7 billion for the year ended december 31, 2019 compared to $3.5 billion for the prior year reflecting higher advisor compensation due to wrap account net inflows and market appreciation, higher mark-to-market impact on advisor deferred compensation expense and investments in recruiting experienced advisors, partially offset by decreased transactional activity.

(commonly known as "brexit") and its related consequences remain uncertain, including with respect to ongoing negotiations between the uk and eu and new trade agreements with global trading partners. this uncertainty may have a negative impact on our uk and european net flows (as well as foreign currency translation if the british pound weakens).
total segment aum increased $63.5 billion, or 15%, during the year ended december 31, 2019 driven by market appreciation, partially offset by net outflows and retail fund distributions. europe, middle east and africa ("emea") retail net outflows were $3.1 billion for the year ended december 31, 2019 reflecting negative consumer sentiment associated with brexit and geopolitical concerns in europe. north america retail net inflows, which include reinvested dividends, were $3.2 billion for the year ended december 31, 2019, a $5.8 billion improvement compared to the prior year. global institutional net outflows of $7.2 billion included $3.4 billion of outflows from former parent-related assets.

our asset management segment pretax adjusted operating earnings, which exclude net realized investment gains or losses, decreased $67 million, or 9%, to $661 million for the year ended december 31, 2019 compared to $728 million for the prior year primarily due to the cumulative impact of net outflows and a vendor credit of $14 million in the prior year, partially offset by higher average markets and a $29 million increase in net performance fees.
management and financial advice fees decreased $52 million, or 2%, to $2.5 billion for the year ended december 31, 2019 compared to the prior year driven by cumulative net outflows and a $27 million negative foreign currency translation impact, partially offset by a $57 million increase in performance fees and higher average markets. our average weighted equity index, which is a proxy for equity movements on aum, increased 4% for the year ended december 31, 2019 compared to the prior year.
other revenues decreased $17 million, or 89%, to $2 million for the year ended december 31, 2019 compared to $19 million for the prior year due to a $14 million vendor credit in the prior year related to the completion of our front, middle and back-office integration.

our annuities segment pretax adjusted operating income, which excludes net realized investment gains or losses (net of the related dsic and dac amortization), the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed benefits (net of hedges and the related dsic and dac amortization), the market impact on fixed index annuity benefits (net of hedges and the related dac amortization) and mean reversion related impacts, was essentially flat at $497 million for the year ended december 31, 2019 compared to $496 million for the prior year.
riversource® variable annuity account balances increased 11% to $80.1 billion as of december 31, 2019 compared to the prior year due to equity market appreciation, partially offset by net outflows of $3.2 billion. variable annuity sales decreased 8% compared to the prior year.
riversource® fixed deferred annuity account balances declined 5% to $8.3 billion as of december 31, 2019 compared to the prior year as older policies continue to lapse and new sales are limited due to low interest rates. given the current interest rate environment, our current fixed deferred annuity book is expected to gradually run off and earnings on our fixed deferred annuity business will trend down. we reinsured approximately 20% of our fixed annuities block during the first quarter of 2019. the reinsurance transaction generated $200 million of excess capital and has a marginal impact on fixed annuity adjusted pretax operating earnings.
net investment income, which excludes net realized investment gains or losses, decreased $90 million, or 14%, to $554 million for the year ended december 31, 2019 compared to $644 million for the prior year due to a $47 million unfavorable impact related to the fixed annuities reinsurance transaction, approximately $30 million from lower average invested assets due to fixed annuity net outflows and approximately $13 million from lower earned interest rates.
other revenues increased $76 million, or 13%, to $661 million for the year ended december 31, 2019 compared to $585 million for the prior year primarily due to accretion on our fixed annuities reinsurance deposit receivable and higher fees from variable annuity guarantee sales in the prior year where the fees start on the first anniversary date and higher average fee rates.
expenses total expenses, which exclude the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed benefits (net of hedges and the related dsic and dac amortization), the market impact on fixed index annuity benefits (net of hedges and the related dac amortization), mean reversion related impacts and the dac and dsic offset to net realized investment gains or losses, decreased $18 million, or 1%, to $2.0 billion for the year ended december 31, 2019 compared to the prior year.
interest credited to fixed accounts decreased $16 million, or 3%, to $445 million for the year ended december 31, 2019 compared to $461 million for the prior year due to lower average fixed deferred annuity account balances.
benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses, which exclude the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed benefits (net of hedges and the related dsic amortization), mean reversion related impacts and the dsic offset to net realized investment gains or losses, were essentially flat at $664 million for the year ended december 31, 2019 compared to $665 million for the prior year primarily reflecting the impact of unlocking, partially offset by higher reserve funding driven by the impact of higher variable annuity guaranteed benefit rider charges.
amortization of dac, which excludes mean reversion related impacts, the dac offset to the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed benefits and fixed index annuity benefits and the dac offset to net realized investment gains or losses, increased $9 million, or 5%, to $190 million for the year ended december 31, 2019 compared to $181 million for the prior year primarily due to the impact of unlocking, partially offset by a favorable impact from normal year over year experience differences for variable annuities.

expenses total expenses, which exclude the market impact on iul benefits (net of hedges and the related dac amortization), mean reversion related impacts and the dac offset to net realized investment gains or losses, decreased $55 million, or 7%, to $786 million for the year ended december 31, 2019 compared to $841 million for the prior year.
interest credited to fixed accounts increased $12 million, or 6%, to $212 million for the year ended december 31, 2019 compared to $200 million for the prior year primarily driven by higher fixed account values associated with ul and vul insurance.
benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses decreased $77 million, or 19%, to $327 million for the year ended december 31, 2019 compared to $404 million for the prior year primarily due to the impact of unlocking. the unlocking impact for 2019 was an expense of $16 million and primarily reflected updates to our interest rate assumptions. the unlocking impact for the prior year was an expense of $101 million and primarily reflected unfavorable mortality experience on ul and vul insurance products.
amortization of dac increased $18 million, or 51%, to $53 million for the year ended december 31, 2019 compared to $35 million for the prior year primarily reflecting the impact of unlocking. the impact of unlocking for 2019 was an expense of $2 million compared to a benefit of $18 million for the prior year.

our ltc insurance pretax adjusted operating earnings were nil for the year ended december 31, 2019 compared to a pretax adjusted operating loss of $61 million for the prior year. our annual review of ltc active life future policy benefit reserve adequacy resulted in unlocking and loss recognition of $8 million for the year ended december 31, 2019 compared to $52 million in the prior year.
as of december 31, 2019, our nursing home indemnity ltc block had approximately $83 million in gross in force annual premium and future policyholder benefits and claim reserves of approximately $1.3 billion, net of reinsurance, which was 55% of gaap reserves. this block has been shrinking over the last few years given the average attained age is 82 and the average attained age of policyholders on claim is 88. fifty-five percent of daily benefits in force in this block come from policies that have a lifetime benefit period.
as of december 31, 2019, our comprehensive reimbursement ltc block had approximately $115 million in gross in force annual premium and future policyholder benefits and claim reserves of approximately $1.1 billion, net of reinsurance. this block has higher premiums per policy than the nursing home indemnity ltc policies. the average attained age is 76 and the average attained age of policyholders on claim is 84. thirty-seven percent of daily benefits in force in this block come from policies that have a lifetime benefit period.
we utilize three primary levers to manage our ltc business. first, we have taken an active approach of steadily increasing rates since 2005, with cumulative rate increases of 162% on our nursing home indemnity ltc block and 93% on our comprehensive reimbursement ltc block as of december 31, 2019. second, we have a reserving process that reflects the policy features and risk characteristics of our blocks. as of december 31, 2018, we had 30,000 policies that were closed with claim activity, as well as 8,000 open claims. we apply this experience to our in force policies, which were 103,000 as of december 31, 2019, at a very granular level by issue year, attained age and benefit features. our statutory reserves are $415 million higher than our gaap reserves and include margins for key assumptions like morbidity and mortality, as well as $233 million in asset adequacy reserves as of december 31, 2019. lastly, we have prudently managed our investment portfolio primarily through a liquid, investment grade portfolio that is currently in a net unrealized gain position.
we undertake an extensive review of active life future policy benefit reserve adequacy annually during the third quarter of each year, or more frequently if appropriate, using current best estimate assumptions as of the date of the review. our annual review process includes an analysis of our key reserve assumptions, including, at this time, those for morbidity, terminations (mortality and lapses), premium rate increases and investment yields. because we have a rigorous annual review of all key reserve assumptions, we believe we are materially less exposed to large one-time reserve adjustments.
distribution expenses decreased $11 million to a benefit of $1 million for the year ended december 31, 2019 compared to an expense of $10 million for the prior year reflecting the sale of aah.
benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses decreased $264 million, or 22%, to $962 million for the year ended december 31, 2019 compared to $1.2 billion for the prior year reflecting a decrease in ltc unlocking and loss recognition and the sale of aah.
interest and debt expense increased $18 million, or 49%, to $55 million for the year ended december 31, 2019 compared to $37 million for the prior year primarily due to interest expense on asset backed securities issued by one of our subsidiaries in the fourth quarter of 2018. this interest expense is eliminated on a consolidated basis.
general and administrative expense increased $41 million, or 13%, to $356 million for the year ended december 31, 2019 compared to $315 million for the prior year primarily due to a $33 million unfavorable change in the mark-to-market impact on share-based compensation expenses, investments in growth initiatives and a $13 million increase in severance, partially offset by a $25 million decrease in auto and home expenses primarily reflecting the sale of aah.

overall pretax income increased $270 million, or 12%, to $2.5 billion for the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to $2.2 billion for the prior year primarily reflecting average equity market appreciation, wrap account net inflows, a positive impact from higher short-term interest rates and a decrease in the unfavorable market impact on variable annuity guaranteed benefits (net of hedges and the related dsic and dac amortization), partially offset by the impact of unlocking, the cumulative impact of asset management net outflows and the impact on dac, dsic and reserves for insurance features in non-traditional long-duration contracts from actual versus expected market performance. the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed benefits (net of hedges and the related dsic and dac amortization) was an expense of $31 million for the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to an expense of $232 million for the prior year.
the impact on dac, dsic and reserves for insurance features in non-traditional long-duration contracts from actual versus expected market performance was an expense of $33 million ($21 million for dac, $5 million for dsic and $7 million for insurance features in non-traditional long duration contracts) for the year ended december 31, 2018 reflecting unfavorable market returns compared to a benefit of $83 million ($36 million for dac, $8 million for dsic and $39 million for insurance features in non-traditional long duration contracts) for the prior year reflecting favorable market returns.

management and financial advice fees increased $361 million, or 6%, to $6.8 billion for the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to $6.4 billion for the prior year primarily due to an increase in aum. average aum increased $35.4 billion, or 5%, compared to the prior year primarily due to average equity market appreciation and wrap account net inflows, partially offset by asset management net outflows. see our discussion on the changes in aum in our segment results of operations section.
distribution fees increased $120 million, or 7%, to $1.9 billion for the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to $1.8 billion for the prior year reflecting average equity market appreciation and higher earnings on brokerage cash due to an increase in short-term interest rates, partially offset by a $30 million decrease related to our transition to share classes without 12b-1 fees in advisory accounts, which we completed during the first quarter of 2017.
other revenues increased $144 million, or 13%, to $1.2 billion for the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to $1.1 billion for the prior year primarily due to the impact of unlocking and an increase in variable annuity guaranteed benefit rider charges, partially offset by a $7 million expense related to a modification of costs within a reinsurance contract.
banking and deposit interest expense increased $41 million, or 85%, to $89 million for the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to $48 million for the prior year due to higher average crediting rates on certificates, as well as higher average certificate balances.
distribution expenses increased $240 million, or 7%, to $3.6 billion for the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to $3.4 billion for the prior year reflecting higher advisor compensation due to average equity market appreciation and wrap account net inflows, partially offset by asset management net outflows and a $16 million decrease from changes related to our transition to share classes without 12b-1 fees in advisory accounts.
benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses increased $69 million, or 3%, to $2.3 billion for the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to $2.2 billion for the prior year primarily reflecting the following items:
•   the impact of unlocking was an expense of $113 million for the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to a benefit of $139 million for the prior year. the unlocking impact for the year ended december 31, 2018 primarily reflected unfavorable mortality experience on ul and vul insurance products and lower surrender rate assumptions on variable annuities, partially offset by a favorable impact from updates to assumptions on utilization of guaranteed withdrawal benefits. the unlocking impact for the prior year primarily reflected a benefit from updates to market-related inputs to our living benefit valuation.
•   our annual review of ltc active life future policy benefit reserve adequacy in the third quarter resulted in loss recognition of $51 million for the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to $57 million in the prior year. the loss recognition in both periods was primarily due to unfavorable morbidity experience, partially offset by approved, pending and future expected premium increases.
•   a $25 million increase in expense related to higher reserve funding driven by the impact of higher variable annuity guaranteed benefit rider charges.
•   the impact on dsic and reserves for insurance features in non-traditional long-duration contracts from actual versus expected market performance was an expense of $12 million for the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to a benefit of $47 million for the prior year.
•   a $356 million decrease in expense from the unhedged nonperformance credit spread risk adjustment on variable annuity guaranteed benefits. the favorable impact of the nonperformance credit spread was $250 million for the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to an unfavorable impact of $106 million for the prior year. as the estimate of the nonperformance credit spread over the libor swap curve tightens or widens, the embedded derivative liability will increase or decrease. as the embedded derivative liability on which the nonperformance credit spread is applied increases (decreases), the impact of the nonperformance credit spread is favorable (unfavorable) to expense.
•   a $106 million increase in expense from other market impacts on variable annuity guaranteed benefits, net of hedges in place to offset those risks and the related dsic amortization. this increase was the result of an unfavorable $1.2 billion change in the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed living benefits reserves, a favorable $1.1 billion change in the market impact on derivatives hedging the variable annuity guaranteed benefits and an unfavorable $4 million change in the dsic offset. the main market drivers contributing to these changes are summarized below:
•   equity market impact on the variable annuity guaranteed living benefits liability net of the impact on the corresponding hedge assets resulted in a higher expense for the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to the prior year.
•   interest rate impact on the variable annuity guaranteed living benefits liability net of the impact on the corresponding hedge assets resulted in a lower expense for the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to the prior year.
•   volatility impact on the variable annuity guaranteed living benefits liability net of the impact on the corresponding hedge assets resulted in a lower expense for the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to the prior year.
•   other unhedged items, including the difference between the assumed and actual underlying separate account investment performance, fixed income credit exposures, transaction costs and various contractholder behavioral items, were a net unfavorable impact compared to the prior year.
amortization of dac increased $55 million, or 21%, to $322 million for the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to $267 million for the prior year primarily reflecting the following items:
•   the impact on dac from actual versus expected market performance was an expense of $21 million for the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to a benefit of $36 million for the prior year.
•   the dac offset to the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed benefits was an expense of $23 million for the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to a benefit of $26 million for the prior year.
•   the impact of unlocking was a benefit of $33 million for the year ended december 31, 2018 and primarily reflected updated mortality assumptions on ul and vul insurance products and lower surrender rate assumptions on variable annuities, partially offset by an unfavorable impact from updates to assumptions on utilization of guaranteed withdrawal benefits. the impact of unlocking for the prior year was a benefit of $12 million and primarily reflected improved persistency and mortality on ul and vul insurance products and a $10 million benefit from a correction related to a variable annuity model assumption, partially offset by updates to market-related inputs to the living benefit valuation.
•   the positive impact on dac from lower than expected lapses on variable annuities was $10 million.
income taxes our effective tax rate was 15.5% for the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to 33.1% for the prior year. the decrease in our effective tax rate for the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to the prior year is primarily the result of the decrease in the federal statutory tax rate and a $286 million expense in 2017 due to provisions in the tax act, partially offset by lower levels of the dividends received deduction and a decrease in the benefit for net excess tax benefits related to employee share-based payments, which was $25 million for the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to $70 million for the prior year.

management and financial fees increased $385 million, or 12%, to $3.5 billion for the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to $3.2 billion for the prior year primarily due to growth in wrap account assets. average advisory wrap account assets increased $33.4 billion, or 15%, compared to the prior year reflecting net inflows and average equity market appreciation.
distribution fees increased $146 million, or 7%, to $2.2 billion for the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to $2.1 billion for the prior year reflecting higher earnings on brokerage cash due to an increase in short-term interest rates and the ipi acquisition, partially offset by a $30 million decrease related to our transition to share classes without 12b-1 fees in advisory accounts in the first quarter of 2017.
banking and deposit interest expense increased $41 million, or 85%, to $89 million for the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to $48 million for the prior year due to higher client crediting rates on certificates, as well as higher average certificate balances.

global retail net outflows of $5.6 billion for the year ended december 31, 2018 included $17.2 billion of net new outflows, partially offset by $11.6 billion of reinvested dividends. in u.s. retail, net new outflows of $14.1 billion reflected elevated outflows in the fourth quarter from market dislocation, industry pressures on active strategies and outflows from former parent-related assets, partially offset by $11.5 billion of reinvested dividends. in emea retail, net outflows of $3.0 billion reflected elevated outflows in the fourth quarter consistent with the industry reflecting weakened market sentiment across all regions related to market volatility and concerns over brexit, the economy and interest rates.
global institutional net outflows of $15.6 billion included $5.2 billion of outflows from former parent-related assets and $2.5 billion of clo redemptions. third party institutional outflows were elevated and reflect lower sales and higher redemptions of equity and fixed income mandates.

fair value measurements we report certain assets and liabilities at fair value; specifically, separate account assets, derivatives, embedded derivatives and most investments and cash equivalents. fair value assumes the exchange of assets or liabilities occurs in orderly transactions and is not the result of a forced liquidation or distressed sale. we include actual market prices, or observable inputs, in our fair value measurements to the extent available. broker quotes are obtained when quotes from pricing services are not available. we validate prices obtained from third parties through a variety of means such as: price variance analysis, subsequent sales testing, stale price review, price comparison across pricing vendors and due diligence reviews of vendors. see note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on our fair value measurements.
fair value of liabilities and nonperformance risk companies are required to measure the fair value of liabilities at the price that would be received to transfer the liability to a market participant (an exit price). since there is not a market for our obligations of our variable annuity riders, indexed annuities and iul insurance, we consider the assumptions participants in a hypothetical market would make to reflect an exit price. as a result, we adjust the valuation of variable annuity riders, indexed annuities and iul insurance by updating certain contractholder assumptions, adding explicit margins to provide for risk, and adjusting the rates used to discount expected cash flows to reflect a market estimate of our nonperformance risk. the nonperformance risk adjustment is based on observable market data adjusted to estimate the risk of our life insurance company subsidiaries not fulfilling these liabilities. consistent with general market conditions, this estimate resulted in a spread over the libor swap curve as of december 31, 2019. as our estimate of this spread widens or tightens, the liability will decrease or increase. if this nonperformance credit spread moves to a zero spread over the libor swap curve, the reduction to future net income would be approximately $341 million, net of dac, dsic, unearned revenue amortization, the reinsurance accrual and income taxes (calculated at the statutory tax rate of 21%), based on december 31, 2019 credit spreads.
liquidity and capital resources overview we maintained substantial liquidity during the year ended december 31, 2019. at december 31, 2019 and 2018, we had $3.7 billion and $2.9 billion, respectively, in cash and cash equivalents excluding cies. we have additional liquidity available through an unsecured revolving credit facility for up to $750 million that expires in october 2022. under the terms of the credit agreement, we can increase this facility to $1.0 billion upon satisfaction of certain approval requirements. available borrowings under this facility are reduced by any outstanding letters of credit. at december 31, 2019, we had no outstanding borrowings under this credit facility and had $1 million of outstanding letters of credit. our credit facility contains various administrative, reporting, legal and financial covenants. we were in compliance with all such covenants at december 31, 2019.
on october 1, 2019, we completed the sale of aah and received gross proceeds of $1.1 billion in cash at closing. after a payment to an affinity partner, the net proceeds were $1.0 billion.
we enter into short-term borrowings, which may include repurchase agreements and federal home loan bank ("fhlb") advances, to reduce reinvestment risk. short-term borrowings allow us to receive cash to reinvest in longer-duration assets, while maintaining the flexibility to pay back the short-term debt with cash flows generated by the fixed income portfolio. the balance of repurchase agreements as of december 31, 2019 and 2018 was nil and $50 million, respectively, which is collateralized with agency residential mortgage backed securities from our investment portfolio. our subsidiaries, riversource life insurance company ("riversource life"), and ameriprise bank, fsb are members of the fhlb of des moines, which provides access to collateralized borrowings. as of december 31, 2019 and 2018, we had borrowings from the fhlb of $201 million and $151 million, respectively, which is collateralized with commercial mortgage backed securities. we believe cash flows from operating activities, available cash balances and our availability of revolver borrowings will be sufficient to fund our operating liquidity needs.
dividends from subsidiaries ameriprise financial is primarily a parent holding company for the operations carried out by our wholly owned subsidiaries. because of our holding company structure, our ability to meet our cash requirements, including the payment of dividends on our common stock, substantially depends upon the receipt of dividends or return of capital from our subsidiaries, particularly our life insurance subsidiary, riversource life, our face-amount certificate subsidiary, ameriprise certificate company ("acc"), ampf holding corporation, which is the parent company of our retail introducing broker-dealer subsidiary, ameriprise financial services, llc ("afs") (previously ameriprise financial services, inc. until january 2020) and our clearing broker-dealer subsidiary, american enterprise investment services, inc. ("aeis"), our transfer agent subsidiary, columbia management investment services corp. ("cmis"), our investment advisory company, columbia management investment advisers, llc ("cmia"), and ameriprise international holdings gmbh, which is the parent company of threadneedle asset management holdings sàrl. the payment of dividends by many of our subsidiaries is restricted and certain of our subsidiaries are subject to regulatory capital requirements.
actual capital and regulatory capital requirements for our wholly owned subsidiaries subject to regulatory capital requirements were as follows:

(1) actual capital is determined on a statutory basis.
(2) regulatory capital requirement is the company action level and is based on the statutory risk-based capital filing.
(3) regulatory capital requirement is based on the applicable regulatory requirement, calculated as of december 31, 2019 and 2018.
(4) actual capital is determined on an adjusted gaap basis.
(5) acc is required to hold capital in compliance with the minnesota department of commerce and sec capital requirements.

(7) regulatory capital requirement is based on minimum requirements for well capitalized banks in accordance with the office of the comptroller of the currency ("occ").
in addition to the particular regulations restricting dividend payments and establishing subsidiary capitalization requirements, we take into account the overall health of the business, capital levels and risk management considerations in determining a strategy for payments to our parent holding company from our subsidiaries, and in deciding to use cash to make capital contributions to our subsidiaries.
during the year ended december 31, 2019, the parent holding company received cash dividends or a return of capital from its subsidiaries of $2.7 billion and contributed cash to its subsidiaries of $368 million. during the year ended december 31, 2018, the parent holding company received cash dividends or a return of capital from its subsidiaries of $2.7 billion and contributed cash to its subsidiaries of $73 million.
the table below presents the historical subsidiary capacity for dividends and other distributions to the parent holding company in each of the years ended december 31:
total capacity                              $3,600              $2,976              $2,354
(1) for riversource life payments in excess of statutory unassigned funds require advance notice to the minnesota department of commerce, riversource life's primary regulator, and are subject to potential disapproval. in addition, dividends and other distributions whose fair market value, together with that of other dividends or distributions made within the preceding 12 months, exceeds the greater of (1) the previous year's statutory net gain from operations or (2) 10% of the previous year-end statutory capital and surplus are referred to as "extraordinary dividends." extraordinary dividends also require advance notice to the minnesota department of commerce, and are subject to potential disapproval. for dividends exceeding these thresholds, riversource life provided notice to the minnesota department of commerce and received responses indicating that it did not object to the payment of these dividends. total dividend capacity for riversource life represents dividends paid during year ended december 31 along with any unpaid ordinary dividend capacity, subject to unassigned funds limitation.
(2) the dividend capacity for acc is based on capital held in excess of regulatory requirements.
the following table presents cash dividends paid or return of capital to the parent holding company, net of cash capital contributions made by the parent holding company for the following subsidiaries for the years ended december 31:

in 2009, riversource life established an agreement to protect its exposure to genworth life insurance company ("glic") for its reinsured ltc. in 2016, substantial enhancements to this reinsurance protection agreement were finalized. the terms of these confidential provisions within the agreement have been shared, in the normal course of regular reviews, with our domiciliary regulator and rating agencies. glic is domiciled in delaware, so in the event glic were subjected to rehabilitation or insolvency proceedings, such proceedings would be located in (and governed by) delaware laws. delaware courts have a long tradition of respecting commercial and reinsurance affairs, as well as contracts among sophisticated parties. similar credit protections to what we have with glic have been tested and respected in delaware and elsewhere in the united states, and as a result we believe our credit protections would be respected even in the unlikely event that glic becomes subject to rehabilitation or insolvency proceedings in delaware. accordingly, while no credit protections are perfect, we believe the correct way to think about the risks represented by our counterparty credit exposure to glic is not the full amount of the gross liability that glic reinsures, but a much smaller net exposure to glic (if any that might exist after taking into account our credit protections). thus, management believes that our agreement and offsetting non ltc legacy arrangements with genworth will enable riversource life to recover on all net exposure in all material respects in the event of a rehabilitation or insolvency of glic.

contractual commitments the contractual obligations identified in the table below include both our on and off-balance sheet transactions that represent material expected or contractually committed future obligations. the table excludes obligations of cies as they are not direct obligations of the company and have recourse only to the assets of the cies. estimated cash payments due by period as of december 31, 2019 were as follows:
insurance and annuities (2)                                    48,321               2,093               3,998                 3,737                      38,493
(2) these scheduled payments are represented by reserves of approximately $30.5 billion at december 31, 2019 and are based on interest credited, mortality, morbidity, lapse, surrender and premium payment assumptions. the estimated payments are presented gross before reinsurance. the scheduled payments are undiscounted and exceed the corresponding liability at december 31, 2019. actual payment obligations may differ if experience varies from these assumptions. as of december 31, 2019, the projected period for which cash payments will be made is 40 years. separate account liabilities have been excluded as associated contractual obligations would be met by separate account assets.
(3) the payments due by year are based on contractual term maturities. however, contractholders have the right to redeem the investment certificates earlier and at their discretion subject to surrender charges, if any. redemptions are most likely to occur in periods of substantial increases in interest rates.
(4) the fair value of these commitments included on the consolidated balance sheets was $1.0 billion as of december 31, 2019. see note 17 to our consolidated financial statements for more information about our deferred premium options.
(5) call dates for the obligations presented are either date or event specific. for date specific obligations, we are required to fund a specific amount on a stated date provided there are no defaults under the agreement. for event specific obligations, we are required to fund a specific amount of its capital commitment when properties in a fund become fully stabilized. for event specific obligations, the estimated call date of these commitments is used in the table above.
(6) purchase obligations include the minimum contractual amounts by period under contracts that were in effect at december 31, 2019. many of the purchase agreements giving rise to these purchase obligations include termination clauses that may require payment of termination fees if the agreements are terminated by us without cause prior to their stated expiration; however, the table reflects the amounts to be paid assuming the contracts are not terminated.
in addition to the contractual commitments outlined in the table above, we periodically fund the employees' defined benefit plans. in 2020, we expect to contribute $16 million to our pension plans and $1 million to our defined benefit postretirement plans. see note 25 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information.
total funding commitments related to loans and private funds, which are not included in the table above due to uncertainty with respect to timing of future cash flows, were $61 million and $12 million, respectively, at december 31, 2019. for additional information relating to these contractual commitments, see note 26 to our consolidated financial statements.
off-balance sheet arrangements we provide asset management services to investment entities which are considered to be vies, such as clos, hedge funds, property funds and other private funds, which are sponsored by us. we consolidate certain clos. we have determined that consolidation is not required for hedge funds, property funds and other private funds, which are sponsored by us. our maximum exposure to loss with respect to our investment in these non-consolidated entities is limited to our carrying value and future funding commitments that are legally binding. other than future funding commitments that are legally binding, we have no obligation to provide further financial or other support to these investment entities nor have we provided any support to these investment entities. see note 5 and note 26 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on our arrangements with these investment entities.

item 1a. risk factors you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, together with the information included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k and other documents we file with the sec. the risks and uncertainties described below are those that we have identified as material, but are not the only risks and uncertainties facing us. our business is also subject to general risks and uncertainties that affect many other companies, such as market conditions, economic conditions, geopolitical events, changes in laws, regulations or accounting rules, fluctuations in interest rates, terrorism, wars or conflicts, major health concerns including epidemics, natural disasters or other disruptions of expected business conditions. additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial also may impair our business, including our results of operations, liquidity, financial condition and stock price.
we may not complete the ge biopharma acquisition within the time frame we anticipate or at all; regulatory approval of the ge biopharma acquisition is subject to conditions; and the ge biopharma acquisition could negatively impact our business, financial statements and stock price.
•   if the ge biopharma acquisition is not completed on the anticipated timetable or at all, or if regulatory approval of the acquisition is subject to additional conditions, we may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of the ge biopharma acquisition on the anticipated timetable or at all.
•   the ge biopharma business could under-perform relative to our expectations and the price that we pay or not perform in accordance with our anticipated timetable, or we could fail to operate such business profitably.
•   the ge biopharma acquisition could cause our financial results to differ from our own or the investment community's expectations in any given period, or over the long-term.
•   pre-closing and post-closing earnings charges related to the ge biopharma acquisition could adversely impact operating results in any given period, and the impact may be substantially different from period-to-period.
•   the ge biopharma acquisition could create demands on our management, operational resources and financial and internal control systems that we are unable to effectively address.
•   the ge biopharma acquisition will divert management's attention and other resources, which could have a negative impact on our ability to manage existing operations or pursue other strategic transactions.
•   we could experience difficulty or greater-than-anticipated costs in integrating the personnel, operations and financial and other controls and systems of ge biopharma, and could experience difficulty attracting and retaining key employees and customers.
•   we may assume unknown liabilities, known contingent liabilities that become realized, known liabilities that prove greater than anticipated, internal control deficiencies or exposure to regulatory sanctions resulting from ge biopharma's activities and the realization of any of these liabilities or deficiencies may increase our expenses, adversely affect our financial position or cause us to fail to meet our public financial reporting obligations.
•   the ge biopharma purchase agreement includes provisions relating to purchase price adjustments, which may have unpredictable financial results.
•   as a result of the ge biopharma acquisition, we expect to record significant goodwill and other assets on our balance sheet and if we are not able to realize the value of these assets, we may be required to incur impairment charges.
the ge biopharma acquisition discussed above would constitute danaher's largest acquisition to date based on purchase price, would expand danaher's business into new fields and involves a number of financial, accounting, managerial, operational, legal, compliance and other risks and challenges. any of these risks or challenges could adversely affect our business, financial statements and stock price.
our outstanding debt has increased significantly in anticipation of the ge biopharma acquisition, and we expect to incur additional debt in the future. our existing and future indebtedness may limit our operations and our use of our cash flow and negatively impact our credit ratings; and any failure to comply with the covenants that apply to our indebtedness could adversely affect our liquidity and financial statements.
as of december 31, 2019, we had approximately $21.7 billion in outstanding indebtedness, including approximately $10.8 billion of long-term debt we issued in 2019 to fund a portion of the purchase price of the ge biopharma acquisition. in addition, we had the ability to incur approximately $4.9 billion of additional indebtedness in direct borrowings or under our outstanding commercial paper facility based on the amounts available under the company's 2020 credit facilities which were not being used to backstop outstanding commercial paper balances. we expect to incur approximately $2.0 billion of additional indebtedness (additional to indebtedness incurred as of december 31, 2019) to fund a portion of the purchase price of the ge biopharma acquisition.
our debt level and related debt service obligations can have negative consequences, including (1) requiring us to dedicate significant cash flow from operations to the payment of principal and interest on our debt, which reduces the funds we have available for other purposes such as acquisitions and other investments; (2) reducing our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and market conditions; and (3) exposing us to interest rate risk since a portion of our debt obligations are at variable rates.
we anticipate that the indebtedness we have incurred and expect to incur in connection with the ge biopharma acquisition will result in a negative change to our credit ratings compared to our credit rating prior to the public announcement of the ge biopharma acquisition. the recent bonds issued by dh europe finance ii s.a.r.l. ("danaher international ii") and guaranteed by danaher corporation were rated bbb+ by standard & poors and baa1 by moody's, each two notches below danaher's current long-term unsecured debt credit rating. upon closing the ge biopharma acquisition we expect danaher's long-term unsecured debt credit rating to be downgraded to mirror that of the bonds issued by danaher international ii. this anticipated reduction in our credit ratings may limit our ability to borrow at interest rates consistent with the interest rates that have been available to us prior to the ge biopharma acquisition. if our credit ratings are further downgraded or put on watch for a further potential downgrade, we may not be able to sell additional debt securities or borrow money in the amounts, at the times or interest rates or upon the more favorable terms and conditions that might be available if our current credit ratings were maintained.
our 2020 credit facilities and long-term debt obligations also impose certain restrictions on us, including certain restrictions on our ability to incur liens on our assets, and a requirement under the 2020 credit facilities to maintain a consolidated leverage ratio (the ratio of consolidated indebtedness to consolidated indebtedness plus shareholders' equity) of 0.65 to 1.0 or less. if we breach any of these restrictions and cannot obtain a waiver from the lenders on favorable terms, subject to applicable cure periods, the outstanding indebtedness (and any other indebtedness with cross-default provisions) could be declared immediately due and payable, which would adversely affect our liquidity and financial statements.
if we incur additional debt in the future, the risks described above would increase.
conditions in the global economy, the particular markets we serve and the financial markets may adversely affect our business and financial statements.
our business is sensitive to general economic conditions. slower global economic growth, actual or anticipated default on sovereign debt, volatility in the currency and credit markets, high levels of unemployment or underemployment, reduced levels of capital expenditures, changes or anticipation of potential changes in government trade, fiscal, tax and monetary policies, changes in capital requirements for financial institutions, government deficit reduction and budget negotiation dynamics, sequestration, austerity measures and other challenges that affect the global economy have in the past adversely affected, and may in the future adversely affect, the company and its distributors, customers and suppliers, including having the effect of:
•   reducing demand for our products and services (in this annual report, references to products and services also includes software), limiting the financing available to our customers and suppliers, increasing order cancellations and resulting in longer sales cycles and slower adoption of new technologies;
•   increasing price competition in our served markets;
•   supply interruptions, which could disrupt our ability to produce our products;
•   increasing the risk of impairment of goodwill and other long-lived assets, and the risk that we may not be able to fully recover the value of other assets such as real estate and tax assets;
•   increasing the risk that counterparties to our contractual arrangements will become insolvent or otherwise unable to fulfill their contractual obligations which, in addition to increasing the risks identified above, could result in preference actions against us; and
•   adversely impacting market sizes and growth rates.
although we have been able to access the commercial paper and other capital markets through the date of this report, there can be no assurances that such markets will remain available to us or that the lenders participating in our revolving credit facility will be able to provide financing in accordance with their contractual obligations.
if growth in the global economy or in any of the markets we serve slows for a significant period, if there is significant deterioration in the global economy or such markets or if improvements in the global economy do not benefit the markets we serve, our business and financial statements could be adversely affected.
significant developments or uncertainties stemming from the u.s. administration, including changes in u.s. trade policies, tariffs and the reaction of other countries thereto, particularly china, can have an adverse effect on our business.
changes, potential changes or uncertainties in u.s. social, political, regulatory and economic conditions or laws and policies governing foreign trade, manufacturing, and development and investment in the territories and countries where we or our customers operate, or governing the health care system and drug prices, can adversely affect our business and financial statements. for example, the u.s. administration has increased tariffs on certain goods imported into the united states, raised the possibility of imposing significant, additional tariff increases and called for substantial changes to trade agreements. in particular, trade tensions between the united states and china have escalated and each country has imposed significant, additional tariffs on a wide range of goods imported from the other country. china accounted for approximately 13% of our sales in 2019. these factors have adversely affected, and in the future could further adversely affect, our business and financial statements.
our growth could suffer if the markets into which we sell our products and services decline, do not grow as anticipated or experience cyclicality.
our growth depends in part on the growth of the markets which we serve, and visibility into our markets is limited (particularly for markets into which we sell through distribution). our quarterly sales and profits depend substantially on the volume and timing of orders received during the fiscal quarter, which are difficult to forecast. any decline or lower than expected growth in our served markets could diminish demand for our products and services, which would adversely affect our financial statements. certain of our businesses operate in industries that may experience periodic, cyclical downturns. in addition, in certain of our businesses demand depends on customers' capital spending budgets as well as government funding policies, and matters of public policy and government budget dynamics as well as product and economic cycles can affect the spending decisions of these entities. demand for our products and services is also sensitive to changes in customer order patterns, which may be affected by announced price changes, marketing or promotional programs, new product introductions, the timing of industry trade shows and changes in distributor or customer inventory levels due to distributor or customer management thereof or other factors. any of these factors could adversely affect our growth and results of operations in any given period.
we face intense competition and if we are unable to compete effectively, we may experience decreased demand and decreased market share. even if we compete effectively, we may be required to reduce prices for our products and services.
our businesses operate in industries that are intensely competitive and have been subject to increasing consolidation. because of the range of the products and services we sell and the variety of markets we serve, we encounter a wide variety of competitors; refer to "item 1. business-competition" for additional details. in order to compete effectively, we must retain longstanding relationships with major customers and continue to grow our business by establishing relationships with new customers, continually developing new products and services to maintain and expand our brand recognition and leadership position in various product and service categories and penetrating new markets, including high-growth markets. in addition, significant shifts in industry market share have occurred and may in the future occur in connection with product problems, safety alerts and publications about products, reflecting the competitive significance of product quality, product efficacy and quality systems in our industry. our failure to compete effectively and/or pricing pressures resulting from competition may adversely impact our financial statements, and our expansion into new markets may result in greater-than-expected risks, liabilities and expenses. in addition, the company's competitors and customers have from time to time introduced, and may in the future introduce, private label, generic or low-cost products that compete with the company's products at lower price points. competitors' products can capture significant market share or lead to a decrease in market prices overall, resulting in an adverse effect on the company's financial statements.
our growth depends in part on the timely development and commercialization, and customer acceptance, of new and enhanced products and services based on technological innovation.
we generally sell our products and services in industries that are characterized by rapid technological changes, frequent new product introductions and changing industry standards. if we do not develop innovative new and enhanced products and services on a timely basis, our offerings will become obsolete over time and our competitive position and financial statements will suffer. our success will depend on several factors, including our ability to:
•   correctly identify customer needs and preferences and predict future needs and preferences;
•   allocate our r&amp;d funding to products and services with higher growth prospects;
•   anticipate and respond to our competitors' development of new products and services and technological innovations;
•   differentiate our offerings from our competitors' offerings and avoid commoditization;
•   innovate and develop new technologies and applications, and acquire or obtain rights to third-party technologies that may have valuable applications in our served markets;
•   obtain adequate intellectual property rights with respect to key technologies before our competitors do;
•   successfully commercialize new technologies in a timely manner, price them competitively and cost-effectively manufacture and deliver sufficient volumes of new products of appropriate quality on time;
•   obtain necessary regulatory approvals of appropriate scope (including with respect to medical device products by demonstrating satisfactory clinical results where applicable, as well as achieving third-party reimbursement); and
•   stimulate customer demand for and convince customers to adopt new technologies.
if we fail to accurately predict future customer needs and preferences or fail to produce viable technologies, we may invest heavily in r&d of products and services that do not lead to significant revenue, which would adversely affect our profitability. even when we successfully innovate and develop new and enhanced products and services, we often incur substantial costs in doing so, and our profitability may suffer. in addition, promising new offerings may fail to reach the market or realize only limited commercial success because of real or perceived efficacy or safety concerns, failure to achieve positive clinical outcomes, uncertainty over third-party reimbursement or entrenched patterns of clinical practice. competitors may also develop after-market services and parts for our products which attract customers and adversely affect our return on investment for new products.
our reputation, ability to do business and financial statements can be impaired by improper conduct by any of our employees, agents or business partners.
we cannot provide assurance that our internal controls and compliance systems, including our code of conduct, always protect us from acts committed by employees, agents or business partners of ours (or of businesses we acquire or partner with) that violate u.s. and/or non-u.s. laws, including the laws governing payments to government officials, bribery, fraud, kickbacks and false claims, pricing, sales and marketing practices, conflicts of interest, competition, employment practices and workplace behavior, export and import compliance, economic and trade sanctions, money laundering and data privacy. in particular, the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act, the uk bribery act and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business, and we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree. any such improper actions or allegations of such acts could damage our reputation and subject us to civil or criminal investigations in the united states and in other jurisdictions and related shareholder lawsuits, could lead to substantial civil and criminal, monetary and nonmonetary penalties and could cause us to incur significant legal and investigatory fees. in addition, the government may seek to hold us liable for violations committed by companies in which we invest or that we acquire. we also rely on our suppliers to adhere to our supplier code of conduct, and material violations of such code of conduct could occur that could have a material effect on our business, reputation and financial statements.
certain of our businesses are subject to extensive regulation by the u.s. fda and by comparable agencies of other countries, as well as laws regulating fraud and abuse in the health care industry and the privacy and security of health information. failure to comply with those regulations could adversely affect our reputation, ability to do business and financial statements.
certain of our products are medical devices and other products that are subject to regulation by the u.s. fda, by other federal and state governmental agencies, by comparable agencies of other countries and regions, by certain accrediting bodies and by regulations governing hazardous materials and drugs-of abuse (or the manufacture and sale of products containing any such materials). the global regulatory environment has become increasingly stringent and unpredictable. several countries that did not have regulatory requirements for medical devices have established such requirements in recent years, and other countries have expanded, or plan to expand, their existing regulations. please see "regulatory matters-medical device regulations" for more information. failure to meet these requirements adversely impacts our business in the applicable geographies.
to varying degrees, these regulators require us to comply with laws and regulations governing the development, testing, manufacturing, labeling, marketing, distribution and post-marketing surveillance of our products. we cannot guarantee that we will be able to obtain regulatory clearance (such as 510(k) clearance) or approvals for our new products or modifications to (or additional indications or uses of) existing products within our anticipated timeframe or at all, and if we do obtain such clearance or approval it may be time-consuming, costly and subject to restrictions. our ability to obtain such regulatory clearances or approvals will depend on many factors, for example our ability to obtain the necessary clinical trial results, and the process for obtaining such clearances or approvals could change over time and may require the withdrawal of products from the market until such clearances are obtained. even after initial regulatory clearance or approval, we are subject to periodic inspection by these regulatory authorities, and if safety issues arise we can be required to amend conditions for use of a product, such as providing additional warnings on the product's label or narrowing its approved intended use, which could reduce the product's market acceptance. failure to obtain required regulatory clearances or approvals before marketing our products (or before implementing modifications to or promoting additional indications or uses of our products), other violations of these regulations, failure to remediate inspectional observations to the satisfaction of these regulatory authorities, real or perceived efficacy or safety concerns or trends of adverse events with respect to our products (even after obtaining clearance for distribution) and unfavorable or inconsistent clinical data from existing or future clinical trials can lead to fda form 483 inspectional observations, warning letters, notices to customers, declining sales, loss of customers, loss of market share, remediation and increased compliance costs, recalls, seizures of adulterated or misbranded products, injunctions, administrative detentions, refusals to permit importations, partial or total shutdown of production facilities or the implementation of operating restrictions, narrowing of permitted uses for a product, suspension or withdrawal of approvals and pre-market notification rescissions. we are also subject to various laws regulating fraud and abuse, research and development, pricing and sales and marketing practices, the privacy and security of health information as well as manufacturing and quality standards, including the federal regulations described in "item 1. business-regulatory matters."
ensuring that our internal operations and business arrangements with third parties comply with applicable laws and regulations involves substantial costs. it is also possible that government authorities will conclude that our business practices do not comply with current or future statutes, regulations, agency guidance or case law.
noncompliance with the laws and regulations referenced above can result in, among other things, fines, expenses, injunctions, civil penalties, recalls or seizures of products, total or partial suspension of production, refusal of the government to grant 510(k) clearance of devices, withdrawal of marketing approvals, criminal prosecutions and other adverse effects referenced below under "our businesses are subject to extensive regulation; failure to comply with those regulations could adversely affect our financial statements and our business, including our reputation." further, defending against any such actions can be costly and time-consuming and may require significant personnel resources. therefore, even if we are successful in defending against any such actions brought against us, our business may be impaired.
our products are subject to clinical trials, the results of which may be unexpected, or perceived as unfavorable by the market, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
as a part of the regulatory process of obtaining marketing clearance for certain new products and new indications for certain existing products, we conduct and participate in numerous clinical trials with a variety of study designs, patient populations and trial endpoints. unexpected or inconsistent clinical data from existing or future clinical trials, or a regulator's or the market's perception of this clinical data, can adversely impact our ability to obtain product approvals, our position in, and share of, the markets in which we participate and our business and financial statements.
off-label marketing of our products could result in substantial penalties.
the fda strictly regulates the promotional claims that may be made about approved or cleared products. in particular, any clearances we may receive only permit us to market our products for the uses indicated on the labeling cleared by the fda. we may request additional label indications for our current products, and the fda may deny those requests outright, require additional expensive performance or clinical data to support any additional indications or impose limitations on the intended use of any cleared products as a condition of clearance. if the fda determines that we have marketed our products for off-label use, we can be subject to fines, injunctions or other penalties. it is also possible that other federal, state or foreign enforcement authorities might take action if they consider our business activities to constitute promotion of an off-label use, which could result in significant penalties, including, but not limited to, criminal, civil and administrative penalties, substantial monetary penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, and/or the curtailment of our operations. any of these events could significantly harm our business and financial statements.
certain modifications to our products may require new 510(k) clearances or other marketing authorizations and may require us to recall or cease marketing our products.
once a medical device is permitted to be legally marketed in the united states pursuant to a 510(k) clearance, a manufacturer may be required to notify the fda of certain modifications to the device. manufacturers determine in the first instance whether a change to a product requires a new 510(k) clearance or premarket submission, but the fda may review any manufacturer's decision. the fda may not agree with our decisions regarding whether new clearances are necessary. we have made modifications to our products in the past and have determined based on our review of the applicable fda regulations and guidance that in certain instances new 510(k) clearances or other premarket submissions were not required. we may make similar modifications or add additional features in the future that we believe do not require a new 510(k) clearance. if the fda disagrees with our determinations and requires us to submit new 510(k) notifications, we may be required to cease marketing or to recall the modified product until we obtain clearance, and we may be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties.
the health care industry and related industries that we serve have undergone, and are in the process of undergoing, significant changes in an effort to reduce costs, which could adversely affect our financial statements.
the health care industry and related industries that we serve have undergone, and are in the process of undergoing, significant changes in an effort to reduce costs, including the following:
•   many of our customers, and the end-users to whom our customers supply products, rely on government funding of and reimbursement for health care products and services and research activities. the ppaca, health care austerity measures in other countries and other potential health care reform changes and government austerity measures have reduced and may further reduce the amount of government funding or reimbursement available to customers or end-users of our products and services and/or the volume of medical procedures using our products and services. for example, the protecting access to medicare act of 2014, or pama, introduced a multi-year pricing program for services payable under the clinical laboratory fee schedule ("clfs") that is designed to bring medicare allowable amounts in line with the amounts paid by private payers.  it is still unclear whether and to what extent these new rates will affect overall pricing and reimbursement for clinical laboratory testing services, but to the extent our customers conclude that medicare reimbursement for these services is inadequate, it can in turn adversely impact the prices at which we sell our products. other countries, as well as some private payors, also control the price of health care products, directly or indirectly, through reimbursement, payment, pricing or coverage limitations, tying reimbursement to outcomes or (in the case of governmental entities) through compulsory licensing. global economic uncertainty or deterioration can also adversely impact government funding and reimbursement.
•   governmental and private health care providers and payors around the world are increasingly utilizing managed care for the delivery of health care services, centralizing purchasing, limiting the number of vendors that may participate in purchasing programs, forming group purchasing organizations and integrated health delivery networks and pursuing consolidation to improve their purchasing leverage and using competitive bid processes to procure health care products and services.
these changes as well as other impacts from market demand, government regulations, third-party coverage and reimbursement policies and societal pressures are changing the way healthcare is delivered, reimbursed and funded and have in the past and could in the future cause participants in the health care industry and related industries that we serve to purchase fewer of our products and services, reduce the prices they are willing to pay for our products or services, reduce the amounts of reimbursement and funding available for our products and services from governmental agencies or third-party payors, heighten clinical data requirements, reduce the volume of medical procedures that use our products and services, affect the acceptance rate of new technologies and products and increase our compliance and other costs. in addition, we may be excluded from important market segments or unable to enter into contracts with group purchasing organizations and integrated health networks on terms acceptable to us, and even if we do enter into such contracts they may be on terms that negatively affect our current or future profitability. all of the factors described above can adversely affect our business and financial statements.
any inability to consummate acquisitions at our historical rate and at appropriate prices, and to make appropriate investments that support our long-term strategy, could negatively impact our growth rate and stock price.
our ability to grow revenues, earnings and cash flow at or above our historic rates depends in part upon our ability to identify and successfully acquire and integrate businesses at appropriate prices and realize anticipated synergies, and to make appropriate investments that support our long-term strategy. we may not be able to consummate acquisitions at rates similar to the past, which could adversely impact our growth rate and our stock price. promising acquisitions and investments are difficult to identify and complete for a number of reasons, including high valuations, competition among prospective buyers, the availability of affordable funding in the capital markets and the need to satisfy applicable closing conditions and obtain applicable antitrust and other regulatory approvals on acceptable terms. in addition, competition for acquisitions and investments has resulted and may result in higher purchase prices. changes in accounting or regulatory requirements or instability in the credit markets could also adversely impact our ability to consummate acquisitions and investments.
our acquisition of businesses, investments, joint ventures and other strategic relationships could negatively impact our financial statements.
as part of our business strategy we acquire businesses, make investments and enter into joint ventures and other strategic relationships in the ordinary course, and we also from time to time complete more significant transactions; refer to md&a for additional details. acquisitions, investments, joint ventures and strategic relationships involve a number of financial, accounting, managerial, operational, legal, compliance and other risks and challenges, including the following, any of which could adversely affect our business and our financial statements:
•   businesses, technologies, services and products that we acquire or invest in sometimes under-perform relative to our expectations and the price that we paid or fail to perform in accordance with our anticipated timetable, resulting in a failure to operate any such business profitably.
•   we from time to time incur or assume significant debt in connection with our acquisitions, investments, joint ventures or strategic relationships, which can also cause a deterioration of danaher's credit ratings, result in increased borrowing costs and interest expense and diminish our future access to the capital markets.
•   acquisitions, investments, joint ventures or strategic relationships can cause our financial results to differ from our own or the investment community's expectations in any given period, or over the long-term.
•   acquisitions, investments, joint ventures or strategic relationships can create demands on our management, operational resources and financial and internal control systems that we are unable to effectively address.
•   we can experience difficulty in integrating personnel, operations and financial and other controls and systems and retaining key employees and customers.
•   we may be unable to achieve cost savings or other synergies anticipated in connection with an acquisition, investment, joint venture or strategic relationship.
•   we have assumed and may assume unknown liabilities, known contingent liabilities that become realized, known liabilities that prove greater than anticipated, internal control deficiencies or exposure to regulatory sanctions resulting from the acquired company's or investee's activities and the realization of any of these liabilities or deficiencies can increase our expenses, adversely affect our financial position or cause us to fail to meet our public financial reporting obligations.
•   in connection with acquisitions and joint ventures, we often enter into post-closing financial arrangements such as purchase price adjustments, earn-out obligations and indemnification obligations, which can have unpredictable financial results.
•   as a result of our acquisitions and investments, we have recorded significant goodwill and other assets on our balance sheet and if we are not able to realize the value of these assets, or if the fair value of our investments declines, we are required to incur impairment charges.
•   we may have interests that diverge from those of our joint venture partners or other strategic partners and we may not be able to direct the management and operations of the joint venture or other strategic relationship in the manner we believe is most appropriate, exposing us to additional risk.
•   investing in or making loans to early-stage companies often entails a high degree of risk, and we do not always achieve the strategic, technological, financial or commercial benefits we anticipate; we may lose our investment or fail to recoup our loan; or our investment may be illiquid for a greater-than-expected period of time.
the indemnification provisions of acquisition agreements by which we have acquired companies may not fully protect us and as a result we may face unexpected liabilities.
certain of the acquisition agreements by which we have acquired companies require the former owners to indemnify us against certain liabilities related to the operation of the acquired company before we acquired it. in most of these agreements, however, the liability of the former owners is limited and certain former owners may be unable to meet their indemnification responsibilities. we cannot assure you that these indemnification provisions will protect us fully or at all, and as a result we may face unexpected liabilities that adversely affect our financial statements.
divestitures or other dispositions could negatively impact our business, and contingent liabilities from businesses that we or our predecessors have sold could adversely affect our financial statements.
we continually assess the strategic fit of our existing businesses and may divest, spin-off, split-off or otherwise dispose of businesses that are deemed not to fit with our strategic plan or are not achieving the desired return on investment. for example, in 2015, danaher separated and split-off to danaher shareholders the majority of its former communications business in a reverse morris trust transaction with netscout systems, inc. (the "communications disposition"), in 2016 danaher separated and spun-off to danaher shareholders its former test & measurement segment, industrial technologies segment (excluding the product identification businesses) and retail/commercial petroleum business (collectively known as fortive corporation) (the "fortive disposition"), and in 2019 danaher consummated the separation and initial public offering ("ipo") and subsequent split-off of its dental segment, known as envista holdings corporation (the "envista disposition"). transactions such as these pose risks and challenges that could negatively impact our business and financial statements. for example, when we decide to sell or otherwise dispose of a business or assets, we may be unable to do so on satisfactory terms within our anticipated timeframe or at all, and even after reaching a definitive agreement to sell or dispose a business the sale is typically subject to satisfaction of pre-closing conditions which may not become satisfied. in addition, divestitures or other dispositions can dilute the company's earnings per share, have other adverse financial, tax and accounting impacts and distract management, and disputes can arise with buyers. in addition, we have retained responsibility for and/or have agreed to indemnify buyers against some known and unknown contingent liabilities related to a number of businesses we or our predecessors have sold or disposed. the resolution of these contingencies has not had a material effect on our financial statements but we cannot be certain that this favorable pattern will continue.
we could incur significant liability if any of the 2015 separation and split-off of our communications business, the 2016 separation and spin-off of fortive or the 2019 separation, ipo and split-off of envista is determined to be a taxable transaction.
we have received opinions from outside tax counsel to the effect that each of the communications disposition, the fortive disposition and the envista disposition qualifies as a transaction that is described in sections 355(a) and 368(a)(1)(d) of the internal revenue code. these opinions rely on certain facts, assumptions, representations and undertakings regarding the past and future conduct of the companies' respective businesses and other matters. if any of these facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings are incorrect or not satisfied, our stockholders and we may not be able to rely on the respective opinion of tax counsel and could be subject to significant tax liabilities. notwithstanding the opinion of tax counsel, the internal revenue service ("irs") could determine on audit that any such transactions are taxable if it determines that any of these facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings are not correct or have been violated or if it disagrees with the conclusions in the respective opinion. if any such transaction is determined to be taxable for u.s. federal income tax purposes, our stockholders that are subject to u.s. federal income tax and we could incur significant u.s. federal income tax liabilities.
potential indemnification liabilities pursuant to the 2015 separation and split-off of our communications business, the 2016 separation and spin-off of fortive or the 2019 separation, ipo and split-off of envista could materially and adversely affect our business and financial statements.
with respect to each of the communications disposition, the fortive disposition and the envista disposition, we entered into a separation agreement and related agreements to govern the separation and related transactions and the relationship between the respective companies going forward. these agreements provide for specific indemnity and liability obligations of each party that can lead to disputes between us and the respective counterparty. if we are required to indemnify any of the other parties under the circumstances set forth in these agreements, we may be subject to substantial liabilities. in addition, with respect to the liabilities for which the other parties have agreed to indemnify us under these agreements, there can be no assurance that the indemnity rights we have against such other parties will be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of the liabilities, or that such other parties will be able to fully satisfy its indemnification obligations. it is also possible that a court could disregard the allocation of assets and liabilities agreed to between danaher and such other parties and require danaher to assume responsibility for obligations allocated to such other parties. each of these risks could negatively affect our business and financial statements.
a significant disruption in, or breach in security of, our information technology systems or data or violation of data privacy laws could adversely affect our business, reputation and financial statements.
we rely on information technology systems, some of which are provided and/or managed by third-parties, to process, transmit and store electronic information (including sensitive data such as confidential business information and personally identifiable data relating to employees, customers, other business partners and patients), and to manage or support a variety of critical business processes and activities (such as receiving and fulfilling orders, billing, collecting and making payments, shipping products, providing services and support to customers and fulfilling contractual obligations). in addition, some of our remote monitoring products and services incorporate software and information technology that house personal data and some products or software we sell to customers connect to our systems for maintenance or other purposes. these systems, products and services (including those we acquire through business acquisitions) may be damaged, disrupted or shut down due to attacks by computer hackers, computer viruses, ransomware, human error or malfeasance, power outages, hardware failures, telecommunication or utility failures, catastrophes or other unforeseen events, and in any such circumstances our system redundancy and other disaster recovery planning may be ineffective or inadequate. attacks may also target hardware, software and information installed, stored or transmitted in our products after such products have been purchased and incorporated into third-party products, facilities or infrastructure. security breaches of systems provided or enabled by us, regardless of whether the breach is attributable to a vulnerability in our products or services, or security breaches of third party systems we rely on to process, store or transmit electronic information, could result in the misappropriation, destruction or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information or personal data belonging to us or to our employees, partners, customers, patients or suppliers. like most multinational corporations, our information technology systems have been subject to computer viruses, malicious codes, unauthorized access and other cyber-attacks and we expect the sophistication and frequency of such attacks to continue to increase. unauthorized tampering, adulteration or interference with our products may also adversely affect product functionality and result in loss of data, risk to patient safety and product recalls or field actions. any of the attacks, breaches or other disruptions or damage described above could interrupt our operations or the operations of our customers and partners, delay production and shipments, result in theft of our and our customers' intellectual property and trade secrets, damage customer, patient, business partner and employee relationships and our reputation or result in defective products or services, legal claims and proceedings, liability and penalties under privacy laws and increased costs for security and remediation, in each case resulting in an adverse effect on our business, reputation and financial statements.
if we are unable to maintain reliable information technology systems and appropriate controls with respect to global data privacy and security requirements and prevent data breaches, we may suffer adverse regulatory consequences, business consequences and litigation. as a global organization, we are subject to data privacy and security laws, regulations, and customer-imposed controls in numerous jurisdictions as a result of having access to and processing confidential, personal and/or sensitive data in the course of our business. please see "regulatory matters - data privacy and security laws" for additional information. entities that are found to be in violation of hipaa as the result of a breach of unsecured patient health information, a complaint about privacy practices or an audit by the hhs, may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative fines and penalties and/or additional reporting and oversight obligations if required to enter into a resolution agreement and corrective action plan with hhs to settle allegations of hipaa non-compliance. failure to comply with the requirements of gdpr and the applicable national data protection laws of the eu member states may result in fines of up to €20 million or up to 4% of the total worldwide annual turnover of the preceding financial year, whichever is higher, and other administrative penalties. several other countries such as china and russia have passed, and other countries are considering passing, laws that require personal data relating to their citizens to be maintained on local servers and impose additional data transfer restrictions. there is also a new, broad privacy law in california, the ccpa, which came into effect in january 2020. the ccpa has some of the same features as the gdpr, and has already prompted several other states to follow with similar laws. government enforcement actions can be costly and interrupt the regular operation of our business, and data breaches or violations of data privacy laws can result in fines, reputational damage and civil lawsuits, any of which may adversely affect our business, reputation and financial statements. in addition, compliance with the varying data privacy regulations across the united states and around the world has required significant expenditures and may require additional expenditures, and may require further changes in our products or business models that increase competition or reduce revenue.
our operations, products and services expose us to the risk of environmental, health and safety liabilities, costs and violations that could adversely affect our business, reputation and financial statements.
our operations, products and services are subject to environmental laws and regulations, which impose limitations on the discharge of pollutants into the environment, establish standards for the use, generation, treatment, storage and disposal of hazardous and nonhazardous wastes and impose end-of-life disposal and take-back programs. we must also comply with various health and safety regulations in the united states and abroad in connection with our operations. we cannot assure you that our environmental, health and safety compliance program (or the compliance programs of businesses we acquire) have been or will at all times be effective. failure to comply with any of these laws can result in civil and criminal, monetary and nonmonetary penalties and damage to our reputation. in addition, we cannot provide assurance that our costs of complying with current or future environmental protection and health and safety laws will not exceed our estimates or adversely affect our financial statements.
in addition, we from time to time incur costs related to remedial efforts or alleged environmental damage associated with past or current waste disposal practices or other hazardous materials handling practices. we are also from time to time party to personal injury, property damage or other claims brought by private parties alleging injury or damage due to the presence of or exposure to hazardous substances. we can also become subject to additional remedial, compliance or personal injury costs due to future events such as changes in existing laws or regulations, changes in agency direction or enforcement policies, developments in remediation technologies, changes in the conduct of our operations and changes in accounting rules. for additional information regarding these risks, refer to note 18 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report. we cannot assure you that our liabilities arising from past or future releases of, or exposures to, hazardous substances will not exceed our estimates or adversely affect our reputation and financial statements or that we will not be subject to additional claims for personal injury or remediation in the future based on our past, present or future business activities. however, based on the information we currently have we do not believe that it is reasonably possible that any amounts we may be required to pay in connection with environmental matters in excess of our reserves as of december 31, 2019 will have a material effect on our financial statements.
our businesses are subject to extensive regulation; failure to comply with those regulations could adversely affect our financial statements and our business, including our reputation.
in addition to the environmental, health, safety, health care, medical device, anticorruption, data privacy and other regulations noted elsewhere in this annual report, our businesses are subject to extensive regulation by u.s. and non-u.s. governmental and self-regulatory entities at the supranational, federal, state, local and other jurisdictional levels, including the following:
•   we are required to comply with various import laws and export control and economic sanctions laws, which may affect our transactions with certain customers, business partners and other persons and dealings between our employees and between our subsidiaries. in certain circumstances, export control and economic sanctions regulations may prohibit the export of certain products, services and technologies. in other circumstances, we may be required to obtain an export license before exporting the controlled item. compliance with the various import laws that apply to our businesses can restrict our access to, and increase the cost of obtaining, certain products and at times can interrupt our supply of imported inventory. in addition, from time to time, certain of our subsidiaries have limited business dealings in countries subject to comprehensive sanctions. these business dealings represent an insignificant amount of our consolidated revenues and income, but expose us to a heightened risk of violating applicable sanctions regulations. we have established policies and procedures designed to assist with our compliance with such laws and regulations. however, there can be no assurance that our policies and procedures have prevented and will prevent violations of these regulations and any violation can adversely affect our reputation, business and financial statements.
•   we also have agreements to sell products and services to government entities and are subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to companies doing business with government entities (less than 5% of our 2019 sales were made to the u.s. federal government). the laws governing government contracts differ from the laws governing private contracts. for example, many government contracts contain pricing and other terms and conditions that are not applicable to private contracts. our agreements with government entities are in some cases subject to termination, reduction or modification at the convenience of the government or in the event of changes in government requirements, reductions in federal spending and other factors, and we may underestimate our costs of performing under the contract. in certain cases, a governmental entity may require us to pay back amounts it has paid to us. government contracts that have been awarded to us following a bid process can become the subject of a bid protest by a losing bidder, which could result in loss of the contract. we are also subject to investigation and audit for compliance with the requirements governing government contracts.
these are not the only regulations that our businesses must comply with. the regulations we are subject to have tended to become more stringent over time and can be inconsistent across jurisdictions. we, our representatives and the industries in which we operate are at times under review and/or investigation by regulatory authorities. failure to comply (or any alleged or perceived failure to comply) with the regulations referenced above or any other regulations can result in import detentions, fines, damages, civil and administrative penalties, injunctions, suspensions or losses of regulatory approvals, recall or seizure of products, operating restrictions, refusal of the government to approve product export applications or allow us to enter into supply contracts, disbarment from selling to certain governmental agencies or exclusion from government funded healthcare programs, such as medicare and medicaid or similar programs in other countries or jurisdictions, integrity oversight and reporting obligations to resolve allegations of non-compliance, disruption of our business, limitation on our ability to manufacture, import, export and sell products and services, loss of customers, significant legal and investigatory fees, disgorgement, individual imprisonment, reputational harm, contractual damages, diminished profits, curtailment or restricting of business operations, criminal prosecution and other monetary and non-monetary penalties. compliance with these and other regulations can also affect our returns on investment, require us to incur significant expenses or modify our business model or impair our flexibility in modifying product, marketing, pricing or other strategies for growing our business. our products and operations are also often subject to the rules of industrial standards bodies such as the international standards organization, and failure to comply with these rules can result in withdrawal of certifications needed to sell our products and services and otherwise adversely impact our business and financial statements. for additional information regarding these risks, refer to "item 1. business-regulatory matters."
our restructuring actions can have long-term adverse effects on our business.
in recent years, we have implemented significant restructuring activities across our businesses to adjust our cost structure, and we may engage in similar restructuring activities in the future. these restructuring activities and our regular ongoing cost reduction activities (including in connection with the integration of acquired businesses) reduce our available talent, assets and other resources and can slow improvements in our products and services, adversely affect our ability to respond to customers, limit our ability to increase production quickly if demand for our products increases and trigger adverse public attention. in addition, delays in implementing planned restructuring activities or other productivity improvements, unexpected costs or failure to meet targeted improvements may diminish the operational or financial benefits we expect to realize from such actions. moreover, we may not succeed in implementing present or future restructuring activities or cost reduction activities. realizing the anticipated benefits from these initiatives, if any benefits are achieved at all, can take several years, and we may be unable to achieve our targeted cost efficiencies and profit margin improvements. additionally, we may have insufficient access to capital to fund investments in these strategic initiatives, or our business strategy may change from time to time, which could delay our ability to implement initiatives that we believe are important to our business. any of the circumstances described above could adversely impact our business and financial statements.
we may be required to recognize impairment charges for our goodwill and other intangible assets.
as of december 31, 2019, the net carrying value of our goodwill and other intangible assets totaled approximately $32.5 billion. in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, we periodically assess these assets to determine if they are impaired. significant negative industry or economic trends, disruptions to our business, inability to effectively integrate acquired businesses, unexpected significant changes or planned changes in use of our assets, changes in the structure of our business, divestitures, market capitalization declines, or increases in associated discount rates can impair our goodwill and other intangible assets. any charges relating to such impairments adversely affect our results of operations in the periods recognized.
foreign currency exchange rates can adversely affect our financial statements.
sales and purchases in currencies other than the u.s. dollar expose us to fluctuations in foreign currencies relative to the u.s. dollar and may adversely affect our financial statements. increased strength of the u.s. dollar increases the effective price of our products sold in u.s. dollars into other countries, which can from time to time require us to lower our prices or adversely affect sales to the extent we do not increase local currency prices. decreased strength of the u.s. dollar adversely affects the cost of materials, products and services we purchase overseas. sales and expenses of our non-u.s. businesses are also translated into u.s. dollars for reporting purposes and the strengthening of the u.s. dollar generally results in unfavorable translation effects. in addition, certain of our businesses invoice customers in a currency other than the business' functional currency, and movements in the invoiced currency relative to the functional currency can also result in unfavorable translation effects. the company also faces exchange rate risk from its investments in subsidiaries owned and operated in foreign countries.
changes in our tax rates or exposure to additional income tax liabilities or assessments can affect our profitability. in addition, audits by tax authorities can result in additional tax payments for prior periods.
we are subject to income taxes in the united states and in numerous non-u.s. jurisdictions.  on december 22, 2017, the tax cuts and jobs act ("tcja") was enacted.  the tcja significantly revised the u.s. federal corporate income tax law by, among other things, lowering the corporate income tax rate to 21.0%, implementing a quasi-territorial tax system, and imposing a one-time tax on unremitted cumulative non-u.s. earnings of foreign subsidiaries ("transition tax").
due to the potential for changes to tax laws and regulations or changes to the interpretation thereof (including regulations and interpretations pertaining to the tcja), the ambiguity of tax laws and regulations, the subjectivity of factual interpretations, the complexity of our intercompany arrangements, uncertainties regarding the geographic mix of earnings in any particular period, and other factors, our estimates of effective tax rate and income tax assets and liabilities can be incorrect and our financial statements could be adversely affected; please refer to md&a for a discussion of additional factors that may adversely affect our effective tax rate and decrease our profitability in any period. the impact of these factors referenced in the first sentence of this paragraph may be substantially different from period-to-period.
in addition, the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits by u.s. federal, state and local tax authorities and by non-u.s. tax authorities, such as the audits described in md&a and the company's consolidated financial statements.  if audits result in payments or assessments different from our reserves, our results can include unfavorable adjustments to our tax liabilities and our financial statements can be adversely affected.  in particular, the irs' proposed adjustments to certain of the company's historical taxable income with respect to the deferral of tax on certain premium income related to the company's self-insurance programs, and the danish tax authority's assessments purporting to impose withholding tax relating to interest accrued in denmark on historical borrowings from certain of the company's subsidiaries (each as further discussed in md&a and the company's consolidated financial statements), each could take many years to resolve and could ultimately result in a material, adverse impact to the company's financial statements, including its cash flows and effective tax rates. any further significant changes to the tax system in the united states or in other jurisdictions (including changes in the taxation of international income as further described below) could also adversely affect our financial statements.
changes in tax law relating to multinational corporations could adversely affect our tax position.
the u.s. congress, government agencies in non-u.s. jurisdictions where we and our affiliates do business, and the organisation for economic co-operation and development ("oecd") have recently focused on issues related to the taxation of multinational corporations. one example is in the area of "base erosion and profit shifting," where profits are claimed to be earned for tax purposes in low-tax jurisdictions, or payments are made between affiliates from a jurisdiction with high tax rates to a jurisdiction with lower tax rates. the oecd has released several components of its comprehensive plan to create an agreed set of international rules to address base erosion and profit shifting. as a result, the tax laws in the united states and other countries in which we do business could change on a prospective or retroactive basis, and any such changes could adversely affect our business and financial statements.
we are subject to a variety of litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings in the course of our business that can adversely affect our business and financial statements.
we are subject to a variety of litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings incidental to our business (or the business operations of previously owned entities), including claims or counterclaims for damages arising out of the use of products or services and claims relating to intellectual property matters, employment matters, tax matters, commercial disputes, breach of contract claims, competition and sales and trading practices, environmental matters, personal injury, insurance coverage and acquisition or divestiture-related matters, as well as regulatory subpoenas, requests for information, investigations and enforcement. we also from time to time become subject to lawsuits as a result of past or future acquisitions or as a result of liabilities retained from, or representations, warranties or indemnities provided in connection with, businesses divested by us or our predecessors. the types of claims made in lawsuits include claims for compensatory damages, punitive and consequential damages (and in some cases, treble damages) and/or injunctive relief. the defense of these lawsuits can divert our management's attention, we from time to time incur significant expenses in defending these lawsuits, and we can be required to pay damage awards or settlements or become subject to equitable remedies that adversely affect our operations and financial statements. moreover, any insurance or indemnification rights that we may have may be insufficient or unavailable to protect us against such losses. in addition, developments in proceedings in any given period can require us to adjust the loss contingency estimates that we have recorded in our financial statements, record estimates for liabilities or assets previously not susceptible of reasonable estimates or pay cash settlements or judgments. any of these developments can adversely affect our financial statements in any particular period. we cannot assure you that our liabilities in connection with current and future litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings will not exceed our estimates or adversely affect our financial statements and business. however, based on our experience, current information and applicable law, we do not believe that it is reasonably possible that any amounts we may be required to pay in connection with litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings in excess of our reserves as of december 31, 2019 will have a material effect on our financial statements.
from time to time, we become aware through our internal audits and other internal control procedures, employees or other parties of possible compliance matters, such as complaints or concerns relating to accounting, internal controls, financial reporting, auditing or ethical matters or relating to compliance with laws. when we become aware of such possible compliance matters, we investigate internally and take appropriate corrective action. internal investigations can lead to the assertion of claims or the commencement of legal or regulatory proceedings against us and adversely affect our financial statements.
if we are unable to adequately protect our intellectual property, or if third-parties infringe our intellectual property rights, we may suffer competitive injury or expend significant resources enforcing our rights. these risks are particularly pronounced in countries in which we do business that do not have levels of protection of intellectual property comparable to the united states.
many of the markets we serve are technology-driven, and as a result intellectual property rights play a significant role in product development and differentiation. we own numerous patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets and other intellectual property and licenses to intellectual property owned by others, which in aggregate are important to our business. the intellectual property rights that we obtain, however, are not always sufficiently broad and do not always provide us a significant competitive advantage, and patents may not be issued for pending or future patent applications owned by or licensed to us. in addition, the steps that we and our licensors have taken to maintain and protect our intellectual property do not always prevent it from being challenged, invalidated, circumvented, designed-around or becoming subject to compulsory licensing. in some circumstances, enforcement is not available to us because an infringer has a dominant intellectual property position or for other business reasons. we also rely on nondisclosure and noncompetition agreements with employees, consultants and other parties to protect, in part, trade secrets and other proprietary rights. there can be no assurance that these agreements adequately protect our trade secrets and other proprietary rights and will not be breached, that we will have adequate remedies for any breach, that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information or that third-parties will not otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or other proprietary rights. our failure to obtain or maintain intellectual property rights that convey competitive advantage, adequately protect our intellectual property or detect or prevent circumvention or unauthorized use of such property and the cost of enforcing our intellectual property rights can adversely impact our business, including our competitive position, and financial statements.
these risks are particularly pronounced in countries in which we do business that do not have levels of protection of corporate proprietary information, intellectual property, technology and other assets comparable to the united states. the risks we encounter in such countries include the following:
•   joint ventures that we participate in can include restrictions that could compromise our control over the intellectual property, technology and proprietary information of the joint venture;
•   as we expand our operations globally, increasing amounts of our data, intellectual property and technology is used and stored in countries outside the united states, and regulations in certain countries require data to be stored locally. these factors increase the risk that such data, intellectual property and technology could be stolen or otherwise compromised;
•   certain of our products have been counterfeited and we may encounter additional and/or increased levels of counterfeiting in the future;
•   governmental entities may adopt regulations or other requirements that give them rights to certain of our intellectual property, technology and/or proprietary information, such as through compulsory licensing or foreign ownership restrictions or requirements;
•   in certain countries, we do not have the same ability to enforce intellectual property rights as we do in the united states;
•   governmental regulations relating to state secrecy or other topics limit our ability to transfer data or technology out of certain jurisdictions;
•   risks, costs and challenges of operating in a particular jurisdiction can result in a decision to relocate or divert operations to a different jurisdiction, potentially at higher cost.
any of these risks can adversely impact our business, including our competitive position, and financial statements. refer to "-international economic, political, legal, compliance and business factors could negatively affect our financial statements" for a discussion of additional risks relating to our international operations.
third-parties from time to time claim that we are infringing or misappropriating their intellectual property rights and we could suffer significant litigation expenses, losses or licensing expenses or be prevented from selling products or services.
from time to time, we receive notices from third parties alleging intellectual property infringement or misappropriation of third parties' intellectual property and cannot be certain that the conduct of our business does not and will not infringe or misappropriate the intellectual property rights of others. disputes or litigations regarding intellectual property can be costly and time-consuming to defend due to the complexity of many of our technologies and the uncertainty of intellectual property litigation. our intellectual property portfolio may not be useful in asserting a counterclaim, or negotiating a license, in response to a claim of infringement or misappropriation. in addition, as a result of such claims of infringement or misappropriation, we could lose our rights to critical technology, be unable to license critical technology or sell critical products and services, be required to pay substantial damages or license fees with respect to the infringed rights, be required to license technology or other intellectual property rights from others, be required to cease marketing, manufacturing or using certain products or be required to redesign, re-engineer or re-brand our products at substantial cost, any of which could adversely impact our business, including our competitive position, and financial statements. third-party intellectual property rights may also make it more difficult or expensive for us to meet market demand for particular product or design innovations. when we are required to seek licenses under patents or other intellectual property rights of others, we are not always able to acquire these licenses on acceptable terms, if at all. even if we successfully defend against claims of infringement or misappropriation, we may incur significant costs and diversion of management attention and resources, which could adversely affect our business and financial statements.
the u.s. government has certain rights to use and disclose some of the intellectual property that we license and could exclusively license it to a third-party if we fail to achieve practical application of the intellectual property.
certain technology licensed by us under agreements with third-party licensors is subject to government rights. government rights in inventions conceived or reduced to practice under a government-funded program can include a nonexclusive, royalty-free worldwide license to practice or have practiced such inventions for any governmental purpose. in addition, the u.s. government has the right to require us or our licensors (as applicable) to grant licenses which would be exclusive under any of such inventions to a third-party if they determine that: (1) adequate steps have not been taken to commercialize such inventions in a particular field of use; (2) such action is necessary to meet public health or safety needs; or (3) such action is necessary to meet requirements for public use under federal regulations. further, the government rights include the right to use and disclose, without limitation, technical data relating to licensed technology that was developed in whole or in part at government expense.
defects and unanticipated use or inadequate disclosure with respect to our products or services, or allegations thereof, can adversely affect our business, reputation and financial statements.
manufacturing or design defects or "bugs" in, unanticipated use of, safety or quality issues (or the perception of such issues) with respect to, "off label" use of, or inadequate disclosure of risks relating to the use of products and services that we make or sell (including items that we source from third-parties) can lead to personal injury, death, property damage, loss of profits or other liability. these events can lead to recalls or safety alerts, result in the removal of a product or service from the market and result in product liability or similar claims being brought against us. recalls, removals and product liability and similar claims (regardless of their validity or ultimate outcome) result in significant costs, as well as negative publicity and damage to our reputation that could reduce demand for our products and services. our business can also be affected by studies of the utilization, safety and efficacy of medical device products and components that are conducted by industry participants, government agencies and others. any of the above can result in the discontinuation of marketing of such products in one or more countries and give rise to claims for damages from persons who believe they have been injured as a result of product issues, including claims by individuals or groups seeking to represent a class.
the manufacture of many of our products is a highly exacting and complex process, and if we directly or indirectly encounter problems manufacturing products, our reputation, business and financial statements could suffer.
the manufacture of many of our products is a highly exacting and complex process, due in part to strict regulatory requirements. problems can arise during manufacturing for a variety of reasons, including equipment malfunction, failure to follow specific protocols and procedures, problems with raw materials, natural disasters and environmental factors, and if not discovered before the product is released to market can result in recalls and product liability exposure. because of the time required to approve and license certain regulated manufacturing facilities and other stringent regulations of the fda and similar agencies regarding the manufacture of certain of our products, an alternative manufacturer is not always available on a timely basis to replace such production capacity. any of these manufacturing problems could result in significant costs, liability and lost revenue, loss of market share as well as negative publicity and damage to our reputation that could reduce demand for our products.
adverse changes in our relationships with, or the financial condition, performance, purchasing patterns or inventory levels of, key distributors and other channel partners can adversely affect our financial statements.
certain of our businesses sell a significant amount of their products to or through key distributors and other channel partners that have valuable relationships with customers and end-users. some of these distributors and other partners also sell our competitors' products or compete with us directly, and if they favor competing products for any reason they may fail to market our products effectively. adverse changes in our relationships with these distributors and other partners, reduction or discontinuation of their purchases from us or adverse developments in their financial condition, performance or purchasing patterns, can adversely affect our business and financial statements.  the levels of inventory maintained by our distributors and other channel partners, and changes in those levels, also impacts our results of operations in any given period. in addition, the consolidation of distributors and customers in certain of our served industries can adversely impact our business and financial statements.
certain of our businesses rely on relationships with collaborative partners and other third-parties for development, supply and marketing of certain products and potential products, and such collaborative partners or other third-parties could fail to perform sufficiently.
we believe that for certain of our businesses, success in penetrating target markets depends in part on their ability to develop and maintain collaborative relationships with other companies. relying on collaborative relationships is risky because, among other things, our collaborative partners may (1) not devote sufficient resources to the success of our collaborations; (2) fail to obtain regulatory approvals necessary to continue the collaborations in a timely manner; (3) be acquired by other companies and terminate our collaborative partnership or become insolvent; (4) compete with us; (5) disagree with us on key details of the collaborative relationship; (6) have insufficient capital resources; and (7) decline to renew existing collaborations on acceptable terms. because these and other factors may be beyond our control, the development or commercialization of our products involved in collaborative partnerships may be delayed or otherwise adversely affected. if we or any of our collaborative partners terminate a collaborative arrangement, we may be required to devote additional resources to product development and commercialization or we may need to cancel some development programs, which could adversely affect our business and financial statements.
our financial results are subject to fluctuations in the cost and availability of commodities that we use in our operations.
as discussed in "item 1. business-materials," our manufacturing and other operations employ a wide variety of components, raw materials and other commodities, including metallic-based components, electronic components, chemicals, plastics and other petroleum-based products. prices for and availability of these components, raw materials and other commodities have fluctuated significantly in the past. any sustained interruption in the supply of these items could adversely affect our business. in addition, due to the highly competitive nature of the industries that we serve, the cost-containment efforts of our customers and the terms of certain contracts we are party to, when commodity prices rise we are not always able to pass along cost increases through higher prices. if we are unable to fully recover higher commodity costs through price increases or offset these increases through cost reductions, or if there is a time delay between the increase in costs and our ability to recover or offset these costs, our margins and profitability could decline and our financial statements could be adversely affected.
if we cannot adjust our manufacturing capacity or the purchases required for our manufacturing activities to reflect changes in market conditions and customer demand, our profitability may suffer. in addition, our reliance upon sole or limited sources of supply for certain materials, components and services can cause production interruptions, delays and inefficiencies.
we purchase materials, components and equipment from third-parties for use in our manufacturing operations, including metallic-based components, electronic components, chemicals, plastics and other petroleum-based products. our profitability could be adversely impacted if we are unable to adjust our purchases to reflect changes in customer demand and market fluctuations, including those caused by seasonality or cyclicality. during a market upturn, suppliers from time to time extend lead times, limit supplies or increase prices. if we cannot purchase sufficient products at competitive prices and quality and on a timely enough basis to meet increasing demand, we may not be able to satisfy market demand, product shipments may be delayed, our costs may increase or we may breach our contractual commitments and incur liabilities. conversely, in order to secure supplies for the production of products, we sometimes enter into noncancelable purchase commitments with vendors, which can impact our ability to adjust our inventory to reflect declining market demands. if demand for our products is less than we expect, we may experience additional excess and obsolete inventories and be forced to incur additional charges and our profitability may suffer.
in addition, some of our businesses purchase certain requirements from sole or limited source suppliers for reasons of quality assurance, regulatory requirements, cost effectiveness, availability or uniqueness of design. if these or other suppliers encounter financial, operating or other difficulties or if our relationship with them changes, we might not be able to quickly establish or qualify replacement sources of supply. the supply chains for our businesses can also be disrupted by supplier capacity constraints, bankruptcy or exiting of the business for other reasons, decreased availability of key raw materials or commodities and external events such as natural disasters, pandemic health issues, war, terrorist actions, governmental actions and legislative or regulatory changes. any of these factors can result in production interruptions, delays, extended lead times and inefficiencies.
because we cannot always immediately adapt our production capacity and related cost structures to changing market conditions, at times our manufacturing capacity exceeds or falls short of our production requirements. any or all of these problems can result in the loss of customers, provide an opportunity for competing products to gain market acceptance and otherwise adversely affect our financial statements.
changes in governmental regulations can reduce demand for our products or services or increase our expenses.
we compete in markets in which we and our customers must comply with supranational, federal, state, local and other jurisdictional regulations, such as regulations governing health and safety, the environment, food and drugs, privacy and electronic communications. we develop, configure and market our products and services to meet customer needs created by these regulations. these regulations are complex, change frequently, have tended to become more stringent over time and may be inconsistent across jurisdictions. any significant change in any of these regulations (or in the interpretation or application thereof) can reduce demand for, increase our costs of producing or delay the introduction of new or modified products and services, or restrict our existing activities, products and services. for example, a number of our products and services are marketed to the pharmaceutical and related industries for use in discovering and developing drugs and therapies. changes in the u.s. fda's regulation of the drug discovery and development process can have an adverse effect on the demand for these products and services. in addition, in certain of our markets our growth depends in part upon the introduction of new regulations. in these markets, the delay or failure of governmental and other entities to adopt or enforce new regulations, the adoption of new regulations which our products and services are not positioned to address or the repeal of existing regulations, can adversely affect demand. in addition, regulatory deadlines can result in substantially different levels of demand for our products and services from period-to-period.
work stoppages, union and works council campaigns and other labor disputes could adversely impact our productivity and results of operations.
certain of our u.s. and non-u.s. employees are subject to collective labor arrangements. we are subject to potential work stoppages, union and works council campaigns and other labor disputes, any of which could adversely impact our financial statements and business, including our productivity and reputation.
international economic, political, legal, compliance and business factors could negatively affect our financial statements.
in 2019, approximately 63% of our sales were derived from customers outside the united states. in addition, many of our manufacturing operations, suppliers and employees are located outside the united states. since our growth strategy depends in part on our ability to further penetrate markets outside the united states and increase the localization of our products and services, we expect to continue to increase our sales and presence outside the united states, particularly in the high-growth markets. our international business (and particularly our business in high-growth markets) is subject to risks that are customarily encountered in non-u.s. operations, including:
•   interruption in the transportation of materials to us and finished goods to our customers;
•   local product preferences and product requirements;
•   changes in a country's or region's political or economic conditions, such as the devaluation of particular currencies;
•   trade protection measures, embargoes and import or export restrictions and requirements;
•   unexpected changes in laws or regulatory requirements, including changes in tax laws;

international business risks have in the past and may in the future negatively affect our financial statements, business, growth rate, competitive position, and financial condition.
for example, in 2019 we generated approximately 13% of our sales from china. accordingly, our business, financial condition and results of operations can be adversely influenced by political, economic and social conditions in china generally. additionally, china's government continues to play a significant role in regulating industry development by imposing industrial policies, and it maintains control over china's economic growth through setting monetary policy and determining treatment of particular industries or companies. further, considerable uncertainty exists regarding the long-term effects of the expansionary monetary and fiscal policies adopted by the central banks and financial authorities of some of the world's leading economies, including the united states and china. uncertainty or adverse changes to economic conditions in china or the policies of china's government or its laws and regulations can have a material adverse effect on the overall economic growth of china and can impact our business and operating results, reducing demand for our products and adversely affecting our financial statements, business, growth rate and competitive position and financial condition.
in addition, our global operations expose us to risks associated with public health crises and epidemics, such as the novel strain of coronavirus that recently originated in china (covid-19), which could adversely impact our operations, supply chains and distribution systems and reduce demand for our products and services.  while we believe the coronavirus may have a negative impact on our financial results, the impact is difficult to assess at this time.
significant developments stemming from the uk's referendum decision to exit the eu could have an adverse effect on us.
in a referendum on june 23, 2016, voters in the uk voted for the uk to exit the eu. the uk formally withdrew from the eu on january 31, 2020 with a transition period through december 31, 2020. during the transition period, the uk will continue to follow eu law and will negotiate with the eu on the terms of its relationship. as it stands, the terms and the nature of the uk's future relationship with the eu post-2020 are still being decided. this referendum and withdrawal has caused and may continue to cause political and economic uncertainty, including significant volatility in global stock markets and currency exchange rate fluctuations. if no agreement is reached by december 31, 2020, the uk's membership in the eu could terminate under a so-called "hard brexit". the effects of brexit will depend on many factors, including any agreements that the uk makes to retain access to eu markets either during a transitional period or more permanently.  brexit could lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations as the uk determines which eu laws to replace or replicate. in a "hard brexit" scenario, there could be increased costs from re-imposition of tariffs on trade between the uk and eu, shipping delays because of the need for customs inspections and procedures, and temporary shortages of certain goods. in addition, trade and investment between the uk, the eu, the united states and other countries will be impacted by the fact that the uk currently operates under the eu's tax treaties. the uk will need to negotiate its own tax and trade treaties with countries all over the world, which could take years to complete. we have manufacturing facilities in the uk, and, depending on the terms of brexit, we could become subject to export tariffs and regulatory restrictions that could increase the costs and time related to doing business in europe. additionally, brexit could result in the uk or the eu significantly altering its regulations affecting the clearance or approval of our products that are developed or manufactured in the uk. any new regulations could add time and expense to the conduct of our business, as well as the process by which our products receive regulatory approval in the uk, the eu and elsewhere. any of these factors could adversely affect customer demand, our relationships with customers and suppliers and our business and financial statements. as of december 31, 2019, the company had seven manufacturing facilities in the uk and the company's net investment in plant, property and equipment in the uk was $163 million. for the year ended december 31, 2019, less than 5% of our sales were derived from customers located in the uk, however, the impact of brexit could also impact our sales and operations outside the uk.
if we suffer loss to our facilities, supply chains, distribution systems or information technology systems due to catastrophe or other events, our operations could be seriously harmed.
our facilities, supply chains, distribution systems and information technology systems are subject to catastrophic loss due to fire, flood, earthquake, hurricane, public health crisis (including epidemics), war, terrorism or other natural or man-made disasters, such as the damage caused to our facilities by hurricane maria in puerto rico in september 2017. if any of these facilities, supply chains or systems were to experience a catastrophic loss, it could disrupt our operations, delay production and shipments, result in defective products or services, damage customer relationships and our reputation and result in legal exposure and large repair or replacement expenses. the third-party insurance coverage that we maintain will vary from time to time in both type and amount depending on cost, availability and our decisions regarding risk retention, and may be unavailable or insufficient to protect us against such losses.
our defined benefit pension plans are subject to financial market risks that could adversely affect our financial statements.
the performance of the financial markets and interest rates impact our defined benefit pension plan expenses and funding obligations. significant changes in market interest rates, decreases in the fair value of plan assets, investment losses on plan assets and changes in discount rates can increase our funding obligations and adversely impact our financial statements. in addition, upward pressure on the cost of providing health care coverage to current employees and retirees can increase our future funding obligations and adversely affect our financial statements.
item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ("md&a") is designed to provide a reader of danaher's financial statements with a narrative from the perspective of company management. the company's md&a is divided into five sections:
•   overview
•   liquidity and capital resources
•   critical accounting estimates
•   new accounting standards this discussion and analysis should be read along with danaher's audited financial statements and related notes thereto as of december 31, 2019 and 2018 and for each of the three years in the period ended december 31, 2019 included in this annual report.
unless otherwise indicated, all financial results in this report refer to continuing operations.
overview general refer to "item 1. business-general" for a discussion of danaher's strategic objectives and methodologies for delivering long-term shareholder value. danaher is a multinational business with global operations. during 2019, approximately 63% of danaher's sales were derived from customers outside the united states. as a diversified, global business, danaher's operations are affected by worldwide, regional and industry-specific economic and political factors. danaher's geographic and industry diversity, as well as the range of its products, software and services, help limit the impact of any one industry or the economy of any single country on its consolidated operating results. the company's individual businesses monitor key competitors and customers, including to the extent possible their sales, to gauge relative performance and the outlook for the future.
as a result of the company's geographic and industry diversity, the company faces a variety of opportunities and challenges, including rapid technological development (particularly with respect to computing, automation, artificial intelligence, mobile connectivity, communications and digitization) in most of the company's served markets, the expansion and evolution of opportunities in high-growth markets, trends and costs associated with a global labor force, consolidation of the company's competitors and increasing regulation. the company operates in a highly competitive business environment in most markets, and the company's long-term growth and profitability will depend in particular on its ability to expand its business in high-growth geographies and high-growth market segments, identify, consummate and integrate appropriate acquisitions, develop innovative and differentiated new products and services with higher gross profit margins, expand and improve the effectiveness of the company's sales force, continue to reduce costs and improve operating efficiency and quality, and effectively address the demands of an increasingly regulated global environment. the company is making significant investments, organically and through acquisitions, to address the rapid pace of technological change in its served markets and to globalize its manufacturing, research and development and customer-facing resources (particularly in high-growth markets) in order to be responsive to the company's customers throughout the world and improve the efficiency of the company's operations.
business performance consolidated sales for the year ended december 31, 2019 increased 5.0% as compared to 2018. while differences exist among the company's businesses, on an overall basis, demand for the company's products and services increased on a year-over-year basis in 2019 as compared to 2018. this demand, together with the company's continued investments in sales growth initiatives and the other business-specific factors discussed below, contributed to year-over-year core sales growth of 6.0% (for the definition of "core sales," refer to "-results of operations" below). geographically, both high-growth and developed markets contributed to year-over-year core sales growth during 2019. core sales in high-growth markets grew at a high-single digit rate in 2019 as compared to 2018 led by strength in china. high-growth markets represented approximately 32% of the company's total sales in 2019. core sales in developed markets grew at a mid-single digit rate in 2019 as compared to 2018 and were driven by north america and western europe.
the company's net earnings from continuing operations for the year ended december 31, 2019 totaled approximately $2.4 billion, or $3.26 per diluted share, compared to approximately $2.4 billion, or $3.39 per diluted share for the year ended december 31, 2018. net earnings attributable to common stockholders for the year ended december 31, 2019 totaled approximately $2.9 billion or $4.05 per diluted share compared to approximately $2.7 billion or $3.74 per diluted share for the year ended december 31, 2018. the gain on the disposition of envista, partially offset by the tax-related charges discussed below in "-results of operations-income taxes" are the primary reasons for the year-over-year increase in net earnings attributable to common stockholders and diluted earnings per share for the year ended december 31, 2019; refer to "-results of operations" for further discussion of year-over-year changes in net earnings and diluted earnings per share for the year ended december 31, 2019. refer to "results of operations-discontinued operations" for further discussion of the disposition of envista.
acquisitions and dispositions on february 25, 2019, the company entered into the ge biopharma purchase agreement with ge to acquire the ge biopharma business for a cash purchase price of approximately $21.0 billion, subject to certain adjustments, and the assumption of approximately $0.4 billion of pension liabilities. the ge biopharma business, to be known as cytiva following the closing of the acquisition, is a leading provider of instruments, consumables and software that support the research, discovery, process development and manufacturing workflows of biopharmaceutical drugs. based on preliminary unaudited financial information provided by ge, the ge biopharma business generated revenues of approximately $3.3 billion in 2019. though the timing of obtaining the final regulatory approvals necessary to close the ge biopharma acquisition is uncertain, the company continues to make progress with respect thereto and expects to close the transaction in the first quarter of 2020. the acquisition is expected to provide additional sales and earnings growth opportunities for the company's life sciences segment by expanding the business' geographic and product line diversity, including new product and service offerings that complement the company's current biologics workflow solutions. as a condition to obtaining certain regulatory approvals for the closing of the transaction, the company expects it will be required to divest certain of its existing product lines that in the aggregate generated revenues of approximately $170 million in 2019.
the company plans to finance the ge biopharma acquisition with approximately $3.0 billion of proceeds from the march 1, 2019 underwritten public offerings of its common stock and mcps, approximately $10.8 billion of proceeds from the issuance of euro-denominated and u.s. dollar-denominated long-term debt in the second half of 2019, and approximately $7.2 billion from the aggregate of cash on hand and proceeds from commercial paper borrowings. refer to note 11 in the consolidated financial statements for additional information related to the issuance of debt and to note 19 for additional information related to the march 1, 2019 public offerings.
during 2019, the company acquired five businesses for total consideration of $331 million in cash, net of cash acquired. the businesses acquired complement existing units of each of the company's three segments. the aggregate annual sales of these five businesses at the time of their respective acquisitions, in each case based on the company's revenues for its last completed fiscal year prior to the acquisition, were $72 million. in addition, in 2019 the company invested $241 million in non-marketable equity securities and a partnership.
for a discussion of the company's 2018 and 2017 acquisition and disposition activity, refer to "liquidity and capital resources-investing activities".
envista disposition on september 20, 2019, envista completed an underwritten ipo of 30.8 million shares of its common stock, (the "ipo"), which represented 19.4% of envista's outstanding shares at the time of the offering, at a public offering price of $22.00 per share. envista realized net proceeds of $643 million from the ipo, after deducting underwriting discounts and deal expenses.
in connection with the completion of the ipo, through a series of equity and other transactions, the company transferred its dental businesses to envista (the "separation"). in exchange, envista transferred consideration of approximately $2.0 billion to the company, which consisted primarily of the net proceeds from the ipo and approximately $1.3 billion of proceeds from envista's term debt financing. the excess of the net proceeds from the ipo over the net book value of the business transferred to envista was $60 million and was recorded in additional paid-in capital.
on december 18, 2019, danaher completed the disposition of its remaining 80.6% ownership of envista common stock through a split-off exchange offer, which resulted in danaher's repurchase of 22.9 million shares of danaher common stock in exchange for the remaining shares of envista common stock held by danaher (the "split-off"). the ipo, separation and split-off are collectively referred to as the "envista disposition". as a result, the company recognized a gain on the disposition of $451 million in the fourth quarter of 2019 equal to the difference between the fair value of the danaher common stock tendered in the exchange offer and the carrying value of envista common stock. the accounting requirements for reporting envista as a discontinued operation were met when the split-off was completed. accordingly, the consolidated financial statements for all periods presented reflect this business as a discontinued operation. for each period presented, the company allocated a portion of the consolidated interest expense to discontinued operations based on the ratio of the discontinued business' net assets to the
company's consolidated net assets. envista had revenues of approximately $2.6 billion in 2019 prior to the envista disposition and approximately $2.8 billion in 2018.
to effect the envista disposition, the company incurred $69 million in costs during the year ended december 31, 2019 which are reflected in earnings from discontinued operations, net of income taxes in the accompanying consolidated statements of earnings. these costs primarily relate to professional fees associated with preparation of regulatory filings and activities within finance, tax, legal and information technology functions as well as certain investment banking fees and tax costs.
refer to note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion.
uk's referendum decision to exit the eu in a referendum on june 23, 2016, voters approved for the uk to exit the eu. the uk formally withdrew from the eu on january 31, 2020 with a transition period through december 31, 2020. during the transition period, the uk will continue to follow eu law and will negotiate with the eu on the terms of its relationship post-2020. failure to complete negotiations by the implementation deadline of december 31, 2020 relating to brexit could result in the uk reverting to undesirable and adverse trade agreements with the eu. the nature of the uk's future relationship with the eu is still uncertain. the company continues to monitor the status of brexit and plan for potential impacts. as of december 31, 2019, the company had seven manufacturing facilities in the uk and the company's net investment in plant, property and equipment in the uk was $163 million. for the year ended december 31, 2019, less than 5% of the company's sales were derived from customers located in the uk, however, the impact of brexit could also impact the company's sales and operations outside the uk. to mitigate the potential impact of brexit on the import of goods to the uk, the company has increased its level of inventory within the uk. the ultimate impact of brexit on the company's financial results is uncertain. for additional information, refer to the "item 1a-risk factors" section of this annual report.
coronavirus for information on the potential impact of the coronavirus to the company's operations, refer to the "item 1a-risk factors" section of this annual report.
results of operations in this report, references to the non-gaap measure of core sales (also referred to as core revenues or sales/revenues from existing businesses) refer to sales from continuing operations calculated according to generally accepted accounting principles in the united states ("gaap") but excluding:
•   sales from acquired businesses; and
references to sales or operating profit attributable to acquisitions or acquired businesses refer to sales or operating profit, as applicable, from acquired businesses recorded prior to the first anniversary of the acquisition less the amount of sales and operating profit, as applicable, attributable to divested product lines not considered discontinued operations. the portion of revenue attributable to currency translation is calculated as the difference between:
•   the period-to-period change in revenue (excluding sales from acquired businesses); and
•   the period-to-period change in revenue (excluding sales from acquired businesses) after applying current period foreign exchange rates to the prior year period.
core sales growth should be considered in addition to, and not as a replacement for or superior to, sales, and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. management believes that reporting the non-gaap financial measure of core sales growth provides useful information to investors by helping identify underlying growth trends in danaher's business and facilitating comparisons of danaher's revenue performance with its performance in prior and future periods and to danaher's peers. management also uses core sales growth to measure the company's operating and financial performance, and uses it as one of the performance measures in the company's executive short-term cash incentive program. the company excludes the effect of currency translation from core sales because currency translation is not under management's control, is subject to volatility and can obscure underlying business trends, and excludes the effect of acquisitions and divestiture-related items because the nature, size, timing and number of acquisitions and divestitures can vary dramatically from period-to-period and between the company and its peers and can also obscure underlying business trends and make comparisons of long-term performance difficult.
throughout this discussion, references to sales volume refer to the impact of both price and unit sales and references to productivity improvements generally refer to improved cost efficiencies resulting from the ongoing application of dbs.

•   higher 2018 sales volumes from existing businesses and incremental year-over-year cost savings associated with the continued productivity improvement initiatives taken in 2018 and 2017, net of incremental year-over-year costs associated with various new product development, sales and marketing growth investments and the effect of year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates - 125 basis points
•   restructuring, impairment and other related charges related to discontinuing a product line in 2017 - 130 basis points
2018 vs. 2017 operating profit margin comparisons were unfavorably impacted by:
•   2017 gain on resolution of acquisition-related matters - 25 basis points environmental & applied solutions the company's environmental & applied solutions segment offers products and services that help protect important resources and keep global food and water supplies safe. the company's water quality business provides instrumentation, consumables, software, services and disinfection systems to help analyze, treat and manage the quality of ultra-pure, potable, industrial, waste, ground, source and ocean water in residential, commercial, municipal, industrial and natural resource applications. the company's product identification business provides equipment, software, services and consumables for various color and appearance management, packaging design and quality management, packaging converting, printing, marking, coding and traceability applications for consumer, pharmaceutical and industrial products.

price increases in the segment contributed 1.5% to sales growth on a year-over-year basis during 2018 as compared with 2017 and are reflected as a component of the change in core revenue growth.
core sales in the segment's water quality businesses grew at a high-single digit rate during 2018 as compared with 2017. year-over-year core sales in the analytical instrumentation product line increased, led by continued demand in the industrial and municipal end-markets. geographically, year-over-year core revenue growth in the analytical instrumentation product line was driven by increased demand across all major geographies, led by china, north america and western europe. year-over-year core revenue growth in the business' chemical treatment solutions product line was driven by demand in the commercial and industrial, mining and primary metals end-markets. geographically, year-over-year core revenue growth in the chemical treatment solutions product line was driven by north america and latin america. core sales in the business' ultraviolet water disinfection product line grew on a year-over-year basis due primarily to demand in the municipal and consumer end-markets. geographically, year-over year core revenue growth in the ultraviolet water disinfection product line was led by north america and china, partially offset by softer demand in western europe.
core sales in the segment's product identification businesses grew at a mid-single digit rate during 2018 as compared with 2017. year-over-year core revenue growth for marking and coding equipment and related consumables was driven by demand across all major end-markets and in all major geographies, particularly western europe, north america and high-growth markets. demand for the business' packaging and color solutions decreased slightly year-over-year. geographically, core sales for packaging and color solutions decreased in north america and high-growth markets, partially offset by increased demand in western europe.
operating profit margins declined 10 basis points during 2018 as compared to 2017. the following factors impacted year-over-year operating profit margin comparisons:
2018 vs. 2017 operating profit margin comparisons were favorably impacted by:
•   higher 2018 sales volumes, incremental year-over-year cost savings associated with the continued productivity improvement initiatives taken in 2018 and 2017, and improved pricing, net of incremental year-over-year costs associated with various new product development and sales and marketing growth investments - 35 basis points
2018 vs. 2017 operating profit margin comparisons were unfavorably impacted by:
•   the incremental net dilutive effect in 2018 of acquired businesses - 45 basis points cost of sales and gross profit year ended december 31
gross profit             $9,983.7                $9,505.3                $8,571.3
gross profit margin          55.7    %               55.8    %               55.2    %
the year-over-year increase in cost of sales during 2019 as compared with 2018 was due primarily to the impact of higher year-over-year sales volumes, including sales from recently acquired businesses, product mix, and higher freight and tariff costs, partially offset by increased leverage of certain manufacturing costs and incremental year-over-year cost savings associated with the continued productivity improvement initiatives taken in 2019 and 2018.
the year-over-year increase in cost of sales during 2018 as compared with 2017, was due primarily to the impact of higher year-over-year sales volumes, including sales from recently acquired businesses, partially offset by incremental year-over-year cost savings associated with the continued productivity improvement initiatives taken in 2018 and 2017 and charges associated with the company's strategic decision to discontinue a product line in its diagnostics segment in 2017. cost of goods sold also increased in 2018 as a result of higher tariffs.
the slight year-over-year decrease in gross profit margins during 2019 as compared with 2018 was due primarily to the impact of product mix and higher freight and tariff costs, partially offset by the impact of higher year-over-year sales volumes, including sales from recently acquired businesses, increased leverage of certain manufacturing costs and incremental year-over-year cost savings associated with the continued productivity improvement initiatives taken in 2019 and 2018.
the year-over-year increase in gross profit margins during 2018 as compared with 2017 was due primarily to the favorable impact of higher year-over-year sales volumes, including sales from recently acquired businesses, increased leverage of certain manufacturing costs and incremental year-over-year cost savings associated with the continued productivity improvement initiatives taken in 2018 and 2017. gross margin improvements were partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange rates in 2018.
research and development ("r&amp;d") expenses                  (1,126.0    )           (1,059.2    )             (956.4    )
sg&a expenses as a percentage of sales declined 40 basis points on a year-over-year basis for 2019 compared with 2018. the decline was driven by increased leverage of the company's general and administrative cost base resulting from higher 2019 sales volumes and continuing productivity improvements taken in 2019 and 2018, partially offset by continued investments in sales and marketing growth initiatives and transaction costs and integration preparation costs associated with the anticipated ge biopharma acquisition, which increased sg&a as a percentage of sales by approximately 50 basis points during 2019.
sg&a expenses as a percentage of sales declined 90 basis points on a year-over-year basis for 2018 compared with 2017. the decline was driven by increased leverage of the company's general and administrative cost base resulting from higher 2018 sales volumes, continuing productivity improvements taken in 2018 and 2017, and the impact of the restructuring, impairment and other related charges incurred in 2017 associated with the company's strategic decision to discontinue a product line in its diagnostics segment. the decline in sg&a expenses as a percentage of sales was partially offset by higher relative spending levels at recently acquired companies and continued investments in sales and marketing growth initiatives.
r&d expenses (consisting principally of internal and contract engineering personnel costs) as a percentage of sales increased slightly in 2019 as compared with 2018, as year-over-year increases in the company's investments in new product development initiatives approximated the year-over-year increase in sales. r&d expenses as a percentage of sales were flat in 2018 as compared to 2017.
as described in note 1 and note 13 to the consolidated financial statements, in the first quarter of 2018, the company adopted accounting standards update ("asu") asu no. 2017-07, compensation- retirement benefits (topic 715): improving the presentation of net periodic pension cost and net periodic postretirement benefit cost. the asu requires the company to disaggregate the service cost component from the other components of net periodic benefit costs and requires the company to present the other components of net periodic benefit cost in other income, net. the asu required application on a retrospective basis. the other components of net periodic benefit costs included in other income, net for the years ended december 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 were net gains of $12 million, $35 million and $31 million, respectively. the company's net periodic pension cost for the year-ended december 31, 2019 includes a settlement loss of $7 million pre-tax ($6 million after-tax, or $0.01 per diluted share) as a result of the transfer of a portion of its non-u.s. pension liabilities related to one defined benefit plan to a third party.
during 2017, the company received $138 million of cash proceeds and recorded $22 million in short-term other receivables from the sale of certain marketable equity securities during 2017. the company recorded a pretax gain related to this sale of $73 million ($46 million after-tax or $0.06 per diluted share).
loss on early extinguishment of borrowings in the fourth quarter of 2019, the company redeemed the $500 million aggregate principal amount of 2.4% senior unsecured notes due 2020 and the $375 million aggregate principal amount of 5.0% senior unsecured notes due 2020. the company recorded a loss on extinguishment of these borrowings, net of certain deferred gains, of $7 million ($5 million after-tax or $0.01 per diluted share). the company funded the redemption using a portion of the cash distribution it received in connection with the envista disposition.
interest costs interest expense of $109 million for 2019 was $28 million lower than in 2018, due primarily to the impact of the company's cross-currency swap derivative contracts and the repayment of certain outstanding borrowings in 2019, partially offset by interest expense from 2019 debt issuances. for a further description of the company's debt as of december 31, 2019 refer to note 11 to the consolidated financial statements. interest expense of $137 million in 2018 was $3 million lower than the 2017 interest expense of $140 million due primarily to the decrease in interest costs as a result of the repayment of certain outstanding borrowings in the third quarter of 2018 and the second and fourth quarters of 2017, lower average outstanding u.s. commercial paper borrowings during 2018 compared to 2017, and the impact of foreign exchange rates in 2018 as compared to 2017, partially offset by the cost of additional non-u.s. debt issued during 2017.
in january 2019, the company entered into approximately $1.9 billion of cross-currency swap derivative contracts on its u.s. dollar-denominated bonds to effectively convert the company's u.s. dollar-denominated bonds to obligations denominated in danish kroner, japanese yen, euro and swiss franc and reduce the interest rate from the stated interest rates on the u.s. dollar-denominated debt to the interest rates of the swaps. as of december 31, 2019, approximately $1.0 billion of the cross-currency swap derivative contracts remained outstanding.
the company used interest rate swap agreements to hedge the variability in cash flows due to changes in benchmark interest rates related to a portion of the u.s. debt the company issued to fund the ge biopharma acquisition. the interest rate swap agreements are agreements in which the company agrees to pay a fixed interest rate based on the rate specified in the agreement in exchange for receiving a floating interest rate from a third-party bank based upon a specified benchmark interest rate. in june 2019, the company entered into interest rate swap agreements with a notional amount of $850 million. these contracts, which were settled in november 2019, effectively fixed the interest rate for a portion of the company's u.s. dollar-denominated debt issued in november 2019 equal to the notional amount of the swaps to the rate specified in the interest rate swap agreements. the changes in the fair value of these instruments resulting from the changes in interest rates were recorded as a loss of $38 million in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders' equity prior to the issuance of the debt and are subsequently being reclassified to interest expense over the life of the related debt.
income taxes general income tax expense and deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect management's assessment of future taxes expected to be paid on items reflected in the company's consolidated financial statements. the company records the tax effect of discrete items and items that are reported net of their tax effects in the period in which they occur.
the company's effective tax rate can be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with different statutory tax rates (including as a result of business acquisitions and dispositions), changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, accruals related to contingent tax liabilities and period-to-period changes in such accruals, the results of audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns (as further discussed below), the expiration of statutes of limitations, the implementation of tax planning strategies, tax rulings, court decisions, settlements with tax authorities and changes in tax laws and regulations, such as the tcja and legislative policy changes that may result from the oecd's initiative on base erosion and profit shifting. for a description of the tax treatment of earnings that are planned to be reinvested indefinitely outside the united states, refer to "-liquidity and capital resources-cash and cash requirements" below.
the amount of income taxes the company pays is subject to ongoing audits by federal, state and foreign tax authorities, which often result in proposed assessments. management performs a comprehensive review of its global tax positions on a quarterly basis. based on these reviews, the results of discussions and resolutions of matters with certain tax authorities, tax rulings and court decisions and the expiration of statutes of limitations, reserves for contingent tax liabilities are accrued or adjusted as necessary. for a discussion of risks related to these and other tax matters, refer to "item 1a. risk factors".
on december 22, 2017, the tcja was enacted, substantially changing the u.s. tax system. under the sec staff accounting bulletin no. 118 ("sab no. 118") guidance, for the year ended december 31, 2017, the company recorded provisional amounts in earnings for the enactment of the tcja and during 2018, the company completed its accounting for the tcja based on the company's interpretation of the new tax regulations and related guidance issued by the u.s. department of the treasury and the irs.
the tcja imposes tax on u.s. shareholders for global intangible low-taxed income ("gilti") earned by certain foreign subsidiaries. the company has elected the period cost method for its accounting for gilti.
due to the complexity and recent issuance of these tax regulations, management's interpretations of the impact of these rules could be subject to challenge by the taxing authorities.
year-over-year changes in the tax provision and effective tax rate year ended december 31
the company's effective tax rate for 2019, 2018 and 2017 differs from the u.s. federal statutory rates of 21.0% in 2019 and 2018 and 35.0% in 2017, due principally to the company's earnings outside the united states that are indefinitely reinvested and taxed at rates different than the u.s. federal statutory rate. in addition:
•   the effective tax rate of 26.4% in 2019 includes 650 basis points of net tax charges related primarily to changes in estimates associated with prior period uncertain tax positions, audit settlements, and envista disposition costs, net of the release of reserves for uncertain tax positions due to the expiration of statutes of limitation, release of valuation
allowances associated with certain foreign tax credits, tax benefits resulting from changes in tax law and excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation.
•   the effective tax rate of 18.8% in 2018 includes 120 basis points of tax benefits primarily related to the release of reserves upon the expiration of statutes of limitation, audit settlements and release of a valuation allowance in a certain foreign tax jurisdiction. these tax benefits were partially offset by additional provisions related to completing the accounting for the enactment of the tcja and tax costs directly related to reorganization activities associated with the envista disposition.
•   the effective tax rate of 14.6% in 2017 includes 560 basis points of net tax benefits due to the revaluation of deferred tax liabilities from 35.0% to 21.0% due to the tcja and the release of reserves upon statute of limitation expiration, partially offset by income tax expense related to the transition tax on foreign earnings due to the tcja and changes in estimates associated with prior period uncertain tax positions.
the company conducts business globally, and files numerous consolidated and separate income tax returns in the u.s. federal, state and foreign jurisdictions. the non-u.s. countries in which the company has a significant presence include china, denmark, germany, singapore, switzerland and the united kingdom. the company believes that a change in the statutory tax rate of any individual foreign country would not have a material effect on the company's consolidated financial statements given the geographic dispersion of the company's taxable income.
the company and its subsidiaries are routinely examined by various domestic and international taxing authorities. the irs has completed substantially all of the examinations of the company's federal income tax returns through 2011 and is currently examining certain of the company's federal income tax returns for 2012 through 2017. in addition, the company has subsidiaries in austria, belgium, canada, china, denmark, france, germany, hong kong, india, italy, japan, korea, switzerland, the united kingdom and various other countries, states and provinces that are currently under audit for years ranging from 2004 through 2018.
in the fourth quarter of 2018 and the first quarter of 2019, the irs proposed significant adjustments to the company's taxable income for the years 2012 through 2015 with respect to the deferral of tax on certain premium income related to the company's self-insurance programs. for income tax purposes, the recognition of premium income has been deferred in accordance with u.s. tax laws related to insurance. the irs is challenging the deferral of premiums for certain types of the company's self-insurance policies. the proposed adjustments would increase the company's taxable income over the 2012 through 2015 period by approximately $2.7 billion. management believes the positions the company has taken in its u.s. tax returns are in accordance with the relevant tax laws and intends to vigorously defend these positions. due to the enactment of the tcja in 2017 and the resulting reduction in the u.s. corporate tax rate for years after 2017, the company revalued its deferred tax liabilities related to the temporary differences associated with this deferred premium income from 35.0% to 21.0%. if the company is not successful in defending these assessments, the taxes owed to the irs may be computed under the previous 35.0% statutory tax rate and the company may be required to revalue the related deferred tax liabilities from 21.0% to 35.0%, which in addition to any interest due on the amounts assessed, would require a charge to future earnings. the ultimate resolution of this matter is uncertain, could take many years and could result in a material adverse impact to the company's financial statements, including its cash flows and effective tax rate.
tax authorities in denmark have raised significant issues related to interest accrued by certain of the company's subsidiaries. on december 10, 2013, the company received assessments from the danish tax authority ("skat") of approximately dkk 1.8 billion (approximately $266 million based on exchange rates as of december 31, 2019) including interest through december 31, 2019, imposing withholding tax relating to interest accrued in denmark on borrowings from certain of the company's subsidiaries for the years 2004-2009. the company appealed these assessments to the danish national tax tribunal in 2014. the appeal is pending, awaiting the final outcome of other, preceding withholding tax cases that were appealed to the danish courts and subsequently to the court of justice of the european union ("cjeu"). in february 2019, the cjeu decided several of these cases and ruled that the exemption of interest payments from withholding taxes provided in the applicable eu directive should be denied where taxpayers use the directive for abusive or fraudulent purposes, and that it is up to the national courts to make this determination. this decision of the cjeu now awaits application by the danish high court in the other, preceding withholding tax cases.
skat has maintained a similar position related to withholding tax on interest accrued in denmark on borrowings from certain of the company's subsidiaries with respect to tax years 2010-2012 and 2013-2015. on august 27, 2019 and december 16, 2019, the company received assessments for these matters of approximately dkk 1.1 billion including interest through december 31, 2019 (approximately $159 million based on the exchange rate as of december 31, 2019) for tax years 2010-2012 and dkk 751 million including interest through december 31, 2019 (approximately $113 million based on the exchange rate as of december 31, 2019) for tax years 2013-2015, respectively. the company is appealing these assessments as well.
management believes the positions the company has taken in denmark are in accordance with the relevant tax laws and is vigorously defending its positions. the company intends on pursuing this matter through the danish high court should the appeal to the danish national tax tribunal be unsuccessful. the company will continue to monitor decisions of both the danish courts and the cjeu and evaluate the impact of these court rulings on the company's tax positions in denmark. the ultimate resolution of this matter is uncertain, could take many years, and could result in a material adverse impact to the company's financial statements, including its cash flow and effective tax rate.
the company expects its 2020 effective tax rate to be approximately 19.5%. any future legislative changes in the united states including potential tax reform in other jurisdictions, could cause the company's effective tax rate to differ from this estimate. refer to note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information related to income taxes.
discontinued operations as further discussed in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements, discontinued operations include the results of envista which was disposed of during the fourth quarter of 2019 as well as an income tax benefit in 2017 related to the fortive businesses that were disposed of during the third quarter of 2016.
in 2019, earnings from discontinued operations, net of income taxes, were $576 million and reflect the operating results of envista prior to the envista disposition and a gain on the disposition of envista of $451 million, net of certain costs associated with the envista disposition including costs related to establishing envista as a stand-alone entity and legal, accounting and investment banking fees. in 2018 and 2017, earnings from discontinued operations, net of income taxes, were $245 million and $320 million, respectively, and reflect the operations of envista as well as a $22 million income tax benefit in 2017 related to the release of previously provided reserves associated with uncertain tax positions on certain danaher tax returns which were jointly filed with fortive entities. these reserves were released due to the expiration of statutes of limitations for those returns. all fortive entity-related balances are included in the income tax benefit related to discontinued operations for the year ended december 31, 2017.
comprehensive income comprehensive income increased by approximately $726 million in 2019 as compared to 2018, primarily due to a decrease in losses from foreign currency translation adjustments in 2019 compared to 2018 and higher net earnings (including those attributable to discontinued operations) partially offset by an increase in losses from pension and postretirement plan benefit adjustments in 2019 compared to 2018 and losses from cash flow hedge adjustments in 2019.  the company recorded a foreign currency translation loss of $75 million for 2019 compared to a translation loss of $632 million for 2018. the company recorded a pension and postretirement plan benefit loss of $90 million for 2019 compared to a loss of $13 million for 2018. the company recorded losses from cash flow hedge adjustments in 2019 of $113 million.
comprehensive income decreased by approximately $1.5 billion in 2018 as compared to 2017, primarily due to a loss from foreign currency translation adjustments in 2018 compared to a gain in 2017 and a loss from pension and postretirement plan benefit adjustments in 2018 as compared to a gain in 2017, partially offset by higher net earnings (including those attributable to discontinued operations) and a decrease in unrealized losses on available-for-sale securities in 2018 compared to 2017. the company recorded a foreign currency translation loss of $632 million for 2018 compared to a translation gain of $976 million for 2017. the company recorded a pension and postretirement plan benefit loss of $13 million in 2018 compared to a gain of $71 million in 2017.
financial instruments and risk management the company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, equity prices and commodity prices as well as credit risk, each of which could impact its consolidated financial statements. the company generally addresses its exposure to these risks through its normal operating and financing activities. the company also periodically uses derivative financial instruments to manage foreign exchange risks and interest rate risks. in addition, the company's broad-based business activities help to reduce the impact that volatility in any particular area or related areas may have on its operating profit as a whole.
interest rate risk the company manages interest cost using a mixture of fixed-rate and variable-rate debt. a change in interest rates on fixed rate long-term debt impacts the fair value of the debt but not the company's earnings or cash flow because the interest on such debt is fixed. generally, the fair market value of fixed-rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. as of december 31, 2019, an increase of 100 basis points in interest rates would have decreased the fair value of the company's fixed-rate long-term debt (excluding the lyons, which have not been included in this calculation as the value of this convertible debt is primarily derived from the value of its underlying common stock) by approximately $1.7 billion.
as of december 31, 2019, the company's variable-rate debt obligations consisted primarily of euro-based commercial paper borrowings (refer to note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding the company's outstanding commercial paper balances as of december 31, 2019). as a result, the company's primary interest rate exposure results from changes in short-term interest rates. as these shorter duration obligations mature, the company may issue additional short-term commercial paper obligations to refinance all or part of these borrowings. in 2019, the average annual interest rate associated with outstanding commercial paper borrowings was approximately negative 19 basis points. a hypothetical increase of this average to negative 12 basis points would have increased the company's annual interest expense by $2 million. the hypothetical increase used is the actual amount by which the company's commercial paper interest rates fluctuated during 2019.
refer to "results of operations-interest costs" for discussion of the company's cross-currency swap derivative contracts and interest rate swap agreements.
currency exchange rate risk the company faces transactional exchange rate risk from transactions with customers in countries outside the united states and from intercompany transactions between affiliates. transactional exchange rate risk arises from the purchase and sale of goods and services in currencies other than danaher's functional currency or the functional currency of its applicable subsidiary. the company also faces translational exchange rate risk related to the translation of financial statements of its foreign operations into u.s. dollars, danaher's functional currency. costs incurred and sales recorded by subsidiaries operating outside of the united states are translated into u.s. dollars using exchange rates effective during the respective period. as a result, the company is exposed to movements in the exchange rates of various currencies against the u.s. dollar. in particular, the company has more sales in european currencies than it has expenses in those currencies. therefore, when european currencies strengthen or weaken against the u.s. dollar, operating profits are increased or decreased, respectively. the effect of a change in currency exchange rates on the company's net investment in international subsidiaries is reflected in the accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) component of stockholders' equity.
currency exchange rates negatively impacted 2019 reported sales by 2.0% on a year-over-year basis, primarily as a result of the u.s. dollar strengthening against other major currencies. if the exchange rates in effect as of december 31, 2019 were to prevail throughout 2020, currency exchange rates would slightly increase 2020 estimated sales relative to 2019 sales. strengthening of the u.s. dollar against other major currencies compared to the exchange rates in effect as of december 31, 2019 would adversely impact the company's sales and results of operations on an overall basis. any weakening of the u.s. dollar against other major currencies compared to the exchange rates in effect as of december 31, 2019 would positively impact the company's sales and results of operations.
the company has generally accepted the exposure to exchange rate movements without using derivative financial instruments to manage this transactional exchange risk, although the company has used foreign currency-denominated debt and cross-currency swaps to hedge a portion of its net investments in foreign operations against adverse movements in exchange rates. both positive and negative movements in currency exchange rates against the u.s. dollar will continue to affect the reported amount of sales and net earnings in the company's consolidated financial statements. in addition, the company has assets and liabilities held in foreign currencies. a 10% depreciation in major currencies relative to the u.s. dollar as of december 31, 2019 would have reduced foreign currency-denominated net assets and stockholders' equity by approximately $830 million. in 2019, the company entered into approximately $1.9 billion of cross-currency swap derivative contracts on its u.s. dollar-denominated bonds to hedge its net investment in foreign operations against adverse changes in the exchange rates between the u.s. dollar and the danish kroner, japanese yen, euro and the swiss franc. these contracts effectively convert the company's u.s. dollar-denominated bonds to obligations denominated in danish kroner, japanese yen, euro and swiss franc, and partially offset the impact of changes in currency rates on foreign currency-denominated net assets during the term of the swap. as of december 31, 2019, approximately $1.0 billion of the cross-currency swap derivative contracts remained outstanding. the company also uses cross-currency swap derivative contracts to hedge u.s. dollar-denominated long-term debt issuances in a foreign subsidiary whose functional currency is the euro against adverse movements in exchange rates between the u.s. dollar and the euro. in november 2019, the company entered into cross-currency swap derivative contracts with respect to approximately $4.0 billion of its u.s. dollar-denominated bonds and all of these derivative contracts remained outstanding as of december 31, 2019.
equity price risk the company's investment portfolio from time to time includes publicly-traded equity securities that are sensitive to fluctuations in market price, though as of december 31, 2019, the company held no available-for-sale marketable equity securities. the company holds non-marketable equity investments in privately held companies that may be impacted by equity price risks or other factors. these non-marketable equity investments are accounted for under the fair value alternative method with changes in fair value recorded in earnings. volatility in the equity markets or other fair value considerations could affect the value of these investments and require charges or gains to be recognized in earnings.
commodity price risk for a discussion of risks relating to commodity prices, refer to "item 1a. risk factors."
credit risk the company is exposed to potential credit losses in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to its financial instruments. financial instruments that potentially subject the company to credit risk consist of cash and temporary investments, receivables from customers and derivatives. the company places cash and temporary investments with various high-quality financial institutions throughout the world and exposure is limited at any one institution. although the company typically does not obtain collateral or other security to secure these obligations, it does regularly monitor the third-party depository institutions that hold its cash and cash equivalents. the company's emphasis is primarily on safety and liquidity of principal and secondarily on maximizing yield on those funds.
in addition, concentrations of credit risk arising from receivables from customers are limited due to the diversity of the company's customers. the company's businesses perform credit evaluations of their customers' financial conditions as deemed appropriate and also obtain collateral or other security when deemed appropriate.
the company enters into derivative transactions infrequently and typically with high-quality financial institutions, so that exposure at any one institution is limited.
liquidity and capital resources management assesses the company's liquidity in terms of its ability to generate cash to fund its operating, investing and financing activities. the company continues to generate substantial cash from operating activities and forecasts that its operating cash flow and other sources of liquidity will be sufficient to allow it to continue investing in existing businesses, consummating strategic acquisitions and investments, paying interest and servicing debt and managing its capital structure on a short and long-term basis. in addition, as discussed in further detail above, the company received approximately $2.0 billion of cash from envista as consideration for the transfer of the company's dental businesses to envista, a portion of which consideration the company used to redeem certain of the company's outstanding indebtedness in the fourth quarter of 2019.
following is an overview of the company's cash flows and liquidity for the years ended december 31:

•   operating cash flows from continuing operations increased $13 million, or less than 1%, during 2019 as compared to 2018, due primarily to higher net earnings, which included higher noncash charges for depreciation, amortization, and stock compensation, and the impact of a noncash discrete income tax charge in 2019, net of higher cash used for funding trade accounts receivable, inventories and trade accounts payable in 2019 compared to 2018. in addition, lower cash used for payments for various employee-related liabilities, customer funding and accrued expenses increased operating cash flows from continuing operations in 2019 compared to 2018.
•   on march 1, 2019, the company completed the underwritten public offering of 12.1 million shares of danaher common stock at a price to the public of $123.00 per share resulting in net proceeds of approximately $1.4 billion, after deducting expenses and the underwriters' discount. simultaneously, the company completed the underwritten public offering of 1.65 million shares of its mcps resulting in net proceeds of approximately $1.6 billion, after deducting expenses and the underwriters' discount. the company intends to use the net proceeds from the underwritten public offerings of its common stock and mcps (the "common stock offering" and "mcps offering", respectively) to fund a portion of the cash consideration payable for, and certain costs associated with, the ge biopharma acquisition.
•   in the second half of 2019, the company issued approximately €6.2 billion of senior unsecured euronotes and approximately $4.0 billion of senior unsecured notes. the proceeds from these issuances will be used to fund a portion of the cash consideration payable for the ge biopharma acquisition.
•   on december 18, 2019, danaher completed the envista disposition. prior to the ipo, envista borrowed $650 million under a senior unsecured term loan and €600 million under a three-year, senior unsecured term loan facility. envista transferred the net proceeds from these borrowings along with the net proceeds of $643 million from the envista ipo to the company in consideration for the company's transfer of the dental businesses to envista.
•   danaher used a portion of the consideration received from envista to redeem $882 million in aggregate principal amount of outstanding indebtedness in the fourth quarter of 2019 (consisting of the company's 2.4% senior unsecured notes due 2020 and 5.0% senior unsecured notes due 2020 (collectively the "redeemed notes")), as well as the make-whole premiums and accrued and unpaid interest required to be paid in connection with such redemptions. the company used the balance of the consideration it received from envista to redeem commercial paper borrowings as they matured.
•   net cash used in investing activities during 2019 consisted primarily of cash paid for acquisitions, additions to property, plant and equipment and payments for purchases of investments. the company acquired five businesses during 2019 for total consideration (including assumed debt and net of cash acquired) of $331 million. payments for additions to property, plant and equipment increased $52 million in 2019 compared to 2018 and included investments in operating assets and new facilities. in addition, in 2019, the company invested $241 million in non-marketable equity securities and a partnership.
operating activities cash flows from operating activities can fluctuate significantly from period-to-period as working capital needs and the timing of payments for income taxes, restructuring activities and productivity improvement initiatives, pension funding and other items impact reported cash flows.
operating cash flows from continuing operations were approximately $3.7 billion for 2019, an increase of $13 million, or less than 1%, as compared to 2018. the year-over-year change in operating cash flows from 2018 to 2019 was primarily attributable to the following factors:
•   2019 operating cash flows benefited from higher net earnings in 2019 as compared to 2018. net earnings for 2019 include noncash discrete income tax charges totaling $215 million, which decreased net earnings without a corresponding impact to operating cash flows.
•   net earnings for 2019 reflected an increase of $12 million of depreciation and amortization expense as compared to 2018. amortization expense primarily relates to the amortization of intangible assets acquired in connection with acquisitions and increased due to recently acquired businesses. depreciation expense relates to both the company's manufacturing and operating facilities as well as instrumentation leased to customers under operating-type lease arrangements and increased due primarily to the impact of increased capital expenditures. depreciation and amortization are noncash expenses that decrease earnings without a corresponding impact to operating cash flows.
•   the aggregate of trade accounts receivable, inventories and trade accounts payable used $160 million in operating cash flows during 2019, compared to $41 million of operating cash flows provided in 2018. the amount of cash flow generated from or used by the aggregate of trade accounts receivable, inventories and trade accounts payable depends upon how effectively the company manages the cash conversion cycle, which effectively represents the number of days that elapse from the day it pays for the purchase of raw materials and components to the collection of cash from its customers and can be significantly impacted by the timing of collections and payments in a period.
•   the aggregate of prepaid expenses and other assets, deferred income taxes and accrued expenses and other liabilities provided $37 million in operating cash flows during 2019, compared to $121 million used in 2018. the noncash discrete tax charge, the timing of cash payments for taxes, various employee-related liabilities, customer funding and accrued expenses drove the majority of this change.
operating cash flows from continuing operations were approximately $3.6 billion for 2018, an increase of $522 million, or 17%, as compared to 2017. this increase was primarily attributable to the increase in net earnings from continuing operations in 2018 as compared to 2017. net earnings in 2017 also included a $73 million gain on sale of marketable equity securities for which the proceeds were reflected in the investing activities section of the accompanying consolidated statement of cash flows, and therefore, did not contribute to operating cash flows.
investing activities cash flows relating to investing activities consist primarily of cash used for acquisitions and capital expenditures, including instruments leased to customers, cash used for investments and cash proceeds from divestitures of businesses or assets.
net cash used in investing activities was approximately $1.2 billion during 2019 compared to approximately $2.9 billion and $843 million of net cash used in 2018 and 2017, respectively.
acquisitions, divestitures and sale of investments for a discussion of the company's 2019 acquisitions refer to "-overview." in addition, in 2019, the company invested $241 million in non-marketable equity securities and partnerships.
during 2018, the company acquired two businesses for total consideration of approximately $2.2 billion in cash, net of cash acquired. the businesses acquired complement existing units of the company's life sciences and environmental & applied solutions segments. the aggregate annual sales of these two businesses at the time of their respective acquisitions, in each case based on the companies' revenues for its last completed fiscal year prior to the acquisition, were $313 million.
in addition, in 2018, the company invested $146 million in non-marketable equity securities and partnerships. the company received cash proceeds of $22 million from the collection of short-term other receivables related to the sale of certain marketable equity securities during 2017.
during 2017, the company acquired nine businesses for total consideration of $386 million in cash, net of cash acquired. the businesses acquired complement existing units of the life sciences and environmental & applied solutions segments. the aggregate annual sales of these nine businesses at the time of their respective acquisitions, in each case based on the companies' revenues for its last completed fiscal year prior to the acquisition, were $160 million.
the company received $138 million of cash proceeds and recorded $22 million in short-term other receivables from the sale of certain marketable equity securities during 2017. the company recorded a pretax gain related to this sale of $73 million ($46 million after-tax or $0.06 per diluted share).
capital expenditures capital expenditures are made primarily for increasing capacity, replacing equipment, supporting new product development, improving information technology systems and the manufacture of instruments that are used in operating-type lease arrangements that certain of the company's businesses enter into with customers. capital expenditures totaled $636 million in 2019 and $584 million in 2018. the year-over-year increase in capital spending in 2019 was due to increased investments in operating assets and new facilities across the company. in 2020, the company expects capital spending to be approximately $700 million, though actual expenditures will ultimately depend on business conditions.
financing activities cash flows from financing activities consist primarily of cash flows associated with the issuance and repayments of commercial paper, issuance and repayment of long-term debt, issuance and repurchases of common stock, issuance of preferred stock, payments of cash dividends to shareholders and proceeds from the envista ipo. financing activities provided cash of approximately $16.4 billion during 2019 compared to $797 million of cash used during 2018. the year-over-year increase in cash provided by financing activities was due primarily to the public offerings of the company's common and preferred stock during the first quarter of 2019, the issuance of debt by the company in the second half of 2019, the proceeds received from the envista ipo and envista debt issuances, and net proceeds from commercial paper borrowings in 2019 compared to 2018. these sources of liquidity were partially offset by higher debt redemptions during 2019 compared to 2018 which included the impact of the early extinguishment of $882 million of borrowings through the use of the proceeds received from envista as part of the disposition of this business.
financing activities used cash of $797 million during 2018 compared to approximately $3.1 billion of cash used during 2017. the year-over-year decrease in cash used in financing activities was due primarily to lower net repayments of commercial paper borrowings in 2018, as the company decreased its commercial paper borrowings in 2017 after increasing commercial paper borrowings for the cepheid acquisition in 2016. the company issued commercial paper early in 2018 to pay for a portion of the acquisition price of idt and repaid substantially all of such commercial paper borrowings later in 2018. the cash outflow in 2017 for the net repayment of commercial paper was partially offset by proceeds from the issuance of long-term notes. in both 2018 and 2017, the company repaid long-term debt, including $500 million aggregate principal amount of u.s. notes with accrued interest that matured in september 2018.
total debt was approximately $21.7 billion and $9.7 billion as of december 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. the company had the ability to incur approximately $4.9 billion of additional indebtedness in direct borrowings or under the outstanding commercial paper facilities based on the amounts available under the company's $10.0 billion of credit facilities which were not being used to backstop outstanding commercial paper balances as of december 31, 2019. the company has classified approximately $5.0 billion of its borrowings outstanding under the euro-denominated commercial paper program as of december 31, 2019 as long-term debt in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as the company has the intent and ability, as supported by availability under the revolving credit facility, to refinance these borrowings for at least one year from the balance sheet date. as commercial paper obligations mature, the company may issue additional short-term commercial paper obligations to refinance all or part of these borrowings.
under the company's u.s. and euro-denominated commercial paper program, the notes are typically issued at a discount from par, generally based on the ratings assigned to the company by credit rating agencies at the time of the issuance and prevailing market rates measured by reference to libor or euribor. additionally, the company's floating rate senior unsecured notes due 2022 pay interest based upon the three-month euribor plus 0.3%. in july 2017, the head of the united kingdom financial conduct authority announced the intent to phase out the use of libor by the end of 2021. the u.s. federal reserve, in conjunction with the alternative reference rates committee, a steering committee comprised of large u.s. financial institutions, is considering replacing u.s. dollar libor with the secured overnight financing rate, or sofr, a new index calculated by short-term repurchase agreements, backed by treasury securities. the company has evaluated the anticipated impact of the transition from libor and does not expect the transition to be material to the company's financial position.
refer to note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the company's financing activities and indebtedness, including the company's outstanding debt as of december 31, 2019, and the company's commercial paper program and related credit facilities.
common stock offering and mcps offering for a description of the first quarter 2019 common stock and mcps offerings, refer to note 19 to the consolidated financial statements.
shelf registration statement the company has filed a "well-known seasoned issuer" shelf registration statement on form s-3 with the sec that registers an indeterminate amount of debt securities, common stock, preferred stock, warrants, depositary shares, purchase contracts and units for future issuance. the company expects to use net proceeds realized by the company from future securities sales off this shelf registration statement for general corporate purposes, including without limitation repayment or refinancing of debt or other corporate obligations, acquisitions, capital expenditures, share repurchases and dividends and/or working capital.
stock repurchase program please see "issuer purchases of equity securities" in item 5 of part ii of this annual report for a description of the company's stock repurchase program.
dividends the company declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.17 per share of company common stock that was paid on january 31, 2020 to holders of record on december 27, 2019. in addition, the company declared a quarterly cash dividend of $11.875 per mcps that was paid on january 15, 2020 to holders of record as of december 31, 2019. aggregate cash payments for dividends on company common stock during 2019 were $478 million. the year-over-year increase in dividend payments on common stock in 2019 results from increases in the quarterly dividend rate effective with respect to the dividend paid in the second quarter of 2019. aggregate cash payments for dividends on the mcps during 2019 were $49 million.
cash and cash requirements as of december 31, 2019, the company held approximately $19.9 billion of cash and cash equivalents that were invested in highly liquid investment-grade debt instruments with a maturity of 90 days or less with an approximate weighted average annual interest rate of 1.5%. of this amount, approximately $16.3 billion was held within the united states and approximately $3.6 billion was held outside of the united states. the company will continue to have cash requirements to support working capital needs, capital expenditures, acquisitions and investments, pay interest and service debt, pay taxes and any related interest or penalties, fund its restructuring activities and pension plans as required, pay dividends to shareholders, repurchase shares of the company's common stock and support other business needs. the company generally intends to use available
cash and internally generated funds to meet these cash requirements, but in the event that additional liquidity is required, particularly in connection with acquisitions (including the ge biopharma acquisition), the company may also borrow under its commercial paper programs or credit facilities, enter into new credit facilities and either borrow directly thereunder or use such credit facilities to backstop additional borrowing capacity under its commercial paper programs and/or issue debt and/or equity in the capital markets. the company also may from time to time access the capital markets to take advantage of favorable interest rate environments or other market conditions. for a description of the company's anticipated financing of the ge biopharma acquisition, refer to note 3 to the consolidated financial statements.
while repatriation of some cash held outside the united states may be restricted by local laws, most of the company's foreign cash could be repatriated to the united states. following enactment of the tcja and the associated transition tax, in general, repatriation of cash to the united states can be completed with no incremental u.s. tax; however, repatriation of cash could subject the company to non-u.s. jurisdictional taxes on distributions. the cash that the company's non-u.s. subsidiaries hold for indefinite reinvestment is generally used to finance foreign operations, investments and acquisitions. the income taxes applicable to repatriating such earnings are not readily determinable. as of december 31, 2019, the company continues to assert that principally all of its non-u.s. earnings are indefinitely reinvested and management believes that the company has sufficient liquidity to satisfy its cash needs, including its cash needs in the united states.
during 2019, the company contributed $10 million to its u.s. defined benefit pension plans and $44 million to its non-u.s. defined benefit pension plans. during 2020, the company's cash contribution requirements for its u.s. and its non-u.s. defined benefit pension plans are expected to be approximately $95 million and $40 million, respectively. the ultimate amounts to be contributed depend upon, among other things, legal requirements, underlying asset returns, the plan's funded status, the anticipated tax deductibility of the contribution, local practices, market conditions, interest rates and other factors.
contractual obligations the following table sets forth, by period due or year of expected expiration, as applicable, a summary of the company's contractual obligations as of december 31, 2019 under (1) debt obligations, (2) leases, (3) purchase obligations and (4) other long-term liabilities reflected on the company's consolidated balance sheet. the amounts presented in the "other long-term liabilities" line in the table below include approximately $1.3 billion of noncurrent gross unrecognized tax benefits and related interest (and do not include $58 million of current gross unrecognized tax benefits which are included in accrued expenses and other liabilities on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet). the timing of the long-term portion of these tax liabilities is uncertain, and therefore, they have been included in the "more than 5 years" column in the table below. refer to note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on unrecognized tax benefits. certain of the company's acquisitions also involve the potential payment of contingent consideration. the table below does not reflect any such obligations, as the timing and amounts of any such payments are uncertain. refer to "-off-balance sheet arrangements" for a discussion of other contractual obligations that are not reflected in the table below.

(d)   amounts reflect undiscounted future operating lease payments under accounting standards update no. 2016-02, leases (topic 842), while the current and long-term operating lease liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet reflect the discounted future operating lease payments. refer to note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for further information.
(e)   consist of agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable, legally binding on the company, and that specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased, fixed, minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction.
(f)   primarily consist of obligations under product service and warranty policies and allowances, performance and operating cost guarantees, estimated environmental remediation costs, self-insurance and litigation claims, postretirement benefits, pension obligations, deferred tax liabilities and deferred compensation obligations. the timing of cash flows associated with these obligations is based upon management's estimates over the terms of these arrangements and is largely based upon historical experience. other long-term liabilities reflected in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet include the above amounts as well as the long-term operating lease liabilities, which are reflected on a discounted basis in the consolidated balance sheet.
off-balance sheet arrangements guarantees and related instruments the following table sets forth, by period due or year of expected expiration, as applicable, a summary of guarantees and related instruments of the company as of december 31, 2019.
amount of commitment expiration per period
guarantees and related instruments consist primarily of outstanding standby letters of credit, bank guarantees and performance and bid bonds. these have been provided in connection with certain arrangements with vendors, customers, insurance providers, financing counterparties and governmental entities to secure the company's obligations and/or performance requirements related to specific transactions.
other off-balance sheet arrangements the company has from time to time divested certain of its businesses and assets. in connection with these divestitures, the company often provides representations, warranties and/or indemnities to cover various risks and unknown liabilities, such as claims for damages arising out of the use of products or relating to intellectual property matters, employment matters, commercial disputes, environmental matters or tax matters. in particular, in connection with the 2019 envista disposition, the 2016 fortive disposition and the 2015 communications disposition, danaher entered into separation and related agreements pursuant to which danaher agreed to indemnify the other parties against certain damages and expenses that might occur in the future. these indemnification obligations cover a variety of liabilities, including, but not limited to, employee, tax and environmental matters. the company has not included any such items in the contractual obligations table above because they generally relate to unknown conditions and the company cannot estimate the potential liabilities from such matters, but the company does not believe it is reasonably possible that any such liability will have a material effect on the company's financial statements. in addition, as a result of these divestitures, as well as restructuring activities, certain properties leased by the company have been sublet to third parties. in the event any of these third parties vacate any of these premises, the company would be legally obligated under master lease arrangements. the company believes that the financial risk of default by such sub-lessors is individually and in the aggregate not material to the company's financial statements.
in the normal course of business, the company periodically enters into agreements that require it to indemnify customers, suppliers or other business partners for specific risks, such as claims for injury or property damage arising out of the company's products, software or services or claims alleging that company products or services infringe third-party intellectual property. the company has not included any such indemnification provisions in the contractual obligations table above. historically, the company has not experienced significant losses on these types of indemnification obligations.
the company's restated certificate of incorporation requires it to indemnify to the full extent authorized or permitted by law any person made, or threatened to be made a party to any action or proceeding by reason of his or her service as a director or officer of the company, or by reason of serving at the request of the company as a director or officer of any other entity, subject to limited exceptions. danaher's amended and restated by-laws provide for similar indemnification rights. in addition, danaher has executed with each director and executive officer of danaher corporation an indemnification agreement which provides for substantially similar indemnification rights and under which danaher has agreed to pay expenses in advance of the final disposition of any such indemnifiable proceeding. while the company maintains insurance for this type of liability, a significant deductible applies to this coverage and any such liability could exceed the amount of the insurance coverage.
legal proceedings refer to "item 3. legal proceedings" and note 18 to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding legal proceedings and contingencies, and for a discussion of risks related to legal proceedings and contingencies, refer to "item 1a. risk factors."
critical accounting estimates management's discussion and analysis of the company's financial condition and results of operations is based upon the company's consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states. the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. the company bases these estimates and judgments on historical experience, the current economic environment and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. actual results may differ materially from these estimates and judgments.
the company believes the following accounting estimates are most critical to an understanding of its financial statements. estimates are considered to be critical if they meet both of the following criteria: (1) the estimate requires assumptions about material matters that are uncertain at the time the estimate is made, and (2) material changes in the estimate are reasonably likely from period-to-period. for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting estimates, refer to note 1 to the consolidated financial statements.
acquired intangibles-the company's business acquisitions typically result in the recognition of goodwill, in-process r&d and other intangible assets, which affect the amount of future period amortization expense and possible impairment charges that the company may incur. refer to notes 1, 3 and 8 to the consolidated financial statements for a description of the company's policies relating to goodwill, acquired intangibles and acquisitions.
in performing its goodwill impairment testing, the company estimates the fair value of its reporting units primarily using a market-based approach. in evaluating the estimates derived by the market-based approach, management makes judgments about the relevance and reliability of the multiples by considering factors unique to its reporting units, including operating results, business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows, and transactions and marketplace data as well as judgments about the comparability of the market proxies selected. in certain circumstances the company also estimates fair value utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis (i.e., an income approach) in order to validate the results of the market approach. the discounted cash flow model requires judgmental assumptions about projected revenue growth, future operating margins, discount rates and terminal values. there are inherent uncertainties related to these assumptions and management's judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill impairment.
as of december 31, 2019, the company had five reporting units for goodwill impairment testing. reporting units resulting from recent acquisitions generally present the highest risk of impairment. management believes the impairment risk associated with these reporting units generally decreases as these businesses are integrated into the company and better positioned for potential future earnings growth. the company's annual goodwill impairment analysis in 2019 indicated that in all instances, the fair values of the company's reporting units exceeded their carrying values and consequently did not result in an impairment charge. the excess of the estimated fair value over carrying value (expressed as a percentage of carrying value for the respective reporting unit) for each of the company's reporting units as of the annual testing date ranged from approximately 85% to approximately 600%. in order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations used in the goodwill impairment test, the company applied a hypothetical 10% decrease to the fair values of each reporting unit and compared those hypothetical values to the reporting unit carrying values. based on this hypothetical 10% decrease, the excess of the estimated fair value over carrying value (expressed as a percentage of carrying value for the respective reporting unit) for each of the company's reporting units ranged from approximately 65% to approximately 530%.
the company reviews identified intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable. the company also tests intangible assets with indefinite lives at least annually for impairment. determining whether an impairment loss occurred requires a comparison of the carrying amount to the sum of undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. these analyses require management to make judgments and estimates about future revenues, expenses, market conditions and discount rates related to these assets.
if actual results are not consistent with management's estimates and assumptions, goodwill and other intangible assets may be overstated and a charge would need to be taken against net earnings which would adversely affect the company's financial statements. historically, the company's estimates of goodwill and intangible assets have been materially correct.
contingent liabilities-as discussed in "item 3. legal proceedings" and note 18 to the consolidated financial statements, the company is, from time to time, subject to a variety of litigation and similar contingent liabilities incidental to its business (or the business operations of previously owned entities). the company recognizes a liability for any legal contingency that is known or probable of occurrence and reasonably estimable. these assessments require judgments concerning matters such as litigation developments and outcomes, the anticipated outcome of negotiations, the number of future claims and the cost of both pending and future claims. in addition, because most contingencies are resolved over long periods of time, liabilities may change in the future due to various factors, including those discussed in note 18 to the consolidated financial statements. if the reserves established by the company with respect to these contingent liabilities are inadequate, the company would be required to incur an expense equal to the amount of the loss incurred in excess of the reserves, which would adversely affect the company's financial statements.
revenue recognition-the company derives revenues from the sale of products and services. revenue is recognized when control over the promised products or services is transferred to the customer in an amount that reflects the consideration that the company expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. in determining if control has transferred, the company considers whether certain indicators of the transfer of control are present, such as the transfer of title, present right to payment, significant risks and rewards of ownership and customer acceptance when acceptance is not a formality. to determine the consideration that the customer owes the company, the company must make judgments regarding the amount of customer allowances and rebates, as well as an estimate for product returns. the company also enters into lease arrangements with customers which requires the company to determine whether the arrangements are operating or sales-type leases. refer to note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for a description of the company's revenue recognition policies.
if the company's judgments regarding revenue recognition prove incorrect, the company's reported revenues in particular periods may be incorrect. historically, the company's estimates of revenue have been materially correct.
pension and other postretirement benefits-for a description of the company's pension and other postretirement benefit accounting practices, refer to notes  and  to the consolidated financial statements. calculations of the amount of pension and other postretirement benefit costs and obligations depend on the assumptions used in the actuarial valuations, including assumptions regarding discount rates, expected return on plan assets, rates of salary increases, health care cost trend rates, mortality rates and other factors. if the assumptions used in calculating pension and other postretirement benefits costs and obligations are incorrect or if the factors underlying the assumptions change (as a result of differences in actual experience, changes in key economic indicators or other factors) the company's financial statements could be materially affected. a 50 basis point reduction in the discount rates used for the plans would have increased the u.s. net obligation by $133 million ($99 million on an after-tax basis) and the non-u.s. net obligation by $137 million ($116 million on an after-tax basis) from the amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements as of december 31, 2019. a 50 basis point increase in the discount rates used for the plans would have decreased the u.s. net obligation by $122 million ($91 million on an after-tax basis) and the non-u.s. net obligation by $124 million ($105 million on an after-tax basis) from the amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements as of december 31, 2019.
for 2019, the estimated long-term rate of return for the u.s. plans was 7.0%, and the company intends to continue to use an assumption of 7.0% for 2020. the estimated long-term rate of return for the non-u.s. plans was determined on a plan-by-plan basis based on the nature of the plan assets and ranged from 0.8% to 5.0%. if the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets for 2019 was reduced by 50 basis points, pension expense for the u.s. and non-u.s. plans for 2019 would have increased $9 million ($7 million on an after-tax basis) and $5 million ($4 million on an after-tax basis), respectively.
for a discussion of the company's 2019 and anticipated 2020 defined benefit pension plan contributions, refer to "-liquidity and capital resources-cash and cash requirements".
income taxes-for a description of the company's income tax accounting policies, refer to notes 1 and 15 to the consolidated financial statements. the company establishes valuation allowances for its deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. this requires management to make judgments and estimates regarding: (1) the timing and amount of the reversal of taxable temporary differences, (2) expected future taxable income, and (3) the impact of tax planning strategies. future changes to tax rates would also impact the amounts of deferred tax assets and liabilities and could have an adverse impact on the company's financial statements.
the company provides for unrecognized tax benefits when, based upon the technical merits, it is "more likely than not" that an uncertain tax position will not be sustained upon examination. judgment is required in evaluating tax positions and determining income tax provisions. the company re-evaluates the technical merits of its tax positions and may recognize an uncertain tax benefit in certain circumstances, including when: (1) a tax audit is completed; (2) applicable tax laws change, including a tax case ruling or legislative guidance; or (3) the applicable statute of limitations expires.
in addition, certain of the company's tax returns are currently under review by tax authorities including in denmark and the united states (refer to "-results of operations-income taxes" and note 15 to the consolidated financial statements). management believes the positions taken in these returns are in accordance with the relevant tax laws. however, the outcome of these audits is uncertain and could result in the company being required to record charges for prior year tax obligations which could have a material adverse impact to the company's financial statements, including its effective tax rate.
an increase of 1.0% in the company's 2019 nominal tax rate would have resulted in an additional income tax provision for continuing operations for the year ended december 31, 2019 of $33 million.

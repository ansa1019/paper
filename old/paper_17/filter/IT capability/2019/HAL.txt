table of contents management's report on internal control over financial reporting the management of halliburton company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in the securities exchange act rule 13a-15(f). internal control over financial reporting, no matter how well designed, has inherent limitations. therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. further, because of changes in conditions, the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting may vary over time. under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, we conducted an evaluation to assess the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31, 2019 based upon criteria set forth in the internal control - integrated framework (2013) issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission. based on our assessment, we believe that, as of december 31, 2019 , our internal control over financial reporting is effective. the effectiveness of halliburton's internal control over financial reporting as of december 31, 2019 has been audited by kpmg llp, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report that is included herein. halliburton company by

relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. the communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. evaluation of the realizability of deferred tax assets as discussed in notes 1 and 11 to the consolidated financial statements, the company had gross deferred tax assets of $3.3
table of contents the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included the following. we tested certain internal controls related to the company's evaluation of the realizability of deferred tax assets, including controls related to the development of forecasts of future taxable income. we evaluated the assumptions used in the development of forecasts of future taxable income by comparing to historical actuals while considering current and anticipated future commodity prices or market events. we also evaluated the company's history of realizing deferred tax assets by evaluating the expiration of net operating loss carryforwards and foreign tax credits. assessment of the fair value of property, plant and equipment as discussed in notes 1, 2, and 8 to the consolidated financial statements, the gross amount of property, plant and equipment as of december 31, 2019 was $19.9 billion and related accumulated depreciation of $12.6 billion. the company recognizes impairment on property, plant and equipment when the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset group is less than the carrying amount of the asset group. the company recognized an impairment charge of $1.4 billion for the year ended december 31, 2019. we identified the assessment of the company's estimate of the fair value of property, plant and equipment as a critical audit matter. there was a high degree of subjectivity in evaluating the significant assumptions used in determining the discounted cash flows needed to estimate the fair value of the asset groups, specifically the revenue growth rates, operating margin and the discount rate used. the primary procedures we performed to address the critical audit matter included the following. we tested certain internal controls over the company's process to estimate the discounted cash flows of the asset groups, including controls related to the significant assumptions. we evaluated the company's development of the revenue growth rates and operating margin assumptions by identifying and assessing the sources of data that management used in their assessment. we evaluated the revenue growth rates and operating margin for consistency with relevant historical data, changes in the business, and external industry data. in addition, we involved valuation professionals with specialized skills and knowledge to assist with evaluating the selected discount rate by comparing it against a discount rate range that was independently developed using publicly available market data for comparable companies.

table of contents    item 8 | notes to consolidated financial statements halliburton company notes to consolidated financial statements note 1 . description of company and significant accounting policies description of company halliburton company is one of the world's largest providers of products and services to the energy industry. its predecessor was established in 1919 and incorporated under the laws of the state of delaware in 1924. we help our customers maximize asset value throughout the lifecycle of the reservoir - from locating hydrocarbons and managing geological data, to drilling and formation evaluation, well construction and completion, and optimizing production throughout the life of the asset. we serve major, national and independent oil and natural gas companies throughout the world and operate under two divisions, which form the basis for the two operating segments we report, the completion and production segment and the drilling and evaluation segment.
use of estimates our financial statements are prepared in conformity with united states generally accepted accounting principles, requiring us to make estimates and assumptions that affect:
-  the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements; and
we believe the most significant estimates and assumptions are associated with the forecasting of our effective income tax rate and the valuation of deferred taxes, legal reserves, long-lived asset valuations, purchase price allocations, and allowance for bad debts. ultimate results could differ from our estimates.
basis of presentation the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of our company and all of our subsidiaries that we control or variable interest entities for which we have determined that we are the primary beneficiary. all material intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated. investments in companies in which we do not have a controlling interest, but over which we do exercise significant influence, are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. if we do not have significant influence, we use the cost method of accounting. in addition, certain reclassifications of prior period balances have been made to conform to the current period presentation.
revenue recognition our services and products are generally sold based upon purchase orders or contracts with our customers that include fixed or determinable prices but do not include right of return provisions or other significant post-
delivery obligations. the vast majority of our service and product contracts are short-term in nature. we recognize revenue based on the transfer of control or our customers' ability to benefit from our services and products in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those services and products. we also assess our customers' ability and intention to pay, which is based on a variety of factors, including our historical payment experience with and the financial condition of our customers. rates for services are typically priced on a per day, per meter, per man-hour or similar basis.see note 4 for further information on revenue recognition.
research and development we maintain an active research and development program. the program improves products, processes and engineering standards and practices that serve the changing needs of our customers, such as those related to high pressure and high temperature environments, and also develops new products and processes. research and development costs are expensed as incurred and were $ 404million in 2019 , $ 390million in 2018 and $ 360million in 2017 .
cash equivalents we consider all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value. cost represents invoice or production cost for new items and original cost. production cost includes material, labor and manufacturing overhead. the majority of our inventory is recorded on the average cost method. we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and record provisions for excess or obsolete inventory based primarily on historical usage, estimated product demand and technological developments.
table of contents    item 8 | notes to consolidated financial statements allowance for bad debts we establish an allowance for bad debts through a review of several factors, including historical collection experience, current aging status of the customer accounts and financial condition of our customers. our policy is to write off bad debts when the customer accounts are determined to be uncollectible.
property, plant and equipment other than those assets that have been written down to their fair values due to impairment, property, plant and equipment are reported at cost less accumulated depreciation, which is generally provided on the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. accelerated depreciation methods are used for tax purposes, wherever permitted. upon sale or retirement of an asset, the related costs and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any gain or loss is recognized. planned major maintenance costs are generally expensed as incurred. expenditures for additions, modifications and conversions are capitalized when they increase the value or extend the useful life of the asset.
goodwill and other intangible assets we record as goodwill the excess purchase price over the fair value of the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business acquisition. changes in the carrying amount of goodwill are detailed below by reportable segment.

the reported amounts of goodwill for each reporting unit are reviewed for impairment on an annual basis, during the third quarter, and more frequently when circumstances indicate an impairment may exist. due to the impairments and other charges recorded during the fourth quarter of 2019, we updated our goodwill impairment assessment through december 31, 2019. as a result of our goodwill impairment assessments performed in the years ended december 31,
2019 , 2018 and 2017 , we determined that the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its net book value and, therefore, no goodwill impairments were deemed necessary.for further information on our goodwill impairment assessments, see "item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations -
critical accounting estimates."
we amortize other identifiable intangible assets with a finite life on a straight-line basis over the period which the asset is expected to contribute to our future cash flows, ranging from one year to twenty-eight years . the components of these other intangible assets generally consist of patents, license agreements, non-compete agreements, trademarks and customer lists and contracts.
evaluating impairment of long-lived assets when events or changes in circumstances indicate that long-lived assets other than goodwill may be impaired, an evaluation is performed. for assets classified as held for use, we first group individual assets based on the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows from other assets. we then compare estimated future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset group to its carrying amount. if the asset group's undiscounted cash flows are less than its carrying amount, we then determine the asset group's fair value by using a discounted cash flow analysis and recognize any resulting impairment. when an asset is classified as held for sale, the asset's book value is evaluated and adjusted to the lower of its carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell. in addition, depreciation and amortization is ceased while it is classified as held for sale.see note 2 for further information on impairments and other charges recorded in 2019.
income taxes we recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the year. in addition, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the financial statements or tax returns. a valuation allowance is provided for deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that these items will not be realized.
table of contents    item 8 | notes to consolidated financial statements in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. based upon the level of historical taxable income and projections for future taxable income over the periods in which the deferred tax assets are deductible, management believes it is more likely than not that we will realize the benefits of these deductible differences, net of the existing valuation allowances.
we recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the provision for income taxes on continuing operations in our consolidated statements of operations.
derivative instruments at times, we enter into derivative financial transactions to hedge existing or projected exposures to changing foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. we do not enter into derivative transactions for speculative or trading purposes. we recognize all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value. derivatives that are not hedges are adjusted to fair value and reflected through the results of operations. if the derivative is designated as a hedge, depending on the nature of the hedge, changes in the fair value of derivatives are either offset against:
-  the change in fair value of the hedged assets, liabilities or firm commitments through earnings; or
-  recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings.
the ineffective portion of a derivative's change in fair value is recognized in earnings. recognized gains or losses on derivatives entered into to manage foreign currency exchange risk are included in "other, net" on the consolidated statements of operations. gains or losses on interest rate derivatives are included in "interest expense, net."
foreign currency translation foreign entities whose functional currency is the united states dollar translate monetary assets and liabilities at year-end exchange rates, and nonmonetary items are translated at historical rates. revenue and expense transactions are translated at the average rates in effect during the year, except for those expenses associated with nonmonetary balance sheet accounts, which are translated at historical rates. gains or losses from remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities due to changes in exchange rates are recognized in our consolidated statements of operations in "other, net" in the year of occurrence.
stock-based compensation stock-based compensation cost is measured at the date of grant, based on the calculated fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the employee's service period, which is generally the vesting period of the equity grant. additionally, compensation cost is recognized based on awards ultimately expected to vest, therefore, we have reduced the cost for estimated forfeitures based on historical forfeiture rates. forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and revised in subsequent periods to reflect actual forfeitures.see note 13 for additional information related to stock-based compensation.
table of contents    item 8 | notes to consolidated financial statements note 2 . impairments and other charges market conditions negatively impacted our business during 2019, particularly in north america. we experienced continued pricing pressure and customer activity reductions for our products and services. the north america land rig count decreased 26% from its high point in early 2019 to its low point in december 2019, and we idled equipment throughout the year to adjust to changing activity levels. during the fourth quarter of 2019, the north america market continued to deteriorate with a 9% decrease in the average land rig count compared to the third quarter.
customer activity declined across all basins, affecting both our drilling and completions businesses, and pricing pressure persisted during the year-end tendering season.
as a result of these market conditions and our service delivery improvement strategy, we took actions during the fourth quarter of 2019 to proactively manage our equipment fleet, rationalize our portfolio of real estate facilities, and initiate reductions in our global workforce in an effort to mitigate the impact of market deterioration and better align our workforce with anticipated activity levels. as part of our real estate rationalization, we identified owned properties to sell and leased properties to abandon. we reviewed the recoverability of our long-lived assets and, based upon our impairment assessments, we determined the carrying amount of some of our long-lived assets exceeded their respective fair values.
we determined the fair value of our long-lived assets based on a discounted cash flow analysis, with the exception of real estate facilities classified as held for sale for which fair value was based on third party sales price estimates. these fair value assessments required the use of estimates which represent significant unobservable inputs. the discounted cash flow analysis utilized management's short-term and long-term forecast of operating performance, including revenue growth rates and expected profitability margins, the remaining useful life and service potential of the asset, and a discount rate based on our weighted average cost of capital. as such, these analyses incorporate inherent uncertainties about commodity prices, supply and demand for our services, and future market conditions that are difficult to predict in volatile economic environments. if market conditions worsen, our fair value assumptions of estimated future cash flows could be materially altered and we may be required to record additional asset impairments. such a potential impairment charge could have a material adverse impact on our operating results.
as a result of the events described above, we recorded impairments and other charges of approximately $ 2.5billion during the year ended december 31, 2019. the following table presents various pre-tax charges we recorded during the years ended december 31, 2019 , 2018 and 2017 which are reflected within "impairments and other charges" on our consolidated statements of operations.

of the $ 2.5billion of impairments and other charges recorded during the year ended december 31, 2019, approximately $ 1.6billion was attributable to our completion and production segment and approximately $ 849million was attributable to our drilling and evaluation segment. long-lived asset impairments include impairments of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets, and real estate facilities. the $ 1.6billion of long-lived asset impairments consists of the following: $ 759million attributable to hydraulic fracturing equipment, the majority of which was located in north america; $ 243million related to legacy drilling equipment; $ 215million related to real estate properties owned and classified as held for sale; $ 139million related to right-of-use assets associated with operating leases; $ 98million related to intangible assets; and $ 148million of other fixed asset impairments.
included within "inventory costs and write-downs" in the table above are amounts associated with certain supply contracts, coupled with a write-down of some of our inventory which exceeded its market value. we also rationalized our portfolio of existing joint ventures and recorded resulting charges within "joint ventures" in the table above.
table of contents    item 8 | notes to consolidated financial statements note 3 . business segment and geographic information we operate under two divisions, which form the basis for the two operating segments we report: the completion and production segment and the drilling and evaluation segment. for more information about the product service lines included in each segment, see "part i, item 1. business." the business operations of our divisions are organized around four primary geographic regions: north america, latin america, europe/africa/cis and middle east/asia. our equity in earnings and losses of unconsolidated affiliates that are accounted for using the equity method of accounting are included within cost of services and cost of sales on our statements of operations, which is part of operating income of the applicable segment.

operations by geographic region the following tables present information by geographic area. in 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , based on the location of services provided and products sold, 51% , 58% and 53% , respectively, of our consolidated revenue was from the united states. as of december 31, 2019 and december 31, 2018 , 59% and 62% of our property, plant and equipment was located in the united states. no other country accounted for more than 10% of our revenue or property, plant and equipment during the periods presented.
note 4 . revenue revenue is recognized based on the transfer of control or our customers' ability to benefit from our services and products in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those services and products. the vast majority of our service and product contracts are short-term in nature. in recognizing revenue for our services and products, we determine the transaction price of purchase orders or contracts with our customers, which may consist of fixed and variable consideration. we also assess our customers'

contract balances we perform our obligations under contracts with our customers by transferring services and products in exchange for consideration. the timing of our performance often differs from the timing of our customer's payment, which results in the recognition of receivables and deferred revenue. deferred revenue represents advance consideration received from customers for contracts where revenue is recognized on future performance of service. deferred revenue, as well as revenue recognized during the period relating to amounts included as deferred revenue at the beginning of the period, was not material to our consolidated financial statements.
transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations remaining performance obligations represent firm contracts for which work has not been performed and future revenue recognition is expected. we have elected the practical expedient permitting the exclusion of disclosing remaining performance obligations for contracts that have an original expected duration of one year or less. we have some long-term contracts related to software and integrated project management services such as lump sum turnkey contracts. for software contracts, revenue is generally recognized over time throughout the license period when the software is considered to be a right to access our intellectual property. for lump sum turnkey projects, we recognize revenue over time using an input method, which requires us to exercise judgment. revenue allocated to remaining performance obligations for these long-term contracts is not material.
note 5 . receivables as of december 31, 2019 , 36% of our net trade receivables were from customers in the united states. as of december
31, 2018 , 43% of our net trade receivables were from customers in the united states. no other country or single customer accounted for more than 10% of our net trade receivables at these dates.
we routinely monitor the financial stability of our customers and employ an extensive process to evaluate the collectability of outstanding receivables. this process, which involves a high degree of judgment utilizing significant assumptions, includes analysis of our customers' historical time to pay, financial condition and various financial metrics, debt structure, credit agency ratings, and production profile, as well as political and economic factors in countries of operations and other customer-specific factors.

table of contents    item 8 | notes to consolidated financial statements note 6 . leases we adopted a comprehensive new lease accounting standard effective january 1, 2019. the details of the significant changes to our accounting policies resulting from the adoption of the new standard are set out below. we adopted the standard using the optional modified retrospective transition method; accordingly, the comparative information as of december 31, 2018 and for the years ended december 31, 2018 and 2017 have not been adjusted and continue to be reported under the previous lease standard. under the new lease standard, assets and liabilities that arise from all leases are required to be recognized on the balance sheet for lessees. previously, only capital leases, which are now referred to as finance leases, were recorded on the balance sheet. the adoption of this standard resulted in the recognition of approximately $ 1.0billion of operating lease right-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets as of january 1, 2019. the adoption of this standard did not materially impact our consolidated results of operations for the year ended december 31, 2019 . see note 17 for additional information about the new accounting standard.
beginning january 1, 2019, for all leases with a term in excess of 12 months, we recognized a lease liability equal to the present value of the lease payments and a right-of-use asset representing our right to use the underlying asset for the lease term. for operating leases, lease expense for lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term, while finance leases include both an operating expense and an interest expense component. for all leases with a term of 12 months or less, we elected the practical expedient to not recognize lease assets and liabilities. we recognize lease expense for these short-term leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
we are a lessee for numerous operating leases, primarily related to real estate, transportation and equipment. the vast majority of our operating leases have remaining lease terms of 10years or less, some of which include options to extend the leases, and some of which include options to terminate the leases. we generally do not include renewal or termination options in our assessment of the leases unless extension or termination for certain assets is deemed to be reasonably certain. the accounting for some of our leases may require judgment, which includes determining whether a contract contains a lease, determining the incremental borrowing rates to utilize in our net present value calculation of lease payments for lease agreements which do not provide an implicit rate, and assessing the likelihood of renewal or termination options. we also have some lease agreements with lease and non-
lease components, which are generally accounted for as a single lease component. for certain equipment leases, such as offshore vessels and drilling rigs, we account for the lease and non-lease components separately.
the following tables illustrate the financial impact of our leases as of and for the year ended december 31, 2019 , along with other supplemental information about our existing leases:
amortization of right-of-use assets  $                           19

operations during the year ended december 31, 2019 , we recorded a total income tax provision of $ 7million on a pre-tax loss of $ 1.1billion , resulting in an effective tax rate of - 0.6% . the effective tax rate for 2019 was primarily impacted by a $ 291million tax benefit associated with the $ 2.5billion of impairments and other charges recognized during the year, which primarily consisted of the tax effects of impairment charges taxed at various rates, offset by valuation allowances on deferred tax assets associated with market conditions that negatively impacted our business during the year. see note 2 for further information. our 2019 effective tax rate was also impacted by certain discrete tax adjustments related to prior year taxes, offset by additional valuation allowances recorded on deferred tax assets.

at december 31, 2019 , we had $ 1.5billion of domestic and foreign tax-effected net operating loss carryforwards, with approximately $ 200million estimated to be utilized against our unrecognized tax benefits. the ultimate realization of these deferred tax assets depends on the ability to generate sufficient taxable income in the appropriate taxing jurisdiction. $ 157million of the net operating loss carryforwards will expire after taxable years ended from 2020 through 2024 , $ 219million will expire after taxable years ended from 2025 through 2029 , and $ 755million will expire after taxable years ended from 2030 through 2040 . the remaining balance will not expire. additionally, we had $ 967million of foreign tax credit carryforwards that will expire from 2025 through
2029 , which are offset by foreign branch deferred activity reflected in the above table, along with $ 198million of research and development tax credit carryforwards that will expire from 2030 through 2040 . during the year ended december 31, 2019, we increased our valuation allowance on deferred tax assets by $ 169million related to $
85million associated with foreign deferred tax assets and $ 84million associated with foreign tax credits.
in accordance with the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017, a company's foreign earnings accumulated under the legacy tax laws are deemed to be repatriated into the united states. we have provided federal and state income tax related to this deemed repatriation. we have not provided incremental united states income taxes and foreign withholding taxes on undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries as of december 31, 2019 . the company generally does not provide for taxes related to its undistributed earnings because such earnings either would not be taxable when remitted or they are considered to be indefinitely reinvested.

tax our stock and incentive plan, as amended (stock plan), provides for the grant of any or all of the following types of stock-based awards:
-  stock options, including incentive stock options and nonqualified stock options;
-  restricted stock unit awards;
-  stock value equivalent awards.
there are currently no stock appreciation rights, stock value equivalent awards, or incentive stock options outstanding. under the terms of the stock plan, approximately 231million shares of common stock have been reserved for issuance to employees and non-employee directors. at december 31, 2019 , approximately 17million shares were available for future grants under the stock plan. the stock to be offered pursuant to the grant of an award under the stock plan may be authorized but unissued common shares or treasury shares.
in addition to the provisions of the stock plan, we also have stock-based compensation provisions under our restricted stock plan for non-employee directors and our employee stock purchase plan (espp).
stock options the majority of our options are generally issued during the second quarter of the year. all stock options under the stock plan are granted at the fair market value of our common stock at the grant date. employee stock options generally vest ratably over a period of three years and expire 10years from the grant date. compensation expense for stock options is generally recognized on a straight line basis over the entire vesting period.

158million during 2017 , of which $ 6million , $ 88million and $ 53million related to proceeds from exercises of stock options in 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , respectively. the remainder relates to cash proceeds from the issuance of shares related to our employee stock purchase plan.
the fair value of options at the date of grant was estimated using the black-scholes option pricing model. the expected volatility of options granted was a blended rate based upon implied volatility calculated on actively traded options on our common stock and upon the historical volatility of our common stock. the expected term of options granted was based upon historical observation of actual time elapsed between date of grant and exercise of options for all employees. the assumptions and resulting fair values of options granted were as follows:
expected volatility                                        31%                     28%           32%

restricted stock restricted shares issued under the stock plan are restricted as to sale or disposition. these restrictions lapse periodically generally over a period of five years . restrictions may also lapse for early retirement and other conditions in accordance with our established policies. upon termination of employment, shares on which restrictions have not lapsed must be returned to us, resulting in restricted stock forfeitures. the fair market value of the stock on the date of grant is amortized and charged to income on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award.

employee stock purchase plan under the espp, eligible employees may have up to 10% of their earnings withheld, subject to some limitations, to be used to purchase shares of our common stock. the espp contains four three-month offering periods commencing on january 1, april 1, july 1 and october 1 of each year. the price at which common stock may be purchased under the espp is equal to 85% of the lower of the fair market value of the common stock on the commencement date or last trading day of each offering period. effective january 1, 2020, this purchase price threshold was changed from 85%
to 90% . under the espp, 74million shares of common stock have been reserved for issuance, of which 54million shares have been sold through the espp since the inception of the plan through december 31, 2019 and 20million shares are available for future issuance. the stock to be offered may be authorized but unissued common shares or treasury shares.
the fair value of espp shares was estimated using the black-scholes option pricing model. the expected volatility was a one-year historical volatility of our common stock. the assumptions and resulting fair values were as follows:

the carrying amount and fair value of our total debt, including short-term borrowings and current maturities of long term debt, is as follows:
of        level 1            2          fair        value       level 1            2          fair        value doll...                                  value                                                 value total  $   11,093    $     868    $   11,961    $  10,327    $    6,726    $   4,041    $   10,767    $  10,344
debt our debt categorized within level 1 on the fair value hierarchy is calculated using quoted prices in active markets for identical liabilities with transactions occurring on the last two days of period-end. our debt categorized within level 2 on the fair value hierarchy is calculated using significant observable inputs for similar liabilities where estimated values are determined from observable data points on our other bonds and on other similarly rated corporate debt or from observable data points of transactions occurring prior to two days from period-end and adjusting for changes in market conditions. differences between the periods presented in our level 1
and level 2 classification of our long-term debt relate to the timing of when transactions are executed. we have no debt categorized within level 3 on the fair value hierarchy based on unobservable inputs.
we are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. we selectively manage these exposures through the use of derivative instruments, including forward foreign exchange contracts, foreign exchange options and interest rate swaps. the objective of our risk management strategy is to minimize the volatility from fluctuations in foreign currency and interest rates. we do not use derivative instruments for trading purposes. the fair value of our forward contracts, options and interest rate swaps was not material as of december 31, 2019 or december 31, 2018 . the counterparties to our derivatives are primarily global commercial and investment banks.
table of contents    item 8 | notes to consolidated financial statements foreign currency exchange risk we have operations in many international locations and are involved in transactions denominated in currencies other than the united states dollar, our functional currency, which exposes us to foreign currency exchange rate risk. techniques in managing foreign currency exchange risk include, but are not limited to, foreign currency borrowing and investing and the use of currency exchange instruments. we attempt to selectively manage significant exposures to potential foreign currency exchange losses based on current market conditions, future operating activities and the associated cost in relation to the perceived risk of loss. the purpose of our foreign currency risk management activities is to minimize the risk that our cash flows from the purchase and sale of products and services in foreign currencies will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates. we use forward contracts and options to manage our exposure to fluctuations in the currencies of certain countries in which we do business internationally. these instruments are not treated as hedges for accounting purposes, generally have an expiration date of one year or less and are not exchange traded. while these instruments are subject to fluctuations in value, the fluctuations are generally offset by the value of the underlying exposures being managed. the use of some of these instruments may limit our ability to benefit from favorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. derivatives are not utilized to manage exposures in some currencies due primarily to the lack of available markets or cost considerations (non-traded currencies). we attempt to manage our working capital position to minimize foreign currency exposure in non-traded currencies and recognize that pricing for the services and products offered in these countries should account for the cost of exchange rate devaluations. we have historically incurred transaction losses in non-traded currencies. the notional amounts of open foreign exchange derivatives were $ 513million at december 31, 2019 and $ 591million at december 31, 2018 . the notional amounts of these instruments do not generally represent amounts exchanged by the parties, and thus are not a measure of our exposure or of the cash requirements related to these contracts. the fair value of our foreign exchange derivatives as of december 31, 2019 and december 31, 2018 is included in "other current assets" in our consolidated balance sheets and was immaterial. the fair value of these instruments is categorized within level 2 on the fair value hierarchy and was determined using a market approach with certain inputs, such as notional amounts hedged, exchange rates, and other terms of the contracts that are observable in the market or can be derived from or corroborated by observable data. interest rate risk we are subject to interest rate risk on our existing long-term debt. our short-
term borrowings do not give rise to significant interest rate risk due to their short-term nature. we had fixed rate long-term debt totaling $ 10.3billion at both december 31, 2019 and december 31, 2018 . we maintain an interest rate management strategy that is intended to mitigate the exposure to changes in interest rates in the aggregate for our debt portfolio. we use interest rate swaps to effectively convert a portion of our fixed rate debt to floating libor-based rates. our interest rate swaps, which expire when the underlying debt matures, are designated as fair value hedges of the underlying debt and are determined to be highly effective. these derivative instruments are marked to market with gains and losses recognized currently in interest expense to offset the respective gains and losses recognized on changes in the fair value of the hedged debt. as of december 31, 2019 , we had an interest rate swap relating to one of our debt instruments with a total notional amount of $ 100million .
table of contents    item 8 | notes to consolidated financial statements note 16 . retirement plans our company and subsidiaries have various plans that cover a significant number of our employees. these plans include defined contribution plans, defined benefit plans and other postretirement plans:
our defined contribution plans provide retirement benefits in return for services rendered. these plans provide an individual account for each participant and have terms that specify how contributions to the
-  participant's account are to be determined rather than the amount of pension benefits the participant is to receive. contributions to these plans are based on a percentage of pre-tax income, after-tax income, or discretionary amounts determined on an annual basis. our expense for the defined contribution plans for continuing operations totaled$206millionin2019,$193millionin2018and$173millionin2017.
our defined benefit plans, which include both funded and unfunded pension plans, define an amount of pension
-  benefit to be provided, usually as a function of age, years of service and/or compensation. the unfunded obligations and net periodic benefit cost of our united states defined benefit plans were not material for the periods presented; and our postretirement plans other than pensions are offered to specific eligible employees. the accumulated
-  benefit obligations and net periodic benefit cost for these plans were not material for the periods presented.
funded status for our international pension plans, at december 31, 2019 , the projected benefit obligation was $ 1.1billion and the fair value of plan assets was $ 1.0billion , which resulted in an unfunded obligation of $ 111million . at december 31, 2018 , the projected benefit obligation was $ 951million and the fair value of plan assets was $
832million , which resulted in an unfunded obligation of $ 119million . the accumulated benefit obligation for our international plans was $ 1.0billion at december 31, 2019 and $ 878million at december 31, 2018 .

(f) other investments primarily includes investments in insurance contracts.
risk management practices for these plans include diversification by issuer, industry and geography, as well as the use of multiple asset classes and investment managers within each asset class. our investment strategy for our united kingdom pension plan, which constituted 79% of our international pension plans' projected benefit obligation at december 31, 2019 and is no longer accruing service benefits, aims to achieve full funding of the benefit obligation, with the plan's assets increasingly composed of investments whose cash flows match the projected liabilities of the plan.

table of contents    item 8 | notes to consolidated financial statements assumed long-term rates of return on plan assets, discount rates for estimating benefit obligations and rates of compensation increases vary by plan according to local economic conditions. where possible, discount rates were determined based on the prevailing market rates of a portfolio of high-quality debt instruments with maturities matching the expected timing of the payment of the benefit obligations. expected long-term rates of return on plan assets were determined based upon an evaluation of our plan assets and historical trends and experience, taking into account current and expected market conditions. other information contributions. funding requirements for each plan are determined based on the local laws of the country where such plan resides. in certain countries the funding requirements are mandatory, while in other countries they are discretionary. we currently expect to contribute $ 17million to our international pension plans in 2020 . benefit payments. expected benefit payments over the next 10years for our international pension plans are as follows: $ 42million in 2020 , $ 43million in 2021
through 2029 . note 17 . new accounting pronouncements standards adopted in 2019 leases effective january 1, 2019, we adopted an accounting standard update issued by the financial accounting standards board (fasb) related to accounting for leases, which requires lessees to record assets and liabilities that arise for all leases on their balance sheet and expanded financial statement disclosures for both lessees and lessors. we adopted this standard using the optional modified retrospective transition method. as such, the comparative financial information has not been restated and continues to be reported under the lease standard in effect during those periods. we also elected other practical expedients provided by the new standard, including the package of practical expedients, the short-
term lease recognition practical expedient in which leases with a term of 12 months or less are not recognized on the balance sheet, and the practical expedient to not separate lease and non-lease components for the majority of our leases. the adoption of this standard resulted in the recognition of approximately $ 1.0billion of operating lease right-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities on our balance sheet as of january 1, 2019. additionally, capital leases have been reclassified on our consolidated balance sheets as of december 31, 2018 to conform to current period presentation. this consisted of $ 88million reclassified from property, plant and equipment to other assets and $ 109million reclassified from long-term debt to other liabilities. the adoption of this standard did not materially impact our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended december 31, 2019 . see note 6

item 7 | executive overview item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (md&a) should be read in conjunction with the consolidated and combined financial statements included in "item 8. financial statements and supplementary data" contained herein.
executive overview financial results we experienced challenging market dynamics in 2019 as our customers in the north america market fundamentally shifted from growth to capital discipline, impacting our business through reduced customer activity and pricing pressure, while the international markets continued their recovery. we executed our value proposition, delivered exceptional safety and service quality, and remained focused on generating strong returns and cash flow. the following graph illustrates our revenue and operating margins for each operating segment over the past three years.
during 2019, we generated total company revenue of $22.4 billion, a 7% decrease from the $24.0 billion of revenue generated in 2018, with our completion and production (c&p) segment declining by 12% and our drilling and evaluation (d&e) segment improving by 4%. we reported a total company operating loss of approximately $448 million in 2019 driven by $2.5 billion of impairments and other charges. this compares to operating income of $2.5 billion in 2018. a significant decline in stimulation activity and pricing in north america land during 2019 negatively impacted operating results, coupled with reduced drilling activity in the middle east.
our north america revenue declined 18% in 2019, as compared to 2018, driven by reduced customer activity and pricing, and our decision to focus on customers that provide better returns. the north america land rig count decreased 26% from its high point in early 2019 to its low point in december 2019, with a 9% drop from the third to the fourth quarter. customer activity declined across all basins in north america land during the fourth quarter of 2019, affecting both our drilling and completions businesses. this reduction in activity resulted in part from our north american customers' increase in capital discipline. with this backdrop, we moved quickly to implement a service delivery improvement strategy and initiate cost reductions, which included proactively managing our fleet count to anticipated levels of near-term demand, executing personnel reductions, and rationalizing our real estate portfolio. we performed this exercise with a focus on adjusting our cost structure to improve financial performance. we did, however, experience growth in many of our non-hydraulic fracturing businesses and will continue to focus on these businesses going forward.
with strong growth opportunities internationally, we continued to benefit from the recovery in this market as revenue increased 10% in 2019, as compared to 2018, outgrowing the international rig count for the second year in a row. all international regions significantly contributed to this revenue increase, led by asia pacific, latin america and europe, with meaningful contributions from both of our divisions. our completion and production division led with a 13% increase in revenue due to higher activity in mature fields in europe and unconventionals in argentina, the united arab emirates, and australia, while our drilling and evaluation division grew international revenues by 8% with increased activity levels in all markets, particularly norway, mexico, china and nigeria.
item 7 | executive overview business outlook
2019 closed the decade of the shale revolution that transformed the united states into the world's top hydrocarbon producer. our company was an early participant in this development and invested and innovated alongside our customers since the beginning. as unconventionals enter the maturation phase and as capital spending by our customers has decreased, we remain committed to the north american market and taking appropriate actions to thrive in the new environment. the cost containment measures we took in the fourth quarter of 2019 should benefit our business as we adapt to this dynamic market environment.
in north america, the shale industry is facing its biggest challenge since the 2015 downturn with a strong focus on capital discipline. in the fourth quarter of 2019, the market experienced a long-awaited attrition of equipment. more equipment is expected to exit the market in 2020 driven by lower demand and increasing service intensity. after systematically rationalizing and reducing equipment supply in 2019 to adjust to changing activity levels, in 2020 we plan to provide the capacity that maximizes the returns on our overall fleet. we also expect customer spending behavior to remain similar to 2019 in which some operators spend a higher portion of their budgets earlier in the year. with north america customer spending expected to decline again in 2020, we will continue our strategy to maximize returns with an appropriate level of service capacity while continuing to invest in technologies that improve margins. we plan to continue strategic growth opportunities with our non-hydraulic fracturing businesses. our wireline and perforating, artificial lift, and specialty chemical product lines all produced strong double-digit revenue growth in 2019, despite the overall market softness in u.s. land, and we intend to build on this momentum and spread it to other services.
internationally, we expect a third consecutive year of customer spending growth. we believe we have the right footprint and an enhanced technology portfolio to compete successfully across the international markets. our pipeline of projects is strong and we expect continued growth in our drilling and evaluation division as our icruise rotary steerable drilling platform roll-out continues, new offshore drilling activity begins around the world, and we operate a full year of our norway integrated contracts. pricing in certain international regions is improving, and we expect this momentum to continue in 2020. we are gaining pricing traction on new work and contract renewals, and we are making strategic choices about the work we pursue to deliver returns-driven growth in the international markets. we intend to be prudent with capital allocation with a strategic reallocation of assets to opportunities with better returns, driving the right pricing discussions with customers. we believe that with increased activity, disciplined capital allocation, pricing improvements, and our ability to compete for a larger share of high-margin services, we will achieve international margin expansion.
in 2020, we will continue to focus on delivering margin expansion and strong returns and cash flow while continuing to build the foundation for a longer-term recovery. we intend to dynamically respond to the changing market, invest effectively and remain flexible in our cost structure. we believe in responsible capital stewardship, prioritizing capital efficiency, and investing in the technologies that deliver differentiation and returns. we will continue to collaborate and engineer solutions to maximize asset value for our customers and align our business with customers in the fastest growing market segments with attention to the sustainability of our business, minimizing environmental impacts and acting as a responsible corporate citizen.
we intend to continue to strengthen our product service lines through a combination of organic growth, investment and selective acquisitions. we plan to continue executing the following strategies in 2020:
-   prudently allocating capital into strategic markets around the world;
-   collaborating with, and engineering solutions to maximize asset value for, our customers;
-   leveraging our broad technology offerings to provide value to our customers and enable them to more efficiently drill and complete their wells;
-   investing in technology that will help our customers reduce reservoir uncertainty, increase operational efficiency and improve well productivity - as well as help us reduce our costs and deliver acceptable returns;
-   improving working capital and managing our balance sheet to maximize our financial flexibility;
-   seeking additional ways to be one of the most cost-efficient service providers in the industry by optimizing costs, maintaining capital discipline and leveraging our scale and breadth of operations; and
-   striving to achieve superior returns and cash flow generation for our shareholders.
our operating performance and business outlook are described in more detail in "business environment and results of operations."
item 7 | executive overview capital expenditures during 2019, our capital expenditures were approximately $1.5 billion, a decrease of 24% from 2018, which were predominantly made in our sperry drilling, production enhancement, artificial lift, wireline and perforating, and production solutions product service lines. we intend to reduce our capital expenditures by 20% in 2020 to approximately $1.2 billion. we believe this level of spend, approximately 60% of which we plan to allocate to our completion and production division, will allow continued investments in our anticipated international growth while continuing to adjust our business to the current conditions in north america. within this reduced budget, we will continue investing in and growing certain of our businesses, expanding our artificial lift footprint, continuing our global roll-out of our icruise rotary steerable drilling platform, and focusing on digital efforts and new technologies aimed at improving our efficiency and reducing our operating costs. however, the allocation of capital expenditures across business lines may change depending on market conditions. we believe our capital allocation decisions are consistent with our focus on generating strong cash flow for our investors, regardless of the market environment.
financial markets, liquidity and capital resources we believe we have invested our cash balances conservatively and secured sufficient financing to help mitigate any near-term negative impact on our operations from adverse market conditions. as of december 31, 2019, we had $2.3 billion of cash and equivalents and $3.5 billion of available committed bank credit under our revolving credit facility which expires in 2024. we believe this provides us with sufficient liquidity to address the challenges and opportunities of the current market. for additional information on market conditions, see "liquidity and capital resources" and "business environment and results of operations."
item 7 | liquidity and capital resources liquidity and capital resources as of december 31, 2019, we had $2.3 billion of cash and equivalents, compared to $2.0 billion of cash and equivalents at december 31, 2018.
-   cash flows from operating activities were $2.4 billion. included within cash flows from operating activities was a negative impact from the primary components of our working capital (receivables, inventories and accounts payable) of a net $161 million, primarily associated with reduced payables and a build-up of inventory related to our strategic technology deployments, coupled with approximately $144 million of severance payments.
-   capital expenditures were $1.5 billion and were predominantly made in our sperry drilling, production enhancement, artificial lift, wireline and perforating and production solutions product service lines.
future sources and uses of cash we manufacture most of our own equipment, which provides some flexibility to increase or decrease our capital expenditures based on market conditions. capital spending for 2020 is currently expected to be approximately $1.2 billion, a reduction of approximately 20% from 2019. for additional information on capital expenditures, see "executive overview."
we are actively evaluating our debt maturity profile and other opportunities around uses of cash, which could include paying off portions of near-term debt, funding acquisitions and organic growth projects or shareholder return opportunities.
currently, our quarterly dividend rate is $0.18 per common share, or approximately $158 million. subject to board of directors approval, our intention is to continue paying dividends at our current rate during 2020. our board of directors has authorized a program to repurchase our common stock from time to time. approximately $5.2 billion remained authorized for repurchases as of december 31, 2019 and may be used for open market and other share purchases.
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations and other long-term liabilities as of december 31, 2019:
other long-term liabilities (d)          24               -             -               -             -               -                24
(a)   represents principal amounts of long-term debt, including current maturities of debt, which excludes any unamortized debt issuance costs and discounts.
(c)   amount in 2020 primarily represents certain purchase orders for goods and services utilized in the ordinary course of our business.
(d)   represents pension funding obligations associated with international plans for 2020 only and are based on assumptions that are subject to change as we are currently not able to reasonably estimate our contributions for years after 2020.
item 7 | liquidity and capital resources unrecognized tax benefits, excluding penalties and interest, at december 31, 2019, of which we estimate $235 million may require a cash payment by us. we estimate that $205 million of the cash payment will not be settled within the next 12 months.
other factors affecting liquidity financial position in current market. as of december 31, 2019, we had $2.3 billion of cash and equivalents and $3.5 billion of available committed bank credit under our revolving credit facility which expires in 2024. furthermore, we have no financial covenants or material adverse change provisions in our bank agreements, and our debt maturities extend over a long period of time. we believe our cash on hand, cash flows generated from operations and our available credit facility will provide sufficient liquidity to address the challenges and opportunities of the current market and our global cash needs in 2020, including capital expenditures, working capital investments, dividends, if any, and contingent liabilities.
guarantee agreements. in the normal course of business, we have agreements with financial institutions under which approximately $2.1 billion of letters of credit, bank guarantees, or surety bonds were outstanding as of december 31, 2019. some of the outstanding letters of credit have triggering events that would entitle a bank to require cash collateralization.
credit ratings. our credit ratings with standard & poor's (s&p) remain a- for our long-term debt and a-2 for our short-term debt, with a negative outlook. our credit ratings with moody's investors service (moody's) remain baa1 for our long-term debt and p-2 for our short-term debt, with a stable outlook.
customer receivables. in line with industry practice, we bill our customers for our services in arrears and are, therefore, subject to our customers delaying or failing to pay our invoices. in weak economic environments, we may experience increased delays and failures to pay our invoices due to, among other reasons, a reduction in our customers' cash flow from operations and their access to the credit markets, as well as unsettled political conditions. if our customers delay paying or fail to pay us a significant amount of our outstanding receivables, it could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, consolidated results of operations and consolidated financial condition. see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion.
item 7 | business environment and results of operations business environment and results of operations we operate in more than 80 countries throughout the world to provide a comprehensive range of services and products to the energy industry. our revenue is generated from the sale of services and products to major, national, and independent oil and natural gas companies worldwide. the industry we serve is highly competitive with many substantial competitors in each segment of our business. in 2019, 2018 and 2017, based on the location of services provided and products sold, 51%, 58% and 53%, respectively, of our consolidated revenue was from the united states. no other country accounted for more than 10% of our revenue.
operations in some countries may be adversely affected by unsettled political conditions, acts of terrorism, civil unrest, force majeure, war or other armed conflict, health or similar issues, sanctions, expropriation or other governmental actions, inflation, changes in foreign currency exchange rates, foreign currency exchange restrictions and highly inflationary currencies, as well as other geopolitical factors. we believe the geographic diversification of our business activities reduces the risk that an interruption of operations in any one country, other than the united states, would be materially adverse to our consolidated results of operations.
activity within our business segments is significantly impacted by spending on upstream exploration, development and production programs by our customers. also impacting our activity is the status of the global economy, which impacts oil and natural gas consumption.
some of the more significant determinants of current and future spending levels of our customers are oil and natural gas prices and our customers' expectations about future prices, global oil supply and demand, completions intensity, the world economy, the availability of credit, government regulation and global stability, which together drive worldwide drilling and completions activity. additionally, many of our customers in north america have shifted their strategy from production growth to operating within cash flow and generating returns. lower oil and natural gas prices usually translate into lower exploration and production budgets and lower rig count, while the opposite is usually true for higher oil and natural gas prices. our financial performance is therefore significantly affected by oil and natural gas prices and worldwide rig activity, which are summarized in the tables below.
the following table shows the average oil and natural gas prices for west texas intermediate (wti), united kingdom brent crude oil and henry hub natural gas:
(2) natural gas price measured in dollars per million british thermal units (btu), or mmbtu the historical average rig counts based on the weekly baker hughes rig count data were as follows:
item 7 | business environment and results of operations crude oil prices have been extremely volatile over the past five years. wti oil spot prices declined significantly beginning in 2014 from a peak price of $108 per barrel in june 2014 to a low of $26 per barrel in february 2016, a level which had not been experienced since 2003. since the low point experienced in early 2016, oil prices increased substantially, with wti oil spot prices reaching a high of $77 per barrel in june 2018. in late 2018, oil prices again declined with wti oil spot prices reaching a low of $44 per barrel in december, but rising to a high of $66 per barrel in april 2019. the average full year 2019 wti crude oil spot price of $57 decreased 12% from the average 2018 price.
in the united states energy information administration (eia) january 2020 "short term energy outlook," the eia projected brent prices to average $65 per barrel in 2020 and $68 per barrel in 2021, while wti prices were projected to average approximately $5.50 less per barrel through 2020 and 2021. the international energy agency's (iea) january 2020 "oil market report" forecasts 2020 global demand to average approximately 101.5 million barrels per day, an increase of 1% from 2019, driven by increases in the asia pacific region, while all other regions remain approximately the same.
the henry hub natural gas spot price in the united states averaged $2.54 per mmbtu in 2019, a decrease of $0.63 per mmbtu, or 20%, from 2018. the eia january 2020 "short term energy outlook" projects henry hub natural gas prices to average $2.33 per mmbtu in 2020 and some upward price pressures to emerge in 2021 causing the average price to increase to $2.54 per mmbtu.
north america operations the average north america rig count decreased 146 rigs, or 12%, for the full year 2019 as compared to 2018. the market for both drilling and completion services softened during the second half of 2019 with a continued reduction in activity as customers were focused on staying within their capital spending budgets. some of the other factors leading to activity reductions included an oversupplied gas market and concerns about oil demand softness. in 2020, based on current information, we expect customers in u.s. land to reduce capital spending by approximately 10% from 2019 levels.
international operations the average international rig count for 2019 increased 110 rigs, or 11% compared to 2018. we continue to see a broad-based recovery across numerous international geographies, and we expect more revenue and margin growth opportunities coming from mature fields and shallow water markets in 2020. barring a global economic slowdown, broader offshore recovery should add momentum to the international growth. in 2020, we expect the international spend by our customers to slightly increase, making it the third consecutive year of spending growth.
venezuela. the general license issued by the office of foreign assets control (ofac) of the u.s. department of treasury, which allows us to continue operating in venezuela despite ofac sanctions imposed against the venezuelan energy industry, was set to expire on july 27, 2019, but has been extended several times and is now set to expire on april 22, 2020. consequently, unless ofac further extends the term of the general license, we will cease operations in venezuela on that date in order to comply with the sanctions. in that event, it is unlikely that we will be able to remove our assets that remain in venezuela and those assets may be expropriated. since we have previously written down all of our investment in venezuela and have maintained limited operations in this country during the general license period, we do not expect the expiration of the license to have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated results of operations and consolidated financial condition.
item 7 | results of operations in 2019 compared to 2018

we reported a consolidated operating loss of $448 million in 2019 driven by $2.5 billion of impairments and other charges. this compares to operating income of $2.5 billion in 2018, which includes $265 million of impairments and other charges related to venezuela. a significant decline in stimulation activity and pricing in north america land during 2019 negatively impacted operating results, coupled with reduced drilling activity in the middle east. see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion on impairments and other charges.
operating segments completion and production completion and production revenue was $14.0 billion in 2019, a decrease of $1.9 billion, or 12%, compared to 2018. operating income was $1.7 billion in 2019, a 27% decrease from $2.3 billion in 2018. these results were primarily driven by reduced activity and pricing for stimulation services and lower completion tool sales in north america land. partially offsetting these results were increased artificial lift activity in north america land, higher completion tool sales in the gulf of mexico, increased pressure pumping activity and higher completion tool sales in the eastern hemisphere, and higher pressure pumping activity in latin america.
drilling and evaluation drilling and evaluation revenue was $8.4 billion in 2019, an increase of $355 million, or 4%, from 2018. these results were primarily driven by a global increase in wireline activity, increased activity in multiple product service lines in the north sea and mexico, coupled with improved drilling activity in asia pacific and higher testing activity in the eastern hemisphere. these improvements were partially offset by decreased activity for drilling-related services in north america land and lower project management activity in the middle east.
item 7 | results of operations in 2019 compared to 2018
operating income was $642 million in 2019, a decrease of $103 million, or 14%, compared to 2018. these results were primarily driven by a decline in drilling activity in north america land, coupled with lower project management and drilling activity in the middle east. partially offsetting these results were global improvements in wireline activity and increased drilling-related services in europe/africa/cis.
geographic regions north america north america revenue was $11.9 billion in 2019, an 18% decrease compared to 2018, resulting from lower activity and pricing in north america land, primarily associated with stimulation and drilling-related activity. this decline was partially offset by increased artificial lift activity in north america land and improved completion tool sales in the gulf of mexico.
latin america latin america revenue was $2.4 billion in 2019, a 14% increase compared to 2018, resulting primarily from increased activity in multiple product service lines in mexico and argentina, partially offset by decreased well construction activity in brazil.
europe/africa/cis europe/africa/cis revenue was $3.3 billion in 2019, a 12% increase compared to 2018. the increases were due to higher activity for multiple product service lines throughout the region, primarily in the north sea, israel and russia, partially offset by decreased pipeline services across the region.
middle east/asia middle east/asia revenue was $4.9 billion in 2019, a 7% increase compared to 2018. the increases were due to higher activity throughout the region, primarily related to pressure pumping, completion tool sales and wireline activity, partially offset by decreased drilling activity and project management activity in the middle east.
other operating items impairments and other charges were $2.5 billion in 2019, consisting of asset impairments, primarily associated with pressure pumping and drilling equipment, as well as severance and other costs incurred as we adjusted our cost structure during the year. this compares to $265 million of impairments and other charges recorded in 2018, representing a write-down of all of our remaining investment in venezuela. see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion on these charges.
nonoperating items effective tax rate. during 2019, we recorded a total income tax provision of $7 million on a pre-tax loss of $1.1 billion, resulting in an effective tax rate of -0.6%. during 2018, we recorded a total income tax provision $157 million on pre-tax income of $1.8 billion, resulting in an effective tax rate of 8.7%. see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for significant drivers of these effective tax rates.
item 7 | results of operations in 2018 compared to 2017
information related to the comparison of our operating results between the years 2018 and 2017 is included in "item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" of our 2018 form 10-k filed with the sec and is incorporated by reference into this annual report on form 10-k.
item 7 | critical accounting estimates critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements requires the use of judgments and estimates. our critical accounting policies are described below to provide a better understanding of how we develop our assumptions and judgments about future events and related estimates and how they can impact our financial statements. a critical accounting estimate is one that requires our most difficult, subjective or complex judgments and assessments and is fundamental to our results of operations. we identified our most critical accounting estimates to be:
-   forecasting our effective income tax rate, including our future ability to utilize foreign tax credits and the realizability of deferred tax assets (including net operating loss carryforwards), and providing for uncertain tax positions;
-   legal and investigation matters;
-   valuations of long-lived assets, including intangible assets and goodwill;
-   purchase price allocation for acquired businesses; and
-   allowance for bad debts.
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions we believe to be reasonable according to the current facts and circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. we believe the following are the critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements, as well as the significant estimates and judgments affecting the application of these policies. this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this report.
income tax accounting we recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and use an asset and liability approach in recognizing the amount of deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. we apply the following basic principles in accounting for our income taxes:
-   a current tax liability or asset is recognized for the estimated taxes payable or refundable on tax returns for the current year;
-   a deferred tax liability or asset is recognized for the estimated future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards;
-   the measurement of current and deferred tax liabilities and assets is based on provisions of the enacted tax law, and the effects of potential future changes in tax laws or rates are not considered; and
-   the value of deferred tax assets is reduced, if necessary, by the amount of any tax benefits that, based on available evidence, are not expected to be realized.
we determine deferred taxes separately for each tax-paying component (an entity or a group of entities that is consolidated for tax purposes) in each tax jurisdiction. that determination includes the following procedures:
-   measuring the total deferred tax liability for taxable temporary differences using the applicable tax rate;
-   measuring the total deferred tax asset for deductible temporary differences and operating loss carryforwards using the applicable tax rate;
-   measuring the deferred tax assets for each type of tax credit carryforward; and
-   reducing the deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if, based on available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
our methodology for recording income taxes requires a significant amount of judgment in the use of assumptions and estimates. additionally, we use forecasts of certain tax elements, such as taxable income and foreign tax credit utilization, as well as evaluate the feasibility of implementing tax planning strategies. given the inherent uncertainty involved with the use of such variables, there can be significant variation between anticipated and actual results. unforeseen events may significantly impact these variables, and changes to these variables could have a material impact on our income tax accounts related to both continuing and discontinued operations.
item 7 | critical accounting estimates we have operations in more than 80 countries. consequently, we are subject to the jurisdiction of a significant number of taxing authorities. the income earned in these various jurisdictions is taxed on differing bases, including net income actually earned, net income deemed earned and revenue-based tax withholding. our tax filings are routinely examined in the normal course of business by tax authorities. the final determination of our income tax liabilities involves the interpretation of local tax laws, tax treaties and related authorities in each jurisdiction, as well as the significant use of estimates and assumptions regarding the scope of future operations and results achieved and the timing and nature of income earned and expenditures incurred. the final determination of tax audits or changes in the operating environment, including changes in tax law and currency/repatriation controls, could impact the determination of our income tax liabilities for a tax year and have an adverse effect on our financial statements.
tax filings of our subsidiaries, unconsolidated affiliates and related entities are routinely examined in the normal course of business by tax authorities. these examinations may result in assessments of additional taxes, which we work to resolve with the tax authorities and through the judicial process. predicting the outcome of disputed assessments involves some uncertainty. factors such as the availability of settlement procedures, willingness of tax authorities to negotiate and the operation and impartiality of judicial systems vary across the different tax jurisdictions and may significantly influence the ultimate outcome. we review the facts for each assessment, and then utilize assumptions and estimates to determine the most likely outcome and provide taxes, interest and penalties as needed based on this outcome. we provide for uncertain tax positions pursuant to current accounting standards, which prescribe a minimum recognition threshold and measurement methodology that a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements. the standards also provide guidance for derecognition classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition.
legal and investigation matters as discussed in note 10 of our consolidated financial statements, we are subject to various legal and investigation matters arising in the ordinary course of business. as of december 31, 2019, we have accrued an estimate of the probable and estimable costs for the resolution of some of our legal and investigation matters, which is not material to our consolidated financial statements. for other matters for which the liability is not probable and reasonably estimable, we have not accrued any amounts. attorneys in our legal department monitor and manage all claims filed against us and review all pending investigations. generally, the estimate of probable costs related to these matters is developed in consultation with internal and outside legal counsel representing us. our estimates are based upon an analysis of potential results, assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies. the accuracy of these estimates is impacted by, among other things, the complexity of the issues and the amount of due diligence we have been able to perform. we attempt to resolve these matters through settlements, mediation and arbitration proceedings when possible. if the actual settlement costs, final judgments or fines, after appeals, differ from our estimates, there may be a material adverse effect on our future financial results. we have in the past recorded significant adjustments to our initial estimates of these types of contingencies.
value of long-lived assets, including intangible assets and goodwill we carry a variety of long-lived assets on our balance sheet including property, plant and equipment, goodwill and other intangibles. impairment is the condition that exists when the carrying amount of a long-lived asset exceeds its fair value, and any impairment charge that we record reduces our operating income. goodwill is the excess of the cost of an acquired entity over the net of the amounts assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed. we conduct impairment tests on goodwill annually, during the third quarter, or more frequently whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate an impairment may exist. we conduct impairment tests on long-lived assets, other than goodwill, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
when conducting an impairment test on long-lived assets, other than goodwill, we first group individual assets based on a the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows from other assets, which requires some judgment. we then compare estimated future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset group to its carrying amount. if the undiscounted cash flows are less than the asset group's carrying amount, we then determine the asset group's fair value by using a discounted cash flow analysis. this analysis is based on estimates such as management's short-term and long-term forecast of operating performance, including revenue growth rates and expected profitability margins, estimates of the remaining useful life and service potential of the assets within the asset group, and a discount rate based on our weighted average cost of capital. an impairment loss is measured and recorded as the amount by which the asset group's carrying amount exceeds its fair value. see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for impairments and other charges recorded during the year ended december 31, 2019.
item 7 | critical accounting estimates we perform our goodwill impairment assessment for each reporting unit, which is the same as our reportable segments, the completion and production division and the drilling and evaluation division, comparing the estimated fair value of each reporting unit to the reporting unit's carrying value, including goodwill. we estimate the fair value for each reporting unit using a discounted cash flow analysis based on management's short-term and long-term forecast of operating performance. this analysis includes significant assumptions regarding discount rates, revenue growth rates, expected profitability margins, forecasted capital expenditures and the timing of expected future cash flows based on market conditions. if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is not considered impaired. if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, an impairment loss is measured and recorded.
the impairment assessments discussed above incorporate inherent uncertainties, including projected commodity pricing, supply and demand for our services and future market conditions, which are difficult to predict in volatile economic environments and could result in impairment charges in future periods if actual results materially differ from the estimated assumptions utilized in our forecasts. if market conditions further deteriorate, including crude oil prices significantly declining and remaining at low levels for a sustained period of time, we could be required to record additional impairments of the carrying value of our long-lived assets in the future which could have a material adverse impact on our operating results. see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for our accounting policies related to long-lived assets.
acquisitions - purchase price allocation we allocate the purchase price of an acquired business to its identifiable assets and liabilities based on estimated fair values. the excess of the purchase price over the amount allocated to the assets and liabilities, if any, is recorded as goodwill. we use all available information to estimate fair values, including quoted market prices, the carrying value of acquired assets and widely accepted valuation techniques such as discounted cash flows. we engage third-party appraisal firms when appropriate to assist in fair value determination of inventories, identifiable intangible assets and any other significant assets or liabilities. the judgments made in determining the estimated fair value assigned to each class of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, as well as asset lives, can materially impact our results of operations. our acquisitions may also include contingent consideration, or earn-out provisions, which provide for additional consideration to be paid to the seller if certain future conditions are met. these earn-out provisions are estimated and recognized at fair value at the acquisition date based on projected earnings or other financial metrics over specified periods after the acquisition date. these estimates are reviewed during the specified period and adjusted based on actual results.
allowance for bad debts we evaluate our global accounts receivable through a continuous process of assessing our portfolio on an individual customer and overall basis. this process consists of a thorough review of historical collection experience, current aging status of the customer accounts, financial condition of our customers and whether the receivables involve retainages. we also consider the economic environment of our customers, both from a marketplace and geographic perspective, in evaluating the need for an allowance. based on our review of these factors, we establish or adjust allowances for specific customers. this process involves a high degree of judgment and estimation, and frequently involves significant dollar amounts. accordingly, our results of operations can be affected by adjustments to the allowance due to actual write-offs that differ from estimated amounts.
at december 31, 2019, our allowance for bad debts totaled $776 million, or 15.4% of notes and accounts receivable before the allowance. at december 31, 2018, our allowance for bad debts totaled $738 million, or 12.8% of notes and accounts receivable before the allowance. the allowance for bad debts in both years is primarily comprised of accounts receivable with our primary customer in venezuela. a hypothetical 100 basis point change in our estimate of the collectability of our notes and accounts receivable balance as of december 31, 2019 would have resulted in a $51 million adjustment to 2019 total operating costs and expenses. see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for further information.
off balance sheet arrangements at december 31, 2019, we had no material off balance sheet arrangements. in the normal course of business, we have agreements with financial institutions under which approximately $2.1 billion of letters of credit, bank guarantees or surety bonds were outstanding as of december 31, 2019. some of the outstanding letters of credit have triggering events that would entitle a bank to require cash collateralization. none of these off balance sheet arrangements either has, or is likely to have, a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.
item 7 | financial instrument market risk financial instrument market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. we selectively manage these exposures through the use of derivative instruments, including forward foreign exchange contracts, foreign exchange options and interest rate swaps. the objective of our risk management strategy is to minimize the volatility from fluctuations in foreign currency and interest rates. we do not use derivative instruments for trading purposes. the counterparties to our forward contracts, options and interest rate swaps are global commercial and investment banks.
we use a sensitivity analysis model to measure the impact of potential adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. with respect to foreign exchange sensitivity, after consideration of the impact from our foreign exchange hedges, a hypothetical 10% adverse change in the value of all our foreign currency positions relative to the united states dollar as of december 31, 2019 would result in a $91 million, pre-tax, loss for our net monetary assets denominated in currencies other than united states dollars. with respect to interest rates sensitivity, after consideration of the impact from our interest rate swap, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in the libor rate would result in approximately an additional $1 million of interest charges for the year ended december 31, 2019.
there are certain limitations inherent in the sensitivity analyses presented, primarily due to the assumption that exchange rates and interest rates change instantaneously in an equally adverse fashion. in addition, the analyses are unable to reflect the complex market reactions that normally would arise from the market shifts modeled. while this is our best estimate of the impact of the various scenarios, these estimates should not be viewed as forecasts.

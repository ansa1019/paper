item 1a    risk factors our business is subject to various risks and uncertainties. any of the risks described below could materially, adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
the categories in which we participate are very competitive, and if we are not able to compete effectively, our results of operations could be adversely affected.
the consumer and pet food categories in which we participate are very competitive. our principal competitors in these categories are manufacturers, as well as retailers with their own branded and private label products. competitors market and sell their products through brick-and-mortar stores and e-commerce. all of our principal competitors have substantial financial, marketing, and other resources. in most product categories, we compete not only with other widely advertised branded products, but also with regional brands and with generic and private label products that are generally sold at lower prices. competition in our product categories is based on
product innovation, product quality, price, brand recognition and loyalty, effectiveness of marketing, promotional activity, convenient ordering and delivery to the consumer, and the ability to identify and satisfy consumer preferences. if our large competitors were to seek an advantage through pricing or promotional changes, we could choose to do the same, which could adversely affect our margins and profitability. if we did not do the same, our revenues and market share could be adversely affected. our market share and revenue growth could also be adversely impacted if we are not successful in introducing innovative products in response to changing consumer demands or by new product introductions of our competitors. if we are unable to build and sustain brand equity by offering recognizably superior product quality, we may be unable to maintain premium pricing over generic and private label products.
we may be unable to maintain our profit margins in the face of a consolidating retail environment.
there has been significant consolidation in the grocery industry, resulting in customers with increased purchasing power. in addition, large retail customers may seek to use their position to improve their profitability through improved efficiency, lower pricing, increased reliance on their own brand name products, increased emphasis on generic and other economy brands, and increased promotional programs. if we are unable to use our scale, marketing expertise, product innovation, knowledge of consumers needs, and category leadership positions to respond to these demands, our profitability and volume growth could be negatively impacted. in addition, the loss of any large customer could adversely affect our sales and profits. in fiscal 2019, walmart accounted for 20 percent of our consolidated net sales and 31 percent of net sales of our north america retail segment. petsmart and petco accounted for 36 percent and 14 percent, respectively, of our pet segments net sales in fiscal 2019. national pet superstore chains have experienced reduced store traffic. if national pet superstore chains continue to experience reduced store traffic, or experience any operational difficulties, our pet segment operating results may be adversely affected. for more information on significant customers, please see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report.
price changes for the commodities we depend on for raw materials, packaging, and energy may adversely affect our profitability.
the principal raw materials that we use are commodities that experience price volatility caused by external conditions such as weather, product scarcity, limited sources of supply, commodity market fluctuations, currency fluctuations, trade tariffs, and changes in governmental agricultural and energy policies and regulations. commodity price changes may result in unexpected increases in raw material, packaging, and energy costs. if we are unable to increase productivity to offset these increased costs or increase our prices, we may experience reduced margins and profitability. we do not fully hedge against changes in commodity prices, and the risk management procedures that we do use may not always work as we intend.
volatility in the market value of derivatives we use to manage exposures to fluctuations in commodity prices will cause volatility in our gross margins and net earnings.
we utilize derivatives to manage price risk for some of our principal ingredient and energy costs, including grains (oats, wheat, and corn), oils (principally soybean), dairy products, natural gas, and diesel fuel. changes in the values of these derivatives are recorded in earnings currently, resulting in volatility in both gross margin and net earnings. these gains and losses are reported in cost of sales in our consolidated statements of earnings and in unallocated corporate items outside our segment operating results until we utilize the underlying input in our manufacturing process, at which time the gains and losses are reclassified to segment operating profit. we also record our grain inventories at net realizable value. we may experience volatile earnings as a result of these accounting treatments.
if we are not efficient in our production, our profitability could suffer as a result of the highly competitive environment in which we operate.
our future success and earnings growth depend in part on our ability to be efficient in the production and manufacture of our products in highly competitive markets. gaining additional efficiencies may become more
difficult over time. our failure to reduce costs through productivity gains or by eliminating redundant costs resulting from acquisitions or divestitures could adversely affect our profitability and weaken our competitive position. many productivity initiatives involve complex reorganization of manufacturing facilities and production lines. such manufacturing realignment may result in the interruption of production, which may negatively impact product volume and margins. we periodically engage in restructuring and cost savings initiatives designed to increase our efficiency and reduce expenses. if we are unable to execute those initiatives as planned, we may not realize all or any of the anticipated benefits, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations.
disruption of our supply chain could adversely affect our business.
our ability to make, move, and sell products is critical to our success. damage or disruption to raw material supplies or our manufacturing or distribution capabilities due to weather, including any potential effects of climate change, natural disaster, fire, terrorism, cyber-attack, pandemic, strikes, import/export restrictions, or other factors could impair our ability to manufacture or sell our products. many of our product lines are manufactured at a single location. our suppliers policies and practices can damage our reputation and the quality and safety of our products. failure to take adequate steps to mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such events, or to effectively manage such events if they occur, particularly when a product is sourced from a single supplier or location, could adversely affect our business and results of operations, as well as require additional resources to restore our supply chain.
concerns with the safety and quality of food products could cause consumers to avoid certain food products or ingredients.
we could be adversely affected if consumers in our principal markets lose confidence in the safety and quality of certain food products or ingredients. adverse publicity about these types of concerns, whether or not valid, may discourage consumers from buying our products or cause production and delivery disruptions.
if our products become adulterated, misbranded, or mislabeled, we might need to recall those items and may experience product liability claims if consumers or their pets are injured.
we may need to recall some of our products if they become adulterated, misbranded, or mislabeled. a widespread product recall could result in significant losses due to the costs of a recall, the destruction of product inventory, and lost sales due to the unavailability of product for a period of time. we could also suffer losses from a significant product liability judgment against us. a significant product recall or product liability case could also result in adverse publicity, damage to our reputation, and a loss of consumer confidence in our products, which could have an adverse effect on our business results and the value of our brands.
we may be unable to anticipate changes in consumer preferences and trends, which may result in decreased demand for our products.
our success depends in part on our ability to anticipate the tastes, eating habits, and purchasing behaviors of consumers and to offer products that appeal to their preferences in channels where they shop. consumer preferences and category-level consumption may change from time to time and can be affected by a number of different trends and other factors. if we fail to anticipate, identify or react to these changes and trends, such as adapting to emerging e-commerce channels, or to introduce new and improved products on a timely basis, we may experience reduced demand for our products, which would in turn cause our revenues and profitability to suffer. similarly, demand for our products could be affected by consumer concerns regarding the health effects of ingredients such as sodium, trans fats, genetically modified organisms, sugar, processed wheat, or other product ingredients or attributes.
we may be unable to grow our market share or add products that are in faster growing and more profitable categories.
the food industrys growth potential is constrained by population growth. our success depends in part on our ability to grow our business faster than populations are growing in the markets that we serve. one way to achieve that growth is to enhance our portfolio by adding innovative new products in faster growing and more profitable categories. our future results will also depend on our ability to increase market share in our existing product categories. if we do not succeed in developing innovative products for new and existing categories, our growth and profitability could be adversely affected.
economic downturns could limit consumer demand for our products.
the willingness of consumers to purchase our products depends in part on local economic conditions. in periods of economic uncertainty, consumers may purchase more generic, private label, and other economy brands and may forego certain purchases altogether. in those circumstances, we could experience a reduction in sales of higher margin products or a shift in our product mix to lower margin offerings. in addition, as a result of economic conditions or competitive actions, we may be unable to raise our prices sufficiently to protect margins. consumers may also reduce the amount of food that they consume away from home at customers that purchase products from our convenience stores & foodservice segment. any of these events could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.
our results may be negatively impacted if consumers do not maintain their favorable perception of our brands.
maintaining and continually enhancing the value of our many iconic brands is critical to the success of our business. the value of our brands is based in large part on the degree to which consumers react and respond positively to these brands. brand value could diminish significantly due to a number of factors, including consumer perception that we have acted in an irresponsible manner, adverse publicity about our products, our failure to maintain the quality of our products, the failure of our products to deliver consistently positive consumer experiences, concerns about food safety, or our products becoming unavailable to consumers. consumer demand for our products may also be impacted by changes in the level of advertising or promotional support. the use of social and digital media by consumers, us, and third parties increases the speed and extent that information or misinformation and opinions can be shared. negative posts or comments about us, our brands, or our products on social or digital media could seriously damage our brands and reputation. if we do not maintain the favorable perception of our brands, our business results could be negatively impacted.
our international operations are subject to political and economic risks.
in fiscal 2019, 26 percent of our consolidated net sales were generated outside of the united states. we are accordingly subject to a number of risks relating to doing business internationally, any of which could significantly harm our business. these risks include:
   political and economic instability;
   exchange controls and currency exchange rates;
   compliance with anti-corruption regulations;
   uncertainty relating to the united kingdoms planned exit from the european union;
   foreign tax treaties and policies; and
   restriction on the transfer of funds to and from foreign countries, including potentially negative tax consequences.
our financial performance on a u.s. dollar denominated basis is subject to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. these fluctuations could cause material variations in our results of operations. our principal exposures are to the australian dollar, brazilian real, british pound sterling, canadian dollar, chinese renminbi, euro, japanese yen, mexican peso, and swiss franc. from time to time, we enter into agreements that are intended to reduce the effects of our exposure to currency fluctuations, but these agreements may not be effective in significantly reducing our exposure.
new regulations or regulatory-based claims could adversely affect our business.
our facilities and products are subject to many laws and regulations administered by the united states department of agriculture, the federal food and drug administration, the occupational safety and health administration, and other federal, state, local, and foreign governmental agencies relating to the production, packaging, labelling, storage, distribution, quality, and safety of food products and the health and safety of our employees. our failure to comply with such laws and regulations could subject us to lawsuits, administrative penalties, and civil remedies, including fines, injunctions, and recalls of our products. we advertise our products and could be the target of claims relating to alleged false or deceptive advertising under federal, state, and foreign laws and regulations. we may also be subject to new laws or regulations restricting our right to advertise our products, including restrictions on the audience to whom products are marketed. changes in laws or regulations that impose additional regulatory requirements on us could increase our cost of doing business or restrict our actions, causing our results of operations to be adversely affected.
we are subject to various federal, state, local, and foreign environmental laws and regulations. our failure to comply with environmental laws and regulations could subject us to lawsuits, administrative penalties, and civil remedies. we are currently party to a variety of environmental remediation obligations. due to regulatory complexities, uncertainties inherent in litigation, and the risk of unidentified contaminants on current and former properties of ours, the potential exists for remediation, liability, indemnification, and compliance costs to differ from our estimates. we cannot guarantee that our costs in relation to these matters, or compliance with environmental laws in general, will not exceed our established liabilities or otherwise have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
we have a substantial amount of indebtedness, which could limit financing and other options and in some cases adversely affect our ability to pay dividends.
as of may 26, 2019, we had total debt, redeemable interests, and noncontrolling interests of $15.4 billion. the agreements under which we have issued indebtedness do not prevent us from incurring additional unsecured indebtedness in the future. our level of indebtedness may limit our:
            ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, or general corporate purposes, particularly if the ratings assigned to our debt securities by rating organizations were revised downward; and
   flexibility to adjust to changing business and market conditions and may make us more vulnerable to a downturn in general economic conditions.
there are various financial covenants and other restrictions in our debt instruments and noncontrolling interests. if we fail to comply with any of these requirements, the related indebtedness (and other unrelated indebtedness) could become due and payable prior to its stated maturity and our ability to obtain additional or alternative financing may also be adversely affected.
our ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt and other obligations will depend on our operating and financial performance, which in turn is subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial, business, and other factors beyond our control.
global capital and credit market issues could negatively affect our liquidity, increase our costs of borrowing, and disrupt the operations of our suppliers and customers.
we depend on stable, liquid, and well-functioning capital and credit markets to fund our operations. although we believe that our operating cash flows, financial assets, access to capital and credit markets, and revolving credit agreements will permit us to meet our financing needs for the foreseeable future, there can be no assurance that future volatility or disruption in the capital and credit markets will not impair our liquidity or increase our costs of borrowing. we also utilize interest rate derivatives to reduce the volatility of our financing costs. if we are not effective in hedging this volatility, we may experience an increase in our costs of borrowing. our business could also be negatively impacted if our suppliers or customers experience disruptions resulting from tighter capital and credit markets or a slowdown in the general economy.
from time to time, we issue variable rate securities based on interbank offered rates (ibors) and enter into interest rate swaps that contain a variable element based on an ibor. there is currently uncertainty whether certain ibors will continue to be available after 2021. if certain ibors cease to be available, we may need to amend affected agreements, and we cannot predict what alternative index would be negotiated with our counterparties and security holders. as a result, our interest expense could increase and our available cash flow for general corporate requirements may be adversely affected.
volatility in the securities markets, interest rates, and other factors could substantially increase our defined benefit pension, other postretirement benefit, and postemployment benefit costs.
we sponsor a number of defined benefit plans for employees in the united states, canada, and various foreign locations, including defined benefit pension, retiree health and welfare, severance, and other postemployment plans. our major defined benefit pension plans are funded with trust assets invested in a globally diversified portfolio of securities and other investments. changes in interest rates, mortality rates, health care costs, early retirement rates, investment returns, and the market value of plan assets can affect the funded status of our defined benefit plans and cause volatility in the net periodic benefit cost and future funding requirements of the plans. a significant increase in our obligations or future funding requirements could have a negative impact on our results of operations and cash flows from operations.
our business operations could be disrupted if our information technology systems fail to perform adequately or are breached.
information technology serves an important role in the efficient and effective operation of our business. we rely on information technology networks and systems, including the internet, to process, transmit, and store electronic information to manage a variety of business processes and to comply with regulatory, legal, and tax requirements. our information technology systems and infrastructure are critical to effectively manage our key business processes including digital marketing, order entry and fulfillment, supply chain management, finance, administration, and other business processes. these technologies enable internal and external communication among our locations, employees, suppliers, customers, and others and include the receipt and storage of personal information about our employees, consumers, and proprietary business information. our information technology systems, some of which are dependent on services provided by third parties, may be vulnerable to damage, interruption, or shutdown due to any number of causes such as catastrophic events, natural disasters, fires, power outages, systems failures, telecommunications failures, security breaches, computer viruses, hackers, employee error or malfeasance, and other causes. increased cyber-security threats pose a potential risk to the security and viability of our information technology systems, as well as the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the data stored on those systems. the failure of our information technology systems to perform as we anticipate could disrupt our business and result in transaction errors, processing inefficiencies, data loss, legal claims or proceedings, regulatory penalties, and the loss of sales and customers. any interruption of our information technology systems could have operational, reputational, legal, and financial impacts that may have a material adverse effect on our business.
a change in the assumptions regarding the future performance of our businesses or a different weighted-average cost of capital used to value our reporting units or our indefinite-lived intangible assets could negatively affect our consolidated results of operations and net worth.
as of may 26, 2019, we had $20.6 billion of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets. goodwill for each of our reporting units is tested for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred. we compare the carrying value of the reporting unit, including goodwill, to the fair value of the reporting unit. if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value of the reporting unit, including goodwill, impairment has occurred. our estimates of fair value are determined based on a discounted cash flow model. growth rates for sales and profits are determined using inputs from our long-range planning process. we also make estimates of discount rates, perpetuity growth assumptions, market comparables, and other factors. our latin america and u.s. yogurt reporting units have experienced declining business performance and we continue to monitor these businesses. while we currently believe that our goodwill is not impaired, different assumptions regarding the future performance of our businesses could result in significant impairment losses.
we evaluate the useful lives of our intangible assets, primarily intangible assets associated with the blue buffalo, pillsbury, totinos, progresso, yoplait, old el paso, yoki, häagen-dazs, and annies brands, to determine if they are finite or indefinite-lived. reaching a determination on useful life requires significant judgments and assumptions regarding the future effects of obsolescence, demand, competition, other economic factors (such as the stability of the industry, known technological advances, legislative action that results in an uncertain or changing regulatory environment, and expected changes in distribution channels), the level of required maintenance expenditures, and the expected lives of other related groups of assets.
our indefinite-lived intangible assets are also tested for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable. our estimate of the fair value of the brands is based on a discounted cash flow model using inputs including projected revenues from our long-range plan, assumed royalty rates which could be payable if we did not own the brands, and a discount rate. our pillsbury, yoki, and progresso brands have experienced declining business performance, and we continue to monitor these businesses. for further information on goodwill and intangible assets, please refer to note 6 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report.
we may fail to realize all of the anticipated benefits of the blue buffalo acquisition or those benefits may take longer to realize than expected.
our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the blue buffalo acquisition will depend, to a large extent, on our ability to integrate blue buffalo, which is a complex, costly, and time-consuming process. we had not operated in the pet food sector prior to the acquisition of blue buffalo and our lack of experience in this sector may hinder our ability to manage blue buffalo successfully following the acquisition.
the integration process may disrupt our business and, if implemented ineffectively, could restrict the realization of the full expected benefits. the failure to meet the challenges involved in the integration process and to realize the anticipated benefits of the blue buffalo acquisition could cause an interruption of, or a loss of momentum in, our operations and could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
in addition, the integration of blue buffalo may result in material unanticipated problems, expenses, liabilities, competitive responses, and loss of customers and other business relationships. additional integration challenges include:
   diversion of managements attention to integration matters;
   difficulties in achieving anticipated cost savings, synergies, business opportunities, and growth prospects from the acquisition;
   difficulties in the integration of operations and systems;
   difficulties in conforming standards, controls, procedures, and accounting and other policies, business cultures, and compensation structures;
   challenges in keeping existing customers and obtaining new customers;
   difficulties in building and operating new and existing manufacturing facilities;
   challenges in attracting and retaining key personnel;
   the impact of potential liabilities we may be inheriting from blue buffalo; and
many of these factors will be outside of our control and any one of them could result in increased costs, decreases in the amount of expected revenues, and diversion of managements time and energy, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations and result in us becoming subject to litigation. in addition, even if blue buffalo is integrated successfully, the full anticipated benefits of the acquisition may not be realized, including the synergies, cost savings or sales or growth opportunities that are anticipated. these benefits may not be achieved within the anticipated time frame, or at all. further, additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the integration process. all of these factors could cause reductions in our earnings per share and decrease or delay the expected accretive effect of the acquisition. as a result, it cannot be assured that the blue buffalo acquisition will result in the realization of the full or any anticipated benefits.
blue buffalo may underperform relative to our expectations.
the business, prospects, and financial performance of blue buffalo are subject to certain risks and uncertainties. we may not be able to maintain the growth rate, levels of revenue, earnings, or operating efficiency that we and blue buffalo have achieved or might achieve separately. our failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. when we acquired blue buffalo in fiscal 2018, we recorded significant brand intangible and goodwill assets at fair value based on, among other things, our projections of blue buffalos financial performance. our failure to meet or exceed our projections could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations, including a material impairment to our intangible assets.
our failure to successfully integrate other acquisitions into our existing operations could adversely affect our financial results.
from time to time, we evaluate potential acquisitions or joint ventures that would further our strategic objectives. our success depends, in part, upon our ability to integrate acquired and existing operations. if we are unable to successfully integrate acquisitions, our financial results could suffer. additional potential risks associated with acquisitions include additional debt leverage, the loss of key employees and customers of the acquired business, the assumption of unknown liabilities, the inherent risk associated with entering a geographic area or line of business in which we have no or limited prior experience, failure to achieve anticipated synergies, and the impairment of goodwill or other acquisition-related intangible assets.
item 7    managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive overview we are a global packaged foods company. we develop distinctive value-added food products and market them under unique brand names. we work continuously to improve our core products and to create new products that meet consumers evolving needs and preferences. in addition, we build the equity of our brands over time with strong consumer-directed marketing, innovative new products, and effective merchandising. we believe our brand-building strategy is the key to winning and sustaining leading share positions in markets around the globe.
our fundamental financial goal is to generate superior returns for our shareholders over the long term. we believe that increases in organic net sales, adjusted operating profit, adjusted earnings per share (eps), free cash flow, and cash return to shareholders are key drivers of financial performance for our business.
   low single-digit annual growth in organic net sales;
   mid single-digit annual growth in adjusted operating profit;
   high single-digit annual growth in adjusted diluted eps;
we continue to pursue our consumer first strategy and execute against our global growth framework: 1) competing effectively on all brands and across all geographies through strong innovation, effective consumer marketing, and excellent in-store execution; 2) accelerating growth on our four differential growth platforms, which are häagen-dazs ice cream, snack bars, old el paso mexican food, and our portfolio of natural and organic food brands; and 3) reshaping our portfolio through growth-enhancing acquisitions and divestitures, including the acquisition of blue buffalo. by focusing on this growth framework, we expect to generate financial performance consistent with the long-term growth objectives listed above, which we believe should result in long-term value creation for our shareholders.
in fiscal 2019 we executed well and met or exceeded each of our key full-year financial targets, including organic net sales growth and constant-currency growth in net sales, adjusted operating profit, and adjusted diluted eps. relative to fiscal 2018, we improved our net sales performance in u.s. yogurt and our emerging market businesses, we increased our contributions from innovation, we stabilized our distribution trends in the u.s., and we generated greater benefits from net price realization and mix through our strategic revenue management capability. these results were partially offset by challenging performance for u.s. snack bars, leaving our organic net sales growth at the low end of the range outlined in our initial annual targets.
we successfully transitioned blue buffalo into the general mills portfolio in fiscal 2019, achieving our goals of double-digit pro forma growth in net sales and segment operating profit excluding the impact of purchase accounting. the combination of record-level holistic margin management (hmm) savings, increased benefits from net price realization and mix, and strong cost management drove growth in constant-currency adjusted operating profit and adjusted diluted eps ahead of our initial targets. finally, we continued to maintain a disciplined focus on cash, resulting in another year of strong free cash flow conversion.
our consolidated net sales for fiscal 2019 rose 7 percent to $16.9 billion. on an organic basis, net sales essentially matched year-ago levels. operating profit of $2.5 billion increased 4 percent. adjusted operating profit of $2.8 billion increased 9 percent and increased 10 percent on a constant-currency basis. diluted eps of $2.90 was down 20 percent compared to fiscal 2018 results. adjusted diluted eps was up 4 percent to $3.22 per share and increased 4 percent on a constant-currency basis (see the non-gaap measures section below for a description of our use of measures not defined by generally accepted accounting principles (gaap)).
net cash provided by operations totaled $2.8 billion in fiscal 2019 representing a conversion rate of 157 percent of net earnings, including earnings attributable to redeemable and noncontrolling interests. this cash generation supported capital investments totaling $538 million, and our resulting free cash flow was $2.3 billion at a conversion rate of 115 percent of adjusted net earnings, including earnings attributable to redeemable and noncontrolling interests. we also returned cash to shareholders through dividends totaling $1.2 billion and reduced total debt outstanding by $1.3 billion.
a detailed review of our fiscal 2019 performance compared to fiscal 2018 appears below in the section titled fiscal 2019 consolidated results of operations. a detailed review of our fiscal 2018 performance compared to our fiscal 2017 performance is set forth in part ii, item 7 of our form 10-k for the fiscal year ended may 27, 2018 under the caption managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  fiscal 2018 results of consolidated operations.
in fiscal 2020, our plans include continued strong innovation and investments in capabilities and brand building to accelerate our topline growth, efficiency initiatives to maintain our strong margins, and a disciplined focus on cash to further reduce our leverage. we remain confident that executing our consumer first strategy and our compete, accelerate, and reshape growth framework will drive sustainable, profitable growth and attractive long-term returns for our shareholders.
                                                constant-currency adjusted operating profit is expected to increase 2 to 4 percent from the base of $2.8 billion reported in fiscal 2019. benefit of the 53rd week in fiscal 2020 will be reinvested in capabilities and brand-building initiatives to drive improvement in our organic net sales growth rate in 2020 and beyond.
see the non-gaap measures section below for a description of our use of measures not defined by gaap.
certain terms used throughout this report are defined in a glossary in item 8 of this report.
in fiscal 2019, net sales increased 7 percent compared to last year, primarily reflecting the addition of blue buffalo. organic net sales were flat in the fiscal year ended may 26, 2019. operating profit margin of 14.9 percent was down 50 basis points from year-ago levels primarily driven by impairment charges recorded for certain intangible and manufacturing assets and unfavorable mark-to-market valuation of certain commodity positions. adjusted operating profit margin increased 30 basis points to 16.9 percent, primarily driven by lower selling, general, and administrative expenses in our north america retail segment and the addition of blue buffalo, partially offset by higher input costs. diluted earnings per share of $2.90 decreased 20 percent primarily driven by a one-time benefit recorded in fiscal 2018 related to the tax cuts and jobs act (tcja). adjusted diluted earnings per share of $3.22 increased 4 percent on a constant-currency basis (see the non-gaap measures section below for a description of our use of measures not defined by gaap).
a summary of our consolidated financial results for fiscal 2019 follows:
operating profit                                           2,515.9                 4 %              14.9 %

the 7 percent increase in net sales in fiscal 2019 reflects the addition of blue buffalo, favorable net price realization and mix across all other segments, and higher contributions from volume growth in the asia & latin america segment, partially offset by lower contributions from volume growth in the north america retail, europe & australia, and convenience stores & foodservice segments.
contributions from organic volume growth (a)   (2)pts organic net price realization and mix           2 pts organic net sales growth                         flat foreign currency exchange                      (2)pts acquisition and divestitures                    9 pts net sales growth                                7 pts
organic net sales in fiscal 2019 were flat compared to fiscal 2018, as favorable organic net price realization and mix was offset by declining contributions from organic volume growth.
cost of sales increased $804 million in fiscal 2019 to $11,108 million. the increase was driven by a $503 million increase due to higher volume and a $194 million increase attributable to product rate and mix, including the impact of the blue buffalo acquisition. in fiscal 2019, we recorded a $53 million charge related to the fair value adjustment of inventory acquired in the blue buffalo acquisition. we recorded a $36 million net increase in cost of sales related to mark-to-market valuation of certain commodity positions and grain inventories compared to a net decrease of $32 million in fiscal 2018 (please see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report). in fiscal 2019, we recorded $10 million of restructuring charges in cost of
sales compared to $14 million in fiscal 2018. we also recorded $1 million of restructuring initiative project-related costs in cost of sales in fiscal 2019 compared to $11 million in fiscal 2018 (please see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report for additional information).
selling, general and administrative (sg&a) expenses increased $86 million to $2,936 million in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018. the increase in sg&a expenses primarily reflects the addition of blue buffalo, partially offset by a decrease in media and advertising expense. sg&a expenses as a percent of net sales in fiscal 2019 decreased 70 basis points compared to fiscal 2018.
divestitures loss totaled $30 million in fiscal 2019. in fiscal 2019, we sold our la salteña fresh pasta and refrigerated dough business in argentina, and recorded a pre-tax loss of $35 million. we also sold our yogurt business in china and simultaneously entered into a new yoplait license agreement with the purchaser for their use of the yoplait brand. we recorded a pre-tax gain of $5 million.
restructuring, impairment, and other exit costs totaled $275 million in fiscal 2019 compared to $166 million in fiscal 2018.
in fiscal 2019, as a result of lower sales projections in our long range plans for the businesses supporting our progresso, food should taste good, and mountain high brand intangible assets, we recorded $193 million of impairment charges related to these brand intangible assets (please see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report for additional information).
in addition, in fiscal 2019, we recorded a $15 million charge related to the impairment of certain manufacturing assets in our north america retail and asia & latin america segments.
charges associated with our restructuring initiatives recognized in fiscal 2019 consisted of the following:
expense, in millions targeted actions in global supply chain                                   $80.2
charges associated with restructuring actions previously announced        (2.6)
(a)   includes restructuring charges recorded in cost of sales of $9.9 million.
in fiscal 2019, we approved restructuring actions to drive efficiencies in targeted areas of our global supply chain. in connection with these actions we recorded $80 million of restructuring charges, consisting of $23 million of severance expense and $57 million of other costs, primarily asset write-offs. four of our operating segments were affected by these actions including $54 million related to our north america retail segment, $13 million related to our asia & latin america segment, $12 million related to our europe & australia segment, and $1 million related to our pet segment. we expect these actions to be completed by the end of fiscal 2022.

benefit plan non-service income totaled $88 million in fiscal 2019 compared to $89 million in fiscal 2018 (please see to note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report for additional information).
interest, net for fiscal 2019 totaled $522 million, $148 million higher than fiscal 2018, primarily driven by higher debt levels due to financing for the blue buffalo acquisition.
our effective tax rate for fiscal 2019 was 17.7 percent compared to 2.7 percent in fiscal 2018. the 15.0 percentage point increase reflects the lower statutory rate in fiscal 2019 being more than offset by the impact of the one-time, provisional net benefit of $524 million recorded in fiscal 2018 related to the tcja. our adjusted effective tax rate was 21.8 percent in fiscal 2019 compared to 25.7 percent in fiscal 2018 (see the non-gaap measures section below for a description of our use of measures not defined by gaap). the 3.9 percentage point decrease in the adjusted effective tax rate was primarily due to the net benefits associated with the tcja, partially offset by the change in earnings mix by jurisdiction.
the tcja includes provisions affecting our fiscal 2019 effective tax rate, including but not limited to: a reduction in the u.s. corporate tax rate on domestic operations to 21 percent; a provision that taxes u.s. allocated expenses and certain income from foreign operations (gilti); a limitation on deductible interest expense; the repeal of the domestic manufacturing deduction; and a limitation on the deductibility of certain executive compensation. in fiscal 2019, we completed our accounting for the tax effects of the tcja and recorded a benefit of $7 million which included adjustments to the transition tax and the measurement of our net u.s. deferred tax liability.
after-tax earnings from joint ventures decreased $13 million to $72 million in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018, primarily driven by our $11 million after-tax share of restructuring charges at cpw, and lower net sales and higher input costs for hdj. on a constant-currency basis, after-tax earnings from joint ventures decreased 14 percent, including the cpw restructuring charge (see the non-gaap measures section below for a description of our use of measures not defined by gaap). the components of our joint ventures net sales growth are shown in the following table:

average diluted shares outstanding increased by 20 million in fiscal 2019 from fiscal 2018 due to the impact of the fiscal 2018 share issuance to partially fund the acquisition of blue buffalo and option exercises.
results of segment operations our businesses are organized into five operating segments: north america retail; convenience stores & foodservice; europe & australia; asia & latin america; and pet. we are reporting the pet operating segment results on a one-month lag and, accordingly, our fiscal 2018 results did not include pet segment operating results.

segment operating profit increased 83 percent to $72 million in fiscal 2019, compared to $40 million in fiscal 2018, primarily driven by higher contributions from volume growth, higher net price realization and mix and lower sg&a expenses, partially offset by higher input costs, including currency-driven inflation on imported
products in certain markets. segment operating profit increased 71 percent on a constant-currency basis in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 (see the non-gaap measures section below for our use of this measure not defined by gaap).

pet net sales and segment operating profit in fiscal 2019 totaled $1,431 million and $268 million, respectively. pet operating profit includes a $53 million purchase accounting adjustment related to inventory acquired and $13 million of amortization of the customer list intangible asset.
unallocated corporate items unallocated corporate items include corporate overhead expenses, variances to planned domestic employee benefits and incentives, contributions to the general mills foundation, asset and liability remeasurement impact of hyperinflationary economies, restructuring initiative project-related costs, and other items that are not part of our measurement of segment operating performance. this includes gains and losses from the mark-to-market valuation of certain commodity positions until passed back to our operating segments in accordance with our policy as discussed in note 7 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report.
in fiscal 2019, unallocated corporate expense increased $134 million to $340 million compared to $206 million last year, primarily driven by compensation and benefits expenses. in fiscal 2019, we recorded a $36 million net increase in expense related to mark-to-market valuation of certain commodity positions and grain inventories compared to a $32 million net decrease in expense in the prior year. in addition, we recorded $10 million of restructuring charges, and $1 million of restructuring initiative project-related costs in cost of sales in fiscal 2019, compared to $14 million of restructuring charges and $11 million of restructuring initiative project-related costs in cost of sales in fiscal 2018. in fiscal 2019, we recorded a $16 million gain from a legal recovery related to our yoplait sas subsidiary and $23 million of gains related to certain investment valuation adjustments. we also recorded $26 million of integration costs in fiscal 2019 related to our acquisition of blue buffalo compared to $34 million of transaction and integration costs in fiscal 2018. in addition, we recorded a $3 million loss related to the impact of hyperinflationary accounting for our argentina subsidiary in fiscal 2019.
impact of inflation we experienced input cost inflation of 4 percent in fiscal 2019 and 4 percent in fiscal 2018, primarily on commodity inputs. we expect input cost inflation of approximately 4 percent in fiscal 2020. we attempt to minimize the effects of inflation through hmm, planning, and operating practices. our risk management practices are discussed in item 7a of this report.
liquidity the primary source of our liquidity is cash flow from operations. over the most recent two-year period, our operations have generated $5.6 billion in cash. a substantial portion of this operating cash flow has been returned to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. we also use cash from operations to fund our capital expenditures and acquisitions. we typically use a combination of cash, notes payable, and long-term debt, and occasionally issue shares of stock, to finance significant acquisitions.
as of may 26, 2019, we had $399 million of cash and cash equivalents held in foreign jurisdictions. as a result of the tcja, the historic undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries were taxed in the u.s. via the one-time repatriation tax in fiscal 2018. we have re-evaluated our assertion and have concluded that although earnings prior to fiscal 2018 will remain permanently reinvested, we will no longer make a permanent reinvestment assertion beginning with our fiscal 2018 earnings. as part of the accounting for the tcja, we recorded local country withholding taxes related to certain entities from which we began repatriating undistributed earnings and will continue to record local country withholding taxes on all future earnings. as a result of the transition tax, we may repatriate our cash and cash equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries without such funds being subject to further u.s. income tax liability (please see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report for additional information).

during fiscal 2019, cash provided by operations was $2,807 million compared to $2,841 million in the same period last year. the $34 million decrease was primarily driven by a $377 million decrease in net earnings and a $550 million change in current assets and liabilities, partially offset by a $598 million change in deferred income taxes. the $550 million change in current assets and liabilities was primarily driven by a $413 million change in the timing of accounts payable, including the impact of longer payment terms implemented in prior fiscal years. the change in deferred income taxes was primarily related to the $638 million provisional benefit from revaluing our net u.s. deferred tax liabilities to reflect the new u.s. corporate tax rate as a result of the tcja in fiscal 2018.
we strive to grow core working capital at or below the rate of growth in our net sales. for fiscal 2019, core working capital decreased 34 percent, compared to a net sales increase of 7 percent. as of may 26, 2019, our core working capital balance totaled $385 million, down 34 percent versus last year, this is primarily driven by continued benefits from our payment terms extension program and lower inventory balances. in fiscal 2018, core working capital decreased 27 percent, compared to a net sales increase of 1 percent.

in fiscal 2019, we used $556 million of cash through investing activities compared to $8.7 billion in fiscal 2018. this decrease was primarily driven by the acquisition of blue buffalo for an aggregate purchase price of $8.0 billion, including $103 million of consideration for net debt repaid, in fiscal 2018. we invested $538 million in land, buildings, and equipment in fiscal 2019, $85 million less than fiscal 2018.
we expect capital expenditures to be approximately 3.5 percent of reported net sales in fiscal 2020. these expenditures will fund initiatives that are expected to fuel growth, support innovative products, and continue hmm initiatives throughout the supply chain.

during fiscal 2019, we received $241 million of net proceeds from common stock issued on exercised options compared to $99 million in fiscal 2018. during fiscal 2018, we received $970 million of net proceeds from common stock issued to fund a portion of the blue buffalo acquisition.
share repurchases in fiscal 2019 were insignificant. during fiscal 2018, we repurchased 11 million shares of our common stock for $602 million.
dividends paid in fiscal 2019 totaled $1,182 million, or $1.96 per share, consistent with fiscal 2018.
selected cash flows from joint ventures selected cash flows from our joint ventures are set forth in the following table:

total committed and uncommitted credit facilities          $3.6          $0.2
to ensure availability of funds, we maintain bank credit lines sufficient to cover our outstanding notes payable. commercial paper is a continuing source of short-term financing. we have commercial paper programs available to us in the united states and europe. we also have uncommitted and asset-backed credit lines that support our foreign operations.
certain of our long-term debt agreements, our credit facilities, and our noncontrolling interests contain restrictive covenants. as of may 26, 2019, we were in compliance with all of these covenants.
we have $1,396 million of long-term debt maturing in the next 12 months that is classified as current, including $500 million of 2.2 percent notes due october 2019, 300.0 euro-denominated 0.0 percent notes due january 2020, and 500.0 million euro-denominated floating-rate notes due january 2020. we believe that cash flows from operations, together with available short- and long-term debt financing, will be adequate to meet our liquidity and capital needs for at least the next 12 months.
our net debt to operating cash flow ratio declined to 5.0 in fiscal 2019 from 5.4 in fiscal 2018, primarily driven by a decrease in long-term debt. our net debt-to-adjusted earnings before net interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization ratio declined to 3.9 in fiscal 2019 from 4.2 on a pro forma basis in fiscal 2018, consistent with our plans to reduce our leverage following our acquisition of blue buffalo (see the non-gaap measures section below for our use of this measure not defined by gaap).
we have a 51 percent controlling interest in yoplait sas and a 50 percent interest in yoplait marques snc and liberté marques sàrl. sodiaal international (sodiaal) holds the remaining interests in each of these entities. we consolidate these entities into our consolidated financial statements. we record sodiaals 50 percent interest in yoplait marques snc and liberté marques sàrl as noncontrolling interests, and its 49 percent interest in yoplait sas as a redeemable interest on our consolidated balance sheets. these euro- and canadian dollar-denominated interests are reported in u.s. dollars on our consolidated balance sheets. sodiaal has the ability to put all or a portion of its redeemable interest to us at fair value once per year, up to three times before december 2024. as of may 26, 2019, the redemption value of the redeemable interest was $552 million which approximates its fair value.
during the second quarter of fiscal 2019, sodiaal invested $56 million in yoplait sas.
the third-party holder of the general mills cereals, llc (gmc) class a interests receives quarterly preferred distributions from available net income based on the application of a floating preferred return rate to the holders capital account balance established in the most recent mark-to-market valuation (currently $252 million). on june 1, 2018, the floating preferred return rate on gmcs class a interests was reset to the sum of three-month libor plus 142.5 basis points. the preferred return rate is adjusted every three years through a negotiated agreement with the class a interest holder or through a remarketing auction.
we have an option to purchase the class a interests for consideration equal to the then current capital account value, plus any unpaid preferred return and the prescribed make-whole amount. if we purchase these interests, any change in the third-party holders capital account from its original value will be charged directly to retained earnings and will increase or decrease the net earnings used to calculate eps in that period.
off-balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations as of may 26, 2019, we have issued guarantees and comfort letters of $682 million for the debt and other obligations of consolidated subsidiaries, and guarantees and comfort letters of $134 million for the debt and other obligations of non-consolidated affiliates, mainly cpw. in addition, off-balance sheet arrangements are generally limited to the future payments under non-cancelable operating leases, which totaled $483 million as of may 26, 2019.
as of may 26, 2019, we invested in four variable interest entities (vies). none of our vies are material to our results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity as of and for the fiscal year ended may 26, 2019.
our defined benefit plans in the united states are subject to the requirements of the pension protection act (ppa). in the future, the ppa may require us to make additional contributions to our domestic plans. we do not expect to be required to make any contributions in fiscal 2020.
capital leases                                0.3                      0.2                      0.1                        -                         -
(a)              amounts represent the expected cash payments of our long-term debt and do not include $0.3 million for capital leases or $72.0 million for net unamortized debt issuance costs, premiums and discounts, and fair value adjustments.
(b)   operating leases represents the minimum rental commitments under non-cancelable operating leases.
(c)                                                                      the majority of the purchase obligations represent commitments for raw material and packaging to be utilized in the normal course of business and for consumer marketing spending commitments that support our brands. for purposes of this table, arrangements are considered purchase obligations if a contract specifies all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased, a pricing structure, and approximate timing of the transaction. most arrangements are cancelable without a significant penalty and with short notice (usually 30 days). any amounts reflected on the consolidated balance sheets as accounts payable and accrued liabilities are excluded from the table above.
(d)                                                                           the fair value of our foreign exchange, equity, commodity, and grain derivative contracts with a payable position to the counterparty was $17.3 million as of may 26, 2019, based on fair market values as of that date. future changes in market values will impact the amount of cash ultimately paid or received to settle those instruments in the future. other long-term obligations mainly consist of liabilities for accrued compensation and benefits, including the underfunded status of certain of our defined benefit pension, other postretirement benefit, and postemployment benefit plans, and miscellaneous liabilities. we expect to pay approximately $20 million of benefits from our unfunded postemployment benefit plans and approximately $18 million of deferred compensation in fiscal 2020. we are unable to reliably estimate the amount of these payments beyond fiscal 2020. as of may 26, 2019, our total liability for uncertain tax positions and accrued interest and penalties was $165.1 million.
significant accounting estimates for a complete description of our significant accounting policies, please see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report. our significant accounting estimates are those that have a meaningful impact on the reporting of our financial condition and results of operations. these estimates include our accounting for promotional expenditures, valuation of long-lived assets, intangible assets, redeemable interest, stock-based compensation, income taxes, and defined benefit pension, other postretirement benefit, and postemployment benefit plans.
revenue recognition our revenues are reported net of variable consideration and consideration payable to our customers, including trade promotion, consumer coupon redemption and other costs, including estimated allowances for returns, unsalable product, and prompt pay discounts. trade promotions are recorded using significant judgment of estimated participation and performance levels for offered programs at the time of sale. differences between estimated expenses and actual costs are recognized as a change in management estimate in a subsequent period. our accrued trade liabilities were $484 million as of may 26, 2019, and $500 million as of may 27, 2018. because these amounts are significant, if our estimates are inaccurate we would have to make adjustments in subsequent periods that could have a significant effect on our results of operations.
valuation of long-lived assets we estimate the useful lives of long-lived assets and make estimates concerning undiscounted cash flows to review for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset (or asset group) may not be recoverable. fair value is measured using discounted cash flows or independent appraisals, as appropriate.
intangible assets goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are not subject to amortization and are tested for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred. our estimates of fair value for goodwill impairment testing are determined based on a discounted cash flow model. we use inputs from our long-range planning process to determine growth rates for sales and profits. we also make estimates of discount rates, perpetuity growth assumptions, market comparables, and other factors.
we evaluate the useful lives of our other intangible assets, mainly brands, to determine if they are finite or indefinite-lived. reaching a determination on useful life requires significant judgments and assumptions regarding the future effects of obsolescence, demand, competition, other economic factors (such as the stability of the industry, known technological advances, legislative action that results in an uncertain or changing regulatory environment, and expected changes in distribution channels), the level of required maintenance expenditures, and the expected lives of other related groups of assets. intangible assets that are deemed to have definite lives are amortized on a straight-line basis, over their useful lives, generally ranging from 4 to 30 years. our estimate of the fair value of our brand assets is based on a discounted cash flow model using inputs which include projected revenues from our long-range plan, assumed royalty rates that could be payable if we did not own the brands, and a discount rate.
as of may 26, 2019, we had $20.6 billion of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets. while we currently believe that the fair value of each intangible exceeds its carrying value and that those intangibles so classified will contribute indefinitely to our cash flows, materially different assumptions regarding future performance of our businesses or a different weighted-average cost of capital could result in material impairment losses and amortization expense. we performed our fiscal 2019 assessment of our intangible assets as of the first day of the second quarter of fiscal 2019. as a result of lower sales projections in our long-range plans for the businesses supporting the progresso, food should taste good, and mountain high brand intangible assets, we recorded the following impairment charges:
in millions                 impairment        fair value charge             as of nov. 25, 2018
significant assumptions used in that assessment included our long-range cash flow projections for the businesses, royalty rates, weighted-average cost of capital rates, and tax rates.
our latin america reporting unit and the yoki brand intangible asset had fair values that were not substantially in excess of the carry value. the excess fair value as of the fiscal 2019 test date of the latin america reporting unit and the yoki brand intangible asset were as follows:
in millions        carrying value     excess fair value of intangible     as of fiscal 2019
while having significant coverage as of our fiscal 2019 assessment date, the pillsbury brand intangible asset and u.s. yogurt reporting unit had risk of decreasing coverage. we will continue to monitor these businesses for potential impairment.
redeemable interest in fiscal 2019, we adjusted the redemption value of sodiaals redeemable interest in yoplait sas based on a discounted cash flow model. the significant assumptions used to estimate the redemption value include projected revenue growth and profitability from our long-range plan, capital spending, depreciation and taxes, foreign currency exchange rates, and a discount rate. as of may 26, 2019, the redemption value of the redeemable interest was $552 million.
stock-based compensation the valuation of stock options is a significant accounting estimate that requires us to use judgments and assumptions that are likely to have a material impact on our financial statements. annually, we make predictive assumptions regarding future stock price volatility, employee exercise behavior, dividend yield, and the forfeiture rate. for more information on these assumptions, please see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report.
the estimated fair values of stock options granted and the assumptions used for the black-scholes option-pricing model were as follows:
estimated fair values of stock options granted                $5.35                    $6.18                    $8.80
expected term                                             8.5 years                8.2 years                8.5 years expected volatility                                          16.3 %                   15.8 %                   17.8 %
the risk-free interest rate for periods during the expected term of the options is based on the u.s. treasury zero-coupon yield curve in effect at the time of grant. an increase in the expected term by 1 year, leaving all other assumptions constant, would increase the grant date fair value by 9 percent. if all other assumptions are held constant, a one percentage point increase in our fiscal 2019 volatility assumption would increase the grant date fair value of our fiscal 2019 option awards by 8 percent.
to the extent that actual outcomes differ from our assumptions, we are not required to true up grant-date fair value-based expense to final intrinsic values. historical data has a significant bearing on our forward-looking assumptions. significant variances between actual and predicted experience could lead to prospective revisions in our assumptions, which could then significantly impact the year-over-year comparability of stock-based compensation expense.
any corporate income tax benefit realized upon exercise or vesting of an award in excess of that previously recognized in earnings (referred to as a windfall tax benefit) is presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows as an operating cash flow. the actual impact on future years cash flows will depend, in part, on the volume of employee stock option exercises during a particular year and the relationship between the exercise-date market value of the underlying stock and the original grant-date fair value previously determined for financial reporting purposes.
realized windfall tax benefits and shortfall tax deficiencies related to the exercise or vesting of stock-based awards are recognized in the consolidated statement of earnings. because employee stock option exercise behavior is not within our control, it is possible that significantly different reported results could occur if different assumptions or conditions were to prevail.
income taxes we apply a more-likely-than-not threshold to the recognition and derecognition of uncertain tax positions. accordingly, we recognize the amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being ultimately realized upon settlement. future changes in judgment related to the expected ultimate resolution of uncertain tax positions will affect earnings in the quarter of such change. for more information on income taxes, please see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report.
defined benefit pension, other postretirement benefit, and postemployment benefit plans we have defined benefit pension plans covering many employees in the united states, canada, switzerland, france, and the united kingdom. we also sponsor plans that provide health care benefits to many of our retirees in the united states, canada, and brazil. under certain circumstances, we also provide accruable benefits, primarily severance, to former and inactive employees in the united states, canada, and mexico. please see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report for a description of our defined benefit pension, other postretirement benefit, and postemployment benefit plans.
we recognize benefits provided during retirement or following employment over the plan participants active working lives. accordingly, we make various assumptions to predict and measure costs and obligations many years prior to the settlement of our obligations. assumptions that require significant management judgment and have a material impact on the measurement of our net periodic benefit expense or income and accumulated benefit obligations include the long-term rates of return on plan assets, the interest rates used to discount the obligations for our benefit plans, and health care cost trend rates.
expected rate of return on plan assets our expected rate of return on plan assets is determined by our asset allocation, our historical long-term investment performance, our estimate of future long-term returns by asset class (using input from our actuaries, investment services, and investment managers), and long-term inflation assumptions. we review this assumption annually for each plan; however, our annual investment performance for one particular year does not, by itself, significantly influence our evaluation.
our historical investment returns (compound annual growth rates) for our united states defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets were 6.6 percent, 6.6 percent, 10.3 percent, 8.4 percent, and 7.9 percent for the 1, 5, 10, 15, and 20 year periods ended may 26, 2019.
on a weighted-average basis, the expected rate of return for all defined benefit plans was 7.25 percent for fiscal 2019, 7.88 percent for fiscal 2018, and 8.17 percent for fiscal 2017. for fiscal 2020, we lowered our weighted-average expected rate of return on plan assets for our principal defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans in the united states to 7.0 percent due to asset allocation changes and expected asset returns.
lowering the expected long-term rate of return on assets by 100 basis points would increase our net pension and postretirement expense by $70 million for fiscal 2020. a market-related valuation basis is used to reduce
year-to-year expense volatility. the market-related valuation recognizes certain investment gains or losses over a five-year period from the year in which they occur. investment gains or losses for this purpose are the difference between the expected return calculated using the market-related value of assets and the actual return based on the market-related value of assets. our outside actuaries perform these calculations as part of our determination of annual expense or income.
discount rates we estimate the service and interest cost components of the net periodic benefit expense for our united states and most of our international defined benefit pension, other postretirement benefit, and postemployment benefit plans utilizing a full yield curve approach by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used to determine the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows. our discount rate assumptions are determined annually as of may 31 for our defined benefit pension, other postretirement benefit, and postemployment benefit plan obligations. we work with our outside actuaries to determine the timing and amount of expected future cash outflows to plan participants and, using the aa above median corporate bond yield, to develop a forward interest rate curve, including a margin to that index based on our credit risk. this forward interest rate curve is applied to our expected future cash outflows to determine our discount rate assumptions.

lowering the discount rates by 100 basis points would increase our net defined benefit pension, other postretirement benefit, and postemployment benefit plan expense for fiscal 2020 by approximately $55 million. all obligation-related experience gains and losses are amortized using a straight-line method over the average remaining service period of active plan participants or over the average remaining lifetime of the remaining plan participants if the plan is viewed as all or almost all inactive participants.
health care cost trend rates we review our health care cost trend rates annually. our review is based on data we collect about our health care claims experience and information provided by our actuaries. this information includes recent plan experience, plan design, overall industry experience and projections, and assumptions used by other similar organizations. our initial health care cost trend rate is adjusted as necessary to remain consistent with this review, recent experiences, and short-term expectations. our initial health care cost trend rate assumption is 6.7 percent for retirees age 65 and over and 6.4 percent for retirees under age 65 at the end of fiscal 2019. rates are graded down annually until the ultimate trend rate of 4.5 percent is reached in 2029 for all retirees. the trend rates are applicable for calculations only if the retirees benefits increase as a result of health care inflation. the ultimate trend rate is adjusted annually, as necessary, to approximate the current economic view on the rate of long-term inflation plus an appropriate health care cost premium. assumed trend rates for health care costs have an important effect on the amounts reported for the other postretirement benefit plans.
a one percentage point change in the health care cost trend rate would have the following effects:
effect on the other post retirement accumulated benefit obligation as of may 26,                    43.5                (40.3)
any arising health care claims cost-related experience gain or loss is recognized in the calculation of expected future claims. once recognized, experience gains and losses are amortized using a straight-line method over the average remaining service period of active plan participants or over the average remaining lifetime of the remaining plan participants if the plan is viewed as all or almost all inactive participants.
financial statement impact in fiscal 2019, we recorded net defined benefit pension, other postretirement benefit, and postemployment benefit plan expense of $24 million compared to $23 million of expense in fiscal 2018 and $56 million of expense in fiscal 2017. as of may 26, 2019, we had cumulative unrecognized actuarial net losses of $2.0 billion on our defined benefit pension plans and cumulative unrecognized actuarial net gains of $81 million on our postretirement and postemployment benefit plans, mainly as the result of liability increases from lower interest rates, partially offset by recent increases in the values of plan assets. these unrecognized actuarial net losses will result in increases in our future pension and postretirement benefit expenses because they currently exceed the corridors defined by gaap.
actual future net defined benefit pension, other postretirement benefit, and postemployment benefit plan income or expense will depend on investment performance, changes in future discount rates, changes in health care cost trend rates, and other factors related to the populations participating in these plans.
recently issued accounting pronouncements in august 2017, the financial accounting standards board (fasb) issued new hedge accounting requirements. the new standard amends the hedge accounting recognition and presentation requirements to better align an entitys risk management activities and financial reporting. the new standard also simplifies the application of hedge accounting guidance. the requirements of the new standard are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after december 15, 2018, and interim periods within those annual periods, which for us is the first quarter of fiscal 2020. we do not expect this guidance to have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position.
in february 2016, the fasb issued new accounting requirements for accounting, presentation and classification of leases. this will result in certain leases being capitalized as a right of use asset with a related liability on our consolidated balance sheets. the requirements of the new standard and subsequent amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after december 15, 2018, and interim periods within those annual periods, which for us is the first quarter of fiscal 2020. the requirements of the new standard and subsequent amendments allow for either the modified retrospective transition approach, which requires application of the guidance in all comparative periods presented, or the cumulative effect adjustment approach, which requires application of the guidance at the adoption date.
we are in the process of implementing lease accounting software, developing a centralized business process, and implementing corresponding controls. we have substantially completed our analysis of the impact of this standard on our lease portfolio. we will adopt this guidance in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 using the cumulative effect adjustment approach and electing certain practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance, including not reassessing whether existing contracts contain leases and carrying forward the historical
classification of those leases. in addition, we will also elect to not recognize leases with an initial term of 12 months or less on our consolidated balance sheets. we do not expect the effects to the consolidated financial statements to be pervasive. we estimate that we will record right of use assets and related liabilities of approximately $400 to $500 million, subject to the completion of our assessment and the fluctuation of our lease portfolio and discount rates. we do not expect this guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated statements of earnings or our consolidated statements of cash flows. see note 15 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report for noncancelable future lease commitments.
non-gaap measures we have included in this report measures of financial performance that are not defined by gaap. we believe that these measures provide useful information to investors, and include these measures in other communications to investors.
for each of these non-gaap financial measures, we are providing below a reconciliation of the differences between the non-gaap measure and the most directly comparable gaap measure, an explanation of why we believe the non-gaap measure provides useful information to investors, and any additional material purposes for which our management or board of directors uses the non-gaap measure. these non-gaap measures should be viewed in addition to, and not in lieu of, the comparable gaap measure.
several measures below are presented on an adjusted basis. the adjustments are either items resulting from infrequently occurring events or items that, in managements judgment, significantly affect the year-to-year assessment of operating results.
organic net sales growth rates we provide organic net sales growth rates for our consolidated net sales and segment net sales. this measure is used in reporting to our board of directors and executive management and as a component of the measurement of our performance for incentive compensation purposes. we believe that organic net sales growth rates provide useful information to investors because they provide transparency to underlying performance in our net sales by excluding the effect that foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, as well as acquisitions, divestitures, and a 53rd week, when applicable, have on year-to-year comparability. a reconciliation of these measures to reported net sales growth rates, the relevant gaap measures, are included in our consolidated results of operations and results of segment operations discussions in the md&a above.
net sales growth rate on a constant-currency basis we believe this measure of net sales provides useful information to investors because it provides transparency to the underlying performance by excluding the effect that foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations have on year-to-year comparability given volatility in foreign currency exchange markets.
percentage change in net sales as reported                              7 %

adjusted diluted eps and related constant-currency growth rate this measure is used in reporting to our board of directors and executive management and as a component of the measurement of our performance for incentive compensation purposes. we believe that this measure provides useful information to investors because it is the profitability measure we use to evaluate earnings performance on a comparable year-to-year basis.

adjusted operating profit growth on a constant-currency basis we believe that this measure provides useful information to investors because it is the operating profit measure we use to evaluate operating profit performance on a comparable year-to-year basis. additionally, the measure is evaluated on a constant-currency basis by excluding the effect that foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations have on year-to-year comparability given the volatility in foreign currency exchange rates.
our adjusted operating profit growth on a constant-currency basis is calculated as follows:
2019                               2018                 change operating profit as reported                                             $2,515.9               $2,419.9                    4 %

net debt-to-adjusted earnings before net interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization (ebitda) ratio we believe that this measure provides useful information to investors because it is an indicator of our ability to incur additional debt and to service our existing debt. the reconciliation of adjusted ebitda to net earnings attributable to general mills on a pro forma basis, its gaap equivalent, as well as the calculation of the net debt-to-adjusted ebitda ratio are as follows:
net earnings attributable to redeemable and noncontrolling interests                 33.5                     32.0

forward-looking financial measures our fiscal 2020 outlook for organic net sales growth and adjusted operating profit and adjusted diluted eps are non-gaap financial measures that exclude, or have otherwise been adjusted for, items impacting comparability, including the effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, restructuring charges and project-related costs, acquisition integration costs, and commodity mark-to-market effects. our fiscal 2020 outlook for organic net sales growth also excludes the effect of a 53rd week, acquisitions, and divestitures. we are not able to reconcile these forward-looking non-gaap financial measures to their most directly comparable forward-looking gaap financial measures without unreasonable efforts because we are unable to predict with a reasonable degree of certainty the actual impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices or the timing of acquisitions, divestitures and restructuring actions throughout fiscal 2020. the unavailable information could have a significant impact on our fiscal 2020 gaap financial results.
for fiscal 2020, we currently expect: foreign currency exchange rates (based on a blend of forward and forecasted rates and hedge positions), acquisitions, divestitures, and a 53rd week to increase net sales growth by approximately 1 to 2 percentage points; foreign currency exchange rates to have an immaterial impact on adjusted operating profit and adjusted diluted eps growth; and restructuring charges and project-related costs related to actions previously announced to total approximately $49 million.

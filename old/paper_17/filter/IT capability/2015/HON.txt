item 1a. risk factors cautionary statement about forward-looking statements we describe many of the trends and other factors that drive our business and future results in item 7. managements discussion and analysis of financial condition, results of operations and in other parts of this report (including this item 1a). such discussions contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of section 21e of the securities exchange act of 1934.
forward-looking statements are those that address activities, events or developments that management intends, expects, projects, believes or anticipates will or may occur in the future. they are based on managements assumptions and assessments in light of past experience and trends, current economic and industry conditions, expected future developments and other relevant factors. they are not guarantees of future performance, and actual results, developments and business decisions may differ significantly from those envisaged by our forward-looking statements. we do not undertake to update or revise any of our forward-looking statements. our forward-looking statements are also subject to risks and uncertainties that can affect our performance in both the near-and long-term. these forward-looking statements should be considered in light of the information included in this form 10-k, including, in particular, the factors discussed below. these factors may be revised or supplemented in subsequent reports on forms 10-q and 8-k.
risk factors our business, operating results, cash flows and financial condition are subject to the principal risks and uncertainties set forth below, any one of which could cause our actual results to vary materially from recent results or from our anticipated future results.
macroeconomic and industry risks industry and economic conditions may adversely affect the markets and operating conditions of our customers, which in turn can affect demand for our products and services and our results of operations.
   aerospaceoperating results of aerospace are directly tied to cyclical industry and economic conditions, as well as changes in customer buying patterns of aftermarket parts, supplier stability, factory transitions and capacity constraints. the operating results of our commercial original equipment and commercial aftermarket business units may be adversely affected by downturns in the global demand for air travel which impacts new aircraft production or the delay or cancellation of new aircraft orders, delays in launch schedules for new aircraft, the retirement of aircraft and global flying hours, which impact business and general aviation aircraft utilization rates. operating results in our defense and space systems business unit may be affected by the mix of u.s. and foreign government appropriations for defense and space programs. operating results in our transportation systems business unit may be affected by the level of production and demand for automobiles and trucks equipped with turbochargers, regulatory changes regarding automobile and truck emissions and fuel economy, consumer demand and spending for automotive aftermarket products and delays in launch schedules for new automobile and truck platforms.
   acsoperating results may be adversely impacted by downturns in the level of global residential and commercial construction (including retrofits and upgrades), capital spending and operating expenditures on building and process automation, industrial plant capacity utilization and expansion, and inventory levels in distribution channels.
   pmtoperating results may be adversely impacted by downturns in the capacity utilization for chemical, industrial, refining, petrochemical and semiconductor plants, our customers availability of capital for refinery construction and expansion, raw material demand and supply volatility, and our ability to maximize our facilities production capacity and minimize downtime. in particular, the volatility in oil and natural gas prices have and will continue to impact our customers operating levels and capital spending and thus demand for our products and
services. pricing of certain chemical products are driven by raw materials that are correlated to the price of oil, hence revenue could be significantly impacted by volatility in the price of oil.
an increasing percentage of our sales and operations is in non-u.s. jurisdictions and is subject to the economic, political, regulatory, foreign exchange and other risks of international operations.
our international operations, including u.s. exports, represent more than half of the companys sales. risks related to international operations include exchange control regulations, wage and price controls, antitrust regulations, employment regulations, foreign investment laws, import, export and other trade restrictions (such as embargoes), violations by our employees of anti-corruption laws (despite our efforts to mitigate these risks), changes in regulations regarding transactions with state-owned enterprises, nationalization of private enterprises, acts of terrorism, and our ability to hire and maintain qualified staff and maintain the safety of our employees in these regions. instability and uncertainties arising from the global geopolitical environment and the cost of compliance with increasingly complex and often conflicting regulations worldwide can impair our flexibility in modifying product, marketing, pricing or other strategies for growing our businesses, as well as our ability to improve productivity and maintain acceptable operating margins.
operating outside of the united states also exposes us to foreign exchange risk, which we monitor and seek to reduce through hedging activities. however, foreign exchange hedging activities bear a financial cost and may not always be available to us or successful in eliminating such volatility. finally, we generate significant amounts of cash outside of the united states that is invested with financial and non-financial counterparties. while we employ comprehensive controls regarding global cash management to guard against cash or investment loss and to ensure our ability to fund our operations and commitments, a material disruption to the counterparties with whom we transact business could expose honeywell to financial loss.
risks related to our defined benefit pension plans may adversely impact our results of operations and cash flow.
significant changes in actual investment return on pension assets, discount rates, and other factors could adversely affect our results of operations and require cash pension contributions in future periods. changes in discount rates and actual asset returns different than our anticipated asset returns can result in significant non-cash actuarial gains or losses which we record in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, and, if applicable, in any quarter in which an interim re-measurement is triggered. with regard to cash pension contributions, funding requirements for our pension plans are largely dependent upon interest rates, actual investment returns on pension assets and the impact of legislative or regulatory changes related to pension funding obligations.
operational risks raw material price fluctuations, the ability of key suppliers to meet quality and delivery requirements, or catastrophic events can increase the cost of our products and services, impact our ability to meet commitments to customers and cause us to incur significant liabilities.
the cost of raw materials is a key element in the cost of our products, particularly in pmt (cumene, fluorspar, r240, natural gas, perchloroethylene, sulfur and ethylene) and aerospace (nickel, steel, titanium and other metals). our inability to offset material price inflation through increased prices to customers, formula or long-term fixed price contracts with suppliers, productivity actions or through commodity hedges could adversely affect our results of operations.
many major components, product equipment items and raw materials, particularly in aerospace, are procured or subcontracted on a single or sole-source basis. although we maintain a qualification and performance surveillance process and we believe that sources of supply for raw materials and components are generally adequate, it is difficult to predict what effects shortages or price increases may have in the future. our ability to manage inventory and meet delivery requirements may be
constrained by our suppliers inability to scale production and adjust delivery of long-lead time products during times of volatile demand. our inability to fill our supply needs would jeopardize our ability to fulfill obligations under commercial and government contracts, which could, in turn, result in reduced sales and profits, contract penalties or terminations, and damage to customer relationships.
we may be unable to successfully execute or effectively integrate acquisitions, and divestitures may not occur as planned.
we regularly review our portfolio of businesses and pursue growth through acquisitions and seek to divest non-core businesses. we may not be able to complete transactions on favorable terms, on a timely basis or at all. in addition, our results of operations and cash flows may be adversely impacted by (i) the failure of acquired businesses to meet or exceed expected returns, (ii) the failure to integrate multiple acquired businesses into honeywell simultaneously and on schedule and/or to achieve expected synergies, (iii) the inability to dispose of non-core assets and businesses on satisfactory terms and conditions, and (iv) the discovery of unanticipated liabilities or other problems in acquired businesses for which we lack contractual protections, insurance or indemnities or, with regard to divested businesses, claims by purchasers to whom we have provided contractual indemnification.
our future growth is largely dependent upon our ability to develop new technologies and introduce new products that achieve market acceptance in increasingly competitive markets with acceptable margins.
our future growth rate depends upon a number of factors, including our ability to (i) identify emerging technological trends in our target end-markets, (ii) develop and maintain competitive products and defend our market share against an ever-expanding number of competitors including many new and non- traditional competitors, (iii) enhance our products by adding innovative features that differentiate our products from those of our competitors and prevent commoditization of our products, (iv) develop, manufacture and bring compelling new products to market quickly and cost-effectively, and (v) attract, develop and retain individuals with the requisite technical expertise and understanding of customers needs to develop new technologies and introduce new products.
the failure of our technologies or products to gain market acceptance due to more attractive offerings by our competitors could significantly reduce our revenues and adversely affect our competitive standing and prospects.
failure to increase productivity through sustainable operational improvements, as well as an inability to successfully execute repositioning projects, may reduce our profitability or adversely impact our businesses.
our profitability and margin growth are dependent upon our ability to drive sustainable improvements. in addition, we seek productivity and cost savings benefits through repositioning actions and projects, such as consolidation of manufacturing facilities, transitions to cost-competitive regions and product line rationalizations. risks associated with these actions include delays in execution of the planned initiatives, additional unexpected costs and adverse effects on employee morale. we may not realize the full operational or financial benefits we expect, the recognition of these benefits may be delayed and these actions may potentially disrupt our operations.
as a supplier of military and other equipment to the u.s. government, we are subject to unusual risks, such as the right of the u.s. government to terminate contracts for convenience and to conduct audits and investigations of our operations and performance.
u.s. government contracts are subject to termination by the government, either for the convenience of the government or for our failure to perform consistent with the terms of the applicable contract. our contracts with the u.s. government are also subject to government audits that may recommend downward price adjustments and other changes. when appropriate and prudent, we have made adjustments and paid voluntary refunds in the past and may do so in the future.
we are also subject to government investigations of business practices and compliance with government procurement regulations. if, as a result of any such investigation or other government investigations (including violations of certain environmental, employment or export laws), honeywell or one of its businesses were found to have violated applicable law, it could be suspended from bidding on or receiving awards of new government contracts, suspended from contract performance pending the completion of legal proceedings and/or have its export privileges suspended.
our operations and the prior operations of predecessor companies expose us to the risk of material environmental liabilities.
mainly because of past operations and operations of predecessor companies, we are subject to potentially material liabilities related to the remediation of environmental hazards and to claims of personal injuries or property damages that may be caused by hazardous substance releases and exposures. we continue to incur remedial response and voluntary clean-up costs for site contamination and are a party to lawsuits and claims associated with environmental and safety matters, including past production of products containing hazardous substances. additional lawsuits, claims and costs involving environmental matters are likely to continue to arise in the future. various federal, state, local and foreign governments regulate the discharge of materials into the environment and can impose substantial fines and criminal sanctions for violations, and require installation of costly equipment or operational changes to limit emissions and/or decrease the likelihood of accidental hazardous substance releases. in addition, changes in laws, regulations and enforcement of policies, the discovery of previously unknown contamination or new technology or information related to individual sites, the establishment of stricter state or federal toxicity standards with respect to certain contaminants, or the imposition of new clean-up requirements or remedial techniques could require us to incur additional costs in the future that would have a negative effect on our financial condition or results of operations.
cybersecurity incidents could disrupt business operations, result in the loss of critical and confidential information, and adversely impact our reputation and results of operations.
global cybersecurity threats and incidents can range from uncoordinated individual attempts to gain unauthorized access to information technology (it) systems to sophisticated and targeted measures known as advanced persistent threats, directed at the company, its products, its customers and/or its third party service providers including cloud providers. our customers, including the u.s. government, are increasingly requiring cybersecurity protections and mandating cybersecurity standards in our products and we may incur additional costs to comply with such demands. while we have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, these types of threats and incidents, none of them to date have been material to the company. we seek to deploy comprehensive measures to deter, prevent, detect, respond and mitigate these threats (including access controls, data encryption, vulnerability assessments, product software designs which we believe are less susceptible to cyber attacks, continuous monitoring of our it networks and systems and maintenance of backup and protective systems. despite these efforts, cybersecurity incidents, depending on their nature and scope, could potentially result in the misappropriation, destruction, corruption or unavailability of critical data and confidential or proprietary information (our own or that of third parties) and the disruption of business operations. cybersecurity incidents aimed at the software imbedded in our products could lead to third party claims that our product failures have caused a similar range of damages to our customers, and this risk is enhanced by the increasingly connected nature of our products. the potential consequences of a material cybersecurity incident include reputational damage, litigation with third parties, fines levied by the federal trade commission, diminution in the value of our investment in research, development and engineering, and increased cybersecurity protection and remediation costs, which in turn could adversely affect our competitiveness and results of operations.
legal and regulatory risks our u.s. and non-u.s. tax liabilities are dependent, in part, upon the distribution of income among various jurisdictions in which we operate.
our future results of operations could be adversely affected by changes in the effective tax rate as a result of a change in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in tax laws, regulations and judicial rulings (or changes in the interpretation thereof), changes in generally accepted accounting principles, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in the amount of earnings permanently reinvested offshore, the results of audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns and continuing assessments of our tax exposures and various other governmental enforcement initiatives. our tax expense includes estimates of tax reserves and reflects other estimates and assumptions, including assessments of future earnings of the company which could impact the valuation of our deferred tax assets. changes in tax laws or regulations, including multi- jurisdictional changes enacted in response to the guidelines provided by the organization for economic co-operation and development (oecd) to address base erosion and profit shifting, will increase tax uncertainty and may adversely impact our provision for income taxes.
changes in legislation or government regulations or policies can have a significant impact on our results of operations.
the sales and margins of each of our segments are directly impacted by government regulations including safety, performance and product certification regulations. within aerospace, the operating results of commercial original equipment and commercial aftermarket may be impacted by, among other things, mandates of the federal aviation administration and other similar international regulatory bodies requiring the installation of equipment on aircraft. our defense and space business unit may be affected by changes in government procurement regulations, while emissions, fuel economy and energy efficiency standards for motor vehicles can impact transportation systems. within acs, the demand for and cost of providing products, services and solutions can be impacted by fire, security, safety, health care, environmental and energy efficiency standards and regulations. pmts results of operations can be affected by environmental, safety and energy efficiency standards and regulations. growth in all our businesses within emerging markets may be adversely impacted by the inability to acquire and retain qualified employees where local employment law mandates may be restrictive.
we cannot predict with certainty the outcome of litigation matters, government proceedings and other contingencies and uncertainties.
we are subject to a number of lawsuits, investigations and disputes (some of which involve substantial amounts claimed) arising out of the conduct of our business, including matters relating to commercial transactions, government contracts, product liability (including asbestos), prior acquisitions and divestitures, employment, employee benefits plans, intellectual property, antitrust, import and export matters and environmental, health and safety matters. our potential liabilities are subject to change over time due to new developments, changes in settlement strategy or the impact of evidentiary requirements, and we may become subject to or be required to pay damage awards or settlements that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. while we maintain insurance for certain risks, the amount of our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover the total amount of all insured claims and liabilities. the incurrence of significant liabilities for which there is no or insufficient insurance coverage could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows, liquidity and financial condition.
item 7. managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations
the following managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (md&a) is intended to help the reader understand the results of operations and financial condition of honeywell international inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries (honeywell or the company) for the three years ended december 31, 2015. all references to notes relate to notes to financial statements in item 8. financial statements and supplementary data.
executive summary in 2015, honeywell successfully navigated a challenging macro-economic climate by combining strategic growth in our diverse portfolio and our well-known cost discipline with a marked acceleration of our capital deployment strategy. earnings per share of common stockassuming dilution, grew 13% to $6.04 per share in 2015 and net income attributable to honeywell grew 12% to $4,768 million. our balanced long-term focus on enhancing shareowner value resulted in segment margin expansion of 220 basis points versus 2014 without sacrificing seed planting intended to ensure future growth, including maintaining r&d spending at 5% of sales, new product introductions aligned with global macroeconomic trends in energy, safety and security and productivity, $216 million of repositioning investments to improve our operations and increased investment in high growth regions. honeywell operating system (hos) gold and honeywell user experience (hue) initiatives intensified throughout the company, driving productivity through sustainable improvements to our factories, footprints and supply chain.
in 2015 we deployed capital of over $10 billion, including the following:
   mergers and acquisitionswe deployed over $5 billion during 2015, acquiring businesses that will be integrated into each of our three operating segments. these acquisitions all share a technology focus and increase our existing deep alignment with enduring macro trends such as energy efficiency, clean energy generation, safety and security, urbanization and customer productivity.
   share repurchaseswe continue to opportunistically repurchase our shares with the goal of generally keeping share count flat and seeking to offset the dilutive impact of employee stock based compensation plans. in 2015, we repurchased 18.8 million shares for $1.9 billion.
   capital investment in facilitieswe invested over $1 billion in high return capital expenditures, focused on revenue growth projects such as our solstice low global-warming potential refrigerant products for the automotive industry and catalyst products in uop.
% change compared with prior period                   (4   )%                       3   %
the change in net sales is attributable to the following:
acquisitions/divestitures                  (1)%                         1%
foreign currency translation               (4)%                          
a discussion of net sales by segment can be found in the review of business segments section of this md&a. the foreign currency translation impact is principally driven by the weakening of the euro and canadian dollar against the u.s. dollar.
% change compared with prior period                     (8   )%                         2   %
cost of products and services sold decreased in 2015 compared with 2014 principally due to a decrease in direct and indirect material costs of approximately $1,460 million (driven primarily by the favorable impact of foreign currency translation, productivity, lower raw materials pass-through pricing and the absence of the friction materials business, partially offset by higher sales volume), a decrease in labor costs of approximately $450 million and higher pension income of approximately $230 million.
gross margin percentage increased in 2015 compared with 2014 principally due to higher gross margin in all of our business segments (approximately 2.0 percentage point impact collectively) and increased pension income allocated to cost of products and services sold (approximately 0.5 percentage point impact).
cost of products and services sold increased in 2014 compared with 2013 principally due to an increase in direct material and labor costs of approximately $645 million (driven by higher sales volume and acquisitions, net of divestitures) and an increase in pension and other postretirement benefit expense of approximately $35 million, partially offset by a decrease in repositioning and other charges of approximately $40 million.
gross margin percentage increased in 2014 compared with 2013 principally due to higher gross margin in all of our business segments (approximately 0.7 percentage point impact collectively) and lower repositioning and other charges (approximately 0.1 percentage point impact), partially offset by higher pension and other postretirement benefit expense (approximately 0.1 percentage point impact).
selling, general and administrative expenses (sg&a) decreased in 2015 compared with 2014 primarily driven by the favorable impact from foreign currency translation, increased pension income, decreased indirect costs and benefits from repositioning, partially offset by increased labor costs (primarily merit increases and investment for growth).
sg&a increased in 2014 compared with 2013 primarily driven by an increase in labor costs (primarily acquisitions, incentive compensation, merit increases and investment for growth) and an increase in pension and other postretirement benefit expense, partially offset by a decrease in repositioning charges.
for discussion of changes in the effective tax rate, see note 5 income taxes in the notes to financial statements.
the effective tax rates for 2015, 2014 and 2013 are lower than the u.s. statutory rate of 35% primarily due to lower tax rates on non-u.s. earnings, the vast majority of which we intend to permanently reinvest outside the united states.
the company currently expects the effective tax rate for 2016 to be approximately 26.5%. the effective tax rate can vary from quarter to quarter due to unusual or infrequently occurring items, the resolution of income tax audits, changes in tax laws or other items such as pension mark-to-market adjustments.
earnings per share of common stockassuming dilution increased in 2015 compared with 2014 primarily driven by increased segment profit in each of our business segments and lower pension and other postretirement expense, partially offset by increased tax expense and lower other income (principally due to the absence of a realized gain related to the prior year sale of marketable equity securities).
earnings per share of common stockassuming dilution increased in 2014 compared with 2013 primarily due to increased segment profit in each of our business segments and lower repositioning and other charges, partially offset by higher pension and other postretirement expense and increased tax expense.
business overview our consolidated results are principally impacted by:
   change in global economic growth rates and industry conditions and demand in our key end markets;
   overall sales mix, in particular the mix of aerospace original equipment and aftermarket sales and the mix of acs products, distribution and services sales;
   the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates (in particular the euro), relative to the u.s. dollar;
   the extent to which cost savings from productivity actions are able to offset or exceed the impact of material and non-material inflation; and
   the impact of the pension discount rate and asset returns on pension expense, including mark-to-market adjustments, and funding requirements.
our 2016 areas of focus are supported by the honeywell enablers, including hos gold, are generally applicable to each of our operating segments and include:
   driving profitable growth through r&amp;d, technological excellence and optimized manufacturing capability to deliver innovative products that customers value;
   expanding margins by maintaining and improving the companys cost structure through manufacturing and administrative process improvements, repositioning, and other actions, which will drive productivity and enhance the flexibility of the business as it works to proactively respond to changes in end market demand;
   driving strong cash flow conversion through effective working capital management which will enable the company to deploy capital for strategic acquisitions, capital expenditures and returning cash to shareholders;
   executing disciplined, rigorous m&amp;a and integration processes to deliver inorganic growth through previously announced acquisitions while also identifying appropriate acquisitions to further deploy our capital effectively;
   aligning and prioritizing capital expenditures for long-term growth, while considering short-term demand volatility;
   actively monitoring trends in the oil and gas industry end markets, principally the demand from midstream and downstream customers for products and services provided by process solutions and uop;
   monitoring both suppliers and customers for signs of liquidity constraints, limiting exposure to any resultjing inability to meet delivery commitments or pay amounts due, and identifying alternate sources of supply as necessary;
   proactively managing raw material costs through formula and long-term supply agreements and hedging activities, where feasible and prudent; and
   controlling corporate and other non-operating costs, including costs incurred for asbestos and environmental matters, pension and other post-retirement expenses and tax expense.

2015 compared with 2014
aerospace sales decreased primarily due to the unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation and the friction materials divestiture, partially offset by an increase in organic sales, as discussed below, and a decrease in incentives predominantly to air transport and regional aviation original equipment manufacturers (oem incentives).
   commercial original equipment sales increased by 11% (increased 5% organic) primarily driven by a decrease in oem incentives and higher business and general aviation engine shipments.
   commercial aftermarket sales increased by 2% (increased 2% organic) primarily driven by higher repair and overhaul activities, partially offset by lower retrofits, modifications and upgrades for business and general aviation customers.
   transportation systems sales decreased by 19% (increased 3% organic) primarily due to the unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation and the friction materials divestiture, partially offset by continued growth from new platform launches and higher global turbo gas penetration.
aerospace segment profit increased primarily due to an 8% increase in operational segment profit and a 6% favorable impact of acquisitions, divestitures and other (predominantly the absence of higher prior year oem incentives), as discussed above, partially offset by a 4% unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation. the increase in operational segment profit is primarily driven by productivity, net of inflation, and favorable pricing, partially offset by continued investments for growth. cost of products and services sold decreased primarily due to the favorable impact of foreign currency translation, the friction materials divestiture, and productivity, net of inflation, partially offset by continued investments for growth.

pmt sales increased due to an increase in organic sales partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation.
   uop sales increased by 8% driven primarily by higher catalyst and gas processing volumes partially offset by lower equipment and service revenues in the first nine months. catalyst sales decreased in the fourth quarter due to the timing of shipments as well as stronger volume growth in the fourth quarter of 2013 as compared to 2014 which was partially offset by increased licensing revenues.
   sales in our process solutions business increased by 1% (4% organic) driven primarily by volume growth in advanced solutions software and services and field products partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation, predominately in the fourth quarter. project and service orders and backlog increased in 2014.
   advanced materials sales increased by 3% primarily driven by increased volume in fluorine products and resins and chemicals, partially offset by unfavorable pricing most significantly in fluorine products and lower raw materials pass-through pricing in resins and chemicals. we anticipate lower raw materials pass-through pricing to continue in 2015 primarily in resins and chemicals where sales fluctuate with the market price of certain raw materials, which are correlated to the price of oil.
pmt segment profit increased due to an increase in operational segment profit partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation. the increase in operational segment profit is primarily due to higher sales volumes, as discussed above, and productivity, net of inflation partially offset by unfavorable advanced materials pricing, continued investment for growth and unfavorable foreign currency translation. cost of products and services sold increased primarily due to higher volume and continued investment for growth partially offset by productivity, net of inflation and the favorable impact of foreign currency translation.
repositioning charges see note 3 repositioning and other charges of notes to financial statements for a discussion of our repositioning actions and related charges incurred in 2015, 2014 and 2013. these repositioning actions are expected to generate incremental pretax savings of $175 million to $200 million in 2016 compared with 2015 principally from planned workforce reductions. cash spending related to our repositioning actions was $118 million, $161 million and $160 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, and was funded through operating cash flows. in 2016, we expect cash spending for repositioning actions to be approximately $175 million and to be funded through operating cash flows.
liquidity and capital resources the company continues to manage its businesses to maximize operating cash flows as the primary source of liquidity. in addition to our available cash and operating cash flows, additional sources of liquidity include committed credit lines, short-term debt from the commercial paper market, long-term borrowings, and access to the public debt and equity markets. we continue to balance our cash and financing uses through investment in our existing core businesses, acquisition activity, share repurchases and dividends.
cash flow summary our cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, as reflected in the consolidated statement of cash flows, are summarized as follows:
cash provided by (used for):

2015 compared with 2014
cash provided by operating activities increased by $430 million primarily due to a $489 million favorable impact from working capital and a $382 million increase in net income before the non-cash pension mark-to-market adjustment, partially offset by (i) a $175 million decrease in customer advances and deferred income, (ii) $151 million in oem incentives and (iii) increased cash tax payments of $50 million.
cash used for investing activities increased by $4,638 million primarily due to an increase in cash paid for acquisitions of $5,224 million, most significantly the elster division of melrose industries plc (elster), and a decrease in proceeds of $159 million, primarily from the friction materials divestiture, partially offset by a net $659 million decrease in investments, primarily short-term marketable securities.
cash provided by financing activities increased by $2,374 million primarily due to an increase in the net proceeds from debt issuances of $3,648 million, partially offset by an increase in net repurchases of common stock of $1,039 million and an increase in cash dividends paid of $216 million.
2014 compared with 2013
cash provided by operating activities increased by $689 million primarily due to (i) a $508 million increase of net income before the non-cash pension mark-to-market adjustment, (ii) reduced net payments for repositioning and other charges of $233 million primarily due to the collection of a $130 million asbestos receivable due from one of our insurance carriers and lower asbestos related payments of $98 million, (iii) reduced cash contributions to our pension and other postretirement plans of $131 million and (iv) lower cash tax payments of approximately $129 million, partially offset by a $93 million unfavorable impact from working capital primarily driven by higher inventory to support sales growth.
cash used for investing activities decreased by $83 million primarily due to a decrease in cash paid for acquisitions of $1,129 million most significantly intermec and rae systems, inc. in 2013 and an increase in proceeds from the sales of businesses of $157 million (most significantly friction materials), partially offset by (i) a net $688 million increase in investments primarily short-term marketable securities, (ii) an increase of approximately $371 million in settlement payments of foreign currency exchange contracts used as economic hedges on certain non-functional currency
denominated monetary assets and liabilities and (iii) a $147 million increase in expenditures for property, plant and equipment.
cash used for financing activities increased by $1,839 million primarily due to a decrease in the net proceeds from debt issuances of $1,589 million, an increase in cash dividends paid of $157 million and lower net proceeds from the issuance of common stock of $33 million.
liquidity each of our businesses is focused on implementing strategies to increase operating cash flows through revenue growth, margin expansion and improved working capital turnover. considering the current economic environment in which each of the businesses operate and their business plans and strategies, including the focus on growth, cost reduction and productivity initiatives, we believe that cash balances and operating cash flow will continue to be our principal source of liquidity. in addition to the available cash and operating cash flows, additional sources of liquidity include committed credit lines, short-term debt from the commercial paper markets, long-term borrowings, and access to the public debt and equity markets. at december 31, 2015, a substantial portion of the companys cash and cash equivalents were held by foreign subsidiaries. if the amounts held outside of the u.s. were to be repatriated, under current law, they would be subject to u.s. federal income taxes, less applicable foreign tax credits. however, our intent is to permanently reinvest the vast majority of these funds outside of the u.s. it is not practicable to estimate the amount of tax that might be payable if some or all of such earnings were to be repatriated, and the amount of foreign tax credits that would be available to reduce or eliminate the resulting u.s. income tax liability.
we monitor the third-party depository institutions that hold our cash and cash equivalents on a daily basis. our emphasis is primarily safety of principal and secondarily maximizing yield of those funds. we diversify our cash and cash equivalents among counterparties to minimize exposure to any one of these entities.
a source of liquidity is our ability to issue short-term debt in the commercial paper market. commercial paper notes are sold at a discount and have a maturity of not more than 365 days from date of issuance. borrowings under the commercial paper program are available for general corporate purposes as well as for financing acquisitions. the weighted average interest rate on short-term borrowings and commercial paper outstanding at december 31, 2015 and 2014 was 0.26% and 0.60%.
our ability to access the commercial paper market, and the related cost of these borrowings, is affected by the strength of our credit rating and market conditions. our credit ratings are periodically reviewed by the major independent debt-rating agencies. as of december 31, 2015, standard and poors (s&p), fitch, and moodys have ratings on our long-term debt of a, a and a2 and short-term debt of a-1, f1 and p1. s&p, fitch and moodys have honeywells rating outlook as stable. to date, the company has not experienced any limitations in our ability to access these sources of liquidity.
we also have a current shelf registration statement filed with the securities and exchange commission under which we may issue additional debt securities, common stock and preferred stock that may be offered in one or more offerings on terms to be determined at the time of the offering. net proceeds of any offering would be used for general corporate purposes, including repayment of existing indebtedness, share repurchases, capital expenditures and acquisitions.
during 2015, the company entered into credit agreements with a syndicate of banks. see note 12 long-term debt and credit agreements of notes to financial statements for further discussion on the credit agreements.
during 2015, the company repurchased $1,884 million of outstanding shares to offset the dilutive impact of employee stock based compensation plans, including option exercises, restricted unit vesting and matching contributions under our savings plans. in december 2013, the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to a total of $5 billion of honeywell common stock, $2.2 billion remained available as of december 31, 2015 for additional share repurchases. honeywell presently expects to repurchase outstanding shares from time to time to offset the dilutive impact of employee stock based compensation plans, including future option exercises, restricted unit vesting and matching contributions under our savings plans.
in addition to our normal operating cash requirements, our principal future cash requirements will be to fund capital expenditures, dividends, strategic acquisitions, share repurchases, employee benefit obligations, environmental remediation costs, asbestos claims, severance and exit costs related to repositioning actions and debt repayments.
specifically, we expect our primary cash requirements in 2016 to be as follows:
   capital expenditureswe expect to spend approximately $1.1 billion for capital expenditures in 2016 primarily for growth, production and capacity expansion, cost reduction, maintenance, and replacement.
   share repurchasesunder the companys share repurchase program, $2.2 billion is available as of december 31, 2015 for additional share repurchases. honeywell presently expects to repurchase outstanding shares from time to time to generally offset the dilutive impact of employee stock-based compensation plans, including option exercises, restricted unit vesting and matching contributions under our savings plans. the amount and timing of future repurchases may vary depending on market conditions and our level of operating, financing and other investing activities.
   dividendswe increased our dividend rate by 15% to $.5950 per share of common stock effective with the fourth quarter 2015 dividend. the company intends to continue to pay quarterly dividends in 2016.
   asbestos claimswe expect our cash spending for asbestos claims and our cash receipts for related insurance recoveries to be approximately $295 million and $25 million in 2016.
   pension contributionsin 2016, we are not required to make contributions to our u.s. pension plans. we plan to make contributions of cash and/or marketable securities of approximately $160 million ($106 million of marketable securities were contributed in january 2016) to our non-u.s. plans to satisfy regulatory funding standards. the timing and amount of contributions to both our u.s. and non-u.s. plans may be impacted by a number of factors, including the funded status of the plans.
   repositioning actionswe expect that cash spending for severance and other exit costs necessary to execute repositioning actions will approximate $175 million in 2016.
   environmental remediation costswe expect to spend approximately $250 million in 2016 for remedial response and voluntary clean-up costs.
   acquisitionswe acquired the remaining 30 percent noncontrolling interest in uop russell llc for approximately $240 million in january 2016. in addition, in february 2016 we acquired com dev international for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $330 million and entered into a definitive agreement to acquire xtralis international holdings limited for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $480 million.
we continuously assess the relative strength of each business in our portfolio as to strategic fit, market position, profit and cash flow contribution in order to upgrade our combined portfolio and identify business units that will most benefit from increased investment. we identify acquisition candidates that will further our strategic plan and strengthen our existing core businesses. we also identify businesses that do not fit into our long-term strategic plan based on their market position, relative profitability or growth potential. these businesses are considered for potential divestiture, restructuring or other repositioning actions subject to regulatory constraints. in 2015 and 2014, we realized $1 million and $160 million in cash proceeds from sales of non-strategic businesses.
based on past performance and current expectations, we believe that our operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our future operating cash needs. our available cash, committed credit lines, access to the public debt and equity markets, provide additional sources of short-term and long-term liquidity to fund current operations, debt maturities, and future investment opportunities.

(2)   purchase obligations are entered into with various vendors in the normal course of business and are consistent with our expected requirements.
(3)   the payment amounts in the table only reflect the environmental liabilities which are probable and reasonably estimable as of december 31, 2015.
(4)   these amounts are estimates of asbestos related cash payments for narco and bendix based on our asbestos related liabilities which are probable and reasonably estimable as of december 31, 2015. see asbestos matters in note 19 commitments and contingencies of notes to financial statements for additional information.
(5)   these amounts represent our insurance recoveries that are deemed probable for asbestos related liabilities as of december 31, 2015. see asbestos matters in note 19 commitments and contingencies of notes to financial statements for additional information.
(6)   the table excludes tax liability payments, including those for unrecognized tax benefits. see note 5 income taxes of notes to financial statements for additional information.
environmental matters accruals for environmental matters deemed probable and reasonably estimable were $194 million, $268 million and $272 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013. in addition, in 2015 and 2014 we incurred operating costs for ongoing businesses of approximately $90 million and $88 million relating to compliance with environmental regulations.
spending related to known environmental matters was $273 million, $321 million and $304 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013 and is estimated to be approximately $250 million in 2016. we expect to fund expenditures for these environmental matters from operating cash flow. the timing of cash expenditures depends on a numbers of factors, including the timing of litigation and settlements of remediation liability, personal injury and property damage claims, regulatory approval of cleanup projects, execution timeframe of projects, remedial techniques to be utilized and agreement with other parties.

critical accounting policies the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles is based on the selection and application of accounting policies that require us to make significant estimates and assumptions about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. we consider the accounting policies discussed below to be critical to the understanding of our financial statements. actual results could differ from our estimates and assumptions, and any such differences could be material to our consolidated financial statements.
contingent liabilitieswe are subject to a number of lawsuits, investigations and claims (some of which involve substantial dollar amounts) that arise out of the conduct of our global business operations or those of previously owned entities, including matters relating to commercial transactions, government contracts, product liability (including asbestos), prior acquisitions and divestitures, employee benefit plans, intellectual property, and environmental, health and safety matters. we continually assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to our contingencies, as well as potential amounts or ranges of probable losses, and recognize a liability, if any, for these contingencies based on a careful analysis of each matter with the assistance of outside legal counsel and, if applicable, other experts. such analysis includes making judgments concerning matters such as the costs associated with environmental matters, the outcome of negotiations, the number and cost of pending and future asbestos claims, and the impact of evidentiary requirements. because most contingencies are resolved over long periods of time, liabilities may change in the future due to new developments (including new discovery of facts, changes in legislation and outcomes of similar cases through the judicial system), changes in assumptions or changes in our settlement strategy. see note 19 commitments and contingencies of notes to financial statements for a discussion of
managements judgment applied in the recognition and measurement of our environmental and asbestos liabilities which represent our most significant contingencies.
asbestos related contingencies and insurance recoverieshoneywells involvement in asbestos related personal injury actions relates to two predecessor companies. regarding north american refractories company (narco) asbestos related claims, we accrued for pending claims based on terms and conditions in agreements with narco, its former parent company, and certain asbestos claimants, and an estimate of the unsettled claims pending as of the time narco filed for bankruptcy protection. we also accrued for the estimated value of future narco asbestos related claims expected to be asserted against the narco trust through 2018. in light of the inherent uncertainties in making long term projections and in connection with the initial operation of a 524(g) trust, as well as the stay of all narco asbestos claims from january 2002 through the effective date of the narco trust on april 30, 2013, we do not believe that we have a reasonable basis for estimating narco asbestos claims beyond 2018. regarding bendix asbestos related claims, we accrued for the estimated value of pending claims using average resolution values for the previous five years. we also accrued for the estimated value of future anticipated claims related to bendix for the next five years based on historic claims filing experience and dismissal rates, disease classifications, and average resolution values in the tort system for the previous five years. in light of the uncertainties inherent in making long-term projections, as well as certain factors unique to friction product asbestos claims, we do not believe that we have a reasonable basis for estimating asbestos claims beyond the next five years.
in connection with the recognition of liabilities for asbestos related matters, we record asbestos related insurance recoveries that are deemed probable. in assessing the probability of insurance recovery, we make judgments concerning insurance coverage that we believe are reasonable and consistent with our historical dealings and our knowledge of any pertinent solvency issues surrounding insurers. while the substantial majority of our insurance carriers are solvent, some of our individual carriers are insolvent, which has been considered in our analysis of probable recoveries. projecting future events is subject to various uncertainties that could cause the insurance recovery on asbestos related liabilities to be higher or lower than that projected and recorded. given the inherent uncertainty in making future projections, we reevaluate our projections concerning our probable insurance recoveries in light of any changes to the projected liability, our recovery experience or other relevant factors that may impact future insurance recoveries.
see note 19 commitments and contingencies of notes to financial statements for a discussion of managements judgments applied in the recognition and measurement of our asbestos-related liabilities and related insurance recoveries.
defined benefit pension planswe sponsor both funded and unfunded u.s. and non-u.s. defined benefit pension plans. for financial reporting purposes, net periodic pension (income) expense is calculated annually based upon a number of actuarial assumptions, including a discount rate for plan obligations and an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. changes in the discount rate and expected long-term rate of return on plan assets could materially affect the annual pension (income) expense amount. annual pension (income) expense is comprised of a potential mark-to-market adjustment (mtm adjustment) and service and interest cost, assumed return on plan assets and prior service amortization (pension ongoing (income) expense).
the key assumptions used in developing our 2015, 2014 and 2013 net periodic pension (income) expense for our u.s. plans included the following:
assets:
the mtm adjustment represents the recognition of net actuarial gains or losses in excess of the corridor. net actuarial gains and losses occur when the actual experience differs from any of the
various assumptions used to value our pension plans or when assumptions change. the primary factors contributing to actuarial gains and losses are changes in the discount rate used to value pension obligations as of the measurement date each year and the difference between expected and actual returns on plan assets. the mark-to-market accounting method results in the potential for volatile and difficult to forecast mtm adjustments. mtm charges were $67 million, $249 million and $51 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013.
we determine the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets utilizing historical plan asset returns over varying long-term periods combined with our expectations of future market conditions and asset mix considerations (see note 20 pension and other postretirement benefits of notes to financial statements for details on the actual various asset classes and targeted asset allocation percentages for our pension plans). we plan to continue to use an expected rate of return on plan assets of 7.75% for 2016 as this is a long-term rate based on historical plan asset returns over varying long term periods combined with our expectations of future market conditions and the asset mix of the plans investments.
the discount rate reflects the market rate on december 31 (measurement date) for high-quality fixed-income investments with maturities corresponding to our benefit obligations and is subject to change each year. the discount rate can be volatile from year to year as it is determined based upon prevailing interest rates as of the measurement date. we will use a 4.46% discount rate as of december 31, 2015, reflecting the increase in the market interest rate environment since the prior year-end.
in addition to the potential for mtm adjustments, changes in our expected rate of return on plan assets and discount rate resulting from economic events also affects future pension ongoing (income) expense. the following table highlights the sensitivity of our u.s. pension obligations and ongoing (income) expense to changes in these assumptions, assuming all other assumptions remain constant. these estimates exclude any potential mtm adjustment:
change in assumption   impact on 2016         impact on pbo pension ongoing expense
0.25 percentage point decrease in expected rate of return on assets   increase $40 million   
0.25 percentage point increase in expected rate of return on assets   decrease $40 million   
pension ongoing income for all of our pension plans is expected to be approximately $580 million in 2016 compared with pension ongoing income of $430 million in 2015. the expected increase is primarily due to lower service and interest costs resulting mainly from the change in our discount rate methodology as described in note 20 pension and other postretirement benefits of notes to financial statements and the plan amendment in the fourth quarter of 2015 to freeze final average compensation in our u.s. pension plans as of december 31, 2015 partially offset by the impact of lower asset returns in 2015. also, if required, an mtm adjustment will be recorded in the fourth quarter of 2016 in accordance with our pension accounting method as previously described. it is difficult to reliably forecast or predict whether there will be a mtm adjustment in 2016, and if one is required what the magnitude of such adjustment will be. mtm adjustments are primarily driven by events and circumstances beyond the control of the company such as changes in interest rates and the performance of the financial markets.
long-lived assets (including tangible and finite-lived intangible assets)the determination of useful lives (for depreciation/amortization purposes) and whether or not tangible and intangible assets are impaired involves the use of accounting estimates and assumptions, changes in which could materially impact our financial condition or operating performance if actual results differ from such estimates and assumptions. we evaluate the recoverability of the carrying amount of our long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a long-lived asset group may not be fully recoverable. the principal factors in considering when to perform an impairment review are as follows:
   significant under-performance (i.e., declines in sales, earnings or cash flows) of a business or product line in relation to expectations;
   annual operating plans or five-year strategic plans that indicate an unfavorable trend in operating performance of a business or product line;
   significant changes or planned changes in our use of the assets.
once it is determined that an impairment review is necessary, recoverability of assets is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset grouping to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows. if the carrying amount exceeds the estimated future undiscounted cash flows, the asset grouping is considered to be impaired. the impairment is then measured as the difference between the carrying amount of the asset grouping and its fair value. we endeavor to utilize the best information available to measure fair value, which is usually either market prices (if available), level 1 or level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, or an estimate of the future discounted cash flow, level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. the key estimates in our discounted cash flow analysis include expected industry growth rates, our assumptions as to volume, selling prices and costs, and the discount rate selected.
goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets impairment testingin testing goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, the fair value is estimated utilizing a discounted cash flow approach utilizing cash flow forecasts in our five year strategic and annual operating plans adjusted for terminal value assumptions. these impairment tests involve the use of accounting estimates and assumptions, changes in which could materially impact our financial condition or operating performance if actual results differ from such estimates and assumptions. to address this uncertainty we perform sensitivity analysis on key estimates and assumptions.
income taxeson a recurring basis, we assess the need for a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets by considering all available positive and negative evidence, such as past operating results, projections of future taxable income, enacted tax law changes and the feasibility and impact of tax planning initiatives. our projections of future taxable income include a number of estimates and assumptions regarding our volume, pricing and costs, as well as the timing and amount of reversals of taxable temporary differences.
sales recognition on long-term contractsin 2015, we recognized approximately 14% of our total net sales using the percentage-of-completion method for long-term contracts. these long-term contracts are measured on the cost-to-cost basis for engineering-type contracts and the units-of-delivery basis for production-type contracts. accounting for these contracts involves management judgment in estimating total contract revenue and cost. contract revenues are largely determined by negotiated contract prices and quantities, modified by our assumptions regarding contract options, change orders, incentive and award provisions associated with technical performance and price adjustment clauses (such as inflation or index-based clauses). contract costs are incurred over a period of time, which can be several years, and the estimation of these costs requires management judgment. cost estimates are largely based on negotiated or estimated purchase contract terms, historical performance trends and other economic projections. significant factors that influence these estimates include inflationary trends, technical and schedule risk, internal and subcontractor performance trends, business volume assumptions, asset utilization, and anticipated labor agreements. revenue and cost estimates are regularly monitored and revised based on changes in circumstances. anticipated losses on long-term contracts are recognized when such losses become evident. we maintain financial controls over the customer qualification, contract pricing and estimation processes to reduce the risk of contract losses.

item 1a. risk   factors.
alcoas business, financial condition and results of operations may be impacted by a number of factors. in addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this report, the following risks and uncertainties could materially harm its business, financial condition or results of operations, including causing alcoas actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements. the following list of significant risk factors is not all-inclusive or necessarily in order of importance. additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to alcoa or that alcoa currently deems immaterial also may materially adversely affect us in future periods.
the aluminum industry and aluminum end-use markets are highly cyclical and are influenced by a number of factors, including global economic conditions.
the aluminum industry generally is highly cyclical, and alcoa is subject to cyclical fluctuations in global economic conditions and aluminum end-use markets. alcoa sells many products to industries that are cyclical, such as the commercial construction and transportation, automotive, and aerospace industries, and the demand for its products is sensitive to, and quickly impacted by, demand for the finished goods manufactured by its customers in these industries, which may change as a result of changes in the general u.s. or worldwide economy, currency exchange rates, energy prices or other factors beyond its control.
the demand for aluminum is highly correlated to economic growth. for example, the european sovereign debt crisis that began in late 2009 had an adverse effect on european demand for aluminum and aluminum products. the chinese market is a significant source of global demand for, and supply of, commodities, including aluminum. a sustained slowdown in chinas economic growth and aluminum demand, or a significant slowdown in other markets, that is not offset by decreases in supply or by increased aluminum demand in emerging economies, such as india, brazil, and several south east asian countries, could have an adverse effect on the global supply and demand for aluminum and aluminum prices.
while alcoa believes that the long-term prospects for aluminum and aluminum products are positive, the company is unable to predict the future course of industry variables or the strength of the global economy and the effects of government intervention. negative economic conditions, such as a major economic downturn, a prolonged recovery period, a downturn in the commodity sector, or disruptions in the financial markets, could have a material adverse effect on alcoas business, financial condition or results of operations.
the overall price of primary aluminum consists of several components: 1) the underlying base metal component, which is typically based on quoted prices from the london metal exchange (lme); 2) the regional premium, which comprises the incremental price over the base lme component that is associated with the physical delivery of metal to a particular region (e.g., the midwest premium for metal sold in the united states); and 3) the product premium, which represents the incremental price for receiving physical metal in a particular shape (e.g., coil, billet, slab, rod, etc.) or alloy. each of the above three components has its own drivers of variability.
the lme price is typically driven by macroeconomic factors, global supply and demand of aluminum (including expectations for growth and contraction and the level of global inventories), and financial investors. an imbalance in global supply and demand of aluminum, such as decreasing demand without corresponding supply declines, could have a negative impact on aluminum pricing. speculative trading in aluminum and the influence of hedge funds and other financial institutions participating in commodity markets have also increased in recent years, potentially contributing to higher levels of price volatility. in 2015, the cash lme price of aluminum reached a high of $1,919 per metric ton and a low of $1,424 per metric ton. high lme inventories, or the release of substantial inventories into the market, could lead to a reduction in the price of aluminum. declines in the lme price have had a negative impact on alcoas results of operations.
additionally, alcoas results could be adversely affected by decreases in regional premiums that participants in the physical metal market pay for immediate delivery of aluminum. regional premiums tend to vary based on the supply of and demand for metal in a particular region and associated transportation costs. lme warehousing rules could cause aluminum prices to decrease and surpluses have caused regional premiums to decrease, which would have a negative impact on the companys results of operations.
product premiums generally are a function of supply and demand for a given primary aluminum shape and alloy combination in a particular region. a sustained weak lme aluminum pricing environment, deterioration in lme aluminum prices, or a decrease in regional premiums or product premiums could have a material adverse effect on alcoas business, financial condition, and results of operations or cash flow.
since 2013, the lme has been engaged in a program aimed at reforming the rules under which registered warehouses in its global network operate. the initial rule changes took effect on february 1, 2015, and the lme has announced additional changes that will be implemented in 2016. these rule changes, and any subsequent changes that the exchange chooses to make, could impact the supply/demand balance in the primary aluminum physical market and may impact regional delivery premiums and lme aluminum prices. decreases in regional delivery premiums and/or decreases in lme aluminum prices could have a material adverse effect on alcoas business, financial condition, and results of operations or cash flow.
alcoa may not be able to realize the expected benefits from its strategy of transforming its portfolio by growing its value-add business and by creating a lower cost, competitive commodity business by optimizing its portfolio.
alcoa is continuing to execute on its strategy of transforming its portfolio by growing its value-add business to capture profitable growth as a lightweight metals innovation leader and by creating a lower cost, competitive commodity business by optimizing its portfolio. it is investing in its value-add manufacturing and engineering businesses to capture growth opportunities in strong end markets like automotive and aerospace. alcoa is building out its value-add businesses, including by introducing innovative new products and technology solutions, and investing in expansions of value-add capacity. alcoas growth projects include the joint venture with maaden in saudi arabia; the automotive expansions in davenport, iowa and alcoa, tennessee; the aluminum lithium capacity expansion in lafayette, indiana, at the alcoa technical center in pennsylvania and at the kitts green plant in the united kingdom; and the expansion in aerospace capabilities in la porte, indiana, hampton, virginia and davenport, iowa. from time to time, alcoa also pursues growth opportunities that are strategically aligned with its objectives, such as the acquisition of the firth rixson business (completed in november 2014), the acquisition of tital (completed in march 2015) and the acquisition of rti international metals (completed in july 2015). in addition, alcoa is optimizing its rolling mill portfolio as part of its strategy for profitable growth in the midstream business. at the same time, the company is creating a competitive commodity business by taking decisive actions to lower the cost base of its upstream operations, including closing, selling or curtailing high-cost global smelting capacity, optimizing alumina refining capacity, and pursuing the sale of its interest in certain other operations.
alcoa has made, and may continue to plan and execute, acquisitions and divestitures and take other actions to grow or streamline its portfolio. although management believes that its strategic actions are beneficial to alcoa, there is no assurance that anticipated benefits will be realized. adverse factors may prevent alcoa from realizing the benefits of its growth projects, including unfavorable global economic conditions, currency fluctuations, or unexpected delays in target timelines. acquisitions present significant challenges and risks, including the effective integration of the business into the company, unanticipated costs and liabilities, and the ability to realize anticipated benefits, such as growth in market share, revenue or margins, at the levels or in the timeframe expected. the company may be unable to manage acquisitions successfully.
with respect to portfolio optimization actions such as divestitures, curtailments and closures, alcoa may face barriers to exit from unprofitable businesses or operations, including high exit costs or objections from various stakeholders. in addition, alcoa may retain unforeseen liabilities for divested entities if a buyer fails to honor all commitments. alcoas business operations are capital intensive, and curtailment or closure of operations or facilities may include significant charges, including employee separation costs, asset impairment charges and other measures.
there can be no assurance that acquisitions, growth investments, divestitures or closures will be undertaken or completed in their entirety as planned or that they will be beneficial to alcoa.
in response to market-driven factors relating to the global supply and demand of aluminum, alcoa has curtailed or closed portions of its aluminum production. certain other aluminum producers have independently undertaken to make cuts in production as well. however, the existence of non-market forces on global aluminum industry capacity, such as political pressures in certain countries to keep jobs or to maintain or further develop industry self-sufficiency, may
prevent or delay the closure or curtailment of certain producers smelters, irrespective of their position on the industry cost curve. other production cuts may be impeded by long-term contracts to buy power or raw materials. if industry overcapacity persists due to the disruption by such non-market forces on the market-driven balancing of the global supply and demand of aluminum, the resulting weak pricing environment and margin compression may adversely affect the operating results of aluminum producers, including alcoa.
alcoas operations consume substantial amounts of energy; profitability may decline if energy costs rise or if energy supplies are interrupted.
alcoas operations consume substantial amounts of energy. although alcoa generally expects to meet the energy requirements for its alumina refineries and primary aluminum smelters from internal sources or from long-term contracts, certain conditions could negatively affect alcoas results of operations, including the following:
   significant increases in electricity costs rendering smelter operations uneconomic;
   unavailability of electrical power or other energy sources due to droughts, hurricanes or other natural causes;
   unavailability of energy due to energy shortages resulting in insufficient supplies to serve consumers;
   curtailment of one or more refineries or smelters due to the inability to extend energy contracts upon expiration or to negotiate new arrangements on cost-effective terms or due to the unavailability of energy at competitive rates; or
                                                 curtailment of one or more smelters due to a regulatory authoritys determination that power supply interruptibility rights granted to alcoa under an interruptibility regime in place under the laws of the country in which the smelter is located do not comply with the regulatory authoritys state aid rules, thus rendering the smelter operations that had been relying on such countrys interruptibility regime uneconomic.
if events such as those listed above were to occur, the resulting high energy costs or the disruption of an energy source or the requirement to repay all or a portion of the benefit alcoa received under a power supply interruptibility regime could have a material adverse effect on alcoas business and results of operations.
alcoas profitability could be adversely affected by increases in the cost of raw materials or by significant lag effects of decreases in commodity or lme-linked costs.
alcoas results of operations are affected by changes in the cost of raw materials, including energy, carbon products, caustic soda and other key inputs, as well as freight costs associated with transportation of raw materials to refining and smelting locations. alcoa may not be able to fully offset the effects of higher raw material costs or energy costs through price increases, productivity improvements or cost reduction programs. similarly, alcoas operating results are affected by significant lag effects of declines in key costs of production that are commodity or lme-linked. for example, declines in the lme-linked costs of alumina and power during a particular period may not be adequate to offset sharp declines in metal price in that period. increases in the cost of raw materials or decreases in input costs that are disproportionate to concurrent sharper decreases in the price of aluminum could have a material adverse effect on alcoas operating results.
alcoa is exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, as well as inflation, and other economic factors in the countries in which it operates.
economic factors, including inflation and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, competitive factors in the countries in which alcoa operates, and continued volatility or deterioration in the global economic and financial environment could affect alcoas revenues, expenses and results of operations. changes in the valuation of the u.s. dollar against other currencies, particularly the australian dollar, brazilian real, canadian dollar,
euro and norwegian kroner, may affect alcoas profitability as some important inputs are purchased in other currencies, while the companys upstream products are generally sold in u.s. dollars. in addition, although a strong u.s. dollar generally has a positive impact on alcoas near-term profitability, over a longer term, a strong u.s. dollar may have an unfavorable impact to alcoas position on the global aluminum cost curve due to alcoas u.s. smelting portfolio. as the u.s. dollar strengthens, the cost curve shifts down for smelters outside the u.s. but costs for alcoas u.s. smelting portfolio may not decline.
alcoa may not be able to successfully realize future targets or goals established for its business segments, at the levels or by the dates targeted.
from time to time, alcoa may announce future targets or goals for its business, which are based on the companys then current expectations, estimates, forecasts and projections about the operating environment, economies and markets in which alcoa operates. future targets and goals reflect the companys beliefs and assumptions and its perception of historical trends, then current conditions and expected future developments, as well as other factors management believes are appropriate in the circumstances. as such, targets and goals are inherently subject to significant business, economic, competitive and other uncertainties and contingencies regarding future events, including the risks discussed in this report. the actual outcome may be materially different. there can be no assurance that any targets or goals established by the company will be accomplished at the levels or by the dates targeted, if at all. failure to achieve the targets or goals by the company may have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, results of operations or the market price of its securities.
alcoa faces significant competition, which may have an adverse effect on profitability.
as discussed in part i, item 1. (businesscompetitive conditions) of this report, the markets for alcoas aluminum and non-aluminum products are highly competitive. alcoas competitors include a variety of both u.s. and non-u.s. companies in all major markets, including some that are subsidized. alcoas metals, including aluminum, titanium and nickel, compete with other materials, such as steel, plastics, composites, ceramics, and glass, among others, for various applications in alcoas key markets. new product offerings or new technologies in the marketplace may compete with or replace alcoa products. the willingness of customers to accept substitutes for the products sold by alcoa, the ability of large customers to exert leverage in the marketplace to affect the pricing for fabricated aluminum products, and technological advancements or other developments by or affecting alcoas competitors or customers could affect alcoas results of operations. in addition, alcoas competitive position depends, in part, on the companys ability to leverage its innovation expertise across its businesses and key end markets and, in the case of its upstream businesses, having access to an economical power supply to sustain its operations in various countries.
a downgrade of alcoas credit ratings could limit alcoas ability to obtain future financing, increase its borrowing costs, increase the pricing of its credit facilities, adversely affect the market price of its securities, trigger letter of credit or other collateral postings, or otherwise impair its business, financial condition, and results of operations.
standard and poors ratings services currently rates alcoas long-term debt bbb-, the lowest level of investment grade rating, with a stable ratings outlook (ratings and outlook were affirmed on march 9, 2015). on september 28, 2015, s&p issued a statement that these ratings and outlook for alcoa were not affected by alcoas plan to separate into two publicly-traded companies. on may 29, 2013, moodys investors service downgraded alcoas long-term debt rating from baa3 to ba1, which is below investment grade, and changed the outlook from rating under review to stable. on april 30, 2015, moodys changed the outlook from stable to positive. on september 28, 2015, moodys affirmed these ratings and changed the current outlook from positive to developing based on alcoas plan to separate into two publicly-traded companies. on january 21, 2016, moodys placed alcoas long-term debt rating under review and changed the current outlook from developing to rating under review, while leaving alcoas short-term debt rating unchanged. on april 11, 2014, fitch ratings downgraded alcoas rating from bbb- to bb+, a below investment grade rating, and changed the outlook from negative to stable. on april 16, 2015, fitch ratings affirmed alcoas rating of
bb+ but revised alcoas outlook to positive. on september 30, 2015, fitch placed these ratings on ratings watch positive based on alcoas plan to separate into two publicly-traded companies.
there can be no assurance that one or more of these or other rating agencies will not take negative actions with respect to alcoas ratings. increased debt levels, adverse aluminum market or macroeconomic conditions, a deterioration in the companys debt protection metrics, a contraction in the companys liquidity, or other factors could potentially trigger such actions. a rating agency may lower, suspend or withdraw entirely a rating or place it on negative outlook or watch if, in that rating agencys judgment, circumstances so warrant.
a downgrade of alcoas credit ratings by one or more rating agencies could adversely impact the market price of alcoas securities; adversely affect existing financing (for example, a downgrade by standard and poors or a further downgrade by moodys would subject alcoa to higher costs under alcoas five-year revolving credit agreement and certain of its other revolving credit facilities); limit access to the capital (including commercial paper) or credit markets or otherwise adversely affect the availability of other new financing on favorable terms, if at all; result in more restrictive covenants in agreements governing the terms of any future indebtedness that the company incurs; increase the cost of borrowing or fees on undrawn credit facilities; result in vendors or counterparties seeking collateral or letters of credit from alcoa; or otherwise impair alcoas business, financial condition and results of operations.
cyber attacks and security breaches may threaten the integrity of alcoas intellectual property and other sensitive information, disrupt its business operations, and result in reputational harm and other negative consequences that could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition and results of operations.
alcoa faces global cybersecurity threats, which may range from uncoordinated individual attempts to sophisticated and targeted measures, known as advanced persistent threats, directed at the company. cyber attacks and security breaches may include, but are not limited to, attempts to access information, computer viruses, denial of service and other electronic security breaches.
the company believes that it faces a heightened threat of cyber attacks due to the industries it serves, the locations of its operations and its technological innovations. the company has experienced cybersecurity attacks in the past, including breaches of its information technology systems in which information was taken, and may experience them in the future, potentially with more frequency or sophistication. based on information known to date, past attacks have not had a material impact on alcoas financial condition or results of operations. however, due to the evolving nature of cybersecurity threats, the scope and impact of any future incident cannot be predicted. while the company continually works to safeguard its systems and mitigate potential risks, there is no assurance that such actions will be sufficient to prevent cyber attacks or security breaches that manipulate or improperly use its systems or networks, compromise confidential or otherwise protected information, destroy or corrupt data, or otherwise disrupt its operations. the occurrence of such events could negatively impact alcoas reputation and its competitive position and could result in litigation with third parties, regulatory action, loss of business, potential liability and increased remediation costs, any of which could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition and results of operations. in addition, such attacks or breaches could require significant management attention and resources, and result in the diminution of the value of the companys investment in research and development.
alcoa participates in joint ventures and has formed strategic alliances and may enter into other similar arrangements in the future. for example, in december 2009, alcoa formed a joint venture with maaden, the saudi arabian mining company, to develop a fully integrated aluminum complex (including a bauxite mine, alumina refinery, aluminum smelter and rolling mill) in the kingdom of saudi arabia. although the company has, in connection with the saudi arabia joint venture and its other existing joint ventures and strategic alliances, sought to protect its interests, joint ventures and strategic alliances inherently involve special risks. whether or not alcoa holds majority interests or maintains operational control in such arrangements, its partners may:
   have economic or business interests or goals that are inconsistent with or opposed to those of the company;
   exercise veto rights so as to block actions that alcoa believes to be in its or the joint ventures or strategic alliances best interests;
   take action contrary to alcoas policies or objectives with respect to its investments; or
   as a result of financial or other difficulties, be unable or unwilling to fulfill their obligations under the joint venture, strategic alliance or other agreements, such as contributing capital to expansion or maintenance projects.
there can be no assurance that alcoas joint ventures or strategic alliances will be beneficial to alcoa, whether due to the above-described risks, unfavorable global economic conditions, increases in construction costs, currency fluctuations, political risks, or other factors.
alcoas business and growth prospects may be negatively impacted by limits in its capital expenditures.
alcoa requires substantial capital to invest in growth opportunities and to maintain and prolong the life and capacity of its existing facilities. for 2016, generating positive cash flow from operations that will exceed capital expenditures continues to be an alcoa target. insufficient cash generation or capital project overruns may negatively impact alcoas ability to fund as planned its sustaining and return-seeking capital projects. over the long term, alcoas ability to take advantage of improved aluminum or other market conditions or growth opportunities in its midstream and downstream businesses may be constrained by earlier capital expenditure restrictions, which could adversely affect the long-term value of its business and the companys position in relation to its competitors.
alcoa may also need to address commercial and political issues in relation to its reductions in capital expenditures in certain of the jurisdictions in which it operates. if alcoas interest in its joint ventures is diluted or it loses key concessions, its growth could be constrained. any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on the companys business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.
alcoas global operations expose the company to risks that could adversely affect alcoas business, financial condition, operating results or cash flows.
alcoa has operations or activities in numerous countries and regions outside the united states, including brazil, china, europe, guinea, russia, and the kingdom of saudi arabia. the companys global operations are subject to a number of risks, including:
            economic and commercial instability risks, including those caused by sovereign and private debt default, corruption, and changes in local government laws, regulations and policies, such as those related to tariffs and trade barriers, taxation, exchange controls, employment regulations and repatriation of earnings;
   geopolitical risks such as political instability, civil unrest, expropriation, nationalization of properties by a government, imposition of sanctions, renegotiation or nullification of existing agreements, mining leases and permits;
   war or terrorist activities;
   unexpected events, including fires or explosions at facilities, and natural disasters.
while the impact of any of the foregoing factors is difficult to predict, any one or more of them could adversely affect alcoas business, financial condition, operating results or cash flows. existing insurance arrangements may not provide protection for the costs that may arise from such events.
an adverse decline in the liability discount rate, lower-than-expected investment return on pension assets and other factors could affect alcoas results of operations or amount of pension funding contributions in future periods.
alcoas results of operations may be negatively affected by the amount of expense alcoa records for its pension and other postretirement benefit plans, reductions in the fair value of plan assets and other factors. u.s. generally accepted accounting principles (gaap) require that alcoa calculate income or expense for the plans using actuarial valuations.
these valuations reflect assumptions about financial market and other economic conditions, which may change based on changes in key economic indicators. the most significant year-end assumptions used by alcoa to estimate pension or other postretirement benefit income or expense for the following year are the discount rate applied to plan liabilities and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. in addition, alcoa is required to make an annual measurement of plan assets and liabilities, which may result in a significant charge to shareholders equity. for a discussion regarding how alcoas financial statements can be affected by pension and other postretirement benefits accounting policies, see critical accounting policies and estimatespension and other postretirement benefits in part ii, item 7. (managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations) and note w to the consolidated financial statementspension and other postretirement benefits in part ii, item 8. (financial statements and supplementary data). although gaap expense and pension funding contributions are impacted by different regulations and requirements, the key economic factors that affect gaap expense would also likely affect the amount of cash or securities alcoa would contribute to the pension plans.
potential pension contributions include both mandatory amounts required under federal law and discretionary contributions to improve the plans funded status. the moving ahead for progress in the 21st century act (map-21), enacted in 2012, provided temporary relief for employers like alcoa who sponsor defined benefit pension plans related to funding contributions under the employee retirement income security act of 1974 by allowing the use of a 25-year average discount rate within an upper and lower range for purposes of determining minimum funding obligations. in 2014, the highway and transportation funding act (hatfa) was signed into law. hatfa extended the relief provided by map-21 and modified the interest rates that had been set by map-21. in 2015, the bipartisan budget act of 2015 (bba 2015) was signed into law. bba 2015 extends the relief period provided by hafta. alcoa believes that the relief provided by bba 2015 will moderately reduce the cash flow sensitivity of the companys u.s. pension plans funded status to potential declines in discount rates over the next several years. however, higher than expected pension contributions due to a decline in the plans funded status as a result of declines in the discount rate or lower-than-expected investment returns on plan assets could have a material negative effect on the companys cash flows. adverse capital market conditions could result in reductions in the fair value of plan assets and increase the companys liabilities related to such plans, adversely affecting alcoas liquidity and results of operations.
unanticipated changes in our tax provisions or exposure to additional tax liabilities could affect alcoas future profitability.
alcoa is subject to income taxes in both the united states and various non-u.s. jurisdictions. its domestic and international tax liabilities are dependent upon the distribution of income among these different jurisdictions. changes in applicable domestic or foreign tax laws and regulations, or their interpretation and application, including the possibility of retroactive effect, could affect the companys tax expense and profitability. alcoas tax expense includes estimates of additional tax that may be incurred for tax exposures and reflects various estimates and assumptions. the assumptions include assessments of future earnings of the company that could impact the valuation of its deferred tax assets. the companys future results of operations could be adversely affected by changes in the effective tax rate as a result of a change in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the overall profitability of the company, changes in tax legislation and rates, changes in generally accepted accounting principles, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, the results of tax audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns or related litigation and continuing assessments of its tax exposures. corporate tax reform and tax law changes continue to be analyzed in the united states and in many other jurisdictions. significant changes to the u.s. corporate tax system in particular could have a substantial impact, positive or negative, on alcoas effective tax rate, cash tax expenditures, and deferred tax assets and liabilities.
a significant portion of alcoas employees are represented by labor unions in a number of countries under various collective bargaining agreements with varying durations and expiration dates. for more information, see employees in part i, item 1. (business) of this report. while alcoa was previously successful in renegotiating the master collective bargaining agreement with the united steelworkers (the most recent renegotiation having taken place in june 2014), alcoa may not be able to satisfactorily renegotiate that agreement or other collective bargaining agreements in the u.s. and other countries when they expire. in addition, existing collective bargaining agreements may not prevent a strike or work stoppage at alcoas facilities in the future. alcoa may also be subject to general country strikes or work stoppages unrelated to its business or collective bargaining agreements. any such work stoppages (or potential work stoppages) could have a material adverse effect on alcoas financial results.
alcoa could be adversely affected by changes in the business or financial condition of a significant customer or customers.
a significant downturn or deterioration in the business or financial condition of a key customer or customers supplied by alcoa could affect alcoas results of operations in a particular period. alcoas customers may experience delays in the launch of new products, labor strikes, diminished liquidity or credit unavailability, weak demand for their products, or other difficulties in their businesses. if alcoa is not successful in replacing business lost from such customers, profitability may be adversely affected.
alcoa may not be able to successfully develop and implement technology initiatives.
alcoa is working on new developments for a number of strategic projects in all business segments, including additive manufacturing, alloy development, engineered finishes and product design, high speed continuous casting and rolling technology, and other advanced manufacturing technologies. for more information on alcoas research and development programs, see research and development in part i, item 1. (business) of this report. there can be no assurance that such developments or technologies will be commercially feasible or beneficial to alcoa.
alcoas existing operations and development projects require highly skilled executives and staff with relevant industry and technical experience. the inability of the company or the industry to attract and retain such people may adversely impact alcoas ability to adequately meet project demands and fill roles in existing operations. skills shortages in engineering, technical service, construction and maintenance contractors and other labor market inadequacies may also impact activities. these shortages may adversely impact the cost and schedule of development projects and the cost and efficiency of existing operations.
alcoa may not realize expected benefits from its productivity and cost-reduction initiatives.
alcoa has undertaken, and may continue to undertake, productivity and cost-reduction initiatives to improve performance and conserve cash, including new procurement strategies for raw materials, such as backward integration and non-traditional sourcing from numerous geographies, deployment of company-wide business process models, such as alcoas degrees of implementation process in which ideas are executed in a disciplined manner to generate savings, and overhead cost reductions. there is no assurance that these initiatives will be successful or beneficial to alcoa or that estimated cost savings from such activities will be realized.
alcoas results of operations or liquidity in a particular period could be affected by new or increasingly stringent laws, regulatory requirements or interpretations, or outcomes of significant legal proceedings or investigations adverse to
alcoa. the company may experience a change in effective tax rates or become subject to unexpected or rising costs associated with business operations or provision of health or welfare benefits to employees due to changes in laws, regulations or policies. the company is also subject to a variety of legal compliance risks. these risks include, among other things, potential claims relating to product liability, health and safety, environmental matters, intellectual property rights, government contracts, taxes, and compliance with u.s. and foreign export laws, anti-bribery laws, competition laws and sales and trading practices. alcoa could be subject to fines, penalties, damages (in certain cases, treble damages), or suspension or debarment from government contracts.
while alcoa believes it has adopted appropriate risk management and compliance programs to address and reduce these risks, the global and diverse nature of its operations means that these risks will continue to exist, and additional legal proceedings and contingencies may arise from time to time. in addition, various factors or developments can lead the company to change current estimates of liabilities or make such estimates for matters previously not susceptible of reasonable estimates, such as a significant judicial ruling or judgment, a significant settlement, significant regulatory developments or changes in applicable law. a future adverse ruling or settlement or unfavorable changes in laws, regulations or policies, or other contingencies that the company cannot predict with certainty could have a material adverse effect on the companys results of operations or cash flows in a particular period. for additional information regarding the legal proceedings involving the company, see the discussion in part i, item 3. (legal proceedings) of this report and in note n to the consolidated financial statements in part ii, item 8. (financial statements and supplementary data).
alcoa is subject to a broad range of health, safety and environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which it operates and may be exposed to substantial costs and liabilities associated with such laws and regulations.
alcoas operations worldwide are subject to numerous complex and increasingly stringent health, safety and environmental laws and regulations. the costs of complying with such laws and regulations, including participation in assessments and cleanups of sites, as well as internal voluntary programs, are significant and will continue to be so for the foreseeable future. environmental laws may impose cleanup liability on owners and occupiers of contaminated property, including past or divested properties, regardless of whether the owners and occupiers caused the contamination or whether the activity that caused the contamination was lawful at the time it was conducted. environmental matters for which alcoa may be liable may arise in the future at its present sites, where no problem is currently known, at previously owned sites, sites previously operated by the company, sites owned by its predecessors or sites that it may acquire in the future. compliance with environmental, health and safety legislation and regulatory requirements may prove to be more limiting and costly than the company anticipates. alcoas results of operations or liquidity in a particular period could be affected by certain health, safety or environmental matters, including remediation costs and damages related to certain sites. additionally, evolving regulatory standards and expectations can result in increased litigation and/or increased costs, all of which can have a material and adverse effect on earnings and cash flows.
energy is a significant input in a number of alcoas operations. there is growing recognition that consumption of energy derived from fossil fuels is a contributor to global warming.
a number of governments or governmental bodies have introduced or are contemplating legislative and regulatory change in response to the potential impacts of climate change. there is also current and emerging regulation, such as the mandatory renewable energy target in australia, québecs transition to a cap and trade system with compliance required beginning 2013, the european union emissions trading scheme and the united states clean power plan, which became effective on december 22, 2015. alcoa will likely see changes in the margins of greenhouse gas-intensive assets and energy-intensive assets as a result of regulatory impacts in the countries in which the company operates. these regulatory mechanisms may be either voluntary or legislated and may impact alcoas operations
directly or indirectly through customers or alcoas supply chain. inconsistency of regulations may also change the attractiveness of the locations of some of the companys assets. assessments of the potential impact of future climate change legislation, regulation and international treaties and accords are uncertain, given the wide scope of potential regulatory change in countries in which alcoa operates. the company may realize increased capital expenditures resulting from required compliance with revised or new legislation or regulations, costs to purchase or profits from sales of, allowances or credits under a cap and trade system, increased insurance premiums and deductibles as new actuarial tables are developed to reshape coverage, a change in competitive position relative to industry peers and changes to profit or loss arising from increased or decreased demand for goods produced by the company and indirectly, from changes in costs of goods sold.
the potential physical impacts of climate change on the companys operations are highly uncertain, and will be particular to the geographic circumstances. these may include changes in rainfall patterns, shortages of water or other natural resources, changing sea levels, changing storm patterns and intensities, and changing temperature levels. these effects may adversely impact the cost, production and financial performance of alcoas operations.
alcoas plan to separate into two independent publicly-traded companies is subject to various risks and uncertainties and may not be completed in accordance with the expected plans or anticipated timeline, or at all, and will involve significant time and expense, which could disrupt or adversely affect alcoas business.
on september 28, 2015, alcoa announced plans to separate into two independent publicly-traded companies: a value-add company comprising the global rolled products, engineered products and solutions, and transportation and construction solutions segments, and an upstream company comprising the alumina and primary metals segments. the separation, which is currently targeted to be completed in the second half of 2016, is subject to approval by alcoas board of directors of the final terms of the separation and market, regulatory and certain other conditions. unanticipated developments, including, among others, failure of the separation to qualify for the expected tax treatment, the possibility that any third-party consents required in connection with the separation will not be received, material adverse changes in aluminum industry conditions and changes in global economic and financial market conditions generally, could delay or prevent the completion of the proposed separation, or cause the proposed separation to occur on terms or conditions that are different or less favorable than expected.
alcoa expects that the process of completing the proposed separation will be time-consuming and involve significant costs and expenses, which may be significantly higher than what it currently anticipates and may not yield a benefit if the separation is not completed. executing the proposed separation will require significant time and attention from alcoas senior management and employees, which could disrupt the companys ongoing business and adversely affect the financial results and results of operations. alcoa may also experience increased difficulties in attracting, retaining and motivating employees during the pendency of the separation and following its completion, which could harm the companys businesses.
the separation may not achieve some or all of the anticipated benefits.
alcoa may not realize some or all of the anticipated strategic, financial, operational or other benefits from the separation. as independent publicly-traded companies, the value-add and upstream companies will be smaller, less diversified companies with a narrower business focus and may be more vulnerable to changing market conditions, such as changes in aluminum industry conditions, which could result in increased volatility in their cash flows, working capital and financing requirements and could materially and adversely affect the respective business, financial condition and results of operations. further, there can be no assurance that the combined value of the common stock of the two publicly-traded companies will be equal to or greater than what the value of alcoas common stock would have been had the proposed separation not occurred.
the proposed separation may result in disruptions to, and negatively impact alcoas relationships with, the companys suppliers, customers and other business partners.
uncertainty related to the proposed separation may lead suppliers, customers and other parties with which alcoa currently does business or may do business in the future to terminate or attempt to negotiate changes in existing
business relationships, or to consider entering into business relationships with parties other than alcoa. these disruptions could have a material and adverse effect on alcoas businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects, or the businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects of the independent companies resulting from the separation. the effect of such disruptions could be exacerbated by any delays in the completion of the separation.
item 7.   managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.
overview our business alcoa is a global leader in lightweight metals engineering and manufacturing. alcoas innovative, multi-material products, which include aluminum, titanium, and nickel, are used worldwide in aerospace, automotive, commercial transportation, packaging, building and construction, oil and gas, defense, consumer electronics, and industrial applications.
alcoa is also the world leader in the production and management of primary aluminum, fabricated aluminum, and alumina combined, through its active participation in all major aspects of the industry: technology, mining, refining, smelting, fabricating, and recycling. aluminum is a commodity that is traded on the london metal exchange (lme) and priced daily. sales of primary aluminum and alumina represent approximately 40% of alcoas revenues. the price of aluminum influences the operating results of alcoa.
alcoa is a global company operating in 30 countries. based upon the country where the point of sale occurred, the united states and europe generated 55% and 26%, respectively, of alcoas sales in 2015. in addition, alcoa has investments and operating activities in, among others, australia, brazil, china, guinea, iceland, russia, and saudi arabia. governmental policies, laws and regulations, and other economic factors, including inflation and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, affect the results of operations in these countries.
management review of 2015 and outlook for the future in 2015, growth in global aluminum demand reached 6%, which was slightly less than managements projection (7%) at the end of 2014. however, significant market headwinds negatively impacted the smelting portion of alcoas upstream operations as the average lme price (on 15-day lag) of aluminum declined 10% and regional premiums decreased substantially (39% in the united states and canada and 44% in europe) compared to 2014. the refining portion of the upstream operations continued to make progress in shifting customer pricing away from the lme aluminum price to a mixture of alumina index/spot pricing; however, this was overshadowed by a decrease in the average alumina index/spot price. conversely, alcoas upstream operations realized the benefit of a stronger u.s. dollar in 2015 compared to 2014. in the midstream operations, after-tax operating income was stable in 2015 from 2014 despite generating $1,052 less revenue due to the closure and divestiture of six rolling mills, while the downstream operations received the benefit of $1,310 in combined revenue combined from three acquisitions. across all operations, cost headwinds continued to be a challenge; however, management was able to more than offset these with net productivity improvements.
separate from the 2015 operational results, management initiated a number of portfolio actions during the year. in the upstream operations, following similar actions taken in both 2014 and 2013, smelting capacity of 217 kmt was curtailed (another 230 kmt will be curtailed by the end of june 2016) and 96 kmt (all of which was previously curtailed) was permanently closed (another 269 kmt will be closed by the end of march 2016). additionally, refining capacity of 1,705 kmt was curtailed (another 1,635 kmt will be curtailed by the end of june 2016). management also completed the divestiture of another rolling mill (three rolling mills were previously divested in december 2014) in the midstream operations that was no longer part of the strategic direction of alcoa. from a growth perspective, alcoa completed the acquisition of two businesses, mostly aerospace-related, both of which will enhance the portfolio of alcoas downstream operations.
as a result of the previously mentioned capacity reductions, alcoas 2015 results were negatively impacted by significant restructuring charges related to these actions. additionally, developments in legal matters in italy, an assessment of the realizability of certain deferred tax assets, and an impairment of goodwill caused unfavorable impacts in alcoas 2015 results.
management continued its focus on liquidity and cash flows, generating incremental improvements in procurement efficiencies, overhead rationalization, and disciplined capital spending. this focus and the related results enabled alcoa to end 2015 with a solid financial position, consistent with the end of 2014.
   capital expenditures of $1,180, under $1,500 for the sixth consecutive year;
                        total debt of $9,103, net margin of $1,968, and depreciation, depletion, and amortization of $1,280 (net margin is equivalent to sales minus the following items: cost of goods sold; selling, general administrative, and other expenses; research and development expenses; and provision for depreciation, depletion, and amortization).
in 2016, management is projecting continued growth (increase of 6%) in the global consumption of primary aluminum, a slight change from that of the last four years, led by china at an estimated 8%. all other regions in the world, except for brazil and russia (both are projected to be flat with 2015), are expected to have positive growth in aluminum demand over 2015, including north america at an estimated 5%. after considering forecasted added production, along with expected industry-wide capacity reductions, both of which are mainly driven by china, management anticipates a deficit in the aluminum market. for alumina, growth in global consumption is estimated to be 6%, and demand is expected to slightly exceed supply due to capacity reductions in china, as well as other parts of the world.
management also anticipates improved market conditions for value-add products in the aerospace, building and construction, packaging, automotive, and industrial gas turbine global end markets, despite declines in certain regions, while the commercial transportation global end market is expected to decrease. many of the conditions that drove these markets in 2015 will continue throughout 2016.
aerospace is expected to be driven by large commercial aircraft due to a greater than nine-year order backlog. for building and construction, awarded nonresidential contracts are projected to be up once again in north america while a slight decline in europe is expected. in packaging, growth in china and europe, mainly driven by the penetration of aluminum in the growing beer segment and the conversion from steel cans to aluminum cans, respectively, is expected to more than offset a slight decrease in north america. for automotive, growth is anticipated in the united states (due to the replacement of older vehicles, low borrowing rates, and the decline in gasoline prices) and china (due to evolving emissions policies based on new clean air legislation enacted in 2014 and a continued increase in the percentage of the population driving automobiles), as well as europe. industrial gas turbines are expected to see growth as a result of new demand for high technology turbines and upgrades of existing turbines. in commercial transportation, improving conditions in both europe and china are expected to be more than offset by weakness in north america, due to high inventory levels as a result of one of the highest production years ever in 2015 and projected lower orders.
looking ahead over the next year, management will continue to focus on lowering alcoas refining and smelting operations on the respective global cost curves to the 21st and 38th percentiles, respectively. at december 31, 2015, alcoas refining operations were at the 23rd percentile, a two-percentage point improvement from 2014, and its smelting operations remained at the 43rd percentile on the respective global cost curves. actions taken to improve alcoas position on the global alumina cost curve included, in late 2014, the sale of an ownership interest in a mining and refining joint venture in jamaica and the conversion of the fuel source from fuel oil to natural gas at a refinery in spain, and, in 2015, the curtailment of 1,330 kmt of high-cost capacity in suriname. actions taken in the smelting operations included, in late 2014, the sale of an ownership interest in a smelter in the united states and the renewal of a power contract at each of the three smelters in canada, and, in 2015, the curtailment and closure of 170 kmt combined of high-cost capacity in brazil. also, both the refining and smelting operations benefitted from productivity improvements, new initiatives as well as the full realization of those implemented in 2014. while the benefits of the actions in the refining operations can be seen in alcoas improved position on the global alumina cost curve at the end of 2015, the benefits from the actions in the smelting operations were offset by a downward shift in the global aluminum cost curve, primarily due to the strong u.s. dollar and curtailments/closures of capacity from other smelting industry participants.
other actions taken in 2015 to help drive a lower position on the respective global cost curves include additional curtailments and/or closures of 2,100 kmt of refining capacity and 499 kmt of smelting capacity, all within the united states. the initiation of these actions occurred late in 2015 and will be completed during the first half of 2016; therefore, management expects to realize the benefits of curtailing/closing this high-cost capacity during 2016. additionally, alcoa has initiatives to drive further productivity improvements during 2016, including from procurement and overhead programs. furthermore, the smelter and the refinery at the joint venture in saudi arabia are expected to provide a two-percentage point reduction on each of the respective global cost curves by the end of 2016 (from 2013).
management will also continue to focus on revenue growth for both the midstream and downstream operations, which is expected from multiple sources. the midstream operations anticipate positive contributions from both the davenport, ia rolling mill facility and tennessee rolling mill facility (expansion completed in september 2015), both of which serve the growing demand for aluminum sheet in the u.s. automotive and market as a result of changing emission regulations. likewise, the downstream operations expect favorable results from projects completed in late 2014 and throughout 2015 to meet growing demand in both the aerospace and commercial transportation end markets. these projects include an expansion of aluminum lithium capabilities in lafayette, in, expansions in laporte, in and hampton, va to provide nickel-based super alloy structural components and airfoil blades for jet engines, and an expansion at a facility in hungary to double production of aluminum wheels. additionally, the downstream operations completed three acquisitions (mostly aerospace-related) in november 2014 through july 2015 (see engineered products and solutions in segment information under results of operations below) that will incrementally increase revenue. furthermore, in 2014 and 2015, alcoa entered into a number of multi-year supply agreements related to the aerospace end market valued at approximately $13,500, including six contracts valued at more than $6,700 combined with four major customers in the aerospace end market. under one of these six contracts, the midstream operations will supply aluminum sheet and plate, and under the other five contracts, the downstream operations will supply jet engine components (including aluminum and aluminum-lithium fan blades), multi-material fastening systems, titanium plate and billet, and titanium seat track assemblies.
in addition to focusing on the above-mentioned operational improvements, management has committed to executing the following transaction. on september 28, 2015, alcoa announced that its board of directors approved a plan to separate into two independent, publicly-traded companies. one company will comprise the alumina and primary metals segments and the other company will comprise the global rolled products, engineered products and solutions, and transportation and construction solutions segments. alcoa is targeting to complete the separation in the second half of 2016. the transaction is subject to a number of conditions, including, but not limited to, final approval by alcoas board of directors, receipt of a favorable opinion of legal counsel with respect to the tax-free nature of the transaction for u.s. federal income tax purposes, and the effectiveness of a form 10 registration statement to be filed with the u.s. securities and exchange commission. upon completion of the separation, alcoa shareholders will own all of the outstanding shares of both companies. alcoa may, at any time and for any reason until the proposed transaction is complete, abandon the separation plan or modify or change its terms.
results of operations earnings summary net loss attributable to alcoa for 2015 was $322, or $0.31 per diluted share, compared with net income attributable to alcoa of $268, or $0.21 per share, in 2014. the decrease in results of $590 was mostly due to a lower average realized price for both aluminum and alumina, a charge for legal matters in italy, unfavorable price/product mix in the midstream and downstream operations, an unfavorable change in income taxes due to a higher amount of discrete income tax charges and nondeductible items, lower energy sales, and higher costs. these negative impacts were partially offset by net favorable foreign currency movements, net productivity improvements, higher volume in the midstream and downstream operations, and lower charges and expenses related to a number of portfolio actions (e.g., capacity reductions, divestitures, acquisitions).
net income attributable to alcoa for 2014 was $268, or $0.21 per share, compared with net loss attributable to alcoa of $2,285, or $2.14 per share, in 2013. the improvement in results of $2,553 was primarily due to the absence of all of the following: an impairment of goodwill, a discrete income tax charge for valuation allowances on certain deferred tax assets, and charges for the resolution of a legal matter. other significant changes in results included the following: higher energy sales, a higher average realized price for primary aluminum, net productivity improvements, and net favorable foreign currency movements. these other changes were mostly offset by higher charges and expenses related to a number of portfolio actions (e.g., capacity reductions, divestitures, acquisitions), higher overall input costs, and an unfavorable change in income taxes due to higher operating results.
salessales for 2015 were $22,534 compared with sales of $23,906 in 2014, a decline of $1,372, or 6%. the decrease was primarily due to the absence of sales related to capacity that was closed, sold or curtailed in the midstream and upstream operations (see global rolled products and primary metals in segment information below), a lower average realized price for aluminum in both the upstream and midstream operations and for alumina in the upstream operations, unfavorable foreign currency movements in the midstream and downstream operations, and lower energy sales (both as a result of lower pricing and unfavorable foreign currency movements). these negative impacts were partially offset by the addition of sales from three recently acquired businesses (see engineered products and solutions in segment information below), higher volume across all segments, favorable product mix in the midstream operations, and higher buy/resell activity for primary aluminum.
sales for 2014 were $23,906 compared with sales of $23,032 in 2013, an improvement of $874, or 4%. the increase was mainly the result of higher volumes in the midstream, downstream, and alumina portion of the upstream operations, higher energy sales resulting from excess power due to curtailed smelter capacity, increased buy/resell activity for primary aluminum, and a higher average realized price for primary aluminum. these positive impacts were partially offset by lower primary aluminum volumes, including those related to curtailed and shutdown smelter capacity, and unfavorable price/product mix in the midstream operations.
cost of goods soldcogs as a percentage of sales was 80.2% in 2015 compared with 80.1% in 2014. the percentage was negatively impacted by a lower average realized price for both aluminum and alumina in the upstream operations, unfavorable price/product mix in the midstream and downstream operations, lower energy sales, and higher costs. these negative impacts were mostly offset by net favorable foreign currency movements due to a stronger u.s. dollar, net productivity improvements across all segments, higher volume in the midstream and downstream operations, a favorable lifo (last in, first out) adjustment due to lower prices for aluminum and alumina ($208), lower inventory write-downs related to the decisions to permanently shut down and/or curtail capacity in the upstream and midstream operations (difference of $23see restructuring and other charges below), and the absence of costs related to a new labor agreement that covers employees at 10 locations in the united states (see below).
cogs as a percentage of sales was 80.1% in 2014 compared with 83.7% in 2013. the percentage was positively impacted by net productivity improvements across all segments, both the previously mentioned higher energy sales and higher average realized price for primary aluminum, net favorable foreign currency movements due to a stronger u.s. dollar, lower costs for caustic and carbon, and the absence of costs related to a planned maintenance outage in 2013 at a power plant in australia. these positive impacts were partially offset by higher costs for bauxite, energy, and labor, higher inventory write-downs related to the decisions to permanently shut down certain smelter and rolling mill capacity (difference of $58see restructuring and other charges below), and costs related to a new labor agreement that covers employees at 10 locations in the united states (see below).
on june 6, 2014, the united steelworkers ratified a new five-year labor agreement covering approximately 6,100 employees at 10 u.s. locations; the previous labor agreement expired on may 15, 2014. in 2014, as a result of the preparation for and ratification of the new agreement, alcoa recognized $18 ($12 after-tax) in cogs for, among other items, business contingency costs and a one-time signing bonus for employees. additionally, as a result of the provisions of the new labor agreement, a significant plan amendment was adopted by one of alcoas u.s. pension plans. accordingly, this plan was required to be remeasured, which resulted in a $13 decrease to 2014 net periodic benefit cost.
selling, general administrative, and other expensessg&a expenses were $979, or 4.3% of sales, in 2015 compared with $995, or 4.2% of sales, in 2014. the decrease of $16 was principally the result of favorable foreign currency movements due to a stronger u.s. dollar, the absence of sg&a related to closed and sold locations, and lower acquisition costs ($15), partially offset by expenses for professional and consulting services related to the planned separation of alcoa ($24see management review of 2015 and outlook for the future above) and new sg&a related to inorganic growth in the engineered products and solutions segment.
sg&a expenses were $995, or 4.2% of sales, in 2014 compared with $1,008, or 4.4% of sales, in 2013. the decline of $13 was due to decreases in various expenses, including legal and consulting fees and contract services, mostly offset by costs associated with the acquisition of firth rixson ($42see engineered products and solutions in segment information below) and higher stock-based compensation expense.
research and development expensesr&d expenses were $238 in 2015 compared with $218 in 2014 and $192 in 2013. the increase in 2015 as compared to 2014 was mainly driven by additional spending related to the upgrade of a micromill in san antonio, tx, which was completed during 2015 and began production of automotive sheet on a limited basis, for the global rolled products segment and additive manufacturing for 3-d printing, partially offset by lower spending related to inert anode and carbothermic technology for the primary metals segment. the increase in 2014 as compared to 2013 was primarily caused by spending related to an upgrade of a micromill in san antonio, tx for the global rolled products segment and additional spending related to inert anode and carbothermic technology for the primary metals segment.
provision for depreciation, depletion, and amortizationthe provision for dd&a was $1,280 in 2015 compared with $1,371 in 2014. the decrease of $91, or 7%, was mostly due to favorable foreign currency movements due to a stronger u.s. dollar, particularly against the australian dollar and brazilian real, and the absence of dd&a ($71) related to the divestiture and/or permanent closure of five smelters, six rolling mills, one refinery, and one rod mill (see alumina, primary metals, and global rolled products in segment information below), all of which occurred from march 2014 through june 2015. these positive impacts were partially offset by new dd&a ($93) associated with three acquisitions that occurred from november 2014 through july 2015 (see engineered products and solutions in segment information below).
the provision for dd&a was $1,371 in 2014 compared with $1,421 in 2013. the decrease of $50, or 4%, was principally the result of favorable foreign currency movements due to a stronger u.s. dollar, particularly against the australian dollar and brazilian real, and a reduction in expense related to the permanent shutdown of smelter capacity in australia, canada, the united states, and italy that occurred at different points during both 2013 and 2014 (see primary metals in segment information below). these items were somewhat offset by new dd&a associated with both the acquisition of firth rixson in november 2014 (see engineered products and solutions in segment information below) and assets placed into service in january 2014 related to the completed automotive expansion at the davenport, ia plant.
impairment of goodwillin 2015 and 2013, alcoa recognized an impairment of goodwill in the amount of $25 and $1,731 ($1,719 after noncontrolling interest), respectively, related to the annual impairment review of the soft alloy extrusion business in brazil and the primary metals segment, respectively, (see goodwill in critical accounting policies and estimates below).
legal matters in italy                                                   201                   -                 -
net loss on divestitures of businesses                                   161                 332                 -
reversals of previously recorded layoff and other exit costs             (14   )             (28   )            (8   )
layoff costs were recorded based on approved detailed action plans submitted by the operating locations that specified positions to be eliminated, benefits to be paid under existing severance plans, union contracts or statutory requirements, and the expected timetable for completion of the plans.
2015 actions. in 2015, alcoa recorded restructuring and other charges of $1,195 ($836 after-tax and noncontrolling interest), which were comprised of the following components: $438 ($281 after-tax and noncontrolling interest) for exit costs related to decisions to permanently shut down and demolish three smelters and a power station (see below); $246 ($118 after-tax and noncontrolling interest) for the curtailment of two refineries and two smelters (see below); $201 (pre- and after-tax) related to legal matters in italy; a $161 ($151 after-tax and noncontrolling interest) net loss related to the march 2015 divestiture of a rolling mill in russia (see global rolled products in segment information below) and post-closing adjustments associated with three december 2014 divestitures; $143 ($102 after-tax and noncontrolling interest) for layoff costs, including the separation of approximately 2,100 employees (425 in the transportation and construction solutions segment, 645 in the engineered products and solutions segment, 380 in the primary metals segment, 90 in the global rolled products segment, 85 in the alumina segment, and 475 in corporate); $34 ($14 after-tax and noncontrolling interest) for asset impairments, virtually all of which was related to prior capitalized costs for an expansion project at a refinery in australia that is no longer being pursued; an $18 ($13 after-tax) gain on the sale of land related to one of the rolling mills in australia that was permanently closed in december 2014 (see 2014 actions below); a net charge of $4 (a net credit of $7 after-tax and noncontrolling interest) for other miscellaneous items; and $14 ($11 after-tax and noncontrolling interest) for the reversal of a number of small layoff reserves related to prior periods.
during 2015, management initiated various alumina refining and aluminum smelting capacity curtailments and/or closures. the curtailments were composed of the remaining capacity at all of the following: the são luís smelter in brazil (74 kmt-per-year); the suriname refinery (1,330 kmt-per-year); the point comfort, tx refinery (2,010 kmt-per-year); and the wenatchee, wa smelter (143 kmt-per-year). all of the curtailments were completed in 2015 except for 1,635 kmt-per-year at the point comfort refinery, which is expected to be completed by the end of june 2016. the permanent closures were composed of the capacity at the warrick, in smelter (269 kmt-per-year) (includes the closure of a related coal mine) and the infrastructure of the massena east, ny smelter (potlines were previously shut down in both 2013 and 2014see 2013 actions and 2014 actions below), as the modernization of this smelter is no longer being pursued. the shutdown of the warrick smelter is expected to be completed by the end of march 2016.
the decisions on the above actions were part of a separate 12-month review in refining (2,800 kmt-per-year) and smelting (500 kmt-per-year) capacity initiated by management in march 2015 for possible curtailment (partial or full), permanent closure or divestiture. while many factors contributed to each decision, in general, these actions were initiated to maintain competitiveness amid prevailing market conditions for both alumina and aluminum. demolition and remediation activities related to the warrick smelter and the massena east location will begin in 2016 and are expected to be completed by the end of 2020.
separate from the actions initiated under the reviews described above, in mid-2015, management approved the permanent shutdown and demolition of the poços de caldas smelter (capacity of 96 kmt-per-year) in brazil and the
anglesea power station (includes the closure of a related coal mine) in australia. the entire capacity at poços de caldas had been temporarily idled since may 2014 and the anglesea power station was shut down at the end of august 2015. demolition and remediation activities related to the poços de caldas smelter and the anglesea power station began in late 2015 and are expected to be completed by the end of 2026 and 2020, respectively.
the decision on the poços de caldas smelter was due to managements conclusion that the smelter was no longer competitive as a result of challenging global market conditions for primary aluminum, which led to the initial curtailment, that have not dissipated and higher costs. for the anglesea power station, the decision was made because a sale process did not result in a sale and there would have been imminent operating costs and financial constraints related to this site in the remainder of 2015 and beyond, including significant costs to source coal from available resources, necessary maintenance costs, and a depressed outlook for forward electricity prices. the anglesea power station previously supplied approximately 40 percent of the power needs for the point henry smelter, which was closed in august 2014 (see 2014 actions below).
in 2015, costs related to the shutdown and curtailment actions included asset impairments of $217, representing the write-off of the remaining book value of all related properties, plants, and equipment; $156 for the layoff of approximately 3,100 employees (1,800 in the primary metals segment and 1,300 in the alumina segment), including $30 in pension costs; accelerated depreciation of $84 related to certain facilities as they continued to operate during 2015; and $227 in other exit costs. additionally in 2015, remaining inventories, mostly operating supplies and raw materials, were written down to their net realizable value, resulting in a charge of $90 ($43 after-tax and noncontrolling interest), which was recorded in cogs. the other exit costs of $227 represent $76 in asset retirement obligations and $86 in environmental remediation, both of which were triggered by the decisions to permanently shut down and demolish the aforementioned structures in the united states, brazil, and australia (includes the rehabilitation of a related coal mine in each of australia and the united states), and $65 in supplier and customer contract-related costs.
2014 actions. in 2014, alcoa recorded restructuring and other charges of $1,168 ($703 after-tax and noncontrolling interest), which were comprised of the following components: $693 ($443 after-tax and noncontrolling interest) for exit costs related to decisions to permanently shut down and demolish three smelters and two rolling mills (see below); a $332 ($163 after-tax and noncontrolling interest) net loss for the divestitures of four operations (see alumina, primary metals, and global rolled products in segment information below); $68 ($45 after-tax and noncontrolling interest) for the temporary curtailment of two smelters and a related production slowdown at one refinery (see below); $51 ($36 after-tax and noncontrolling interest) for layoff costs, including the separation of approximately 1,120 employees (470 in the engineered products and solutions segment, 360 in the transportation and construction solutions segment, 45 in the global rolled products segment, 60 in the alumina and primary metals segments combined, and 185 in corporate); $34 ($26 after-tax) for asset impairments related to prior capitalized costs for a modernization project at a smelter in canada that is no longer being pursued; a net charge of $18 ($11 after-tax and noncontrolling interest) for other miscellaneous items, including $2 ($2 after-tax) for asset impairments and accelerated depreciation; and $28 ($21 after-tax and noncontrolling interest) for the reversal of a number of layoff reserves related to prior periods, including those associated with a smelter in italy due to changes in facts and circumstances (see below).
in early 2014, management approved the permanent shutdown and demolition of the remaining capacity (84 kmt-per-year) at the massena east, ny smelter and the full capacity (190 kmt-per-year) at the point henry smelter in australia. the capacity at massena east was fully shut down by the end of march 2014 and the point henry smelter was fully shut down in august 2014. demolition and remediation activities related to both the massena east and point henry smelters began in late 2014 and are expected to be completed by the end of 2020 and 2018, respectively.
the decisions on the massena east and point henry smelters were part of a 15-month review of 460 kmt of smelting capacity initiated by management in may 2013 (see 2013 actions below) for possible curtailment. through this review,
management determined that the remaining capacity of the massena east smelter was no longer competitive and the point henry smelter had no prospect of becoming financially viable. management also initiated the temporary curtailment of the remaining capacity (62 kmt-per-year) at the poços de caldas smelter and additional capacity (85 kmt-per-year) at the são luís smelter, both in brazil. these curtailments were completed by the end of may 2014. as a result of these curtailments, 200 kmt-per-year of production at the poços de caldas refinery was reduced by the end of june 2014.
also in early 2014, management approved the permanent shutdown of alcoas two rolling mills in australia, point henry and yennora. this decision was made due to the significant impact of excess can sheet capacity in both australia and asia. the two rolling mills had a combined can sheet capacity of 200 kmt-per-year and were closed by the end of 2014. demolition and remediation activities related to the two rolling mills began in mid-2015 and are expected to be completed by the end of 2018.
additionally, in august 2014, management approved the permanent shutdown and demolition of the capacity (150 kmt-per-year) at the portovesme smelter in italy, which had been idle since november 2012. this decision was made because the fundamental reasons that made the portovesme smelter uncompetitive remained unchanged, including the lack of a viable long-term power solution. demolition and remediation activities related to the portovesme smelter will begin in 2016 and are expected to be completed by the end of 2020 (delayed due to discussions with the italian government and other stakeholders).
in 2014, costs related to the shutdown and curtailment actions included $208 for the layoff of approximately 1,790 employees (1,210 in the primary metals segment, 470 in the global rolled products segment, 80 in the alumina segment, and 30 in corporate), including $26 in pension costs; accelerated depreciation of $204 related to the three facilities in australia as they continued to operate during 2014; asset impairments of $166 representing the write-off of the remaining book value of all related properties, plants, and equipment; and $183 in other exit costs. additionally in 2014, remaining inventories, mostly operating supplies and raw materials, were written down to their net realizable value, resulting in a charge of $67 ($47 after-tax and noncontrolling interest), which was recorded in cogs. the other exit costs of $183 represent $95 in asset retirement obligations and $42 in environmental remediation, both of which were triggered by the decisions to permanently shut down and demolish the aforementioned structures in australia, italy, and the united states, and $46 in other related costs, including supplier and customer contract-related costs.
as of december 31, 2015, approximately 2,500 of the 2,870 employees (previously 2,910) were separated. the total number of employees associated with 2014 restructuring programs was updated to reflect employees, who were initially identified for separation, accepting other positions within alcoa and natural attrition. the remaining separations for 2014 restructuring programs are expected to be completed by the end of 2016. in 2015 and 2014, cash payments of $62 and $141, respectively, were made against layoff reserves related to 2014 restructuring programs.
2013 actions. in 2013, alcoa recorded restructuring and other charges of $782 ($585 after-tax and noncontrolling interests), which were comprised of the following components: $391 ($305 after-tax and noncontrolling interest) related to the resolution of a legal matter; $245 ($183 after-tax) for exit costs related to the permanent shutdown and demolition of certain structures at three smelter locations (see below); $87 ($61 after-tax and noncontrolling interests) for layoff costs, including the separation of approximately 1,110 employees (340 in the primary metals segment, 250 in the global rolled products segment, 220 in the engineered products and solutions segment, 85 in the alumina segment, 75 in the transportation and construction solutions segment and 140 in corporate), of which 590 relates to a global overhead reduction program, and $9 in pension plan settlement charges related to previously separated employees; $25 ($17 after-tax) in net charges, including $12 ($8 after-tax) for asset impairments, related to retirements and/or the sale of previously idled structures; $25 ($13 after-tax and noncontrolling interests) for asset impairments related to the write-off of capitalized costs for projects no longer being pursued due to the market environment; a net charge of $17 ($12 after-tax and noncontrolling interests) for other miscellaneous items, including $3 ($2 after-tax) for asset impairments; and $8 ($6 after-tax and noncontrolling interests) for the reversal of a number of small layoff reserves related to prior periods.
in may 2013, management approved the permanent shutdown and demolition of two potlines (capacity of 105 kmt-per-year) that utilize soderberg technology at the baie comeau smelter in québec, canada (remaining capacity of 280
kmt-per-year composed of two prebake potlines) and the full capacity (44 kmt-per-year) at the fusina smelter in italy. additionally, in august 2013, management approved the permanent shutdown and demolition of one potline (capacity of 41 kmt-per-year) that utilizes soderberg technology at the massena east, ny smelter (remaining capacity of 84 kmt-per-year composed of two soderberg potlines). the aforementioned soderberg lines at baie comeau and massena east were fully shut down by the end of september 2013 while the fusina smelter was previously temporarily idled in 2010. demolition and remediation activities related to all three facilities began in late 2013 and are expected to be completed by the end of 2016 for massena east and by the end of 2017 for both baie comeau and fusina.
the decisions on the soderberg lines for baie comeau and massena east were part of a 15-month review of 460 kmt of smelting capacity initiated by management in may 2013 for possible curtailment, while the decision on the fusina smelter was in addition to the capacity being reviewed. factors leading to all three decisions were in general focused on achieving sustained competitiveness and included, among others: lack of an economically viable, long-term power solution (italy); changed market fundamentals; other existing idle capacity; and restart costs.
in 2013, exit costs related to the shutdown actions included $114 for the layoff of approximately 550 employees (primary metals segment), including $83 in pension costs; accelerated depreciation of $58 (baie comeau) and asset impairments of $18 (fusina and massena east) representing the write-off of the remaining book value of all related properties, plants, and equipment; and $55 in other exit costs. additionally in 2013, remaining inventories, mostly operating supplies and raw materials, were written down to their net realizable value resulting in a charge of $9 ($6 after-tax), which was recorded in cogs. the other exit costs of $55 represent $48 in asset retirement obligations and $5 in environmental remediation, both of which were triggered by the decisions to permanently shut down and demolish these structures, and $2 in other related costs.
as of december 31, 2015, the separations associated with 2013 restructuring programs were essentially complete. in 2015, 2014, and 2013, cash payments of $7, $39, and $33, respectively, were made against layoff reserves related to 2013 restructuring programs.
alcoa does not include restructuring and other charges in the results of its reportable segments. the pretax impact of allocating such charges to segment results would have been as follows:
interest expenseinterest expense was $498 in 2015 compared with $473 in 2014. the increase of $25, or 5%, was primarily due to an 8% higher average debt level, somewhat offset by the absence of fees paid associated with the execution and termination of a 364-day senior unsecured bridge term loan facility related to the then-planned acquisition of firth rixson ($13see engineered products and solutions in segment information below). the higher average debt level was mostly attributable to higher outstanding long-term debt due to the september 2014 issuance of $1,250 in 5.125% notes, the proceeds of which were used to pay a portion of the purchase price of the firth rixson acquisition.
interest expense was $473 in 2014 compared with $453 in 2013. the increase of $20, or 4%, was principally caused by lower capitalized interest ($43), largely due to the progress completed at the aluminum complex in saudi arabia, and fees paid associated with the execution and termination of a 364-day senior unsecured bridge term loan facility related to the then-planned acquisition of firth rixson ($13see engineered products and solutions in segment information below). these items were partially offset by a 3% lower average debt level and lower amortization of debt-related costs
other expenses (income), netother expenses, net was $2 in 2015 compared with $47 in 2014. the decrease of $45 was mainly the result of a gain on the sale of land both around the lake charles, la anode facility and at alcoas former sherwin, tx refinery site ($49) and the remaining equity investment in a china rolling mill ($19) and a favorable change in deferred compensation. these items were somewhat offset by the absence of a gain on the sale of a mining interest in suriname ($28) and a portion of an equity investment in a china rolling mill ($14), an unfavorable change in the cash surrender value of company-owned life insurance, and a net unfavorable change in mark-to-market derivative contracts.
other expenses, net was $47 in 2014 compared with other income, net of $25 in 2013. the change of $72 was mostly due to an unfavorable change in mark-to-market derivative aluminum contracts ($42), net unfavorable foreign currency movements ($34), a higher equity loss related to alcoas share of the joint venture in saudi arabia due to start-up costs of the entire complex, including restart costs for one of the smelter potlines that was previously shut down due to a period of instability, and a smaller improvement in the cash surrender value of company-owned life insurance. these items were somewhat offset by a gain on the sale of a mining interest in suriname ($28) and a portion of an equity investment in a china rolling mill ($14).
income taxesalcoas effective tax rate was 179.4% (provision on income) in 2015 compared with the u.s. federal statutory rate of 35%. the effective tax rate differs from the u.s. federal statutory rate principally due to a $190 discrete income tax charge for valuation allowances on certain deferred tax assets in the united states and iceland (see income taxes in critical accounting policies and estimates below), a $201 charge for legal matters in italy (see restructuring and other charges above) and a $25 impairment of goodwill (see impairment of goodwill above) that are nondeductible for income tax purposes, a loss on the sale of a rolling mill in russia (see global rolled products in segment information below) for which no tax benefit was recognized, a $34 net discrete income tax charge as described below, and restructuring charges related to the curtailment of a refinery in suriname (see restructuring and other charges above), a portion for which no tax benefit was recognized.
in 2015, alcoa world alumina and chemicals (awac), a joint venture owned 60% by alcoa and 40% by alumina limited (alcoa consolidates awac for financial reporting purposes), recognized an $85 discrete income tax charge for a valuation allowance on certain deferred tax assets in suriname (see income taxes in critical accounting policies and estimates below), which were related mostly to employee benefits and tax loss carryforwards. alcoa also had a $51 deferred tax liability related to its 60%-share of these deferred tax assets that was written off as a result of the valuation allowance recognized by awac.
alcoas effective tax rate was 64.4% (provision on income) in 2014 compared with the u.s. federal statutory rate of 35%. the effective tax rate differs from the u.s. federal statutory rate mainly due to restructuring charges related to operations in italy (no tax benefit) and australia (benefit at a lower tax rate) (see restructuring and other charges above), a $52 ($31 after noncontrolling interest) discrete income tax charge related to a tax rate change in brazil (see below), a loss on the sale of three rolling mills in europe (no tax benefit) (see global rolled products in segment information below), and a $27 ($16 after noncontrolling interest) discrete income tax charge for the remeasurement of certain deferred tax assets of a subsidiary in spain due to a november 2014 enacted tax rate change (from 30% in 2014 to 28% in 2015 to 25% in 2016). these items were somewhat offset by foreign income taxed in lower rate jurisdictions and a $9 discrete income tax benefit for the release of a valuation allowance related to operations in germany due to the initiation of a tax planning strategy.
in december 2011, one of alcoas subsidiaries in brazil applied for a tax holiday related to its expanded mining and refining operations. during 2013, the application was amended and re-filed and, separately, a similar application was filed for another one of the companys subsidiaries in brazil. the deadline for the brazilian government to deny the application was july 11, 2014. since alcoa did not receive notice that its applications were denied, the tax holiday took effect automatically on july 12, 2014. as a result, the tax rate applicable to qualified holiday income for these
subsidiaries decreased significantly (from 34% to 15.25%), resulting in future cash tax savings over the 10-year holiday period (retroactively effective as of january 1, 2013). additionally, a portion of one of the subsidiaries net deferred tax asset that reverses within the holiday period was remeasured at the new tax rate (the net deferred tax asset of the other subsidiary was not remeasured since it could still be utilized against the subsidiarys future earnings not subject to the tax holiday). this remeasurement resulted in a decrease to that subsidiarys net deferred tax asset and a noncash charge to earnings of $52 ($31 after noncontrolling interest).
alcoas effective tax rate was 23.6% in 2013 (provision on a loss) compared with the u.s. federal statutory rate of 35%. the effective tax rate differs (by (58.6)% points) from the u.s. federal statutory rate primarily due to a $1,731 impairment of goodwill (see impairment of goodwill above) and a $209 charge for a legal matter (see restructuring and other charges above) that are nondeductible for income tax purposes, a $372 discrete income tax charge for valuation allowances on certain deferred tax assets in spain and the united states (see income taxes in critical accounting policies and estimates below), restructuring charges related to operations in canada (benefit at a lower tax rate) and italy (no tax benefit) (see restructuring and other charges above), and a $9 discrete income tax charge related to prior year taxes in spain and australia. these items were slightly offset by an $18 discrete income tax benefit related to new u.s. tax legislation (see below).
on january 2, 2013, the american taxpayer relief act of 2012 was signed into law and reinstated various expired or expiring temporary business tax provisions through 2013. two specific temporary business tax provisions that expired in 2011 and impacted alcoa are the look-through rule for payments between related controlled foreign corporations and the research and experimentation credit. the expiration of these two provisions resulted in alcoa recognizing a higher income tax provision of $18 in 2012. as tax law changes are accounted for in the period of enactment, alcoa recognized an $18 discrete income tax benefit in 2013 related to the 2012 tax year to reflect the extension of these provisions. beginning on january 1, 2014, these two provisions once again expired. on december 19, 2014, the tax increase prevention act of 2014 was signed into law, which retroactively extended for one year (i.e. calendar year 2014) a number of the tax provisions that expired at the end of 2013, including the two specific aforementioned provisions. beginning on january 1, 2015, these two provisions once again expired. on december 18, 2015, the consolidated appropriations act, 2016 was signed into law, which retroactively (as of january 1, 2015) extended for two or five years or made permanent a number of the tax provisions that expired at the end of 2014, including the two specific aforementioned provisions. the look-through rule for payments between related controlled foreign corporations was renewed for five years (through 2019) and the research and experimentation credit was made permanent.
management anticipates that the effective tax rate in 2016 will be between 30% and 35%. however, business portfolio actions, changes in the current economic environment, tax legislation or rate changes, currency fluctuations, ability to realize deferred tax assets, and the results of operations in certain taxing jurisdictions may cause this estimated rate to fluctuate.
noncontrolling interestsnet income attributable to noncontrolling interests was $125 in 2015 compared with net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests of $91 in 2014 and net income attributable to noncontrolling interests of $41 in 2013. these amounts were virtually all related to alumina limiteds 40% ownership interest in awac. in 2015, awac generated income compared to a loss in both 2014 and 2013.
in 2015, the change in awacs results was principally due to improved operating results, the absence of restructuring and other charges related to both the permanent shutdown of the point henry smelter in australia (see restructuring and other charges above) and the divestiture of an ownership interest in a mining and refining joint venture in jamaica (see alumina in segment information below), and the absence of a combined $79 ($32 was noncontrolling interests share) discrete income tax charge related to a respective tax rate change in both brazil and spain (see income taxes above). these positive impacts were somewhat offset by restructuring charges related to the curtailment of both the refinery in suriname and in point comfort, tx and the permanent closure of the anglesea power station and coal mine (see restructuring and other charges above), an $85 ($34 was noncontrolling interests share) discrete income tax charge for a valuation allowance on certain deferred tax assets (see income taxes above), and the absence of a $28 gain ($11 was noncontrolling interests share) on the sale of a mining interest in suriname. the improvement in
awacs operating results was largely attributable to net favorable foreign currency movements, net productivity improvements, and lower input costs, slightly offset by a lower average realized alumina price (see alumina in segment information below).
in 2014, awac generated a smaller loss compared to 2013 mainly driven by the absence of a $384 charge for a legal matter (see below), improved operating results, and a $28 gain ($11 was noncontrolling interests share) on the sale of a mining interest in suriname. these positive impacts were mostly offset by restructuring and other charges associated with both the permanent shutdown of the point henry smelter in australia (see restructuring and other charges above) and the divestiture of an ownership interest in a mining and refining joint venture in jamaica (see alumina in segment information below) and a combined $79 ($32 was noncontrolling interests share) discrete income tax charge related to a respective tax rate change in both brazil and spain (see income taxes above). the improvement in awacs operating results was principally due to net favorable foreign currency movements and net productivity improvements, partially offset by an increase in input costs (see alumina in segment information below). even though awac generated an overall loss in both 2014 and 2013, the noncontrolling interests share resulted in income in 2013 due to the manner in which the charges and costs related to a legal matter were allocated. a description of how these charges and costs for this legal matter impacted noncontrolling interests follows.
the noncontrolling interests share of awacs charge for a legal matter in 2013 and 2012 was $58 (related to the aforementioned $384) and $34 (an $85 charge related to the civil portion of the same legal matter), respectively. in 2012, the $34 was based on the 40% ownership interest of alumina limited, while, in 2013, the $58 was based on 15%. the application of a different percentage was due to the criteria in a 2012 allocation agreement between alcoa and alumina limited related to this legal matter being met. additionally, the $34 charge, as well as costs related to this legal matter, was retroactively adjusted to reflect the terms of the allocation agreement, resulting in a credit to noncontrolling interests of $41 in 2013. in summary, noncontrolling interests included a charge of $17 and $34 related to this legal matter in 2013 and 2012, respectively.
segment information alcoas operations consist of five worldwide reportable segments: alumina, primary metals, global rolled products, engineered products and solutions, and transportation and construction solutions (see below). segment performance under alcoas management reporting system is evaluated based on a number of factors; however, the primary measure of performance is the after-tax operating income (atoi) of each segment. certain items such as the impact of lifo inventory accounting; metal price lag (see below); interest expense; noncontrolling interests; corporate expense (general administrative and selling expenses of operating the corporate headquarters and other global administrative facilities, along with depreciation and amortization on corporate-owned assets); restructuring and other charges; and other items, including intersegment profit eliminations, differences between tax rates applicable to the segments and the consolidated effective tax rate, and other nonoperating items such as foreign currency transaction gains/losses and interest income are excluded from segment atoi.
effective in the second quarter of 2015, management removed the impact of metal price lag from the results of the global rolled products and engineered products and solutions (now engineered products and solutions and transportation and construction solutionssee below) segments in order to enhance the visibility of the underlying operating performance of these businesses. metal price lag describes the timing difference created when the average price of metal sold differs from the average cost of the metal when purchased by the respective segment. in general, when the price of metal increases, metal price lag is favorable, and when the price of metal decreases, metal price lag is unfavorable. the impact of metal price lag is now reported as a separate line item in alcoas reconciliation of total segment atoi to consolidated net (loss) income attributable to alcoa. as a result, this change does not impact the consolidated results of alcoa. segment information for all prior periods presented was updated to reflect this change.
in the third quarter of 2015, management approved a realignment of alcoas engineered products and solutions segment due to the expansion of this part of alcoas business portfolio through both organic and inorganic growth. this realignment consisted of moving both the alcoa wheel and transportation products and building and construction systems business units to a new reportable segment named transportation and construction solutions.
additionally, the latin american soft alloy extrusions business previously included in corporate was moved into the new transportation and construction solutions segment. the remaining engineered products and solutions segment consists of the alcoa fastening systems and rings (renamed to include portions of the firth rixson business acquired in november 2014), alcoa power and propulsion (includes the tital business acquired in march 2015), alcoa forgings and extrusions (includes the other portions of firth rixson), and alcoa titanium and engineered products (a new business unit that consists solely of the rti international metals business acquired in july 2015) business units. segment information for all prior periods presented was updated to reflect the new segment structure.
atoi for all reportable segments totaled $1,906 in 2015, $1,968 in 2014, and $1,267 in 2013. the following information provides shipments, sales, and atoi data for each reportable segment, as well as certain production, realized price, and average cost data, for each of the three years in the period ended december 31, 2015. see note q to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this form 10-k for additional information.
*   includes all production-related costs, including raw materials consumed; conversion costs, such as labor, materials, and utilities; depreciation, depletion, and amortization; and plant administrative expenses.
this segment represents a portion of alcoas upstream operations and consists of the companys worldwide refining system. alumina mines bauxite, from which alumina is produced and then sold directly to external smelter customers, as well as to the primary metals segment (see primary metals below), or to customers who process it into industrial chemical products. more than half of aluminas production is sold under supply contracts to third parties worldwide, while the remainder is used internally by the primary metals segment. alumina produced by this segment and used internally is transferred to the primary metals segment at prevailing market prices. a portion of this segments third-party sales are completed through the use of agents, alumina traders, and distributors. generally, the sales of this segment are transacted in u.s. dollars while costs and expenses of this segment are transacted in the local currency of the respective operations, which are the australian dollar, the brazilian real, the u.s. dollar, and the euro.
awac is an unincorporated global joint venture between alcoa and alumina limited and consists of a number of affiliated operating entities, which own, or have an interest in, or operate the bauxite mines and alumina refineries within the alumina segment (except for the poços de caldas refinery in brazil and a portion of the são luĺs refinery in brazil). alcoa owns 60% and alumina limited owns 40% of these individual entities, which are consolidated by the company for financial reporting purposes. as such, the results and analysis presented for the alumina segment are inclusive of alumina limiteds 40% interest.
in december 2014, awac completed the sale of its ownership stake in jamalco, a bauxite mine and alumina refinery joint venture in jamaica, to noble group ltd. jamalco was 55% owned by a subsidiary of awac, and, while owned by awac, 55% of both the operating results and assets and liabilities of this joint venture were included in the alumina segment. as it relates to awacs previous 55% ownership stake, the refinery (awacs share of the capacity was 779 kmt-per-year) generated sales (third-party and intersegment) of approximately $200 in 2013, and the refinery and mine combined, at the time of divestiture, had approximately 500 employees. see restructuring and other charges in results of operations above.
in march 2015, management initiated a 12-month review of 2,800 kmt in refining capacity for possible curtailment (partial or full), permanent closure or divestiture. this review is part of managements target to lower alcoas refining operations on the global alumina cost curve to the 21st percentile (currently 23rd) by the end of 2016. as part of this review, in 2015, management decided to curtail all of the operating capacity at both the suralco (1,330 kmt-per-year) and point comfort (2,010 kmt-per-year) refineries. the curtailment of the capacity at suralco was completed by the end of november 2015. management is currently in discussions with the suriname government to determine the best long-term solution for suralco due to limited bauxite reserves and the absence of a long-term energy alternative. the curtailment of the capacity at point comfort is expected to be completed by the end of june 2016 (375 kmt-per-year was completed by the end of december 2015). suralco and point comfort have nameplate capacity of 2,207 kmt-per-year and 2,305 kmt-per-year, respectively, of which 877 kmt and 295 kmt, respectively was curtailed prior to the review. see restructuring and other charges in results of operations above for a description of the associated charges related to these actions.
in 2014, alumina production decreased by 12 kmt compared to 2013. the decline was mainly driven by lower production at the poços de caldas, jamalco, and san ciprian refineries, mostly offset by higher production at every other refinery in the global system. the poços de caldas refinery started to reduce production in early 2014 in response to managements decision to fully curtail the poços de caldas smelter by the end of may 2014 (see primary metals below). as a result, management reduced the alumina production at the poços de caldas refinery by approximately 200 kmt-per-year by mid-2014. this reduction was replaced by an increase in production at lower cost refineries within alcoas global system. additionally, the decrease at the refinery in jamaica was due to the absence of production for one month as a result of the sale of the ownership stake in jamalco (see above).
third-party sales for the alumina segment decreased 2% in 2015 compared with 2014, largely attributable to a 2% decline in average realized price, somewhat offset by a 1% increase in volume. the change in average realized price was mostly driven by a decrease in both the average alumina index/spot price and average lme-based price, somewhat offset by a higher percentage (75% compared to 68%) of smelter-grade alumina shipments linked to an alumina index/spot price instead of an lme-based price.
third-party sales for this segment improved 6% in 2014 compared with 2013, primarily related to a 7% improvement in volume.
intersegment sales for the alumina segment declined 13% in both 2015 compared with 2014 and 2014 compared with 2013. the decrease in both periods was mostly the result of lower demand from the primary metals segment, as a result of the closure, curtailment or divestiture of a number of smelters (see primary metals below), and a lower average realized price.
atoi for the alumina segment increased $376 in 2015 compared with 2014, mainly caused by net favorable foreign currency movements due to a stronger u.s. dollar, especially against the australian dollar and brazilian real; net productivity improvements; and lower input costs, including natural gas, fuel oil, and transportation, all of which were slightly offset by higher labor and maintenance costs. these positive impacts were slightly offset by the previously mentioned lower average realized price and the absence of a gain on the sale of a mining interest in suriname ($18).
atoi for this segment improved $111 in 2014 compared with 2013, mostly due to net favorable foreign currency movements due to a stronger u.s. dollar, especially against the australian dollar, net productivity improvements, and a gain on the sale of a mining interest in suriname ($18). these positive impacts were partially offset by higher input costs, including natural gas (particularly higher prices in australia), bauxite (mainly due to a new mining site in suriname), and labor and maintenance, all of which were somewhat offset by lower costs for caustic; and a higher equity loss due to start-up costs of the bauxite mine and refinery in saudi arabia.
in 2016, alumina production will be approximately 2,500 kmt lower, mostly due to the curtailment of the point comfort and suralco refineries. also, the continued shift towards alumina index and spot pricing is expected to average 85% of third-party smelter-grade alumina shipments. additionally, net productivity improvements are anticipated.
*                                          average realized price per metric ton of aluminum includes three elements: a) the underlying base metal component, based on quoted prices from the lme; b) the regional premium, which represents the incremental price over the base lme component that is associated with the physical delivery of metal to a particular region (e.g., the midwest premium for metal sold in the united states); and c) the product premium, which represents the incremental price for receiving physical metal in a particular shape (e.g., billet, slab, rod, etc.) or alloy.
**   includes all production-related costs, including raw materials consumed; conversion costs, such as labor, materials, and utilities; depreciation and amortization; and plant administrative expenses.
this segment represents a portion of alcoas upstream operations and consists of the companys worldwide smelting system. primary metals purchases alumina, mostly from the alumina segment (see alumina above), from which primary aluminum is produced and then sold directly to external customers and traders, as well as to alcoas midstream operations and, to a lesser extent, downstream operations. results from the sale of aluminum powder, scrap, and excess energy are also included in this segment, as well as the results of aluminum derivative contracts and buy/resell activity. primary aluminum produced by alcoa and used internally is transferred to other segments at prevailing market prices. the sale of primary aluminum represents approximately 90% of this segments third-party sales. buy/resell activity occurs when this segment purchases metal and resells such metal to external customers or the midstream and downstream operations in order to maximize smelting system efficiency and to meet customer requirements. generally, the sales of this segment are transacted in u.s. dollars while costs and expenses of this segment are transacted in the local currency of the respective operations, which are the u.s. dollar, the euro, the norwegian kroner, icelandic krona, the canadian dollar, the brazilian real, and the australian dollar.
in november 2014, alcoa completed the sale of an aluminum rod plant located in bécancour, québec, canada to sural laminated products. this facility takes molten aluminum and shapes it into the form of a rod, which is used by customers primarily for the transportation of electricity. while owned by alcoa, the operating results and assets and liabilities of this plant were included in the primary metals segment. in conjunction with this transaction, alcoa entered into a multi-year agreement with sural laminated products to supply molten aluminum for the rod plant. the aluminum rod plant generated sales of approximately $200 in 2013 and, at the time of divestiture, had approximately 60 employees. see restructuring and other charges in results of operations above.
in december 2014, alcoa completed the sale of its 50.33% ownership stake in the mt. holly smelter located in goose creek, south carolina to century aluminum company. while owned by alcoa, 50.33% of both the operating results and assets and liabilities related to the smelter were included in the primary metals segment. as it relates to alcoas previous 50.33% ownership stake, the smelter (alcoas share of the capacity was 115 kmt-per-year) generated sales of approximately $280 in 2013 and, at the time of divestiture, had approximately 250 employees. see restructuring and other charges in results of operations above.
at december 31, 2015, alcoa had 778 kmt of idle capacity on a base capacity of 3,401 kmt. in 2015, idle capacity increased 113 kmt compared to 2014, mostly due to the curtailment of 217 kmt combined at a smelter in each the
united states and brazil, partially offset by the permanent closure of the poços de caldas smelter in brazil (96 kmt-per-year). base capacity declined 96 kmt between december 31, 2015 and 2014 due to the previously mentioned permanent closure of the poços de caldas smelter. a detailed description of each of these actions follows below.
at december 31, 2014, alcoa had 665 kmt of idle capacity on a base capacity of 3,497 kmt. in 2014, idle capacity increased 10 kmt compared to 2013 due to the curtailment of 159 kmt combined at two smelters in brazil, mostly offset by the permanent closure of the portovesme smelter in italy (150 kmt-per-year). base capacity declined 540 kmt between december 31, 2014 and 2013 due to the permanent closure of both a smelter in australia and two remaining potlines at a smelter in the united states (274 kmt combined), the previously mentioned permanent closure of the portovesme smelter, and the sale of alcoas ownership stake in the mt. holly smelter (see above). a detailed description of each of these actions follows below.
in march 2015, management initiated a 12-month review of 500 kmt in smelting capacity for possible curtailment (partial or full), permanent closure or divestiture. this review is part of managements target to lower alcoas smelting operations on the global aluminum cost curve to the 38th percentile (currently 43rd) by 2016. in summary, under this review, management approved the curtailment of 447 kmt-per-year and the closure of 269 kmt-per-year. the following is a description of each action.
also in march 2015, management decided to curtail the remaining capacity (74 kmt-per-year) at the são luís smelter in brazil; this action was completed in april 2015. in 2013 and 2014 combined, alcoa curtailed capacity of 194 kmt-per-year at the são luís smelter under a prior management review (see below).
additionally, in november 2015, management decided to curtail the remaining capacity at the intalco (230 kmt-per-year) and wenatchee (143 kmt-per-year) smelters, both in washington. these two smelters previously had curtailed capacity of 90 kmt-per-year combined. the curtailment of the remaining capacity at wenatchee was completed by the end of december 2015 and the curtailment of the remaining capacity at intalco is expected to be completed by the end of june 2016.
furthermore, in december 2015, management approved the permanent closure of the warrick, in smelter (269 kmt-per-year). this decision was made as this smelter is no longer competitive in light of prevailing market conditions for the price of aluminum. the shutdown of the warrick smelter is expected to be completed by the end of march 2016.
separate from the 2015 smelting capacity review described above, in june 2015, management approved the permanent closure of the poços de caldas smelter effective immediately. the poços de caldas smelter had been temporarily idle since may 2014 (see below) due to challenging global market conditions for primary aluminum and higher operating costs, which made the smelter uncompetitive. the decision to permanently close the poços de caldas smelter was based on the fact that these underlying conditions had not improved.
in may 2013, management initiated a 15-month review of 460 kmt in smelting capacity for possible curtailment. this review was aimed at maintaining alcoas competitiveness despite falling aluminum prices and focused on the highest-cost smelting capacity and those plants that have long-term risk due to factors such as energy costs or regulatory uncertainty. in 2014, an additional 250 kmt of smelting capacity was included in the review. in summary, under this review, management approved the closure of 146 kmt-per-year and 274 kmt-per-year and the curtailment of 131 kmt-per-year and 159 kmt-per-year in 2013 and 2014, respectively. the following is a description of each action.
also in may 2013, management approved the permanent closure of two potlines (105 kmt-per-year) that utilize soderberg technology at the baie comeau smelter in quebec, canada. additionally, in august 2013, management approved the permanent closure of one potline (41 kmt-per-year) that utilizes soderberg technology at the massena east, ny smelter. the shutdown of these three lines was completed by the end of september 2013. the baie comeau smelter has a remaining capacity of 280 kmt-per-year composed of two prebake potlines and the massena east smelter had a remaining capacity of 84 kmt-per-year composed of two soderberg potlines (see below).
additionally, in august 2013, management decided to curtail 97 kmt-per-year at the são luís smelter and 31 kmt-per-year at the poços de caldas smelter. this action was also completed by the end of september 2013. an additional 3 kmt-per-year was curtailed at the poços de caldas smelter by the end of 2013.
in january 2014, management approved the permanent closure of the remaining capacity (84 kmt-per-year) at the massena east smelter, which represented two soderberg potlines that were no longer competitive. this shutdown was completed by the end of march 2014. in february 2014, management approved the permanent closure of the point henry smelter (190 kmt-per-year) in australia. this decision was made as management determined that the smelter had no prospect of becoming financially viable. the shutdown of the point henry smelter was completed in august 2014.
also, in march 2014, management decided to curtail the remaining capacity (62 kmt-per-year) at the poços de caldas smelter and additional capacity (85 kmt-per-year) at the são luís smelter. the curtailment of this capacity was completed by the end of may 2014. an additional 12 kmt-per-year was curtailed at the são luís smelter during the remainder of 2014.
separate from the 2013-2014 smelting capacity review described above, in june 2013, management approved the permanent closure of the fusina smelter (44 kmt-per-year) in italy as the underlying conditions that led to the idling of the smelter in 2010 had not fundamentally changed, including low aluminum prices and the lack of an economically viable, long-term power solution. in august 2014, management approved the permanent closure of the portovesme smelter, which had been idle since november 2012. this decision was made because the fundamental reasons that made the portovesme smelter uncompetitive remained unchanged, including the lack of a viable long-term power solution.
in 2015, aluminum production declined by 314 kmt, mainly the result of the absence of and/or lower production at the combined four smelters (point henry, são luís, massena east, and poços de caldas) impacted by the 2014 and 2015 capacity reviews and at the smelter divested in 2014 (mt. holly), all of which is described above.
in 2014, aluminum production decreased by 425 kmt, mostly due to lower production at the five smelters (são luís, massena east, point henry, baie comeau, and poços de caldas) impacted by the 2013-2014 capacity review described above.
third-party sales for the primary metals segment declined 18% in 2015 compared with 2014, primarily due to a 14% drop in average realized price, the absence of sales (approximately $585) from five smelters and a rod mill that were closed, curtailed or divested in 2014, and lower energy sales in brazil, due to both a decrease in energy prices and a weaker brazilian real. these negative impacts were slightly offset by higher volume in the remaining smelter portfolio and higher buy/resell activity. the change in average realized price was largely attributable to a 10% lower average lme price (on 15-day lag) and lower regional premiums, which dropped by an average of 39% in the united states and canada and 44% in europe. the higher buy/resell activity was primarily related to the fulfillment of customer orders with aluminum purchased from the smelter at the saudi arabia joint venture.
third-party sales for the primary metals segment increased 3% in 2014 compared with 2013, mainly due to higher energy sales in brazil resulting from excess power due to curtailed smelter capacity, higher buy/resell activity, and a 7% increase in average realized price, mostly offset by lower volumes, including from the five smelters impacted by the 2013 and 2014 capacity reductions. the change in average realized price was driven by higher regional premiums, which increased by an average of 84% in the united states and canada and 56% in europe.
intersegment sales for the primary metals segment declined 26% in 2015 compared with 2014, mainly the result of lower demand from the midstream and downstream businesses and a decrease in average realized price. the decline related to the midstream business was driven by the absence of shipments to four of the five rolling mills (the fifth mill
purchased scrap metal from third-parties) that were either divested or permanently closed in december 2014 (see global rolled products below). intersegment sales for this segment improved 12% in 2014 compared with 2013, principally due to an increase in average realized price, driven by higher regional premiums, and higher demand from the midstream and downstream businesses.
atoi for the primary metals segment decreased $439 in 2015 compared with 2014, primarily caused by both the previously mentioned lower average realized aluminum price and lower energy sales, higher energy costs (mostly in spain as the 2014 interruptibility rights were more favorable than the 2015 structure), and an unfavorable impact related to the curtailment of the são luís smelter. these negative impacts were somewhat offset by net favorable foreign currency movements due to a stronger u.s. dollar against most major currencies, net productivity improvements, the absence of a write-off of inventory related to the permanent closure of the portovesme, point henry, and massena east smelters ($44), and a lower equity loss related to the joint venture in saudi arabia, including the absence of restart costs for one of the potlines that was previously shut down due to a period of instability.
atoi for this segment climbed $614 in 2014 compared with 2013, principally related to a higher average realized aluminum price; the previously mentioned energy sales in brazil; net productivity improvements; net favorable foreign currency movements due to a stronger u.s. dollar against all major currencies; lower costs for carbon and alumina; and the absence of costs related to a planned maintenance outage in 2013 at a power plant in australia. these positive impacts were slightly offset by an unfavorable impact associated with the 2013 and 2014 capacity reductions described above, including a write-off of inventory related to the permanent closure of the portovesme, point henry, and massena east smelters ($44), and higher energy costs (particularly in spain), labor, and maintenance.
in 2016, aluminum production will be approximately 450 kmt lower and third-party sales will reflect the absence of approximately $400 both as a result of the 2015 curtailment and closure actions. also, energy sales in brazil will be negatively impacted by a decline in energy prices, while net productivity improvements are anticipated.
 see the footnote to the table in primary metals above for a description of these two components), and b) the conversion price, which represents the incremental price over the metal price component that is associated with converting primary aluminum into sheet and plate. in this circumstance, the metal price component is a pass-through to this segments customers with limited exception (e.g., fixed-priced contracts, certain regional premiums).
this segment represents alcoas midstream operations and produces aluminum sheet and plate for a variety of end markets. approximately one-half of the third-party shipments in this segment consist of sheet sold directly to customers in the packaging end market for the production of aluminum cans (beverage, food, and pet food). seasonal increases in can sheet sales are generally experienced in the second and third quarters of the year. this segment also includes sheet and plate sold directly to customers and through distributors related to the aerospace, automotive, commercial transportation, building and construction, and industrial products (mainly used in the production of machinery and equipment and consumer durables) end markets. a small portion of this segment also produces aseptic foil for the packaging end market. while the customer base for flat-rolled products is large, a significant amount of sales of sheet and plate is to a relatively small number of customers. in this circumstance, the sales and costs and expenses of this segment are transacted in the local currency of the respective operations, which are mostly the u.s. dollar, the euro, the russian ruble, the brazilian real, and the british pound.
in march 2015, alcoa completed the sale of a rolling mill located in belaya kalitva, russia to a wholly-owned subsidiary of stupino titanium company. while owned by alcoa, the operating results and assets and liabilities of the rolling mill were included in the global rolled products segment. the rolling mill generated sales of approximately $130 in 2014 and, at the time of divestiture, had approximately 1,870 employees. see restructuring and other charges in results of operations above.
in february 2014, management approved the permanent shutdown of alcoas two rolling mills in australia, point henry and yennora. this decision was made due to the significant impact of excess can sheet capacity in both australia and asia. the two rolling mills had a combined can sheet capacity of 200 kmt-per-year and were closed by the end of 2014. see restructuring and other charges in results of operations above for a description of the associated charges.
in december 2014, alcoa completed the sale of three rolling mills located in spain (alicante and amorebieta) and france (castelsarrasin) to a subsidiary of atlas holdings llc. while owned by alcoa, the operating results and assets and liabilities of the rolling mills were included in the global rolled products segment. in conjunction with this transaction, alcoa entered into a multi-year agreement with the buyer to supply aluminum for the rolling mills. the rolling mills combined generated sales of approximately $500 in 2013 and, at the time of divestiture, had approximately 750 employees. see restructuring and other charges in results of operations above.
third-party sales for the global rolled products segment declined 15% in 2015 compared with 2014, primarily driven by the absence of sales ($1,052) from six rolling mills in australia, spain, russia, and france (see above), unfavorable pricing, mostly due to a decrease in metal prices (both lme and regional premium components), and unfavorable foreign currency movements, mainly the result of a weaker euro, russian ruble, and brazilian real. these negative impacts were somewhat offset by increased demand of the remaining rolling portfolio and favorable product mix (automotive and aerospace versus industrial products). the volume improvement of the remaining portfolio was largely attributable to the automotive (north america) and can sheet packaging (china) end markets, slightly offset by lower demand in the industrial products end market.
third-party sales for this segment improved 3% in 2014 compared with 2013, principally caused by increased demand, somewhat offset by unfavorable price/product mix related to the packaging, aerospace, and industrial products end markets. volume improvements were mostly driven by the automotive and commercial transportation end markets.
atoi for the global rolled products segment decreased $1 in 2015 compared with 2014, primarily attributable to unfavorable price/product mix, largely the result of overall pricing pressure in the global can sheet packaging end market, and higher costs related to growth projects, including research and development as alcoa develops and qualifies products from a new micromill production process and the ramp-up of the tennessee automotive expansion. these negative impacts were virtually offset by net productivity improvements across most businesses and higher volumes of the remaining rolling portfolio, principally driven by higher demand in the automotive end market.
atoi for this segment declined $47 in 2014 compared with 2013, mainly the result of unfavorable price/product mix related to the packaging, aerospace, and industrial products end markets; higher input costs, including energy, labor, maintenance, and transportation; a larger equity loss due to start-up costs related to the rolling mill at the joint venture in saudi arabia; a write-off of inventory related to the decision to permanently shut down the point henry and yennora rolling mills ($9); and costs (business continuity and contract specific) related to a new labor agreement that covers employees at three rolling mills in the united states ($4) (see cogs in results of operations above). these negative impacts were partially offset by net productivity improvements across most businesses and overall higher volumes.
in 2016, demand in the automotive end market is expected to remain strong and the automotive expansion at the davenport, ia facility will operate at full capacity for the entire year while the automotive expansion at the tennessee facility will continue to ramp-up, both of which will serve the growing demand for aluminum-intensive vehicles. also, costs related to the ramp-up of the tennessee facility and the previously-idled casthouse in texarkana, tx, as well as for preparations to run the warrick, in rolling facility on cold metal as a result of the planned closure of the warrick smelter (see primary metals above), are expected. additionally, net productivity improvements are anticipated.
this segment represents a portion of alcoas downstream operations and produces products that are used mostly in the aerospace (commercial and defense), commercial transportation, and power generation end markets. such products include fastening systems (titanium, steel, and nickel alloys) and seamless rolled rings (mostly nickel alloys); and investment castings (nickel super alloys, titanium, and aluminum), including airfoils and forged jet engine components (e.g., jet engine disks), all of which are sold directly to customers and through distributors. more than 70% of the third-party sales in this segment are from the aerospace end market. a small part of this segment also produces various forging and extrusion metal products for the oil and gas, industrial products, automotive, and land and sea defense end markets. seasonal decreases in sales are generally experienced in the third quarter of the year due to the european summer slowdown across all end markets. generally, the sales and costs and expenses of this segment are transacted in the local currency of the respective operations, which are mostly the u.s. dollar and the euro.
in march 2015, alcoa completed the acquisition of an aerospace castings company, tital, a privately held company with approximately 650 employees based in germany. tital produces aluminum and titanium investment casting products for the aerospace and defense end markets. in 2014, tital generated sales of approximately $100. the purpose of this acquisition is to capture increasing demand for advanced jet engine components made of titanium, establish titanium-casting capabilities in europe, and expand existing aluminum casting capacity. the operating results and assets and liabilities of tital were included within the engineered products and solutions segment since the date of acquisition.
also in march 2015, alcoa signed a definitive agreement to acquire rti international metals, inc. (rti), a global supplier of titanium and specialty metal products and services for the commercial aerospace, defense, energy, and medical device end markets. on july 23, 2015, after satisfying all customary closing conditions and receiving the required regulatory and rti shareholder approvals, alcoa completed the acquisition of rti. the purpose of this acquisition is to expand alcoas range of titanium offerings and add advanced technologies and materials, primarily related to the aerospace end market. in 2014, rti generated net sales of $794 and had approximately 2,600 employees. alcoa estimates that rti will generate approximately $1,200 in third-party sales by 2019. in executing its integration plan for rti, alcoa expects to realize annual cost savings of approximately $100 by 2019 due to synergies derived from procurement and productivity improvements, leveraging alcoas global shared services, and driving profitable growth. the operating results and assets and liabilities of rti were included within the engineered products and solutions segment since the date of acquisition.
on november 19, 2014, after satisfying all customary closing conditions and receiving the required regulatory approvals, alcoa completed the acquisition of firth rixson, a global leader in aerospace jet engine components. firth rixson manufactures rings, forgings, and metal products for the aerospace end market, as well as other markets requiring highly engineered material applications. the purpose of this acquisition is to strengthen alcoas aerospace business and position the company to capture additional aerospace growth with a broader range of high-growth, value-add jet engine components. this business generated sales of approximately $970 in 2014 and has 13 operating facilities in the united states, united kingdom, europe, and asia employing approximately 2,400 people combined. in executing its integration plan for firth rixson, alcoa expects to realize annual cost savings of more than $100 by 2019 due to synergies derived from procurement and productivity improvements, optimizing internal metal supply, and leveraging alcoas global shared services. the operating results and assets and liabilities of firth rixson were included within the engineered products and solutions segment since the date of acquisition.
third-party sales for the engineered products and solutions segment improved 27% in 2015 compared with 2014, largely attributable to the third-party sales ($1,310) of three acquired businesses (see above), primarily aerospace-related, and higher volumes in this segments organic businesses, mostly related to the aerospace end market. these positive impacts were slightly offset by unfavorable foreign currency movements, principally driven by a weaker euro.
third-party sales for this segment increased 4% in 2014 compared with 2013, primarily due to higher volumes and the acquisition of firth rixson ($81see above). the higher volumes were mostly related to the aerospace (commercial) and commercial transportation end markets, somewhat offset by lower volumes in the industrial gas turbine end market.
atoi for the engineered products and solutions segment increased $16 in 2015 compared with 2014, principally the result of net productivity improvements across most businesses, a positive contribution from inorganic growth, and overall higher volumes in this segments organic businesses. these positive impacts were partially offset by unfavorable price/product mix, higher costs related to growth projects, and net unfavorable foreign currency movements, primarily related to a weaker euro.
atoi for this segment climbed $10 in 2014 compared with 2013, mainly due to net productivity improvements across all businesses and overall higher volumes, partially offset by higher costs, primarily labor, and unfavorable product mix.
in 2016, demand in the commercial aerospace end market is expected to remain strong, driven by significant order backlog. also, third-party sales will include a positive impact due to a full year of sales related to the acquisitions of rti and tital. additionally, net productivity improvements are anticipated while pricing pressure across all markets is expected.
this segment represents a portion of alcoas downstream operations and produces products that are used mostly in the nonresidential building and construction and commercial transportation end markets. such products include integrated aluminum structural systems, architectural extrusions, and forged aluminum commercial vehicle wheels, which are sold directly to customers and through distributors. a small part of this segment also produces aluminum products for the industrial products end market. generally, the sales and costs and expenses of this segment are transacted in the local currency of the respective operations, which are mostly the u.s. dollar, the euro, and the brazilian real.
third-party sales for the transportation and construction solutions segment decreased 7% in 2015 compared with 2014, primarily driven by unfavorable foreign currency movements, principally caused by a weaker euro and brazilian real, and lower volume related to the building and construction end market, somewhat offset by higher volume related to the commercial transportation end market.
third-party sales for this segment increased 4% in 2014 compared with 2013, mostly the result of higher volume related to the commercial transportation and building and construction end markets, somewhat offset by lower volume in the industrial products and market.
atoi for the transportation and construction solutions segment declined $14 in 2015 compared with 2014, mainly due to higher costs, net unfavorable foreign currency movements, primarily related to a weaker euro and brazilian real, and unfavorable price/product mix. these negative impacts were mostly offset by net productivity improvements across all businesses.
atoi for this segment improved $13 in 2014 compared with 2013, principally attributable to net productivity improvements across all businesses and overall higher volumes, partially offset by unfavorable product mix and higher costs, primarily labor.
transportation end market are expected to decline while improvements in europe are anticipated. additionally, net productivity improvements are anticipated.
reconciliation of atoi to consolidated net (loss) income attributable to alcoa items required to reconcile total segment atoi to consolidated net (loss) income attributable to alcoa include: the impact of lifo inventory accounting; metal price lag; interest expense; noncontrolling interests; corporate expense (general administrative and selling expenses of operating the corporate headquarters and other global administrative facilities, along with depreciation and amortization on corporate-owned assets); restructuring and other charges; and other items, including intersegment profit eliminations, differences between tax rates applicable to the segments and the consolidated effective tax rate, and other nonoperating items such as foreign currency transaction gains/losses and interest income.
the significant changes in the reconciling items between total segment atoi and consolidated net (loss) income attributable to alcoa for 2015 compared with 2014 consisted of:
                                                an increase in interest expense, principally caused by an 8% higher average debt level, which was largely attributable to higher outstanding long-term debt due to the september 2014 issuance of $1,250 in 5.125% notes, somewhat offset by the absence of fees paid associated with the execution and termination of a 364-day senior unsecured bridge term loan facility related to the then-planned acquisition of firth rixson ($8);
                                           a change in noncontrolling interests, due to the change in results of awac, primarily driven by improved operating results and lower restructuring and other charges related to a number of portfolio actions (e.g. capacity reductions and a divestiture), slightly offset by the absence of a gain on the sale of a mining interest in suriname ($11 was noncontrolling interests share);
   a decline in corporate expense, largely attributable to decreases in various expenses, including lower acquisition costs ($13), partially offset by expenses related to the planned separation of alcoa ($24);
   an increase in restructuring and other charges, mostly the result of a charge for legal matters in italy, partially offset by lower restructuring and other charges associated with a number of portfolio actions (e.g. capacity reductions and divestitures); and
                    a change in other, primarily due to a discrete income tax charge for valuation allowances on certain deferred tax assets in the united states and iceland ($190), write-downs of inventories related to various shutdown and curtailment actions ($75), a net discrete income tax charge for a valuation allowance on certain deferred
tax assets ($34), and charges for separate environmental matters in both norway and italy ($15), somewhat offset by a discrete income tax charge related to a tax rate change in both brazil and spain ($79) and higher gains on various asset sales ($35).
the significant changes in the reconciling items between total segment atoi and consolidated net income (loss) attributable to alcoa for 2014 compared with 2013 consisted of:
                                          a change in the impact of lifo, mostly due to higher prices for aluminum, driven by both higher base metal prices (lme) and regional premiums (increase in price at december 31, 2014 indexed to december 31, 2013 compared to a decrease in price at december 31, 2013 indexed to december 31, 2012), and the absence of significant reductions in lifo inventory quantities, which caused a partial liquidation of the lower cost lifo inventory base in 2013 (income of $17 in 2013);
                                                     an increase in interest expense, primarily the result of lower capitalized interest ($28) and fees paid associated with the execution and termination of a 364-day senior unsecured bridge term loan facility related to the then-planned acquisition of firth rixson ($8), partially offset by a 3% lower average debt level and lower amortization of debt-related costs due to the conversion of convertible notes;
                                                     a change in noncontrolling interests, due to the change in the results of awac, mainly driven by restructuring and other charges associated with both the permanent shutdown of the point henry smelter in australia and the divestiture of an ownership interest in a mining and refining joint venture in jamaica and a discrete income tax charge related to a tax rate change in both brazil and spain ($32
   an increase in corporate expense, mostly related to costs associated with the acquisition of firth rixson ($34), partially offset by decreases in various expenses;
                     an increase in restructuring and other charges, principally caused by higher costs related to decisions to permanently shut down and/or temporarily curtail refinery, smelter and/or rolling mill capacity and a net loss on the divestiture of four operations, partially offset by the absence of a charge for a legal matter ($322); and
   a change in other, largely attributable to the absence of a discrete income tax charge for valuation allowances on certain deferred tax assets in spain and the united states ($372), slightly offset by a discrete income tax charge related to a tax rate change in both brazil and spain ($79).

liquidity and capital resources alcoa maintains a disciplined approach to cash management and strengthening of its balance sheet. in 2015, as has been the focus since 2008, management initiated actions to significantly improve alcoas cost structure and liquidity, providing the company with the ability to operate effectively. such actions include procurement efficiencies and overhead rationalization to reduce costs, working capital initiatives to yield significant cash improvements, and maintaining a sustainable level of capital expenditures. in 2016, this approach will continue with the ultimate goal of generating cash from operations that exceeds capital expenditures.
along with the foregoing actions, cash provided from operations and financing activities is expected to be adequate to cover alcoas operational and business needs over the next 12 months. for an analysis of long-term liquidity, see contractual obligations and off-balance sheet arrangements below.
at december 31, 2015, cash and cash equivalents of alcoa were $1,919, of which $1,107 was held outside the united states. alcoa has a number of commitments and obligations related to the companys growth strategy in foreign jurisdictions, resulting in the need for cash outside the united states. as such, management does not have a current expectation of repatriating cash held in foreign jurisdictions.
cash from operations cash provided from operations in 2015 was $1,582 compared with $1,674 in 2014. the decrease of $92, or 5%, was due to a negative change in noncurrent assets of $328, lower operating results (net (loss) income plus net add-back for noncash transactions in earnings) and a negative change in noncurrent liabilities of $18, mostly offset by a positive change associated with working capital of $572 and lower pension contributions of $31.
the components of the positive change in working capital were as follows:
   a positive change of $291 in inventories, largely attributable to the absence of inventory build related to the ramp-up of automotive production at the davenport, ia plant and customer requirements related to smelters that have been curtailed or shut down;
   a positive change of $14 in accrued expenses, mainly caused by a smaller payment to the united states government due to the resolution of a legal matter (see below); and
on april 8, 2015, alcoas majority-owned subsidiary, alcoa of australia limited (aofa), which is part of awac, secured a new 12-year gas supply agreement to power its three alumina refineries in western australia beginning in july 2020. this agreement was conditional on the completion of a third-party acquisition of the related energy assets from the then-current owner, which occurred in june 2015. the terms of aofas gas supply agreement require a prepayment of $500 to be made in two installments. the first installment of $300 was made at the time of the completion of the third-party acquisition and the second installment of $200 will be made in april 2016 (previously was scheduled in january 2016).
cash provided from operations in 2014 was $1,674 compared with $1,578 in 2013. the increase of $96, or 6%, was due to higher operating results (net income plus net add-back for noncash transactions in earnings) and a positive change in noncurrent assets of $114, mostly offset by a negative change associated with working capital of $620, a negative change in noncurrent liabilities of $138, and higher pension contributions of $39.
the components of the negative change in working capital were as follows:
                                                     an unfavorable change of $33 in accrued expenses, mainly caused by $139 in higher payments for layoff and other exit costs associated with restructuring actions and an $88 payment to the united states government due to the resolution of a legal matter (see below), partially offset by the absence of $148 (109) in payments to the italian government related to a november 2009
european commission decision on electricity pricing for certain energy-intensive industries; and
   a positive change of $50 in taxes, including income taxes, mostly driven by higher pretax income.
the higher pension contributions of $39 were principally driven by special termination benefits of $86 for employees affected by the 2013 shutdown of capacity at a smelter in canada.
on august 8, 2014, the highway and transportation funding act (hatfa) was signed into law by the united states government. hatfa, in part, provides temporary relief for employers who sponsor defined benefit pension plans related to funding contributions under the employee retirement income security act of 1974. specifically, hatfa modifies the interest rates that had been set in 2012 by the moving ahead for progress in the 21st century act. this relief had an immediate impact on the calculation of the then remaining funding contributions in 2014, resulting in a reduction of $100 in minimum required pension funding.
in 2014, alcoa world alumina llc, a majority-owned subsidiary of alcoa, and alcoa inc. paid a combined $88 to the united states government due to the resolution of a legal matter. additionally, another $74 was paid in 2015 and will be paid in each of the three subsequent years, 2016 (paid in january 2016) through 2018.
financing activities cash used for financing activities was $441 in 2015 compared with cash provided from financing activities of $2,250 in 2014 and cash used for financing activities of $679 in 2013.
the use of cash in 2015 was principally the result of $2,030 in payments on debt, mostly related to the repayment of borrowings under certain revolving credit facilities (see below) and the repayment of convertible notes assumed in conjunction with the acquisition of rti (see below); $223 in dividends paid to shareholders; and $104 in net cash paid to the noncontrolling interest in awac, alumina limited. these items were mostly offset by $1,901 in additions to debt, virtually all of which was the result of borrowings under certain revolving credit facilities (see below).
the source of cash in 2014 was mostly driven by $2,878 in additions to debt, virtually all of which was the result of $1,238 in net proceeds from the issuance of new senior debt securities used for the acquisition of firth rixson (see below) and $1,640 in borrowings under certain revolving credit facilities (see below); net proceeds of $1,211 from the issuance of mandatory convertible preferred stock related to the aforementioned acquisition; and $150 in proceeds from employee exercises of 17.3 million stock options at a weighted average exercise price of $8.70 (not in millions). these items were somewhat offset by $1,723 in payments on debt, mostly related to $1,640 for the repayment of borrowings under certain revolving credit facilities (see below), and $161 in dividends paid to shareholders.
the use of cash in 2013 was primarily due to $2,317 in payments on debt, mainly related to $1,850 for the repayment of borrowings under certain credit facilities (see below), a $422 early repayment of 6.00% notes due july 2013, and $27 for previous borrowings on the loans supporting the estreito hydroelectric power project in brazil; $132 in dividends paid to shareholders; and net cash paid to noncontrolling interests of $97, most of which relates to alumina limiteds share of awac. these items were partially offset by $1,852 in additions to debt, virtually all of which was the result of borrowings under certain credit facilities (see below).
in july 2015, through the acquisition of rti (see engineered products and solutions in segment information above), alcoa assumed the obligation to repay two tranches of convertible debt; one tranche was due and settled in cash on december 1, 2015 (principal amount of $115) and the other tranche is due october 15, 2019 (principal amount of $403), unless earlier converted or purchased by alcoa at the holders option upon a fundamental change. upon conversion of the 2019 convertible notes in accordance with their terms, holders will receive, at alcoas election, cash,
shares of common stock (up to 27,990,966 shares), or a combination of cash and shares. on the maturity date, each holder of outstanding notes will be entitled to receive on such date $1,000 (not in millions) in cash for each $1,000 (not in millions) in principal amount of notes, together with accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the maturity date.
on july 25, 2014, alcoa entered into a five-year revolving credit agreement (the credit agreement) with a syndicate of lenders and issuers named therein. the credit agreement provides a $4,000 senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the credit facility), the proceeds of which are to be used to provide working capital or for other general corporate purposes of alcoa. subject to the terms and conditions of the credit agreement, alcoa may from time to time request increases in lender commitments under the credit facility, not to exceed $500 in aggregate principal amount, and may also request the issuance of letters of credit, subject to a letter of credit sublimit of $1,000 under the credit facility.
the credit facility was scheduled to mature on july 25, 2019; however, on july 7, 2015, alcoa received approval for a one-year extension of the maturity date by the lenders and issuers that support the credit facility. as such, the credit facility now matures on july 25, 2020, unless extended or earlier terminated in accordance with the provisions of the credit agreement. alcoa may make one additional one-year extension request during the remaining term of the credit facility, subject to the lender consent requirements set forth in the credit agreement. under the provisions of the credit agreement, alcoa will pay a fee of 0.25% (based on alcoas long-term debt ratings as of december 31, 2015) of the total commitment per annum to maintain the credit facility.
the credit facility is unsecured and amounts payable under it will rank pari passu with all other unsecured, unsubordinated indebtedness of alcoa. borrowings under the credit facility may be denominated in u.s. dollars or euros. loans will bear interest at a base rate or a rate equal to libor, plus, in each case, an applicable margin based on the credit ratings of alcoas outstanding senior unsecured long-term debt. the applicable margin on base rate loans and libor loans will be 0.50% and 1.50% per annum, respectively, based on alcoas long-term debt ratings as of december 31, 2015. loans may be prepaid without premium or penalty, subject to customary breakage costs.
the credit agreement replaces alcoas five-year revolving credit agreement, dated as of july 25, 2011 (the former credit agreement), which was scheduled to mature on july 25, 2017. the former credit agreement, which had a total capacity of $3,750 and was undrawn, was terminated effective july 25, 2014.
the credit agreement includes covenants substantially similar to those in the former credit agreement, including, among others, (a) a leverage ratio, (b) limitations on alcoas ability to incur liens securing indebtedness for borrowed money, (c) limitations on alcoas ability to consummate a merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of its assets, and (d) limitations on alcoas ability to change the nature of its business. as of december 31, 2015, alcoa was in compliance with all such covenants.
the obligation of alcoa to pay amounts outstanding under the credit facility may be accelerated upon the occurrence of an event of default as defined in the credit agreement. such events of default include, among others, (a) alcoas failure to pay the principal of, or interest on, borrowings under the credit facility, (b) any representation or warranty of alcoa in the credit agreement proving to be materially false or misleading, (c) alcoas breach of any of its covenants contained in the credit agreement, and (d) the bankruptcy or insolvency of alcoa.
there were no amounts outstanding at december 31, 2015 and no amounts were borrowed during 2015 and 2014 under the credit facility. also, there were no amounts borrowed during 2014 related to the former credit agreement.
in addition to the credit agreement above, alcoa has a number of other credit agreements that provide a combined borrowing capacity of $990, as of december 31, 2015, of which $890 is due to expire in 2016 and $100 is due to expire in 2017. the purpose of any borrowings under these credit arrangements is to provide for working capital requirements and for other general corporate purposes. the covenants contained in all these arrangements are the same as the credit agreement (see above).
in 2015, 2014, and 2013, alcoa borrowed and repaid $1,890, $1,640, and $1,850, respectively, under the respective credit arrangements. the weighted-average interest rate and weighted-average days outstanding of the respective borrowings during 2015, 2014, and 2013 were 1.61%, 1.54%, and 1.57%, respectively, and 69 days, 67 days, and 213 days, respectively.
in february 2014, alcoas automatic shelf registration statement filed with the securities and exchange commission expired. on july 11, 2014, alcoa filed a new shelf registration statement, which was amended on july 25, 2014 and became effective on july 30, 2014, for up to $5,000 of securities on an unallocated basis for future issuance. as of december 31, 2015, $2,500 in securities were issued under the new shelf registration statement.
in september 2014, alcoa completed two public securities offerings under its shelf registration statement for (i) $1,250 of 25 million depositary shares, each representing a 1/10th interest in a share of alcoas 5.375% class b mandatory convertible preferred stock, series 1, par value $1 per share, liquidation preference $500 per share, and (ii) $1,250 of 5.125% notes due 2024. the net proceeds of the offerings were used to finance the cash portion of the acquisition of firth rixson (see engineered products and solutions in segment information above).
alcoas cost of borrowing and ability to access the capital markets are affected not only by market conditions but also by the short- and long-term debt ratings assigned to alcoas debt by the major credit rating agencies.
on march 9, 2015, standard and poors ratings services (s&p) affirmed the following ratings for alcoa: long-term debt at bbb- and short-term debt at a-3. additionally, s&p changed the current outlook from negative to stable. on september 28, 2015 s&p issued a statement that these ratings and outlook for alcoa were not affected by alcoas plan to separate into two publicly-traded companies.
on april 16, 2015 fitch affirmed the following ratings for alcoa: long-term debt at bb+ and short-term debt at b. additionally, fitch changed the current outlook from stable to positive. on september 30, 2015, fitch placed these ratings on ratings watch positive based on alcoas plan to separate into two publicly-traded companies.
on april 30, 2015, moodys investor service (moodys) affirmed the following ratings for alcoa; long-term debt at ba1 and short-term debt at speculative grade liquidity rating-1. additionally, moodys changed the current outlook from stable to positive. on september 28, 2015, moodys affirmed these ratings and changed the current outlook from positive to developing based on alcoas plan to separate into two publicly-traded companies. on january 21, 2016, moodys placed alcoas long-term debt rating under review and changed the current outlook from developing to rating under review, while leaving alcoas short-term debt rating unchanged.
investing activities cash used for investing activities was $1,060 in 2015 compared with $3,460 in 2014 and $1,290 in 2013.
the use of cash in 2015 was mainly due to $1,180 in capital expenditures (includes costs related to environmental control in new and expanded facilities of $141), 38% of which related to growth projects, including the aerospace expansion at the la porte, in plant, the automotive expansion at the alcoa, tn plant, the aerospace expansion (thick plate stretcher) at the davenport, ia plant, the aerospace expansion (isothermal press) at the savannah, ga plant (firth rixson), and the specialty foil expansion at the itapissuma plant in brazil; $205 (net of cash acquired) for the acquisition of tital (see engineered products and solutions in segment information above); and $134 in additions to investments, including the purchase of $70 in equities and fixed income securities held by alcoas captive insurance company and equity contributions of $29 related to the aluminum complex joint venture in saudi arabia. these items were somewhat offset by $302 in cash acquired with rti international metals (see engineered products and solutions in segment information above); $112 in proceeds from the sale of assets and businesses, composed of three land sales in australia and the united states combined and post-closing adjustments related to an ownership stake in a smelter, four rolling mills, and an ownership stake in a bauxite mine/alumina refinery divested from december 2014 through march 2015; and $40 in sales of investments, related to the sale of $21 in equities and fixed income securities held by alcoas captive insurance company and $19 in proceeds from the sale of the remaining portion of an equity investment in a china rolling mill.
the use of cash in 2014 was principally due to $2,385 (net of cash acquired) for the acquisition of firth rixson (see engineered products and solutions in segment information above); $1,219 in capital expenditures (includes costs related to environmental control in new and expanded facilities of $129), 40% of which related to growth projects, including the automotive expansions at the alcoa, tn and davenport, ia fabrication plants, the aerospace expansion at the la porte, in plant, the aluminum-lithium capacity expansion at the lafayette, in plant, and the specialty foil expansion at the itapissuma plant in brazil; and $195 in additions to investments, including equity contributions of $120 related to the aluminum complex joint venture in saudi arabia and the purchase of $49 in equities and fixed income securities held by alcoas captive insurance company. these items were slightly offset by $253 in proceeds from the sale of assets and businesses, largely attributable to the sale of an ownership stake in a bauxite mine and refinery in jamaica (see alumina in segment information above), an ownership stake in a smelter in the united states (see primary metals in segment information above), three rolling mills in spain and france combined (see global rolled products in segment information above), and a rod plant in canada (see primary metals in segment information above); and $57 in sales of investments, mostly related to $42 in combined proceeds from the sale of a mining interest in suriname and a portion of an equity investment in a china rolling mill.
the use of cash in 2013 was primarily due to $1,193 in capital expenditures (includes costs related to environmental control in new and expanded facilities of $143), 34% of which related to growth projects, including the automotive expansion at the davenport, ia fabrication plant, the aluminum-lithium capacity expansion at the lafayette, in plant, and the automotive sheet expansion at the alcoa, tn plant; and $293 in additions to investments, including equity contributions of $171 related to the aluminum complex joint venture in saudi arabia and the purchase of $54 in equities and fixed income securities held by alcoas captive insurance company. these items were slightly offset by a net change in restricted cash of $170, mostly related to the release of funds to be used for capital expenditures of the automotive expansion at the davenport, ia fabrication plant (see noncash financing and investing activities below).
noncash financing and investing activities in july 2015, alcoa purchased all outstanding shares of rti common stock in a stock-for-stock transaction valued at $870. as a result, alcoa issued 87 million shares of its common stock to consummate this transaction, which was not reflected in alcoas statement of consolidated cash flows as it represents a noncash financing activity.
in early 2014, holders of $575 principal amount of alcoas 5.25% convertible notes due march 15, 2014 (the 2014 notes) exercised their option to convert the 2014 notes into 89 million shares of alcoa common stock. the conversion rate for the 2014 notes was 155.4908 shares of alcoas common stock per $1,000 (in full dollars) principal amount of notes, equivalent to a conversion price of $6.43 per share. the difference between the $575 principal amount of the 2014 notes and the $89 par value of the issued shares increased additional capital on alcoas consolidated balance sheet. this transaction was not reflected in alcoas statement of consolidated cash flows as it represents a noncash financing activity.
in late 2014, alcoa paid $2,995 (net of cash acquired) to acquire firth rixson (see engineered products and solutions in segment information above). a portion of this consideration was paid through the issuance of 37 million shares in alcoa common stock valued at $610. the issuance of common stock was not reflected in alcoas statement of consolidated cash flows as it represents a noncash investing activity.
in august 2012, alcoa received a loan of $250 for the purpose of financing all or part of the cost of acquiring, constructing, reconstructing, and renovating certain facilities at alcoas rolling mill plant in davenport, ia. because this loan can only be used for this purpose, the net proceeds of $248 were classified as restricted cash. since restricted cash is not part of cash and cash equivalents, this transaction was not reflected in alcoas statement of consolidated cash flows as it represents a noncash activity. as funds were expended for the project, the release of the cash was reflected as both an inflow on the net change in restricted cash line and an outflow on the capital expenditures line in the investing activities section of the statement of consolidated cash flows. at december 31, 2013 and 2012, alcoa had $13 and $171, respectively, of restricted cash remaining related to this transaction. in 2014, the remaining funds were expended on the project.
contractual obligations and off-balance sheet arrangements contractual obligations. alcoa is required to make future payments under various contracts, including long-term purchase obligations, financing arrangements, and lease agreements. alcoa also has commitments to fund its pension plans, provide payments for other postretirement benefit plans, and fund capital projects. as of december 31, 2015, a summary of alcoas outstanding contractual obligations is as follows (these contractual obligations are grouped in the same manner as they are classified in the statement of consolidated cash flows in order to provide a better understanding of the nature of the obligations and to provide a basis for comparison to historical information):
total   2016                 2017-2018      2019-2020      thereafter operating activities:

obligations for operating activities energy-related purchase obligations consist primarily of electricity and natural gas contracts with expiration dates ranging from 1 year to 32 years. raw material obligations consist mostly of bauxite (relates to alcoas bauxite mine interests in guinea and brazil), caustic soda, alumina, aluminum fluoride, calcined petroleum coke, cathode blocks, and various metals with expiration dates ranging from less than 1 year to 18 years. other purchase obligations consist principally of freight for bauxite and alumina with expiration dates ranging from 1 to 16 years. many of these purchase obligations contain variable pricing components, and, as a result, actual cash payments may differ from the estimates provided in the preceding table. operating leases represent multi-year obligations for certain land and buildings, alumina refinery process control technology, plant equipment, vehicles, and computer equipment.
interest related to total debt is based on interest rates in effect as of december 31, 2015 and is calculated on debt with maturities that extend to 2042. the effect of outstanding interest rate swaps, which are accounted for as fair value hedges, was included in interest related to total debt. as of december 31, 2015, these hedges effectively convert the interest rate from fixed to floating on $200 of debt through 2018. as the contractual interest rates for certain debt and interest rate swaps are variable, actual cash payments may differ from the estimates provided in the preceding table.
estimated minimum required pension funding and postretirement benefit payments are based on actuarial estimates using current assumptions for discount rates, long-term rate of return on plan assets, rate of compensation increases, and health care cost trend rates, among others. the minimum required contributions for pension funding are estimated to be $300 for 2016, $375 for 2017, $475 for 2018, $425 for 2019, and $575 for 2020. these expected pension contributions reflect the impacts of the pension protection act of 2006; the worker, retiree, and employer recovery act of 2008; the moving ahead for progress in the 21st century act of 2012; the highway and transportation funding
act of 2014; and the bipartisan budget act of 2015. other postretirement benefit payments are expected to approximate $220 to $230 annually for years 2016 through 2020 and $195 annually for years 2021 through 2025. such payments will be slightly offset by subsidy receipts related to medicare part d, which are estimated to be approximately $15 to $20 annually for years 2016 through 2025. alcoa has determined that it is not practicable to present pension funding and other postretirement benefit payments beyond 2020 and 2025, respectively.
layoff and other restructuring payments expected to be paid within one year primarily relate to severance costs. amounts scheduled to be paid beyond one year are related to ongoing site remediation work and special layoff benefit payments.
uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken on an income tax return may result in additional payments to tax authorities. the amount in the preceding table includes interest and penalties accrued related to such positions as of december 31, 2015. the total amount of uncertain tax positions is included in the thereafter column as the company is not able to reasonably estimate the timing of potential future payments. if a tax authority agrees with the tax position taken or expected to be taken or the applicable statute of limitations expires, then additional payments will not be necessary.
obligations for financing activities total debt amounts in the preceding table represent the principal amounts of all outstanding debt, including short-term borrowings and long-term debt. maturities for long-term debt extend to 2042.
alcoa has historically paid quarterly dividends on its preferred and common stock. including dividends on preferred stock, alcoa paid $223 in dividends to shareholders during 2015. this amount includes dividends related to a new class of preferred stock issued in september 2014 (see financing activities in liquidity and capital resources above). because all dividends are subject to approval by alcoas board of directors, amounts are not included in the preceding table unless such authorization has occurred. there were $17 of preferred stock dividends approved to be paid on january 1, 2016; however, alcoa paid the dividends on december 31, 2015. as of december 31, 2015, there were 1,310,610,141 shares of outstanding common stock and 546,024 and 2,500,000 shares of outstanding class a and class b preferred stock, respectively. the annual class a and class b preferred stock dividends are at the rate of $3.75 and $26.8750 per share, respectively, and the annual common stock dividend is $0.12 per share.
obligations for investing activities capital projects in the preceding table only include amounts approved by management as of december 31, 2015. funding levels may vary in future years based on anticipated construction schedules of the projects. it is expected that significant expansion projects will be funded through various sources, including cash provided from operations. total capital expenditures are anticipated to be approximately $1,400 in 2016.
equity contributions represent alcoas committed investment related to a joint venture in saudi arabia. alcoa is a participant in a joint venture to develop a new aluminum complex in saudi arabia, comprised of a bauxite mine, alumina refinery, aluminum smelter, and rolling mill, which requires the company to contribute approximately $1,100. as of december 31, 2015, alcoa has made equity contributions of $981. based on changes to both the projects capital investment and equity and debt structure from the initial plans, the estimated $1,100 equity contribution may be reduced. the timing of the amounts included in the preceding table may vary based on changes in anticipated construction schedules of the project.
payments related to acquisitions are based on provisions in certain acquisition agreements that state additional funds are due to the seller from alcoa if the businesses acquired achieve stated financial and operational thresholds. amounts
are only presented in the preceding table if it is has been determined that payment is more likely than not to occur. in connection with the acquisition of firth rixson (see engineered products and solutions in segment information above), alcoa entered into an earn-out agreement, which states that alcoa will make earn-out payments up to an aggregate maximum amount of $150 through 2020. the amounts in the preceding table represent alcoas best estimate of when the payments may be made.
off-balance sheet arrangements. at december 31, 2015, alcoa has maximum potential future payments for guarantees issued on behalf of a third party of $478. these guarantees expire at various times between 2017 and 2024 and relate to project financing for the aluminum complex in saudi arabia. alcoa also has outstanding bank guarantees related to tax matters, outstanding debt, workers compensation, environmental obligations, energy contracts, and customs duties, among others. the total amount committed under these guarantees, which expire at various dates between 2016 and 2023 was $320 at december 31, 2015.
alcoa has outstanding letters of credit primarily related to workers compensation, energy contracts (including $200 related to an expected april 2016 prepayment under a gas supply contract), and leasing obligations. the total amount committed under these letters of credit, which automatically renew or expire at various dates, mostly in 2016, was $510 at december 31, 2015. alcoa also has outstanding surety bonds primarily related to tax matters, contract performance, workers compensation, environmental-related matters, and customs duties. the total amount committed under these bonds, which automatically renew or expire at various dates, mostly in 2016, was $159 at december 31, 2015.
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make certain judgments, estimates, and assumptions regarding uncertainties that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and disclosed in the accompanying notes. areas that require significant judgments, estimates, and assumptions include accounting for derivatives and hedging activities; environmental and litigation matters; asset retirement obligations; the testing of goodwill, equity investments, and properties, plants, and equipment for impairment; estimating fair value of businesses to be divested; pension plans and other postretirement benefits obligations; stock-based compensation; and income taxes.
management uses historical experience and all available information to make these judgments, estimates, and assumptions, and actual results may differ from those used to prepare the companys consolidated financial statements at any given time. despite these inherent limitations, management believes that managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes provide a meaningful and fair perspective of the company.
a summary of the companys significant accounting policies is included in note a to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this form 10-k. management believes that the application of these policies on a consistent basis enables the company to provide the users of the consolidated financial statements with useful and reliable information about the companys operating results and financial condition.
derivatives and hedging. derivatives are held for purposes other than trading and are part of a formally documented risk management program. for derivatives designated as fair value hedges, alcoa measures hedge effectiveness by formally assessing, at least quarterly, the historical high correlation of changes in the fair value of the hedged item and the derivative hedging instrument. for derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, alcoa measures hedge effectiveness by formally assessing, at least quarterly, the probable high correlation of the expected future cash flows of the hedged item and the derivative hedging instrument. the ineffective portions of both types of hedges are recorded in sales or other income or expense in the current period. if the hedging relationship ceases to be highly effective or it becomes probable that an expected transaction will no longer occur, future gains or losses on the derivative instrument are recorded in other income or expense.
alcoa accounts for interest rate swaps related to its existing long-term debt and hedges of firm customer commitments for aluminum as fair value hedges. as a result, the fair values of the derivatives and changes in the fair values of the
underlying hedged items are reported in other current and noncurrent assets and liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet. changes in the fair values of these derivatives and underlying hedged items generally offset and are recorded each period in sales or interest expense, consistent with the underlying hedged item.
alcoa accounts for hedges of foreign currency exposures and certain forecasted transactions as cash flow hedges. the fair values of the derivatives are recorded in other current and noncurrent assets and liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet. the effective portions of the changes in the fair values of these derivatives are recorded in other comprehensive income and are reclassified to sales, cost of goods sold, or other income or expense in the period in which earnings are impacted by the hedged items or in the period that the transaction no longer qualifies as a cash flow hedge. these contracts cover the same periods as known or expected exposures, generally not exceeding five years.
cash flows from derivatives are recognized in the statement of consolidated cash flows in a manner consistent with the underlying transactions.
environmental matters. expenditures for current operations are expensed or capitalized, as appropriate. expenditures relating to existing conditions caused by past operations, which will not contribute to future revenues, are expensed. liabilities are recorded when remediation costs are probable and can be reasonably estimated. the liability may include costs such as site investigations, consultant fees, feasibility studies, outside contractors, and monitoring expenses. estimates are generally not discounted or reduced by potential claims for recovery. claims for recovery are recognized as agreements are reached with third parties. the estimates also include costs related to other potentially responsible parties to the extent that alcoa has reason to believe such parties will not fully pay their proportionate share. the liability is continuously reviewed and adjusted to reflect current remediation progress, prospective estimates of required activity, and other factors that may be relevant, including changes in technology or regulations.
litigation matters. for asserted claims and assessments, liabilities are recorded when an unfavorable outcome of a matter is deemed to be probable and the loss is reasonably estimable. management determines the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome based on many factors such as the nature of the matter, available defenses and case strategy, progress of the matter, views and opinions of legal counsel and other advisors, applicability and success of appeals processes, and the outcome of similar historical matters, among others. once an unfavorable outcome is deemed probable, management weighs the probability of estimated losses, and the most reasonable loss estimate is recorded. if an unfavorable outcome of a matter is deemed to be reasonably possible, then the matter is disclosed and no liability is recorded. with respect to unasserted claims or assessments, management must first determine that the probability that an assertion will be made is likely, then, a determination as to the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to reasonably estimate the potential loss is made. legal matters are reviewed on a continuous basis to determine if there has been a change in managements judgment regarding the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome or the estimate of a potential loss.
asset retirement obligations. alcoa recognizes asset retirement obligations (aros) related to legal obligations associated with the normal operation of alcoas bauxite mining, alumina refining, and aluminum smelting facilities. these aros consist primarily of costs associated with spent pot lining disposal, closure of bauxite residue areas, mine reclamation, and landfill closure. alcoa also recognizes aros for any significant lease restoration obligation, if required by a lease agreement, and for the disposal of regulated waste materials related to the demolition of certain power facilities. the fair values of these aros are recorded on a discounted basis, at the time the obligation is incurred, and accreted over time for the change in present value. additionally, alcoa capitalizes asset retirement costs by increasing the carrying amount of the related long-lived assets and depreciating these assets over their remaining useful life.
certain conditional asset retirement obligations (caros) related to alumina refineries, aluminum smelters, and fabrication facilities have not been recorded in the consolidated financial statements due to uncertainties surrounding the ultimate settlement date. a caro is a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and/or method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within alcoas control. such
goodwill. goodwill is not amortized; instead, it is reviewed for impairment annually (in the fourth quarter) or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist or if a decision is made to sell or exit a business. a significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an indicator of impairment has occurred. such indicators may include deterioration in general economic conditions, negative developments in equity and credit markets, adverse changes in the markets in which an entity operates, increases in input costs that have a negative effect on earnings and cash flows, or a trend of negative or declining cash flows over multiple periods, among others. the fair value that could be realized in an actual transaction may differ from that used to evaluate the impairment of goodwill.
goodwill is allocated among and evaluated for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment. alcoa has ten reporting units, of which four are included in the engineered products and solutions segment and three are included in the transportation and construction solutions segment. the remaining three reporting units are the alumina segment, the primary metals segment (all goodwill was impaired in 2013see below), and the global rolled products segment. more than 70% of alcoas total goodwill is allocated to two reporting units as follows: alcoa fastening systems and rings (afsr) ($2,232) and alcoa power and propulsion (app) ($1,695) businesses, both of which are included in the engineered products and solutions segment. these amounts include an allocation of corporates goodwill.
in november 2014, alcoa acquired firth rixson (see engineered products and solutions in segment information under results of operations above), and, as a result recognized $1,801 in goodwill. this amount was allocated between the afsr and alcoa forgings and extrusion reporting units, which is part of the engineered products and solutions segment. in march and july 2015, alcoa acquired tital and rti, respectively, (see engineered products and solutions in segment information under results of operations above) and recognized $118 and $240, respectively, in goodwill. the goodwill amount related to tital was allocated to the app reporting unit and the amount related to rti was allocated to alcoa titanium and engineered products, a new alcoa reporting unit that consists solely of the acquired rti business and is part of the engineered products and solutions segment.
in reviewing goodwill for impairment, an entity has the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not (greater than 50%) that the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. if an entity elects to perform a qualitative assessment and determines that an impairment is more likely than not, the entity is then required to perform the existing two-step quantitative impairment test (described below), otherwise no further analysis is required. an entity also may elect not to perform the qualitative assessment and, instead, proceed directly to the two-step quantitative impairment test. the ultimate outcome of the goodwill impairment review for a reporting unit should be the same whether an entity chooses to perform the qualitative assessment or proceeds directly to the two-step quantitative impairment test.
alcoas policy for its annual review of goodwill is to perform the qualitative assessment for all reporting units not subjected directly to the two-step quantitative impairment test. generally, management will proceed directly to the two-step quantitative impairment test for two to three reporting units (based on facts and circumstances) during each annual review of goodwill. this policy will result in each of the nine reporting units with goodwill being subjected to the two-step quantitative impairment test at least once during every three-year period.
under the qualitative assessment, various events and circumstances (or factors) that would affect the estimated fair value of a reporting unit are identified (similar to impairment indicators above). these factors are then classified by the
type of impact they would have on the estimated fair value using positive, neutral, and adverse categories based on current business conditions. additionally, an assessment of the level of impact that a particular factor would have on the estimated fair value is determined using high, medium, and low weighting. furthermore, management considers the results of the most recent two-step quantitative impairment test completed for a reporting unit and compares the weighted average cost of capital (wacc) between the current and prior years for each reporting unit.
during the 2015 annual review of goodwill, management performed the qualitative assessment for seven reporting units, the alumina segment, the four reporting units in the engineered products and solutions segment, including afsr and app, and two reporting units in the transportation and construction solutions segment. management concluded that it was not more likely than not that the estimated fair values of the seven reporting units were less than their carrying values. as such, no further analysis was required.
under the two-step quantitative impairment test, the evaluation of impairment involves comparing the current fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. alcoa uses a discounted cash flow (dcf) model to estimate the current fair value of its reporting units when testing for impairment, as management believes forecasted cash flows are the best indicator of such fair value. a number of significant assumptions and estimates are involved in the application of the dcf model to forecast operating cash flows, including markets and market share, sales volumes and prices, production costs, tax rates, capital spending, discount rate, and working capital changes. most of these assumptions vary significantly among the reporting units. cash flow forecasts are generally based on approved business unit operating plans for the early years and historical relationships in later years. the betas used in calculating the individual reporting units wacc rate are estimated for each business with the assistance of valuation experts.
in the event the estimated fair value of a reporting unit per the dcf model is less than the carrying value, additional analysis would be required. the additional analysis would compare the carrying amount of the reporting units goodwill with the implied fair value of that goodwill, which may involve the use of valuation experts. the implied fair value of goodwill is the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the fair value amounts assigned to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit as if the reporting unit was acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit represented the purchase price. if the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, an impairment loss equal to such excess would be recognized, which could significantly and adversely impact reported results of operations and shareholders equity.
during the 2015 annual review of goodwill, management proceeded directly to the two-step quantitative impairment test for two reporting units as follows: global rolled products segment and the soft alloys extrusion business in brazil (hereafter sae), which is included in the transportation and construction solutions segment. the estimated fair value of the global rolled products segment was substantially in excess of its respective carrying value, resulting in no impairment. for sae, the estimated fair value as determined by the dcf model was lower than the associated carrying value. as a result, management performed the second step of the impairment analysis in order to determine the implied fair value of the sae reporting units goodwill. the results of the second-step analysis showed that the implied fair value of the goodwill was zero. therefore, in the fourth quarter of 2015, alcoa recorded a goodwill impairment of $25. the impairment of the sae goodwill resulted from headwinds from the recent downturn in the brazilian economy and the continued erosion of gross margin despite the execution of cost reduction strategies. as a result of the goodwill impairment, there is no goodwill remaining for the sae reporting unit.
goodwill impairment tests in prior years indicated that goodwill was not impaired for any of the companys reporting units, except for the primary metals segment in 2013 (see below), and there were no triggering events since that time that necessitated an impairment test.
in 2013, for primary metals, the estimated fair value as determined by the dcf model was lower than the associated carrying value. as a result, management performed the second step of the impairment analysis in order to determine the implied fair value of primary metals goodwill. the results of the second-step analysis showed that the implied fair value of goodwill was zero. therefore, in the fourth quarter of 2013, alcoa recorded a goodwill impairment of $1,731 ($1,719 after noncontrolling interest). as a result of the goodwill impairment, there is no goodwill remaining for the primary metals reporting unit.
the impairment of primary metals goodwill resulted from several causes: the prolonged economic downturn; a disconnect between industry fundamentals and pricing that has resulted in lower metal prices; and the increased cost of alumina, a key raw material, resulting from expansion of the alumina price index throughout the industry. all of these factors, exacerbated by increases in discount rates, continue to place significant downward pressure on metal prices and operating margins, and the resulting estimated fair value, of the primary metals business. as a result, management decreased the near-term and long-term estimates of the operating results and cash flows utilized in assessing primary metals goodwill for impairment. the valuation of goodwill for the second step of the goodwill impairment analysis is considered a level 3 fair value measurement, which means that the valuation of the assets and liabilities reflect managements own judgments regarding the assumptions market participants would use in determining the fair value of the assets and liabilities.
equity investments. alcoa invests in a number of privately-held companies, primarily through joint ventures and consortia, which are accounted for on the equity method. the equity method is applied in situations where alcoa has the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, over the investee. management reviews equity investments for impairment whenever certain indicators are present suggesting that the carrying value of an investment is not recoverable. this analysis requires a significant amount of judgment from management to identify events or circumstances indicating that an equity investment is impaired. the following items are examples of impairment indicators: significant, sustained declines in an investees revenue, earnings, and cash flow trends; adverse market conditions of the investees industry or geographic area; the investees ability to continue operations measured by several items, including liquidity; and other factors. once an impairment indicator is identified, management uses considerable judgment to determine if the impairment is other than temporary, in which case the equity investment is written down to its estimated fair value. an impairment that is other than temporary could significantly and adversely impact reported results of operations.
properties, plants, and equipment. properties, plants, and equipment are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets (asset group) may not be recoverable. recoverability of assets is determined by comparing the estimated undiscounted net cash flows of the operations related to the assets (asset group) to their carrying amount. an impairment loss would be recognized when the carrying amount of the assets (asset group) exceeds the estimated undiscounted net cash flows. the amount of the impairment loss to be recorded is calculated as the excess of the carrying value of the assets (asset group) over their fair value, with fair value determined using the best information available, which generally is a dcf model. the determination of what constitutes an asset group, the associated estimated undiscounted net cash flows, and the estimated useful lives of assets also require significant judgments.
discontinued operations and assets held for sale. the fair values of all businesses to be divested are estimated using accepted valuation techniques such as a dcf model, valuations performed by third parties, earnings multiples, or indicative bids, when available. a number of significant estimates and assumptions are involved in the application of these techniques, including the forecasting of markets and market share, sales volumes and prices, costs and expenses, and multiple other factors. management considers historical experience and all available information at the time the estimates are made; however, the fair value that is ultimately realized upon the divestiture of a business may differ from the estimated fair value reflected in the consolidated financial statements.
pension and other postretirement benefits. liabilities and expenses for pension and other postretirement benefits are determined using actuarial methodologies and incorporate significant assumptions, including the interest rate used to discount the future estimated liability, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, and several assumptions relating to the employee workforce (salary increases, health care cost trend rates, retirement age, and mortality).
the interest rate used to discount future estimated liabilities is determined using a company-specific yield curve model (above-median) developed with the assistance of an external actuary. the cash flows of the plans projected benefit obligations are discounted using a single equivalent rate derived from yields on high quality corporate bonds, which represent a broad diversification of issuers in various sectors, including finance and banking, consumer products, transportation, insurance, and pharmaceutical, among others. the yield curve model parallels the plans projected cash flows, which have an average duration of 10 years, and the underlying cash flows of the bonds included in the model
exceed the cash flows needed to satisfy the companys plans obligations multiple times. in 2015, 2014, and 2013, the discount rate used to determine benefit obligations for u.s. pension and other postretirement benefit plans was 4.29%, 4.00%, and 4.80%, respectively. the impact on the liabilities of a change in the discount rate of 1/4 of 1% would be approximately $430 and either a charge or credit of approximately $15 to after-tax earnings in the following year.
in conjunction with the annual measurement of the funded status of alcoas pension and other postretirement benefit plans at december 31, 2015, management elected to change the manner in which the interest cost component of net periodic benefit cost will be determined in 2016 and beyond. previously, the interest cost component was determined by multiplying the single equivalent rate described above and the aggregate discounted cash flows of the plans projected benefit obligations. under the new methodology, the interest cost component will be determined by aggregating the product of the discounted cash flows of the plans projected benefit obligations for each year and an individual spot rate (referred to as the spot rate approach). this change will result in a lower interest cost component of net periodic benefit cost under the new methodology compared to the previous methodology of approximately $100 ($65 after-tax) in 2016. management believes this new methodology, which represents a change in an accounting estimate, is a better measure of the interest cost as each years cash flows are specifically linked to the interest rates of bond payments in the same respective year.
the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is generally applied to a five-year market-related value of plan assets (a four-year average or the fair value at the plan measurement date is used for certain non-u.s. plans). the process used by management to develop this assumption is one that relies on a combination of historical asset return information and forward-looking returns by asset class. as it relates to historical asset return information, management focuses on the annual, 10-year moving, and 20-year moving averages when developing this assumption. management also incorporates expected future returns on current and planned asset allocations using information from various external investment managers and consultants, as well as managements own judgment.
for 2015, 2014, and 2013, management used 7.75%, 8.00%, and 8.50% as its expected long-term rate of return, which was based on the prevailing and planned strategic asset allocations, as well as estimates of future returns by asset class. these rates fell within the respective range of the 20-year moving average of actual performance and the expected future return developed by asset class. in 2015, the decrease of 25 basis points in the expected long-term rate of return was due to a decrease in the 20-year moving average of actual performance. for 2016, management anticipates that 7.75% will be the expected long-term rate of return.
during 2014, an independent u.s. organization that publishes standard mortality rates based on statistical analysis and studies issued updated mortality tables. the rates within these standard tables are used by actuaries as one of the many assumptions when measuring a companys projected benefit obligation for pension and other postretirement benefit plans. the funded status of all of alcoas pension and other postretirement benefit plans are measured as of december 31 each calendar year. during the measurement process at the end of 2014, alcoa, with the assistance of an external actuary, considered the rates in the new mortality tables, along with specific data related to alcoas retiree population, to develop the mortality-related assumptions used to measure the benefit obligation of various u.s. benefit plans. as a result, alcoa recognized a charge of approximately $100 ($65 after-tax) in other comprehensive loss related to the updated mortality assumptions.
in 2015, a net charge of $10 (after-tax and noncontrolling interest) was recorded in other comprehensive loss, primarily due to the unfavorable performance of the plan assets, which was mostly offset by the amortization of actuarial losses and a 30 basis point increase in the discount rate. in 2014, a net charge of $69 (after-tax and noncontrolling interest) was recorded in other comprehensive loss, primarily due to an 80 basis point decrease in the discount rate and a change in the mortality assumption (see above), which was mostly offset by the favorable performance of the plan assets and the amortization of actuarial losses. in 2013, a net benefit of $531 (after-tax and noncontrolling interest) was recorded in other comprehensive loss, primarily due to a 65 basis point increase in the discount rate and the amortization of actuarial losses.
stock-based compensation. alcoa recognizes compensation expense for employee equity grants using the non-substantive vesting period approach, in which the expense (net of estimated forfeitures) is recognized ratably over the requisite service period based on the grant date fair value. the fair value of new stock options is estimated on the date of grant using a lattice-pricing model. determining the fair value of stock options at the grant date requires judgment, including estimates for the average risk-free interest rate, dividend yield, volatility, and exercise behavior. these assumptions may differ significantly between grant dates because of changes in the actual results of these inputs that occur over time.
as part of alcoas stock-based compensation plan design, individuals who are retirement-eligible have a six-month requisite service period in the year of grant. as a result, a larger portion of expense will be recognized in the first half of each year for these retirement-eligible employees. compensation expense recorded in 2015, 2014, and 2013 was $92 ($61 after-tax), $87 ($58 after-tax), and $71 ($48 after-tax), respectively. of these amounts, $17, $15, and $14 in 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively, pertains to the acceleration of expense related to retirement-eligible employees.
income taxes. the provision for income taxes is determined using the asset and liability approach of accounting for income taxes. under this approach, the provision for income taxes represents income taxes paid or payable (or received or receivable) for the current year plus the change in deferred taxes during the year. deferred taxes represent the future tax consequences expected to occur when the reported amounts of assets and liabilities are recovered or paid, and result from differences between the financial and tax bases of alcoas assets and liabilities and are adjusted for changes in tax rates and tax laws when enacted.
valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not (greater than 50%) that a tax benefit will not be realized. in evaluating the need for a valuation allowance, management considers all potential sources of taxable income, including income available in carryback periods, future reversals of taxable temporary differences, projections of taxable income, and income from tax planning strategies, as well as all available positive and negative evidence. positive evidence includes factors such as a history of profitable operations, projections of future profitability within the carryforward period, including from tax planning strategies, and alcoas experience with similar operations. existing favorable contracts and the ability to sell products into established markets are additional positive evidence. negative evidence includes items such as cumulative losses, projections of future losses, or carryforward periods that are not long enough to allow for the utilization of a deferred tax asset based on existing projections of income. deferred tax assets for which no valuation allowance is recorded may not be realized upon changes in facts and circumstances, resulting in a future charge to establish a valuation allowance. existing valuation allowances are re-examined under the same standards of positive and negative evidence. if it is determined that it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will be realized, the appropriate amount of the valuation allowance, if any, is released. deferred tax assets and liabilities are also re-measured to reflect changes in underlying tax rates due to law changes and the granting and lapse of tax holidays.
in 2013, alcoa recognized a $372 discrete income tax charge for valuation allowances on certain deferred tax assets in spain and the united states. of this amount, a $237 valuation allowance was established on the full value of the deferred tax assets related to a spanish consolidated tax group. these deferred tax assets have an expiration period ranging from 2016 (for certain credits) to an unlimited life (for operating losses). after weighing all available positive and negative evidence, as described above, management determined that it was no longer more likely than not that alcoa will realize the tax benefit of these deferred tax assets. this was mainly driven by a decline in the outlook of the primary metals business (2013 realized prices were the lowest since 2009) combined with prior year cumulative losses of the spanish consolidated tax group. during 2014, the underlying value of the deferred tax assets decreased due to a remeasurement as a result of the enactment of new tax rates in spain beginning in 2015 (see income taxes in earnings summary under results of operations above), the sale of a member of the spanish consolidated tax group, and a change in foreign currency exchange rates. as a result, the valuation allowance decreased by the same amount. at december 31, 2015, the amount of the valuation allowance was $149. this valuation allowance was reevaluated as of december 31, 2015, and no change to the allowance was deemed necessary based on all available evidence. the need
the remaining $135 recognized in 2013 relates to a valuation allowance established on a portion of available foreign tax credits in the united states. these credits can be carried forward for 10 years, and have an expiration period ranging from 2016 to 2023 as of december 31, 2013 (2016 to 2025 as of december 31, 2015). after weighing all available positive and negative evidence, as described above, management determined that it was no longer more likely than not that alcoa will realize the full tax benefit of these foreign tax credits. this was primarily due to lower foreign sourced taxable income after consideration of tax planning strategies and after the inclusion of earnings from foreign subsidiaries projected to be distributable as taxable foreign dividends. this valuation allowance was reevaluated as of december 31, 2015, and due to reductions in foreign sourced taxable income, a $134 discrete income tax charge was recognized. additionally, $15 of foreign tax credits expired at the end of 2015 resulting in a corresponding decrease to the valuation allowance. at december 31, 2015, the amount of the valuation allowance was $254. the need for this valuation allowance will be assessed on a continuous basis in future periods and, as a result, an increase or decrease to this allowance may result based on changes in facts and circumstances.
in 2015, alcoa recognized an additional $141 discrete income tax charge for valuation allowances on certain deferred tax assets in iceland and suriname. of this amount, an $85 valuation allowance was established on the full value of the deferred tax assets in suriname, which were related mostly to employee benefits and tax loss carryforwards. these deferred tax assets have an expiration period ranging from 2016 to 2022. the remaining $56 charge relates to a valuation allowance established on a portion of the deferred tax assets recorded in iceland. these deferred tax assets have an expiration period ranging from 2017 to 2023. after weighing all available positive and negative evidence, as described above, management determined that it was no longer more likely than not that alcoa will realize the tax benefit of either of these deferred tax assets. this was mainly driven by a decline in the outlook of the primary metals business, combined with prior year cumulative losses and a short expiration period. the need for this valuation allowance will be assessed on a continuous basis in future periods and, as a result, a portion or all of the allowance may be reversed based on changes in facts and circumstances.
tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return are recorded when such benefits meet a more likely than not threshold. otherwise, these tax benefits are recorded when a tax position has been effectively settled, which means that the statute of limitation has expired or the appropriate taxing authority has completed their examination even though the statute of limitations remains open. interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions are recognized as part of the provision for income taxes and are accrued beginning in the period that such interest and penalties would be applicable under relevant tax law until such time that the related tax benefits are recognized.
related party transactions alcoa buys products from and sells products to various related companies, consisting of entities in which alcoa retains a 50% or less equity interest, at negotiated prices between the two parties. these transactions were not material to the financial position or results of operations of alcoa for all periods presented.

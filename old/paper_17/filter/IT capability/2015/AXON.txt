item 1a. risk factors because of the following factors, as well as other variables affecting our operating results, our past financial performance may not be a reliable indicator of our future performance and historical trends should not be used to anticipate our results or trends in future periods.
a substantial number of law enforcement and corrections agencies may not continue to purchase our cews or video products. law enforcement and corrections agencies may be influenced by claims or perceptions that cews, such as our products, are unsafe or may be used in an abusive manner. sales of our products to these agencies may be delayed or limited by these claims or perceptions.
in the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, we derived our revenues predominantly from sales of taser cew brand devices and related cartridges, and expect to depend on sales of these products for the foreseeable future. we are seeing a large number of customers upgrade their devices to the x2 or the new x26p device, which we introduced in 2011 and 2013, respectively. this is a trend we expect to continue. a decrease in the prices of, or demand for these products, or their failure to maintain broad market acceptance, would significantly harm our growth prospects, operating results and financial condition.
the success of our evidence.com software as a service ("saas") delivery model is materially dependent on acceptance of this business model by our law enforcement customers. delayed or lengthy time to adoption by law enforcement agencies will negatively impact our sales and profitability.
a substantial number of law enforcement agencies may be slow to adopt our evidence.com digital data evidence management and storage solution, requiring extended periods of trial and evaluation. the hosted service delivery business model is not presently widely adopted by our law enforcement customer base. as such, the sales cycle has additional complexity with the need to educate our customers and address issues regarding agency bandwidth requirements, data retention policies, data security and chain of evidence custody. delays in successfully securing widespread adoption of evidence.com services could adversely affect our revenues, profitability and financial condition.
our future success will depend on our ability to develop new products or new product features that achieve market acceptance in a timely and cost-effective manner. the development of new products and new product features is complex, time consuming and expensive, and we may experience delays in completing the development and introduction of new products. we cannot provide any assurance that products that we may develop in the future will achieve market acceptance. if we fail to develop new products or new product features on a timely basis that achieve market acceptance, our business, financial results and competitive position could be adversely affected.
we face risks associated with rapid technological change and new competing products.
the technology associated with law enforcement devices is receiving significant attention and is rapidly evolving. while we have some patent protection in certain key areas of our cew, axon and saas technology, it is possible that new technology may result in competing products that operate outside our patents and could present significant competition for our products which could adversely affect our revenue.
complex components and assemblies used in our products may contain undetected defects that are subsequently discovered at any point in the life of the product. defects in our products may result in a loss of sales, delay in market acceptance and damage to our reputation and increased warranty costs, which could have a material adverse effect on profitability and financial condition.
if our security measures are breached and unauthorized access is obtained to customers' data or our data, our network, data centers and service may be perceived as not being secure, customers may curtail or stop using our service and we may incur significant legal and financial exposure and liabilities.
our service involves the storage and transmission of customers' proprietary information, and security breaches could expose us to a risk of loss of this information, litigation and possible liability. we devote significant resources to engineer secure products and ensure security vulnerabilities are mitigated. despite these efforts, security measures may be breached as a result of third-party action, employee error, and malfeasance or otherwise. breaches could occur during transfer of data to data centers or at any time, and result in unauthorized access to our data or our customers' data. third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or customers into disclosing sensitive information such as user names, passwords or other information in order to gain access to our data or our customers' data. additionally, hackers may develop and deploy viruses, worms, and other malicious software programs that attack or gain access to our networks and data centers. because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, or to sabotage systems, change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. any security breach could result in a loss of confidence in the security of our service, damage our reputation, lead to legal liability and negatively impact our future sales.
interruptions or delays in service from our third-party cloud storage providers for our evidence.com service, or the loss or corruption of digitally stored evidence, would impair the delivery of our service and harm our business.
we currently serve our evidence.com customers from third-party cloud storage providers based in the u.s. and other countries. interruptions in our service, or loss or corruption of digital evidence, may reduce our revenue, cause us to issue credits or pay penalties, cause customers to terminate their subscriptions and adversely affect our renewal rates and our ability to attract new customers. our business will also be harmed if our customers and potential customers believe our service is unreliable.
most of our end-user customers are subject to budgetary and political constraints that may delay or prevent sales.
most of our end-user customers are government agencies. these agencies often do not set their own budgets and therefore, have limited control over the amount of money they can spend. in addition, these agencies experience political pressure that may dictate the manner in which they spend money. as a result, even if an agency wants to acquire our products, it may be unable to purchase them due to budgetary or political constraints, particularly in challenging economic environments. there can be no assurance that the economic and budgeting issues will not worsen and adversely impact sales of our products. some government agency orders may also be canceled or substantially delayed due to budgetary, political or other scheduling delays which frequently occur in connection with the acquisition of products by such agencies and such cancellations may accelerate or be more severe than we have experienced historically.
generally, law enforcement and corrections agencies consider a wide range of issues before committing to purchase our products, including product benefits, training costs, the cost to use our products in addition to, or in place of, other products, budget constraints and product reliability, safety and efficacy. the length of our sales cycle may range from a few weeks to as long as several years. adverse publicity surrounding our products or the safety of such products has in the past, and could in the future, lengthen our sales cycle with customers. in the past, we believe that the company's sales were adversely impacted by negative publicity surrounding our products or the use of our products. we may incur substantial selling costs and expend significant effort in connection with the evaluation of our products by potential customers before they place an order. if these potential customers do not purchase our products, we will have expended significant resources and received no revenue in return.
although taser has entered into contracts for the delivery of products and services in the future and anticipates the contracts will be completed, if agencies do not appropriate money in future year budgets, or if other cancellation clauses are invoked, revenue associated with these bookings will not ultimately be recognized, and will result in a reduction to bookings.
changes in civil forfeiture laws may affect our customers' ability to purchase our products some of our customers use funds seized through civil forfeiture proceedings to fund the purchase of our products.  changes in state legislatures could impact our customers' ability to seize funds or use seized funds to fund purchases.  changes in civil forfeiture statutes or regulations are outside of our control and could limit the amount of funds available to our customers which could adversely affect the sale of our products.
our saas product revenue is generally recognized ratably over the terms of the contracts, which generally range from one to five years. as a result, most of the saas revenue we report each quarter is the result of agreements entered into during previous quarters. consequently, current positive or negative trends in this portion of our business are not fully reflected in our revenue results for several periods.
utilizing and administering multiple cloud-based storage providers can mean duplication of efforts and resources, increased cost structure, and organization complexities. these complexities and additional costs could adversely affect our business, financial condition or operating results.
we may face personal injury, wrongful death and other liability claims that harm our reputation and adversely affect our sales and financial condition.
our cew products are often used in aggressive confrontations that may result in serious, permanent bodily injury or death to those involved. our cew products may be associated with these injuries. a person, or the family members of a person, injured in a confrontation or otherwise in connection with the use of our products may bring legal action against us to recover damages on the basis of theories including wrongful death, personal injury, negligent design, defective product or inadequate warning. we are currently subject to a number of such lawsuits and we have recently been subject to significant adverse judgments and settlements. we may also be subject to lawsuits involving allegations of misuse of our products. if successful, wrongful death, personal injury, misuse and other claims could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition and could result in negative publicity about our products. although we carry product liability insurance, we do incur significant legal expenses within our self-insured retention in defending these lawsuits and significant litigation could also result in a diversion of management's attention and resources, negative publicity and a potential award of monetary damages in excess of our insurance coverage. the outcome of any litigation is inherently uncertain and there can be no assurance that our existing or any future litigation will not have a material adverse effect on our revenues, our financial condition or financial results.
other litigation may subject us to significant litigation costs and judgments and divert management attention from our business.
we have been or could be in the future involved in numerous other litigation matters relating to our products, contracts and business relationships, including litigation against persons who we believe have infringed on our intellectual property, infringement litigation filed against the company, litigation against a competitor and litigation filed by a former distributor against the company. such matters have resulted, and are expected to continue to result in, substantial costs to us, judgments, settlements and some diversion of our management's attention, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition or operating results. there is also a risk of adverse judgments, as the outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain.
if we are unable to protect our intellectual property, we may lose our competitive advantage or incur substantial litigation costs to protect our rights. we may be subject to intellectual property infringement claims, which could cause us to incur litigation costs and divert management attention from our business.
our future success depends upon our proprietary technology. our protective measures, including patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secret protection, and internet identity registrations, may prove inadequate to protect our proprietary rights and market advantage. the right to stop others from misusing our trademarks and service marks in commerce depends, to some extent, on our ability to show evidence of enforcement of our rights against such misuse in commerce. our efforts to stop improper use, if insufficient, may lead to loss of trademark and service mark rights, brand loyalty and notoriety among our customers and prospective customers. the scope of any patent to which we have or may obtain rights to may not prevent others from developing and selling competing products. the validity and breadth of claims covered in technology patents involve complex legal and factual questions, and the resolution of such claims may be highly uncertain, lengthy and expensive. in addition, our patents may be held invalid upon challenge, or others may claim rights in or ownership of our patents. moreover, we are subject to litigation with parties that claim, among other matters, that we infringed their patents or other intellectual property rights. the defense and
prosecution of patent and other intellectual property claims are both costly and time consuming and could result in a material adverse effect on our business and financial position. the company was served with a first amended complaint filed by digital ally in the federal district court for the district of kansas alleging that the company's signal technology infringes their patents.  the company believes this litigation is frivolous and the company will vigorously defend this litigation.
also, any intellectual property infringement claims against us, with or without merit, could be costly and time-consuming to defend and divert our management's attention from our business. if our products were found to infringe a third party's proprietary rights, we could be forced to enter into costly royalty or licensing agreements in order to be able to sell our products or discontinue use of the protected technology. such royalty and licensing agreements may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all. there is no guarantee that our use of conventional technology searching and brand clearance searching will identify all potential rights holders. rights holders may demand payment for past infringements and/or force us to accept costly license terms or discontinue use of protected technology and/or works of authorship that may include, for example, photos, videos, and software. our current research and development focus on developing software-based products increases this risk.
our u.s. patents protect us from imported infringing products coming into the u.s. from abroad. we have made applications for patents in a few foreign countries; however, these may be inadequate to protect markets for our products in other foreign countries. each foreign patent is examined and granted according to the law of the country where it was filed independent of whether a u.s. patent on similar technology was granted. a patent in a foreign country may be subject to cancellation if the claimed invention has not been sold in that country. meeting the requirements of working invention differs by country and ranges from sales in the country to manufacturing in the country. u.s. export law, or the laws of some foreign countries, may prohibit us from satisfying the requirements for working the invention, creating a risk that some of our foreign patents may become unenforceable.
we rely on the opinions of the bureau of alcohol, tobacco and firearms, including the determination that a device that has projectiles propelled by the release of compressed gas in place of the expanding gases from ignited gunpowder, are not classified as firearms. changes in statutes, regulations, and interpretation outside of our control may result in our products being classified or reclassified as firearms. our private citizen market could be substantially reduced if consumers are required to obtain a registration to own a firearm prior to purchasing our products.
federal regulation of sales in the u.s.: with the exception of the taser xrep, our cews are not firearms regulated by the u.s. bureau of alcohol, tobacco, firearms and explosives, but our consumer products are regulated by the u.s. consumer product safety commission. although there are currently no federal laws restricting sales of our core cew products in the u.s., future federal regulation could adversely affect sales of our products.
federal regulation of international sales: our cew devices are considered a "crime control" product by the u.s. department of commerce ("doc") for export directly from the u.s. consequently, we must obtain an export license from the doc for the export of our cew devices from the u.s. other than to canada. in addition, certain of our camera and software products require classifications from the doc before they may be shipped internationally. our inability to obtain doc export licenses or classifications on a timely basis for sales of our products to our international customers could significantly and adversely affect our international sales.
state and local regulation: our devices are controlled, restricted or their use prohibited by a number of state and local governments. our devices are banned from private citizen purchase or use by statute in five states: hawaii, massachusetts, new jersey, new york, and rhode island as well as in the district of columbia. some cities and municipalities also prohibit private citizen possession or use of our products. other jurisdictions may ban or restrict the sale of our products and our product sales may be significantly affected by additional state, county and city governmental regulation.
foreign regulation: certain foreign jurisdictions prohibit, restrict, or require a permit for the importation, sale, possession or use of cews, including in some countries by law enforcement agencies, limiting our international sales opportunities.
we face unique regulatory and political challenges presented by international markets.
•   risks associated with the foreign corrupt practices act and local anti-bribery law compliance;
•   political changes and economic crises may lead to changes in the business environment in which we operate;
•   local distributors of our products may not comply with existing laws and regulations;
environmental laws and regulations subject us to a number of risks and could result in significant liabilities and costs.
we are subject to various state, federal and international laws and regulations governing the environment, including restricting the presence of certain substances in our products and making producers for those products financially responsible for the collection, treatment, recycling and disposal. environmental legislation within the european union ("eu") may increase our cost of doing business internationally and impact our revenues from eu countries as we comply with and implement these requirements.
the eu has published directives on the restriction of certain hazardous substances in electronic and electrical equipment (the "rohs directive") and on electronic and electrical waste management (the "weee directive"). the rohs directive restricts the use of a number of substances, including lead. the weee directive directs members of the eu to enact laws, regulations, and administrative provisions to ensure that producers of electric and electronic equipment are financially responsible for the collection, recycling, treatment and environmentally responsible disposal of certain products sold into the eu. in addition, similar environmental legislation has been or may be enacted in other jurisdictions, including the u.s. (under federal and state laws) and other countries, the cumulative impact of which could be significant.
we continue to monitor the impact of specific registration and compliance activities required by the rohs and weee directives. we endeavor to comply with applicable environmental laws, yet compliance with such laws could increase our operations and product costs, increase the complexities of product design, procurement, and manufacturing, limit our ability to manage excess and obsolete non-compliant inventory, limit our sales activities, and impact our future financial results. any violation of these laws can subject us to significant liability, including fines, penalties, and prohibiting sales of our products into one or more states or countries, and result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition.
regulations related to voice, data and communications services may impact our ability to sell our products.
the radio spectrum is required to provide wireless voice, data and video communications services. the allocation of spectrum is regulated in the u.s. and other countries and limited spectrum space is allocated to wireless services and specifically to public safety users. in the u.s., the federal communications commission ("fcc") regulates spectrum use by non-federal entities and federal entities, respectively. similarly, countries around the world have one or more regulatory bodies that define and implement the rules for use of radio spectrum and electromagnetic interference, pursuant to their respective national laws. we manufacture and market products in spectrum bands already made available by regulatory bodies. consequently, our results could be positively or negatively affected by the rules and regulations adopted from time to time by the fcc or regulatory agencies in other countries. regulatory changes in current spectrum bands may also provide opportunities or may require modifications to some of our products so they can continue to be manufactured and marketed. if current products do not comply with the regulations set forth by these governing bodies, we may be unable to sell our products or could incur penalties, which could have an adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
regulations related to conflict minerals may force us to incur additional expenses, may make our supply chain more complex and may result in damage to our reputation with customers.
the u.s. securities and exchange commission ("sec") has enacted disclosure requirements for companies that use certain minerals and metals, known as "conflict minerals," in their products, whether or not these products are manufactured by third parties. these requirements require companies to perform due diligence, disclose and report whether or not such minerals originate from the democratic republic of congo and adjoining countries. we have incurred and will likely continue to incur costs to comply with the disclosure requirements, including costs related to determining the source of any of the relevant minerals and metals used in our products. in addition, these new requirements could adversely affect the sourcing, availability and pricing of minerals used in our products. because our supply chain is complex, we may not be able to sufficiently verify the origins for these minerals and metals used in our products through the due diligence procedures that we implement, which may harm our reputation. in such an event, we may also face difficulties in satisfying customers who require that all of the components of our products are certified as conflict-free.
we depend on certain domestic and foreign suppliers for the delivery of components used in the assembly of our products. our reliance on third-party suppliers creates risks related to our potential inability to obtain an adequate supply of components or sub-assemblies and reduced control over pricing and timing of delivery of components and sub-assemblies. specifically, we depend on suppliers of sub-assemblies, machined parts, injection molded plastic parts, printed circuit boards, custom wire fabrications and other miscellaneous customer parts for our products. we do not have long-term agreements with any of our suppliers and there is no guarantee that supply will not be interrupted. due to changes imposed for imports of foreign products into the u.s., as well as potential port closures and delays created by terrorist attacks or threats, public health issues, national disasters or work stoppages, we are exposed to risk of delays caused by freight carriers or customs clearance issues for our imported parts. any interruption of supply for any material components of our products could significantly delay the shipment of our products and have a material adverse effect on our revenues, profitability and financial condition.
component shortages could result in our inability to produce at a volume to adequately meet customer demand, which could result in a loss of sales, delay in deliveries and injury to our reputation.
single or sole-source components used in the manufacture of our products may become unavailable or discontinued. delays caused by industry allocations or obsolescence may take weeks or months to resolve. in some cases, parts obsolescence may require a product re-design to ensure quality replacement components. these delays could cause significant delays in manufacturing and loss of sales, leading to adverse effects significantly impacting our financial condition or results of operations and injure our reputation.
we may experience a decline in gross margins due to rising raw material and transportation costs associated with a future increase in petroleum prices.
a significant number of our raw materials are comprised of petroleum-based products, or incur some form of landed cost associated with transporting the raw materials or components to our facility. a significant rise in oil prices could adversely impact our ability to sustain current gross margins by increasing component pricing.
to the extent demand for our products increases, our future success will be dependent upon our ability to manage our growth and to increase manufacturing production capacity, which may be accomplished by the implementation of customized manufacturing automation equipment.
to the extent demand for our products increases significantly in future periods, one of our key challenges will be to increase our production capacity to meet sales demand while maintaining product quality. our primary strategies to accomplish this include introducing additional shifts, increasing the physical size of our assembly facilities, the hiring of additional production staff, and the implementation of additional customized automation equipment. the investments we make in this equipment may not yield the anticipated labor and material efficiencies. our inability to meet any future increase in sales demand or effectively manage our expansion could have a material adverse effect on our revenues, financial results and financial condition.
our future success is dependent on our ability to expand sales through distributors and direct sales and our inability to recruit new distributors or increase direct sales would negatively affect our sales.
our distribution strategy is to pursue sales through multiple channels with an emphasis on independent distributors and direct sales. our inability to establish relationships with and retain law enforcement equipment distributors, who we believe can successfully sell our products, would adversely affect our sales. in addition, our arrangements with our distributors are generally short-term. we are also focusing on direct sales to larger agencies through our regional sales managers and our inability to grow sales to these agencies in this manner could adversely affect our sales. if we do not competitively price our products, meet the requirements of our distributors or end-users, provide adequate marketing support, or comply with the terms of our distribution arrangements, our distributors may fail to aggressively market our products or may terminate their relationships with us. these developments would likely have a material adverse effect on our sales. our reliance on the sales of our products by others also makes it more difficult to predict our revenues, cash flow and operating results.
the increased focus on direct sales compared to sales through distribution is dependent on our ability to sell into the states or foreign jurisdictions that have established distributor relationships.
in certain states and foreign jurisdictions we have decided to pursue sales directly with law enforcement customers, rather than working through established distribution channels. our customers may have strong working relationships with distributors and we may face resistance to this change. if we do not overcome this resistance and effectively build a direct relationship with our customers, sales may be adversely affected.
acquisitions and joint ventures may have an adverse effect on our business.
we may consider additional acquisitions or joint ventures as part of our long-term business strategy. these transactions involve significant challenges and risks including that the transaction does not advance our business strategy, that we don't realize a satisfactory return on our investment, or that we experience difficulty in the integration or coordination of new employees, business systems, and technology, or there is a diversion of management's attention from our other businesses. these events could harm our operating results, financial condition or cash flows.
if our goodwill or finite-lived intangible assets become impaired, we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings.
we review our finite-lived intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable, such as a decline in stock price and market capitalization. we test goodwill for impairment at least annually. if such goodwill or finite-lived intangible assets are deemed to be impaired, an impairment loss equal to the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the assets would be recognized. we may be required to record a significant charge in our financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill or finite-lived intangible assets is determined, which would negatively affect our results of operations.
a disruption or failure of our systems or operations in the event of a major earthquake, weather event, fire, explosion, failure to contain hazardous materials, industrial accident, cyber-attack, terrorist attack, or other catastrophic event could cause delays in completing sales, providing services, or performing other mission-critical functions. a catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our critical business or information technology systems could harm our ability to conduct normal business operations and our operating results as well as expose us to claims, litigation and governmental investigations and fines.
our revenues and operating results have varied significantly in the past and may vary significantly in the future due to various factors, including, but not limited to:
•   the outcome of any existing or future litigation;
•   adverse publicity surrounding our products, the safety of our products, or the use of our products;
•   regulatory changes that may affect the marketability of our products.
the company's financial performance is subject to risks associated with changes in the value of the u.s. dollar versus local currencies.
for current and potential foreign customers whose contracts are denominated in u.s. dollars, the relative change in currency values creates fluctuations in our product pricing. these changes in foreign end-user costs may result in lost orders and reduce the competitiveness of our products in certain foreign markets.
for non-u.s. dollar denominated sales, weakening of foreign currencies relative to the u.s. dollar generally leads us to raise international pricing, potentially reducing demand for our products. should we decide not to raise local prices to fully offset the dollar's strengthening, or at all, the u.s. dollar value of our foreign currency denominated sales and earnings would be adversely affected. we do not currently engage in hedging activities. fluctuations in foreign currency could result in a change in the u.s. dollar value of our foreign denominated assets and liabilities including accounts receivable. therefore, the u.s. dollar equivalent collected on a given sale could be less than the amount invoiced causing the sale to be less profitable than contemplated.
unanticipated changes in our effective tax rate and additional tax liabilities may impact our operating results we are subject to income taxes in the united states and various jurisdictions outside of the united states. our effective tax rate could fluctuate due to changes in the mix of earnings and losses in countries with differing statutory tax rates. our tax expense could also be impacted by changes in non-deductible expenses, changes in excess tax benefits related to exercises and vesting of stock-based expense, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and our ability to utilize them and the applicability of withholding taxes.
we are subject to tax examinations in multiple jurisdictions. while we regularly evaluate new information that may change our judgment resulting in recognition, derecognition or change in measurement of a tax position taken, there can be no assurance that the final determination of any examinations will not have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial position.
our tax provision could also be impacted by changes in federal, state or international tax laws including fundamental tax law changes applicable to corporate multinationals currently being considered by many countries including the united states as well as several european countries.
additionally, we may be subject to additional tax liabilities due to changes in non-income taxes resulting from changes in federal, state or international tax laws, changes in taxing jurisdictions' administrative interpretations, decisions, policies, and positions, results of tax examinations, settlements or judicial decisions, changes in accounting principles, changes to the business operations, including acquisitions, as well as the evaluation of new information that results in a change to a tax position taken in a prior period.
we maintain most of our cash balances, some of which are not insured, at three depository institutions.
we maintain most of our cash accounts at three depository institutions. as of december 31, 2015, our aggregate balances in such accounts were $57.1 million. the company's balances with these institutions regularly exceed federal deposit insurance corporation ("fdic") insured limits for domestic deposits and various deposit insurance programs covering our deposits in the netherlands, the united kingdom and germany.
we could suffer losses with respect to the uninsured balances if the depositary institutions failed and the institution's assets were insufficient to cover its deposits and/or the governments did not take actions to support deposits in excess of existing insurance limits. any such losses could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.
we depend on our ability to attract and retain our key management, sales and technical personnel.
our success depends upon the continued service of our key management personnel. our success also depends on our ability to continue to attract, retain and motivate qualified technical personnel. although we have employment agreements with certain of our officers, the employment of such persons is "at-will" and either we or the employee can terminate the employment relationship at any time, subject to the applicable terms of the employment agreements. the competition for our key employees is intense. the loss of the service of one or more of our key personnel could harm our business.
risks related to ownership of our common stock the trading price of our common stock has been, and is likely to continue to be, volatile. in addition to the factors discussed in this annual report on form 10-k, the trading price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control, including:
•   actions of securities analysts who initiate or maintain coverage of us, changes in financial estimates by any securities analysts who follow our company, or our failure to meet these estimates or the expectations of investors;
•   investor sentiment with respect to our competitors, our business partners, and our industry in general;
•   announcements by us or our competitors of significant products or features, technical innovations, acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, or capital commitments;
•   changes in operation performance and stock market valuations of technology companies in our industries, including our developers and competitors;
•   lawsuits threatened or filed against us;
•   developments in anticipated or new legislation and pending lawsuits or regulator actions, including interim or final rulings by tax, judicial or regulatory bodies; and
item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ("md&a") is designed to provide a reader of our consolidated financial statements with a narrative from the perspective of our management on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and certain other factors that may affect our future results. our md&a should be read in conjunction with the other sections of this annual report on form 10-k, including part i, item 1a: "risk factors"; part ii, item 6: "selected financial data"; and part ii, item 8: "financial statements and supplementary data." the various sections of this md&a contain a number of forward-looking statements, all of which are based on our current expectations and could be affected by the uncertainties and risk factors described throughout this filing. the tables in the md&a sections below are derived from exact numbers and may have immaterial rounding differences.
executive overview and key strategic initiatives our central mission is to make the world a safer place by creating technologies which reduce violence. the best way to understand our business strategy is to understand our three strategic missions.
1. protect life (safer weapons). throughout history, the weapon technology used by individuals to protect themselves have caused death and destruction to another person. we believe this is because the only technologies capable of incapacitating a person to stop a threat have relied on the infliction of death or serious injury. our taser conducted electrical weapons ("cews") are one of the few weapons which can truly incapacitate a person without requiring death or serious injury. dating back to the origins of our technology in the late 1960's, we have created and continue to lead this market space world-wide. over the past few decades, the taser cew has become one of the most frequently used weapons in the north american law enforcement market, with injuries and deaths dropping dramatically as a result. today, we are seeing accelerating adoption in other markets around the world.
2. protect truth (wearable cameras and software). we believe, with strong scientific support, that the presence of video recordings in incidents involving conflict can dramatically reduce the frequency of severity of such events by both documenting, and altering the behavior of the persons involved. studies have shown that police officers wearing video camera devices receive up to 90% fewer complaints, and are involved in approximately 60% fewer violent incidents involving the use of force. our axon platform is the market leading solution for wearable cameras with a robust software system for storing, managing, and sharing the related video data. while we are proud of our axon cameras and believe they are the best cameras in the law enforcement marketplace, we invested heavily to create an integrated hardware-software ecosystem specifically for public safety. those investments appear to have been very well placed as bookings in the axon business exceeded $135.1 million in 2015, growing at 136.7% over 2014. as of the date of this annual report on form 10-k, 30 of the 60 major cities in the united states are now using our axon digital evidence platform.
3. empower heroes (cloud-mobile-wearable ecosystem). every society depends upon a professional class of public safety professionals charged with protecting the general public from threats of all kinds, including from those who would break the law and victimize others. with our taser weapons and axon platform, we have created relationships with over 20,000 public safety agencies around the world. we have come to develop a deep organizational understanding of the challenges and opportunities in this market space. one key insight is that law enforcement agencies around the world are significantly "behind the curve" when it comes to technology. many agencies still rely largely on paper based reporting systems and have limited access to modern mobile smart phone technology. some of our customers report that police officers are spending over 60% of their time on paperwork related tasks, rather than on value-add public safety work. internet enabled platforms that connect end users direct to technology providers have dramatically changed industry after industry. these internet enabled businesses offer accelerated speed of technology innovation, reduced cost of implementation and distribution to the end customer, and network effects enabling easy collaboration and information sharing. we are building out our axon platform with body cameras and video management, which are driving rapid growth and market penetration today. however, the real opportunity is to leverage this connected platform to enable a broad suite of mobile, wearable, and data management capabilities to bring modern information technology capabilities to every law enforcement officer. with our axon platform, and the evidence.com service, we have built the first and largest cloud-hosted platform in the public safety space. we will leverage this platform to roll out additional capabilities, both hardware and software, to empower the heroic men and women of public safety to be more efficient, more effective, and have access to the best information available. there is a deep synergy across our product and service offerings and strategies. for example, the public scrutiny around the usage of taser devices provides a compelling reason to deploy body cameras, which they require massive amounts of storage and video management capability which is best achieved through a cloud-hosted system such as our evidence.com service. in fact, the los angeles police department recently announced plans to deploy taser devices, axon cameras, and evidence.com to all front line officers as an integrated suite of capabilities.
execution of our mission from an investor point of view, there are two distinct business segments at different levels of maturity. our taser weapons business is a mature, profitable, and cash generating business with a moderate growth rate. by comparison, our axon platform business is a nascent software as a service (saas) business which is currently growing recorded bookings at greater than 100% annually, is not yet profitable, and has very different accounting treatment for revenue, which are generally recognized over a longer time horizon such as a five-year service contract. by comparison, most taser weapons revenues are generally recognized when shipped and accepted by the customer.
for these reasons, and to help investors and analysts understand the dynamics and progress in both business segments, we publish separate profit and loss tables for both the taser weapons and the axon segments. the taser segment is our "protect life" strategy driven segment. the axon segment is driven by our "protect truth" and "empower heroes" strategies to enable body cameras and video storage and sharing today, growing to a full suite of connected technologies and capabilities going forward.
technological innovation is the foundation for our long-term growth and we intend to maintain our commitment to the research and development of our technology for both new and existing products that further our mission. at the same time we have established industry leading training services to provide our users a comprehensive overview of legal, policy, medical and risk mitigation issues relating to our products and the use of force. we have built a network of distribution channels for selling and marketing our products and services to law enforcement agencies, primarily in north america, with ongoing focus and effort placed on expanding these programs in international, military and other markets. over 17,000 law enforcement agencies in nearly 150 countries have made initial purchases of our taser brand devices for testing or deployment. to date, we do not know of any significant sales of any competing cew products, but acknowledge the continued emergence of competition within the on-officer camera, digital evidence management and related technology market.
our key strategic initiatives include: continue investment in development of innovative new products, which both compliment and add to our existing platforms. our research and development efforts in 2015 were primarily focused on refining our evidence.com services and exploring next generation hardware for our taser weapons and axon segments.we believe that the video evidence capture and management market will continue to grow significantly due to several factors, including increasing recognition of the benefits and value of video evidence and other mobile technologies. in 2016, we expect to devote significant resources towards both the development of the next revenue generating product for our axon segment, and additional functionality for our existing saas. we aim to work closely with our customers to develop new value added features to our existing platform that are necessary to optimize their workflows, as well as develop adjacent technologies in wearables, cloud, and mobile devices.
internationally, there is a very significant portion of the market where officers do not carry cews or wear on-officer cameras. we believe there is substantial opportunity for more widespread adoption of cews and axon products in foreign countries. in recent years, we have seen international markets become increasingly attractive and we seek to maintain that trend as we demonstrate the benefits of large-scale adoptions of our cews and axon products, using countries such as the united kingdom and australia as benchmarks of successful programs. we have also decided to make focused investments in targeted countries such as france, the united kingdom, canada and australia as we see considerable opportunity for increased sales in those regions. because the sales cycle to sell into a new international market can be as long or longer than 18 to 24 months, it is important that we continue to develop our pipeline in terms of both the number and size of opportunities.
in the u.s., our focus is on driving deeper penetration into law enforcement agencies that do not have a cew or on-officer camera on every officer, and to upgrade officers using one of our legacy products to our next generation smart weapons. our strategy is to create a dominant market position in domestic law enforcement and internationally over time.
in the axon segment, our focus is on increasing bookings and brand awareness for evidence.com and axon cameras. we have expanded our axon sales team from 16 at the end of 2014 to 27 full-time salespeople at the end of 2015. we expect the additional salesforce to generate increased bookings in 2016. in addition, during 2016, we expect to continue our concerted efforts to promote the awareness of the benefits of digital evidence management in general, and evidence.com specifically, throughout the law enforcement community. we expect additional efforts will encompass tech summits, sponsorships, tradeshows, interaction with trade associations (such as the international association of chiefs of police), and other promotional activities.included in our strategy to demonstrate the benefits of evidence.com, we have optional test and evaluation periods of the product on-site with customers. we experienced increasing volumes of trial programs in 2015 and believe these trial programs area great way for our customers to see the powerful capabilities, benefits and compelling value proposition of our technology. we anticipate further increases in these trial programs in 2016, ultimately leading to increased sales. as market acceptance grows, we anticipate fewer and/or shorter trial programs will be necessary to capture sales.
additionally, our focus is on maintaining incremental sales channels by continuing to develop purchasing programs that position the company to own municipality budget lines and become the ongoing technology provider for our customers in order to drive sales growth and allow our customers to keep up with the latest technology while minimizing large upfront purchases. we focus on minimizing attrition rates by providing world class products and services that provide the value necessary to ensure customers continue to renew their contracts. we remain committed to developing our presence in federal government and military markets. we intend to continue to place emphasis on supporting our military customers through our team of professionals with extensive military, homeland defense and law enforcement experience. the primary focus of this team is to support military use for our existing hardware as well as increase technology development through contracted support.continued application for patents and intellectual property rights, both in the u.s. and internationally, to protect key technology in our products and further attempt to protect and maintain our competitive position.continued aggressive litigation defense to protect our brand equity. we maintain a team of world class medical experts and internal legal resources to provide an efficient means of defending the company against product liability claims.

the increase in net sales for 2015 compared to 2014 in the taser weapons segment was primarily driven by increased adoption of the taser x26p and x2 smart weapons, as customers upgrade their legacy cews to the new models. the company has also introduced upgrade programs to incentivize agencies to replace older cews with the company's new smart weapons. in the axon segment, the increase in net sales was driven by the continued adoption of the axon on-officer cameras and evidence.com application in the law enforcement markets. international customers continued to be a steady contributor to the results with $36.1 million in 2015 versus $32.3 million in 2014, an increase of 11.7%.
to gain more immediate feedback regarding activity for axon products and evidence.com services, we also review bookings for these products. we consider bookings to be a statistical measure defined as the sales contract value (not invoiced sales), net of cancellations, placed in the relevant fiscal period, regardless of when the products or services ultimately will be provided. some bookings will be invoiced in subsequent years. due to municipal government funding rules, certain of the future year amounts included in bookings are subject to budget appropriation or other contract cancellation clauses. although taser has entered into contracts for the delivery of products and services in the future and anticipates the contracts will be completed, if agencies do not appropriate money in future year budgets or enact a cancellation clause, revenue associated with these bookings will not ultimately be recognized, resulting in a future reduction to bookings. bookings related to evidence.com and the axon product line increased to $135.1 million during 2015, compared to $57.1 million in 2014, an increase of 136.7%.
net unit sales for the taser weapons products and axon segment products are as follows:

during the fourth quarter of 2015, the company publicly announced the introduction of its next generation on-officer camera, the axon body 2. this introduction led to an increase in bookings for the quarter ended december 31, 2015 as compared to september 30, 2015, as many agencies placed orders for the new model, but this adversely impacted recognized revenues, as many agencies opted to order body 2 instead of the original axon body and axon flex units. axon body 2 first became available for shipping during the first quarter of 2016, so a large portion of bookings recorded during the fourth quarter of 2015 did not lead to sales recognized during the quarter. sales of axon body 2 will be recognized as units ship starting in 2016.
net unit sales for the taser weapons products and axon segment products are as follows:

the increase in net sales for 2014 compared to 2013 in the taser weapons segment was primarily driven by the introduction of the taser x26p smart weapon. growing demand is seen in the taser weapons segment as customers are upgrading their legacy cews to the new taser x2 and x26p smart weapons. in the axon segment, the increase in net sales was driven by the continued adoption of the axon on-officer cameras and evidence.com application in the law enforcement markets. international customers contributed to overall growth with sales of $32.3 million in 2014 versus $22.2 million in 2013, an increase of 45.5%.
cost of products sold and services delivered was $69.2 million and $63.0 million for the years ended december 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, an increase of $6.3 million or 10.0%. as a percentage of net sales, cost of products sold and services delivered decreased to 35.0% in 2015 compared to 38.3% in 2014. within the taser weapons segment, cost of products sold increased $1.1 million, or 2.4%, to $48.8 million in 2015, compared to $47.7 million in 2014, and decreased as a percent of sales to 30.1% from 32.7%. the overall increase in cost of products sold is attributable to higher unit sales, and the decrease of cost as a percentage of sales is primarily attributable to higher average selling prices and increased leverage of fixed operating costs.
within the axon segment, cost of products sold and services delivered were $20.4 million, an increase of $5.1 million, or 33.5% from 2014. as a percentage of net sales, cost of products sold and services delivered decreased to 57.5% in 2015 from
80.9% in 2014. the increase in cost of products sold and services delivered was driven by growing sales in this segment, increased data storage costs as more agencies utilize evidence.com, as well as growth in the newly established professional services team. the decrease in cost of products sold and services delivered as a percentage of sales was driven by higher sales and by improvements to our evidence.com saas margins. there are a number of fixed costs for the axon segment which, as we generate additional revenue in the business, we expect to remain relatively stable and should allow for lower cost of services delivered as a percentage of service revenue.
cost of products sold and services delivered was $63.0 million and $52.0 million for the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, an increase of $11.0 million or 21.1%. as a percentage of net sales, cost of products sold and services delivered increased to 38.3% in 2014 from 37.7% in 2013. within the taser weapons segment, cost of products sold increased $3.7 million, or 8.3%, to $47.7 million in 2014, compared to $44.0 million in 2013, but decreased as a percent of sales to 32.7% from 34.5%. the net decrease in cost of products sold as a percent of sales primarily reflects increased leverage due to higher sales and a higher average selling prices.
within the axon segment, cost of products sold and services delivered were $15.3 million, an increase of $7.3 million, or 92.1% from 2013. the increase was driven by growing sales in this segment, increased data storage costs as more agencies utilize evidence.com, as well as the introduction of a professional services team. these increases were partially offset by the full depreciation of the capitalized evidence.com software development costs as of june 30, 2013. the increase in overall cost of products sold and services delivered as a percentage of sales was driven by higher product sales. as a percentage of net sales, cost of products sold and services delivered increased slightly to 80.9% in 2014 from 76.9% in 2013.
gross margin increased $15.7 million to $101.5 million for 2014 compared to $85.8 million for 2013. as a percentage of net sales, gross margin decreased slightly to 61.7% for 2014 compared to 62.3% for 2013. the decrease is primarily attributable to sales mix and continued growth in the axon segment. as a percentage of net sales, gross margin for the taser weapons segment was 67.3% and 65.5% for 2014 and 2013, respectively, while the same measure for these years for the axon segment were 19.1% and 23.1%, respectively. the overall increase in margins was negatively impacted by higher inventory reserves taken towards the end of 2014 as compared to 2013 related primarily to the reserve for the x26 cew that was discontinued as of december 31, 2014. the company also accrued approximately $1.1 million of inventory losses related to products it may not be able to use in production of certain axon camera products.

within the taser weapons segment, sg&a increased $4.7 million, or 10.8%, to $47.6 million from $43.0 million in 2014. salaries, benefits, bonus and stock-based compensation in the taser weapons increased approximately $2.8 million in 2015
compared to 2014. this increase was primarily attributable to the company's efforts to build out international and direct sales teams internally as well as increasing headcount in certain administrative departments to support the overall growth of the entity. on a consolidated basis, legal, professional and accounting expenses were up $0.9 million in 2015 compared to 2014, and most of this increase was allocated to the weapons segment. audit and tax compliance costs were up approximately $0.7 million due primarily to increased complexity in the business structure as well as overall growth of the company. also included in the increase in legal fees was $0.2 million of costs to secure new patents and trademarks. the increase in sales and marketing was primarily attributable to increased efforts at the 2015 international association of chiefs of police in 2015 as compared to 2014. the company incurred higher consulting and lobbying expense during 2015 as compared to 2014 increase $1.8 million to $4.2 million in 2015. the company also engaged additional international sales consultants during 2015 to drive increased sales in targeted foreign markets. offsetting these increases was a decrease to other expenses. the decrease in other is primarily the result of a litigation settlement in 2014 of $3.3 million as compared to settlements of $0.2 million in 2015.
within the axon segment, sg&a increased $10.9 million, or 97.5%, to $22.1 million in 2015 in comparison to the prior year. salaries, benefits, bonus and stock-based compensation in the axon segment increased $4.8 million as the company continues to hire additional engineering, product management personnel, sales and marketing personnel and general support staff to further expand upon existing product offerings as well as the development of new mobile and cloud technologies. the company remains committed to launching new product lines to solidify its competitive advantage in these emerging technologies. sales and marketing expenses in the axon segment also increased approximately $2.1 million in comparison to 2014 due primarily to increased commissions on higher sales and increased marketing efforts for axon technologies. the increase in consulting and lobbying was due to the axon branding campaign that took place in the third quarter of 2015 as well as increased lobbying and public relations efforts ahead of the iacp conference held in october 2015. the increase in the balance of other expenses of $1.2 million during the 2015 as compared 2014 was related to building expenses, including depreciation and amortization, and supplies. of this amount $0.7 million related to depreciation and amortization of assets acquired in two business combinations affected during 2015.
the company expects to see increases in sg&a in 2016 compared to 2015 as it plans to make additional investments in customer-facing positions both domestically and internationally along with increased investments in sales and marketing.
of the increase in sg&a above, there was increased expense associated with customer-facing positions, including: salaries, benefits, bonus and stock-based compensation, as well as sales commissions, which are included in the sales and marketing line item in the table above. positions were added throughout the year, with the following customer-facing headcount as of the end of each year:
(i) in certain international markets where the company does not have a legal entity, it generally engages sales managers as consultants. these expenses are reflected in the consulting and lobbying line within selling, general and administrative expenses.

within the taser weapons segment, sg&a increased $2.8 million, or 7.0%, to $43.0 million from $40.2 million in 2013. salaries, benefits, bonus and stock-based compensation in the taser weapons increased approximately $2.1 million in 2014 compared to 2013 partially due to increased international, telesales, and support sales staff. incremental administrative functions were also added in 2014 in order to support the growing business. travel and meal expenses also increased approximately $0.8
million compared to the prior year as increased international travel occurred to set up the new international offices in amsterdam. offsetting these increases, the company experienced a decrease in liability insurance costs during 2015.
within the axon segment, sg&a increased $4.8 million, or 75.0%, to $11.2 million in 2014 in comparison to the prior year. salaries, benefits, bonus and stock-based compensation in the axon segment increased $1.8 million. sales and marketing expenses in the axon segment also increased approximately $1.4 million in comparison to 2013 as a result of a large presence and a hosted booth at the international association of chiefs of police. sales and marketing expenses also include increases of approximately $0.9 million in commissions. increases were also seen in lobbying and consulting fees of approximately $0.8 million and travel and meal expenses of approximately $0.7 million.
within the taser weapons segment, r&d expenses increased $0.6 million, or 15.4%, to $4.5 million in 2015, which was primarily driven by internal efforts and consulting expenses related to development of future cew products.
within the axon segment, r&d expenses increased $8.1 million, or 73.8%, to $19.1 million in 2015 from the prior year. the increase for 2015 compared to 2014 is primarily driven by additional headcount and higher consulting fees as the company continues its efforts to launch new product lines and saas offerings to strengthen its competitive advantage in these emerging technologies.
within the taser weapons segment, r&d expenses decreased $0.4 million, or 10.2%, to $3.9 million in 2014, which was primarily driven by a shift in personnel resources to the axon segment and reduced testing materials expense. reductions were partially offset by increases in professional and consulting fees.
within the axon segment, r&d expenses increased $5.4 million, or 97.5%, to $11.0 million in 2014 from the prior year. the increase for 2014 compared to 2013 is primarily driven by additional headcount and higher consulting fees.
provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes was $15.4 million for the year ended december 31, 2015. the effective income tax rate for 2015 was 43.6%. the effect of state income taxes of $1.1 million was largely offset by a benefit of $1.0 million for research and development credits in the current year. the difference between statutory and foreign tax rates of $2.4 million was largely driven by losses incurred in a newly formed foreign entity for which no tax benefit will be realized. in addition, a valuation allowance in the amount of $1.2 million was recorded as of december 31 2015 related to certain research and development tax credits the company estimates may not be utilized prior to expiration.
in november 2015, the fasb issued asu no. 2015-17, "income taxes (topic 740): balance sheet classification of deferred taxes ("asu 2015-17"). this standard requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be classified as noncurrent on the balance sheet rather than being separated into current and noncurrent. the company elected early adoption of asu 2015-17 effective december 31, 2015, on a retrospective basis. adoption of this asu resulted in a reclassification of net current deferred tax assets to net noncurrent deferred tax asset in our consolidated balance sheet as of both december 31, 2015 and december 31, 2014. this accounting change had no impact on our consolidated results of operations or comprehensive income.
the provision for income taxes was $12.4 million for the year ended december 31, 2014. the effective income tax rate for 2014 was 38.4%. the effect of state income tax of $1.4 million was largely offset by a benefit of $0.6 million from incentive stock
option deductions as well as $0.5 million of research and development credits in 2014. when an employee exercises isos and sells the related stock prior to the end of the mandatory holding period, the associated expense becomes a reduction to the company's taxable income.
the provision for income taxes was $9.8 million for the year ended december 31, 2013. the effective income tax rate for 2013 was 34.9%. the effect of state income tax of $1.3 million was largely offset by a benefit of $0.5 million from incentive stock option deductions as well as $0.4 million of research and development credits and a $0.4 million favorable return to provision adjustment in 2013. the 2013 return to provision adjustment was driven by the domestic production activities deduction which decreased taxable income, and therefore, reduced the effective tax rate.
liquidity and capital resources summary as of december 31, 2015, we had $59.5 million of cash and cash equivalents, an increase of $11.2 million from the end of 2014.

operating activities net cash provided by operating activities in 2015 of $46.4 million consists of $19.9 million in net income, the net add-back of non-cash income statement items totaling $6.3 million and a positive $20.2 million net change in operating assets and liabilities. included in the non-cash items are $3.3 million in depreciation and amortization expense, $7.3 million in stock-based compensation expense, and $1.7 million of bond premium amortization. these additions were partially offset by an $6.9 million reduction related to excess tax benefit from stock-based compensation that is treated as a financing activity for cash flow purposes. the most significant increase to the portion of cash from operating activities related to the changes in operating assets and liabilities is a $15.3 million increase to deferred revenue. of the increase in deferred revenue, $4.0 million resulted from additional extended warranty sales, $7.3 million resulted from increased hardware deferred revenue from taser assurance program ("tap") and officer safety program ("osp") sales, and $4.0 million related to prepayments for axon saas and related services. the company also had increases in cash provided from operating activities of $4.2 million and $3.1 million for decreases in accounts and notes receivable and inventory, respectively. in addition, the $5.9 million increase to cash from operating activities related to increases in accounts payable, accrued and other liabilities that was primarily caused by current income tax expense, which would have resulted in an increase to income tax payable, if it had not been reduced by the excess tax benefit from stock-based compensation discussed above. these increases were partially offset by increased prepaid expenses and other current assets of $8.6 million during 2015. the increase in other asset accounts during 2015 was driven by primarily by increased prepaid commissions of $2.5 million, increased long-term accounts receivable of $1.2 million for sales made under the officer safety plan, increased balances under corporate-owed life insurance policies of $1.1 million, and a deposit made with a foreign component manufacturer of $2.6 million related to future services.
net cash provided by operating activities in 2014 of $35.4 million consists of $19.9 million in net income, the net add-back of non-cash income statement items totaling $9.6 million and a positive $5.9 million net change in operating assets and liabilities. included in the non-cash items are $4.3 million in depreciation and amortization expense and $5.6 million in stock-based compensation expense. these additions were partially offset by an $8.0 million reduction related to excess tax benefit from stock-based compensation that is treated as a financing activity for cash flow purposes. the most significant increase to the portion of cash from operating activities related to the changes in operating assets and liabilities is a $15.5 million increase to deferred revenue. of the increase in deferred revenue, $6.1 million resulted from additional extended warranty sales, $3.9 million resulted from increased hardware deferred revenue from taser assurance program ("tap") sales, and $5.3 million related to prepayments for axon saas services. in addition, the $9.5 million increase to cash from operating activities related to increases in accounts payable, accrued and other liabilities that was primarily caused by current income tax expense, which would have resulted in an increase to income tax payable, if it had not been reduced by the excess tax benefit from stock-based compensation discussed above. these increases to operating cash flow were partially offset by an increase in accounts and notes receivable of $8.4 million due to higher sales in the fourth quarter of 2014 compared to the same quarter in 2013, and an increase in inventory of $9.4 million in anticipation of higher sales in 2015.
net cash provided by operating activities in 2013 of $32.4 million consists of $18.2 million in net income, the net add-back of non-cash income statement items totaling $5.6 million and a positive $8.6 million net change in operating assets (net of operating liabilities). included in the non-cash items are $5.1 million in depreciation and amortization expense and $4.3 million in stock-based compensation expense. these additions were partially offset by a $6.8 million reduction related to excess tax benefit from stock-based compensation that is treated as a financing activity for cash flow purposes. the most significant increase to cash from operating activities related to the changes in operating assets and liabilities was an $8.1 million increase to deferred revenue. of the increase in deferred revenue, $5.1 million results from additional extended warranty sales and the remainder is primarily a result of prepayments for our evidence.com saas. in addition, the $5.6 million increase to cash from operating activities related to increases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities was primarily caused by current income tax expense, which would have resulted in an increase to income tax payable, if it had not been reduced by the excess tax benefit from stock-based compensation discussed above. these increases to operating cash flow were partially offset by an increase in accounts and notes receivable of $4.4 million. the fluctuation in accounts and notes receivable was primarily driven by sales, which increased 20.1% during 2013
investing activities primarily as a result of investing cash generated from operating activities, we used $36.0 million for investing activities in 2015. purchases of investments, net of calls and maturities, were $18.4 million. during 2015, net cash of $11.2 million was used for the acquisitions of mediasolv solutions corporation and tactical safety responses ltd. the company also invested $6.5 million in the purchase of property and equipment and intangibles.
during the year ended december 31, 2014, we used $24.6 million for investing activities. purchases of investments, net of calls and maturities, were $21.9 million. the company also invested $2.7 million in the purchase of property and equipment and intangibles.
during the year ended december 31, 2013, we used $23.1 million from investing activities. purchases of investments, net of calls and maturities, were $19.7 million. the company also invested $2.1 million in the purchase of property and equipment and intangibles, as well as $1.3 million, net, to purchase familiar, inc.
financing activities net cash used by financing activities was $0.6 million for the year ended december 31, 2015. the repurchase of $7.6 million of the company's common stock, which was purchased for a weighted average cost of $25.86 per share, was partially offset by $2.7 million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options, and $6.9 million of excess tax benefit from stock proceeds. the purchase of common stock was made under a stock repurchase program authorized by taser's board of directors. as of december 31, 2015, no amounts remain available under the plan for future purchases.
net cash used by financing activities was $4.8 million for the year ended december 31, 2014. the repurchase of $22.4 million of the company's common stock, which was purchased for a weighted average cost of $12.99 per share, was partially offset by $11.0 million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options, and $8.0 million of excess tax benefit from stock proceeds. the purchase of common stock was made under a stock repurchase program authorized by taser's board of directors.
net cash used by financing activities was $3.2 million for the year ended december 31, 2013. the repurchase of $25.0 million of the company's common stock, which was purchased for a weighted average cost of $8.20 per share, was offset by $15.4 million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options, and $6.8 million of excess tax benefit from stock proceeds. the purchase of common stock was made under a stock repurchase program authorized by taser's board of directors. we completed the authorized repurchases as of june 2013.
liquidity and capital resources our most significant sources of liquidity continue to be funds generated by operating activities and available cash and cash equivalents. in addition, our $10.0 million revolving credit facility is available for additional working capital needs or investment opportunities. under the terms of the line of credit, available borrowings are reduced by outstanding letters of credit. the line is secured by substantially all of the assets of the company, and bears interest at varying rates, currently libor plus 1.5% or prime less 0.75%. as of december 31, 2015, we had letters of credit outstanding of $3.0 million, leaving the net amount available for borrowing of $7.0 million. the facility matures on july 31, 2017. there can be no assurance that we will continue to generate cash flows at or above current levels or that we will be able to maintain our ability to borrow under our revolving credit facility. at december 31, 2015 and 2014, there were no borrowings under the line.
our agreement with the bank requires us to comply with certain financial and other covenants including maintenance of a minimum leverage ratio and fixed charge coverage ratio. the leverage ratio (ratio of total liabilities to tangible net worth) can be no greater than 1:1, and the fixed charge coverage ratio can be no less than 1.25:1, based upon a trailing twelve-month period. at december 31, 2015, the company's tangible net worth ratio was 0.52:1 and its fixed charge coverage ratio was 2.41:1. accordingly, the company was in compliance with these covenants.
based on our strong balance sheet and the fact that we had just $0.2 million in total long-term debt and capital lease obligations at december 31, 2015, we believe financing will be available, both through our existing credit line and possible additional financing. however, there is no assurance that such funding will be available on terms acceptable to us, or at all.
we believe funds generated from our expected results of operations, as well as available cash and investments, will be sufficient to finance our operations and strategic initiatives for 2016 and the foreseeable future. from time to time, our board of directors considers repurchases of our common stock. further repurchases of our common stock will take place on the open market, will be financed with available cash and are subject to authorization as well as market and business conditions.
capital leases including interest   30                 30                                 -                 -         -
open purchase orders in the above table primarily represent cancelable purchase orders with key vendors, which are included in this table due to the company's strategic relationships with these vendors.
we are subject to u.s. federal income tax as well as income taxes imposed by several states and foreign jurisdictions. as of december 31, 2015, we had $1.3 million of unrecognized tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions. the settlement period for our long-term income tax liabilities cannot be determined; however, the liabilities are not expected to significantly increase or decrease within the next 12 months.
off balance sheet arrangements the discussion of off-balance sheet arrangements in note 9 to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k is incorporated by reference herein.
critical accounting estimates we have identified the following accounting estimates as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations. the preparation of this annual report on form 10-k requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our consolidated financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. while we don't believe that a change in these estimates is reasonably likely, there can be no assurance that our actual results will not differ from these estimates. the effect of these estimates on our business operations is discussed below.
product warranties the company warranties its cews, axon cameras and e-docks from manufacturing defects on a limited basis for a period of one year after purchase and, thereafter, will replace any defective unit for a fee. estimated costs for our standard warranty are charged to cost of products sold and services delivered when revenue is recorded for the related product. we estimate future warranty costs based on historical data related to returns and warranty costs on a quarterly basis and apply this rate to current product anticipated returns from our customers. we have also historically increased our reserve amount if we become aware of a component failure that could result in larger than anticipated returns from our customers. the accrued warranty liability is reviewed quarterly to evaluate whether it sufficiently reflects the remaining warranty obligations based on the anticipated expenditures over the balance of the warranty obligation period, and adjustments are made when actual warranty claim experience differs from estimates. as of december 31, 2015 and 2014, our reserve for warranty returns was approximately $0.3 million and $0.7 million, respectively. warranty (recoveries) expense in the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 was $(0.1) million, $0.4 million and $1.0 million, respectively. the decrease in warranty reserve and related expense as of and for the year ended ended december 31, 2015 was primarily driven by the company's completion of its replacement program for existing evidence transfer machine ("etm") units in the field being upgraded to the newer e-dock product line. additionally, the company continues to experience decreased warranty claims on its other existing products which has led to lower warranty reserves. as the company continues investing in the development of new technologies it will continue to assess the adequacy of its reserves related to inherent uncertainties with new product offerings.
revenue related to separately-priced extended warranties is recorded as deferred revenue at its contractual amount and subsequently recognized in net sales on a straight-line basis over the delivery period. costs related to extended warranties are charged to cost of products sold and services delivered when incurred.
inventory inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market, with cost determined using the weighted average cost of raw materials, which approximates the first-in, first-out ("fifo") method, and an allocation of manufacturing labor and overhead costs. the allocation of manufacturing labor and overhead costs includes management's judgments of what constitutes normal capacity of our production facilities and a determination of what costs are considered to be abnormal fixed production costs, which are expensed as current period charges. provisions are made to reduce potentially excess, obsolete or slow-moving inventories to their net realizable value. these provisions are based on our best estimates after considering historical demand, projected future demand, inventory purchase commitments, industry and market trends and conditions and other factors. during the year ended december 31, 2015, the company recorded provisions for obsolete inventory of approximately $0.5 million compared to $2.2 million during 2014. the decrease during 2015 was partially attributable to a reserve taken in 2014 for legacy x26 cew inventory which ended production during the year ended december 31, 2014. during 2014, the company also accrued approximately $1.1 million of inventory losses related to products it was not certain could be fully utilized in production of certain axon camera products.
revenue recognition, deferred revenue and accounts and notes receivable we derive our revenue from two primary sources: (1) the sale of physical products, including our cews, axon cameras, corresponding hardware extended warranties, and related accessories such as e-docks, cartridges and batteries, and (2) subscription to our evidence.com digital evidence management saas (including data storage fees and other ancillary services), which includes varying levels of support. to a lesser extent, we also recognize training and other revenue. revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, title has transferred, the price is fixed and collectability is reasonably assured. contractual arrangements may contain explicit customer acceptance provisions, and under such arrangements, the company defers recognition of revenue until formal customer acceptance is received. extended warranty revenue, saas revenue and related data storage revenue are recognized ratably over the term of the contract beginning on the commencement date of each contract.
revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables are divided into separate units and revenue is allocated using the relative selling price method based upon vendor-specific objective evidence of selling price or third-party evidence of the selling prices if vendor-specific objective evidence of selling prices does not exist. if neither vendor-specific objective evidence nor third-party evidence exists, management uses its best estimate of selling price. the majority of the company's allocations of arrangement consideration under multiple element arrangements are performed using vendor-specific objective evidence by utilizing prices charged to customers for deliverables when sold separately. the company's multiple element arrangements may include future cews and/or axon devices to be delivered at defined points within a multi-year contract, and in those arrangements, the company allocates total arrangement consideration over the life of the multi-year contract to future deliverables using management's best estimate of selling price. the company has not utilized third party evidence of selling price.
for the the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, the composition of revenue recognized from arrangements containing multiple elements and those not containing multiple elements was as follows:

evidence.com, axon cameras and related accessories are sometimes sold separately, but in most instances are sold together. in these instances, customers typically purchase and pay for the equipment and one year of evidence.com in advance. additional years of service are generally billed annually over a specified service term, which has typically ranged from one to five years. axon equipment represents a deliverable that is provided to the customer at the time of sale, while evidence.com services are provided over the specified term of the contract. generally, the company recognizes revenue for the axon equipment at the time of the sale consistent with the discussion of multiple deliverable arrangements above. revenue for evidence.com is deferred at the time of the sale and recognized over the service period. at times the company subsidizes the cost of axon devices provided to customers to secure long-term evidence.com service contracts. in such circumstances, revenue related to the axon devices recognized at the time of delivery is limited to the amount collected from the customer that is not contingent upon the delivery of future evidence.com services. the company recognizes the remaining allocated revenue related to subsidized axon devices over the remaining period it provides the contracted evidence.com services.
deferred revenue consists of payments received in advance related to products and services for which the criteria for revenue recognition have not yet been met. deferred revenue that will be recognized during the succeeding twelve month period is recorded as current deferred revenue and the remaining portion is recorded as long-term. deferred revenue does not include future revenue from multi-year contracts for which no invoice has yet been created. we generally bill customers in annual installments.
sales are typically made on credit and we generally do not require collateral. we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers' financial condition and maintain an allowance for estimated potential losses. uncollectible accounts are written off when deemed uncollectible, and accounts and notes receivable are presented net of an allowance for doubtful accounts. this allowance represents our best estimate and is based on our judgment after considering a number of factors including third-party credit reports, actual payment history, customer-specific financial information and broader market and economic trends and conditions. in the event that actual uncollectible amounts differ from our estimates, additional expense could be necessary.
valuation of goodwill, intangibles and long-lived assets the recoverability of the goodwill is evaluated and tested for impairment at least annually during the fourth quarter or more often, if and when circumstances indicate that goodwill may not be recoverable. finite-lived intangible assets and other long-lived assets are amortized over their useful lives. we evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate the remaining estimated useful life of long-lived assets and intangible assets may warrant revision or that the remaining balance of these assets, including intangible assets with indefinite lives, may not be recoverable.
circumstances that might indicate long-lived assets might not be recoverable could include, but are not limited to, a change in the product mix, a change in the way products are created, produced or delivered, or a significant change in the way our products are branded and marketed. when performing a review for recoverability, we estimate the future undiscounted cash flows expected
to result from the use of the assets and their eventual disposition. the amount of the impairment loss, if impairment exists, is calculated based on the excess of the carrying amounts of the assets over their estimated fair value computed using discounted cash flows. no impairment losses were recorded in 2015, 2014 or 2013.
income taxes we recognize federal, state and foreign current tax liabilities or assets based on our estimate of taxes payable or refundable in the current fiscal year by tax jurisdiction. we also recognize federal, state and foreign deferred tax assets or liabilities, as appropriate, for our estimate of future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carry forwards.
we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained based on the technical merits of the position. the tax benefits recognized in the consolidated financial statements from such positions are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution. management must also assess whether uncertain tax positions as filed could result in the recognition of a liability for possible interest and penalties if any. we have completed research and development tax credit studies which identified approximately $9.4 million in tax credits for federal, arizona and california income tax purposes related to the 2003 through 2015 tax years, net of the federal benefit on the arizona and california research and development tax credits. management determined that it was more likely than not that the full benefit of the research and development tax credit would not be sustained on examination and accordingly, has established a liability for unrecognized tax benefits of $3.2 million as of december 31, 2015. in addition, we established a $0.2 million liability related to uncertain tax positions for certain state income tax liabilities, for a total unrecognized tax benefit at december 31, 2015 of $3.4 million. management does not expect the amount of the unrecognized tax benefit liability to change significantly within the next 12 months. should the unrecognized tax benefit of $3.4 million be recognized, the company's effective tax rate would be favorably impacted. our estimates are based on the information available to us at the time we prepare the income tax provisions. our income tax returns are subject to audit by federal, state, and local governments, generally years after the returns are filed. these returns could be subject to material adjustments or differing interpretations of the tax laws.
our calculation of current and deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on certain estimates and judgments and involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws. our estimates of current and deferred tax assets and liabilities may change based, in part, on added certainty or finality to an anticipated outcome, changes in accounting or tax laws in the u.s. and overseas, or changes in other facts or circumstances. in addition, we recognize liabilities for potential u.s. tax contingencies based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes may be due. if we determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary, or if the recorded tax liability is greater than our current assessment, we may be required to recognize an income tax benefit, or additional income tax expense, respectively, in our consolidated financial statements.
in preparing our consolidated financial statements, management assesses the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be realized from future taxable income. in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred income tax assets, management considers all available positive and negative evidence, including operating results, ongoing tax planning and forecasts of future taxable income on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis. a valuation allowance is established if we determine that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the net deferred tax assets will not be realized.
although management believes that its tax estimates are reasonable, the ultimate tax determination involves significant judgments that could become subject to audit by tax authorities in the ordinary course of business. as of december 31, 2015, the company would need to generate approximately $33.4 million of pre-tax book income in order to realize the net deferred tax assets for which a benefit has been recorded. this estimate considers the reversal of approximately $11.1 million of gross deferred tax liabilities, $4.2 million tax-effected. we also have state net operating losses ("nols") of $0.3 million, which produce deferred tax assets of $10,000, which expire at various dates between 2016 and 2031. we anticipate the company's future income to continue to trend upward from our 2015 results, with sufficient pre-tax book income to realize a large portion of our deferred tax assets. however, based on specific income projections in years in which certain tax assets are set to expire, a reserve of approximately $1.7 million has been recorded as a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets as of december 31, 2015.
stock-based compensation we have historically granted stock-based compensation to key employees and non-employee directors as a means of attracting and retaining highly qualified personnel. we have historically utilized restricted stock units and stock options; however, no stock options were issued during 2015, 2014 or 2013. the fair value of restricted stock units is estimated as the closing price of our common stock on the date of grant. we estimate the fair value of granted stock options by using the black-scholes-merton option pricing model, which requires the input of highly subjective assumptions. these assumptions include estimating the length of time employees will retain their stock options before exercising them (expected term), the estimated volatility of our common stock
price over the expected term and the number of options that will ultimately not vest (forfeitures). the expense for both restricted stock units and stock options is recorded over the life of the grant, net of forfeitures.
we have granted a total of approximately 1.6 million performance-based awards (options and restricted stock units) of which approximately 0.4 million are outstanding as of december 31, 2015, the vesting of which is contingent upon the achievement of certain performance criteria including the successful development and market acceptance of future product introductions as well as our future sales targets and operating performance. these awards will vest and compensation expense will be recognized based on management's best estimate of the probability of the performance criteria being satisfied using the most currently available projections of future product adoption and operating performance, adjusted at each balance sheet date. changes in the subjective and probability-based assumptions can materially affect the estimate of fair value of stock-based compensation and consequently, the related amount recognized in our statements of operations. refer to note 1(q) to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k for further discussion of our valuation assumptions.
contingencies and accrued litigation expense we are subject to the possibility of various loss contingencies including product-related litigation, arising in the ordinary course of business. we consider the likelihood of loss or impairment of an asset or the incurrence of a liability, as well as our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss in determining loss contingencies. an estimated loss contingency is accrued when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. we regularly evaluate current information available to us to determine whether such accruals should be adjusted and whether new accruals are required. refer to note 9(c) of our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k for further discussion of our contingencies and accrued litigation expense.

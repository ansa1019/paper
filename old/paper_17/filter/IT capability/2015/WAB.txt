item 1a.   risk factors prolonged unfavorable economic and market conditions could adversely affect our business.
unfavorable general economic and market conditions in the united states and internationally could have a negative impact on our sales and operations. to the extent that these factors result in continued instability of capital markets, shortages of raw materials or component parts, longer sales cycles, deferral or delay of customer orders or an inability to market our products effectively, our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.
we are dependent upon key customers.
we rely on several key customers who represent a significant portion of our business. our top customers can change from year to year. for the fiscal year ended december 31, 2015, our top five customers accounted for 22% of our net sales. while we believe our relationships with our customers are generally good, our top customers could choose to reduce or terminate their relationships with us. in addition, many of our customers place orders for products on an as-needed basis and operate in cyclical industries. as a result, their order levels have varied from period to period in the past and may vary significantly in the future. such customer orders are dependent upon their markets and customers, and may be subject to delays and cancellations. as a result of our dependence on our key customers, we could experience a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition if we lost any one or more of our key customers or if there is a reduction in their demand for our products.
our business operates in a highly competitive industry.
we operate in a competitive marketplace and face substantial competition from a limited number of established competitors in the united states and abroad, some of which may have greater financial resources than we do. price competition is strong and, coupled with the existence of a number of cost conscious customers, has historically limited our ability to increase prices. in addition to price, competition is based on product performance and technological leadership, quality, reliability of delivery and customer service and support. there can be no assurance that competition in one or more of our markets will not adversely affect us and our results of operations.
we intend to pursue acquisitions, joint ventures and alliances that involve a number of inherent risks, any of which may cause us not to realize anticipated benefits.
one aspect of our business strategy is to selectively pursue acquisitions, joint ventures and alliances that we believe will improve our market position, and provide opportunities to realize operating synergies. these transactions involve inherent risks and uncertainties, any one of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition including:
•   difficulties in achieving identified financial and operating synergies, including the integration of operations, services and products;
•   diversion of management's attention from other business concerns;
•   the assumption of unknown liabilities; and
•   unanticipated changes in the market conditions, business and economic factors affecting such an acquisition.
we cannot assure that we will be able to consummate any future acquisitions, joint ventures or other business combinations. if we are unable to identify suitable acquisition candidates or to consummate strategic acquisitions, we may be unable to fully implement our business strategy, and our business and results of operations may be adversely affected as a result. in addition, our ability to engage in strategic acquisitions will be dependent on our ability to raise substantial capital, and we may not be able to raise the funds necessary to implement our acquisition strategy on terms satisfactory to us, if at all.
as we introduce new products and services, a failure to predict and react to consumer demand could adversely affect our business.
we have dedicated significant resources to the development, manufacturing and marketing of new products. decisions to develop and market new transportation products are typically made without firm indications of customer acceptance. moreover, by their nature, new products may require alteration of existing business methods or threaten to displace existing equipment in which our customers may have a substantial capital investment. there can be no assurance that any new products that we develop will gain widespread acceptance in the marketplace or that such products will be able to compete successfully with other new products or services that may be introduced by competitors. in addition, we may incur additional warranty or other costs as new products are tested and used by customers.
a portion of our sales are related to delivering products and services to help our u.s. railroad and transit customers meet the positive train control (ptc) mandate from the u.s. federal government, which requires the use of on-board locomotive computers and software by the end of 2018.
for the year ended december 31, 2015, we had sales of about $400 million related to ptc. in 2015, the industry's ptc deadline was extended by three years, which could change the timing of our revenues and could cause us to reassess the staffing, resources and assets deployed in delivering positive train control services.
our revenues are subject to cyclical variations in the railway and passenger transit markets and changes in government spending.
the railway industry historically has been subject to significant fluctuations due to overall economic conditions, the use of alternate methods of transportation and the levels of federal, state and local government spending on railroad transit projects. in economic downturns, railroads have deferred, and may defer, certain expenditures in order to conserve cash in the short term. reductions in freight traffic may reduce demand for our replacement products.
the passenger transit railroad industry is also cyclical. new passenger transit car orders vary from year to year and are influenced greatly by major replacement programs and by the construction or expansion of transit systems by transit authorities. a substantial portion of our net sales have been, and we expect that a material portion of our future net sales will be, derived from contracts with metropolitan transit and commuter rail authorities and amtrak. to the extent that future funding for proposed public projects is curtailed or withdrawn altogether as a result of changes in political, economic, fiscal or other conditions beyond our control, such projects may be delayed or cancelled, resulting in a potential loss of business for us, including transit aftermarket and new transit car orders. there can be no assurance that economic conditions will be favorable or that there will not be significant fluctuations adversely affecting the industry as a whole and, as a result, us.
our backlog represents future production and estimated potential revenue attributable to firm contracts with, or written orders from, our customers for delivery in various periods.  instability in the global economy, negative conditions in the global credit markets, volatility in the industries that our products serve, changes in legislative policy, adverse changes in the financial condition of our customers, adverse changes in the availability of raw materials and supplies, or un-remedied contract breaches could possibly lead to contract termination or cancellations of orders in our backlog or request for deferred deliveries of our backlog orders, each of which could adversely affect our cash flows and results of operations.
a growing portion of our sales may be derived from our international operations, which exposes us to certain risks inherent in doing business on an international level.
in fiscal year 2015, approximately 47% of our consolidated net sales were to customers outside of the u.s. and we intend to continue to expand our international operations in the future. we currently conduct our international operations through a variety of wholly and majority-owned subsidiaries and joint ventures in australia, austria, brazil, canada, china, czech republic, france, germany, india, italy, macedonia, mexico, the netherlands, poland, russia, spain, south africa, turkey, and the united kingdom. as a result, we are subject to various risks, any one of which could have a material adverse effect on those operations and on our business as a whole, including:
•   lack of complete operating control;
•   lack of local business experience;
•   currency exchange fluctuations and devaluations;
•   foreign trade restrictions and exchange controls;
•   difficulty enforcing agreements and intellectual property rights;
•   the potential for nationalization of enterprises; and
•   economic, political and social instability and possible terrorist attacks against american interests.
in addition, certain jurisdictions have laws that limit the ability of non-u.s. subsidiaries and their affiliates to pay dividends and repatriate cash flows.
we may incur increased costs due to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates.
in the ordinary course of business, we are exposed to increases in interest rates that may adversely affect funding costs associated with variable-rate debt and changes in foreign currency exchange rates. we may seek to minimize these risks through the use of interest rate swap contracts and currency hedging agreements. there can be no assurance that any of these measures will be effective. any material changes in interest or exchange rates could result in material losses to us.
we may have liability arising from asbestos litigation.
claims have been filed against the company and certain of its affiliates in various jurisdictions across the united states by persons alleging bodily injury as a result of exposure to asbestos-containing products. most of these claims have been made against our wholly owned subsidiary, railroad friction products corporation (rfpc), and are based on a product sold by rfpc prior to the time that the company acquired any interest in rfpc.
most of these claims, including all of the rfpc claims, are submitted to insurance carriers for defense and indemnity or to non-affiliated companies that retain the liabilities for the asbestos-containing products at issue. we cannot, however, assure that all these claims will be fully covered by insurance or that the indemnitors or insurers will remain financially viable. our ultimate legal and financial liability with respect to these claims, as is the case with most other pending litigation, cannot be estimated.
we are subject to a variety of environmental laws and regulations.
we are subject to a variety of environmental laws and regulations governing discharges to air and water, the handling, storage and disposal of hazardous or solid waste materials and the remediation of contamination associated with releases of hazardous substances. we believe our operations currently comply in all material respects with all of the various environmental laws and regulations applicable to our business; however, there can be no assurance that environmental requirements will not change in the future or that we will not incur significant costs to comply with such requirements.
future climate change regulation could result in increased operating costs, affect the demand for our products or affect the ability of our critical suppliers to meet our needs.
the company has followed the current debate over climate change and the related policy discussion and prospective legislation. the potential challenges for the company that climate change policy and legislation may pose have been reviewed by the company. any such challenges are heavily dependent on the nature and degree of climate change legislation and the extent to which it applies to our industry. at this time, the company cannot predict the ultimate impact of climate change and climate change legislation on the company's operations. further, when or if these impacts may occur cannot be assessed until scientific analysis and legislative policy are more developed and specific legislative proposals begin to take shape. any laws or regulations that may be adopted to restrict or reduce emissions of greenhouse gas could require us to incur increased operating costs, and could have an adverse effect on demand for our products. in addition, the price and availability of certain of the raw materials that we use could vary in the future as a result of environmental laws and regulations affecting our suppliers. an increase in the price of our raw materials or a decline in their availability could adversely affect our operating margins or result in reduced demand for our products.
our manufacturer's warranties or product liability may expose us to potentially significant claims.
we warrant the workmanship and materials of many of our products. accordingly, we are subject to a risk of product liability or warranty claims in the event that the failure of any of our products results in personal injury or death, or does not conform to our customers' specifications. in addition, in recent years, we have introduced a number of new products for which we do not have a history of warranty experience. although we have not had any material product liability or warranty claims made against us and we currently maintain liability insurance coverage, we cannot assure that product liability claims, if made, would not exceed our insurance coverage limits or that insurance will continue to be available on commercially acceptable terms, if at all. the possibility exists for these types of warranty claims to result in costly product recalls, significant repair costs and damage to our reputation.
labor disputes may have a material adverse effect on our operations and profitability.
we collectively bargain with labor unions that represent approximately 30% of our employees. our current collective bargaining agreements are generally effective from 2016 through 2018. agreements expiring at various times during 2016 cover approximately 26% of the company's workforce. failure to reach an agreement could result in strikes or other labor protests which could disrupt our operations. if we were to experience a strike or work stoppage, it would be difficult for us to find a sufficient number of employees with the necessary skills to replace these employees. we cannot assure that we will reach any such agreement or that we will not encounter strikes or other types of conflicts with the labor unions of our personnel. such labor disputes could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations, could cause us to lose revenues and customers and might have permanent effects on our business.
from time to time we are engaged in contractual disputes with our customers.
from time to time, we are engaged in contractual disputes with our customers regarding routine delivery and performance issues as well as adjustments for design changes and related extra work. these disputes are generally resolved in
the ordinary course of business without having a material adverse impact on us although we cannot guarantee that this will continue to occur.
our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health.
at december 31, 2015, we had total debt of $695.7 million. if it becomes necessary to access our available borrowing capacity under our 2013 refinancing credit agreement, the $445.0 million currently borrowed under this facility and the $250.0 million 4.375% senior notes, being indebted could have important consequences to us. for example, it could:
•   increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;
•   require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes;
•   limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industries in which we operate;
•   place us at a disadvantage compared to competitors that have less debt; and
•   limit our ability to borrow additional funds.
the indenture for our $250 million 4.375% senior notes due in 2023 and our 2013 refinancing credit agreement contain various covenants that limit our management's discretion in the operation of our businesses.
the indenture governing the notes and our credit agreement contain various covenants that limit our management's discretion.
the 2013 refinancing credit agreement limits the company's ability to declare or pay cash dividends and prohibits the company from declaring or making other distributions, subject to certain exceptions. the 2013 refinancing credit agreement contains various other covenants and restrictions including the following limitations: incurrence of additional indebtedness; mergers, consolidations and sales of assets and acquisitions; additional liens; sale and leasebacks; permissible investments, loans and advances; certain debt payments; capital expenditures; and imposes a minimum interest expense coverage ratio and a maximum debt to cash flow ratio.
the indenture under which the senior notes were issued contains covenants and restrictions which limit among other things, the following: the incurrence of indebtedness, payment of dividends and certain distributions, sale of assets, change in control, mergers and consolidations and the incurrence of liens.
the integration of our recently completed acquisitions may not result in anticipated improvements in market position or the realization of anticipated operating synergies or may take longer to realize than expected.
in 2014 and 2015, we completed multiple acquisitions with a combined investment of $424.7 million. although we believe that the acquisitions will improve our market position and realize positive operating results, including operating synergies, operating expense reductions and overhead cost savings, we cannot be assured that these improvements will be obtained or the timing of such improvements. the management and acquisition of businesses involves substantial risks, any of which may result in a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations, including:
•   the uncertainty that an acquired business will achieve anticipated operating results;
•   diversion of management's attention;
•   departure of key personnel from the acquired business;
•   effectively managing entrepreneurial spirit and decision-making;
•   integration of different information systems;
•   unanticipated costs and exposure to unforeseen liabilities; and
•   impairment of assets.
item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview wabtec is one of the world's largest providers of value-added, technology-based products and services for the global rail industry. our products are found on virtually all u.s. locomotives, freight cars and passenger transit vehicles, as well as in more than 100 countries throughout the world. our products enhance safety, improve productivity and reduce maintenance costs for customers, and many of our core products and services are essential in the safe and efficient operation of freight rail and passenger transit vehicles. wabtec is a global company with operations in 20 countries. in 2015, about 47% of the company's revenues came from customers outside the u.s.
management review and future outlook wabtec's long-term financial goals are to generate cash flow from operations in excess of net income, maintain a strong credit profile while minimizing our overall cost of capital, increase margins through strict attention to cost controls and implementation of the wabtec performance system, and increase revenues through a focused growth strategy, including global and market expansion, new products and technologies, aftermarket products and services, and acquisitions. in addition, management evaluates the company's current operational performance through measures such as quality and on-time delivery.
the company monitors a variety of factors and statistics to gauge market activity. freight rail markets around the world are driven primarily by overall economic conditions and activity, while transit markets are driven primarily by government funding and passenger ridership.  changes in these market drivers can cause fluctuations in demand for wabtec's product and services.  in its 2014 - 2019 study, unife projected annual growth of about 2.7% in the worldwide rail supply market over the next several years, with the highest expected growth rates in africa, the middle east, and latin america.
in north america, the aar compiles statistics that gauge the level of activity in the freight rail industry, including revenue ton-miles and carloadings, which are generally referred to as "rail traffic".  based on changes in rail traffic trends, railroads can increase or decrease purchases of new locomotives and freight cars.  in 2015, north american carloadings decreased 2.2%, including a 5.8% decrease in commodity carloadings and a 2.1% increase in intermodal carloadings. deliveries of new locomotives decreased 20%, and deliveries of new freight cars increased 22%. in 2016, we expect locomotive and freight car deliveries to be lower than in 2015. unife projected an annual growth rate of about 3.0% in north america, but the actual figure depends on the growth of the economy.
in north america, the american public transportation association (apta) compiles ridership statistics and trends.  based on preliminary figures for 2015, ridership decreased about 1.0% in the u.s. and about 1.0% in canada.  ridership provides fare box revenues to transit authorities, which use these funds, along with state and local money, primarily, for equipment maintenance.  in 2015, the u.s. congress passed a new, five-year transportation funding bill, which includes an increase in spending of about 10.0% in the first year, and smaller increases in future years.  a majority of the money that transit agencies spend to purchase new equipment or infrastructure comes from the federal government.
wabtec continues to expand its presence in freight rail and passenger transit markets outside the u.s., particularly in europe, asia-pacific and south america. to gauge activity in these markets, we monitor trends in rail traffic and the spending plans of our customers.  in europe, the majority of the rail system serves the passenger transit market, which is larger than the transit market in the u.s., our presence in the u.k., germany and italy has positioned the company to take advantage of this market. unife projected the western european rail market to grow annually by about 2.0% in the next few years, with the united kingdom and france expected to invest in new rolling stock.  unife projected the market in asia-pacific, the world's second largest according to the study, to grow annually by about 4.0%, primarily reflecting strong spending in china in recent years.  other growth markets around the world, according to unife, include latin america, projected to grow at about 5.0%; and the commonwealth of independent states, projected to grow at about 1.0%.  actual growth rates will be affected by the general global economic conditions and specific economic conditions in each market. through wholly owned subsidiaries and joint ventures, wabtec has a presence in every key freight rail and passenger transit market around the world.
in 2016 and beyond, general economic and market conditions in the united states and internationally will have an impact on our sales and operations. to the extent that these factors cause instability of capital markets, shortages of raw materials or component parts, longer sales cycles, deferral or delay of customer orders or an inability to market our products effectively, our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. in addition, we face risks associated with our four-point growth strategy including the level of investment that customers are willing to make in new technologies
developed by the industry and the company, and risks inherent in global expansion. when necessary, we will modify our financial and operating strategies to reflect changes in market conditions and risks.
proposed transaction with faiveley transport s.a.
on july 27, 2015, the company announced plans to acquire faiveley transport s.a. ("faiveley transport"), a leading global provider of value-added, integrated systems and services for the railway industry with annual sales of about $1.2 billion and more than 5,700 employees in 24 countries.  faiveley transport supplies railway manufacturers, operators and maintenance providers with a range of valued-added, technology-based systems and services in energy & comfort (air conditioning, power collectors and converters, and passenger information), access & mobility (passenger access systems and platform doors), and brakes & safety (braking systems and couplers).
the transaction has been structured in three steps:
•   wabtec made an irrevocable offer to the owners of approximately 51% of faiveley transport's shares for a purchase price of €100 per share, payable 25% in cash and 75% in wabtec preferred stock. the preferred stock will have a 1% annual dividend or, if greater, the annual dividend assuming full conversion into common shares, and must be converted after three years into wabtec common shares at an implied ratio of one faiveley transport common share for 1.125 wabtec common shares. shareholders owning 51% of faiveley transport have entered into exclusive discussions with wabtec.
•   upon completion of required labor group consultations, on october 6, 2015, the 51% shareholders entered into a definitive share purchase agreement and faiveley transport entered into an acquisition agreement with wabtec.
•   upon completing the share purchase, wabtec will commence a tender offer for the remaining publicly traded faiveley transport shares. the public shareholders will have the option to elect to receive €100 per share in cash or wabtec preferred stock. the preferred stock portion of the consideration is subject to a cap of 75% of faiveley transport's common shares. wabtec intends to delist faiveley transport from euronext after the tender offer if minority interests represent less than 5%.
the total purchase price offered is about $1.8 billion, including assumed debt.  wabtec plans to fund the cash portion of the transaction with cash on hand, existing credit facilities and potentially other credit and debt financing.  prior to december 31, 2015, wabtec set aside €186.9 million as an escrow deposit for the faiveley transport purchase. the combination of wabtec and faiveley transport would create one of the world's largest public rail equipment companies, with revenues of about $4.5 billion and a presence in all key freight rail and passenger transit geographies worldwide.
closing of the transaction is subject to various conditions, including completion of regulatory requirements. these steps are currently on-going and the timing of completion is unknown.

net sales increased by $263.5 million to $3,308.0 million in 2015 from $3,044.5 million in 2014. the increase is primarily due to a $156.5 million increase for specialty products and electronics sales from higher demand for freight original equipment products and aftermarket electronic and ptc electronic products. acquisitions increased sales $262.8 million and unfavorable foreign exchange decreased sales $151.8 million.
freight segment sales increased by $323.2 million, or 18.7%, primarily due to a $145.7 million increase for specialty products and electronics sales from higher demand for freight original equipment rail products, ptc electronics, and aftermarket rail products and $80.4 million for remanufacturing, overhaul and build products due to higher demand for aftermarket locomotive builds. acquisitions increased sales by $145.5 million and unfavorable foreign exchange decreased sales by $49.6 million.
transit segment sales decreased by $59.7 million, or 4.5%, due to a decrease of $102.3 million related to unfavorable foreign exchange, a $53.9 million decrease in remanufacturing, overhaul and build from lower demand for original transit locomotive because a multi-year project was substantially completed in 2014, and a $23.1 million decrease for brake products from lower demand for braking products in europe and braking systems in north america. these decreases were partially offset by $117.3 million in sales from acquisitions.

cost of sales increased by $151.7 million to $2,260.2 million in 2015 compared to $2,108.5 million in the same period of 2014.  for the twelve months ended 2015, cost of sales as a percentage of sales was 68.3% compared to 69.3% in the same period of 2014. the decrease of cost of sales as a percentage of sales is due to lower material costs primarily due to lower original equipment transit locomotive sales and higher specialty product and electronics sales.
freight segment cost of sales increased 0.5% as a percentage of sales to 66.3% in 2015 compared to 65.8% for the same period of 2014. the increase is primarily related to slightly lower margins related to recent acquisitions, and cost overruns on a project nearing completion, partially offset by higher specialty products and electronics sales.
transit segment cost of sales decreased 2.2% as a percentage of sales to 71.7% in 2015 compared to 73.9% for the same period in 2014. the decrease in 2015 is primarily due to lower material costs associated with lower original equipment locomotive sales and lower original equipment and aftermarket brake product sales which carry higher raw material content, partially offset by additional costs incurred on the closeout of several projects.
included in cost of sales is warranty expense. the provision for warranty expense is generally established for specific losses, along with historical estimates of customer claims as a percentage of sales, which can cause variability in warranty expense between quarters. warranty expense for the twelve months ended december 31, 2015 increased $1.3 million to $35.4 million from $34.1 million in 2014 primarily due to increased sales.

financing activities:
operating activities. in 2015, 2014 and 2013, cash provided by operations was $448.3 million, $472.4 million and $235.7 million, respectively. in comparison to 2014, cash provided by operations in 2015 decreased due to unfavorable working capital requirements partially offset by higher operating results. the unfavorable working capital requirements primarily related to an unfavorable change in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $132.0 million and $86.9 million, respectively. these cash outflows were partially offset by a favorable change in accounts receivable of $38.9 million driven by collections due to achieving certain project related milestones and a favorable change in inventory of $84.2 million due to successful efforts to control the amount of inventory on hand.
in comparison to 2013, cash provided by operations in 2014 increased due to reduced working capital compared to the prior year, coupled with higher operating results. the major components of the higher cash inflows were as follows: a positive change in accounts receivable of $132.3 million as the number of days to collect cash decreased, a positive change in other accrued liabilities and customer deposits of $117.6 million, and a positive change in accrued income taxes due to payment timing.  these cash inflows were partially offset by the following cash outflows: an unfavorable change in accounts payable of $5.6 million due to payment timing, and an unfavorable change or increase of $90.1 million in inventory as the company held more inventory to support the higher backlog of orders in 2015.
investing activities. in 2015, 2014 and 2013, cash used in investing activities was $380.1 million, $347.7 million and $258.7 million, respectively. the major components of the cash outflow in 2015 were planned additions to property, plant, and equipment of $49.4 million for continued investments in our facilities and manufacturing processes and $129.6 million in net cash paid for acquisitions.  this compares to $47.7 million for property, plant, and equipment and $300.4 million in net cash paid for acquisitions in 2014.  refer to note 4 of the "notes to condensed consolidated financial statements" for additional information on acquisitions.
financing activities. in 2015, cash used for financing activities was $248.9 million, which included $787.4 million in proceeds from the revolving credit facility debt, $612.7 million of repayments of debt on the revolving credit facility, $27.0 million of dividend payments and $387.8 million of wabtec stock repurchases. in 2014, cash provided by financing activities was $25.5 million, which included $563.4 million in proceeds from the revolving credit facility debt, $493.8 million of repayments of debt on the revolving credit facility, $19.2 million of dividend payments and $26.8 million of wabtec stock repurchases.

2013 refinancing credit agreement on december 19, 2013, the company amended its existing revolving credit facility with a consortium of commercial banks. this "2013 refinancing credit agreement" provides the company with a $800.0 million, five- year revolving credit facility. the company incurred approximately $1.0 million of deferred financing cost related to the 2013 refinancing credit agreement. the facility expires on december 19, 2018. the 2013 refinancing credit agreement borrowings bear variable interest rates indexed as described below. at december 31, 2015, the company had available bank borrowing capacity, net of $21.9 million of letters of credit, of approximately $333.1 million, subject to certain financial covenant restrictions.
under the 2013 refinancing credit agreement, the company may elect a base rate of interest for u.s. dollar denominated loans or, for certain currencies, an interest rate based on the london interbank offered rate ("libor") of interest, or other rates appropriate for such currencies (in any case, "the alternate rate"). the base rate adjusts on a daily basis and is the greater of the federal funds effective rate plus 0.5% per annum, the pnc, n.a. prime rate or the daily libor rate plus 100 basis points, plus a margin that ranges from 0 basis points to 75 basis points . the alternate rate is based on the quoted rates specific to the applicable currency, plus a margin that ranges from 75 basis points to 175 basis points. both the base rate and alternate rate margins are dependent on the company's consolidated total indebtedness to cash flow ratios. the initial base rate margin is 0 basis points and the alternate rate margin is 75 basis points.
at december 31, 2015, the weighted average interest rate on the company's variable rate debt was 1.10%.  on january 12, 2012, the company entered into a forward starting interest rate swap agreement with a notional value of $150.0 million. the effective date of the interest rate swap agreement is july 31, 2013, and the termination date is november 7, 2016. the impact of the interest rate swap agreement converts a portion of the company's outstanding debt from a variable rate to a fixed-rate borrowing. during the term of the interest rate swap agreement the interest rate on the notional value will be fixed at 1.415% plus the alternate rate margin. on june 5, 2014, the company entered into a forward starting interest rate swap agreement with a notional value of $150.0 million.  the effective date of the interest rate swap agreement is november 7, 2016, and the termination date is december 19, 2018.  the impact of the interest rate swap agreement converts a portion of the company's outstanding debt from a variable rate to a fixed-rate borrowing.  during the term of the interest rate swap agreement the interest rate on the notional value will be fixed at 2.56% plus the alternate rate margin.  as for these agreements, the company is exposed to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties.  however, since only the cash interest payments are exchanged, exposure is significantly less than the notional amount.  the counterparties are large financial institutions with an excellent credit rating and history of performance.  the company currently believes the risk of nonperformance is negligible.
the 2013 refinancing credit agreement limits the company's ability to declare or pay cash dividends and prohibits the company from declaring or making other distributions, subject to certain exceptions. the 2013 refinancing credit agreement contains various other covenants and restrictions including the following limitations: incurrence of additional indebtedness; mergers, consolidations, sales of assets and acquisitions; additional liens; sale and leasebacks; permissible investments, loans and advances; certain debt payments; and imposes a minimum interest expense coverage ratio of 3.0 and a maximum debt to cash flow ratio of 3.25. the company does not expect that these measurements will limit the company in executing it's operating activities. see note 9 of "notes to consolidated financial statements" included in part iv, item 15 of this report.

critical accounting estimates the preparation of the financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions regarding uncertainties that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses. areas of uncertainty that require judgments, estimates and assumptions include the accounting for allowance for doubtful accounts, inventories, the testing of goodwill and other intangibles for impairment, warranty reserves, pensions and other postretirement benefits, stock based compensation and tax matters. management uses historical experience and all available information to make these judgments and estimates, and actual results will inevitably differ from those estimates and assumptions that are used to prepare the company's financial statements at any given time. despite these inherent limitations, management believes that management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (md&a) and the financial statements and related footnotes provide a meaningful and fair perspective of the company. a discussion of the judgments and uncertainties associated with accounting for derivatives and environmental matters can be found in notes 3 and 19, respectively, in the "notes to consolidated financial statements" included in part iv, item 15 of this report.
a summary of the company's significant accounting policies is included in note 3 in the "notes to consolidated financial statements" included in part iv, item 15 of this report and is incorporated by reference herein. management believes that the application of these policies on a consistent basis enables the company to provide the users of the financial statements with useful and reliable information about the company's operating results and financial condition.
accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts:
description the company provides an allowance for doubtful accounts to cover anticipated losses on uncollectible accounts receivable.
judgments and uncertainties  the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable reflects our best estimate of probable losses inherent in our receivable portfolio determined on the basis of historical experience, specific allowances for known troubled accounts and other currently available evidence.
effect if actual results differ from assumptions  if our estimates regarding the collectability of troubled accounts, and/or our actual losses within our receivable portfolio exceed our historical experience, we may be exposed to the expense of increasing our allowance for doubtful accounts.
description inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market and are reviewed to ensure that an adequate provision is recognized for excess, slow moving and obsolete inventories.
judgments and uncertainties cost is determined under the first-in, first-out (fifo) method. inventory costs include material, labor and overhead. the company compares inventory components to prior year sales history and current backlog and anticipated future requirements. to the extent that inventory parts exceed estimated usage and demand, a reserve is recognized to reduce the carrying value of inventory. also, specific reserves are established for known inventory obsolescence.
effect if actual results differ from assumptions if the market value of our products were to decrease due to changing market conditions, the company could be at risk of incurring write-downs to adjust inventory value to a market value lower than stated cost. if our estimates regarding sales and backlog requirements are inaccurate, we may be exposed to the expense of increasing our reserves for slow moving and obsolete inventory.
goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles:
description goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles are required to be tested for impairment at least annually. the company performs its annual impairment test during the fourth quarter and more frequently when indicators of impairment are present. the company reviews goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level. the evaluation of impairment involves comparing the current fair value of the business to the recorded value (including goodwill).
judgments and uncertainties a number of significant assumptions and estimates are involved in the application of the impairment test, including the identification of macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors, overall financial performance, wabtec specific events and share price trends and making the assessment on whether each relevant factor will impact the impairment test positively or negatively and the magnitude of any such amount.
effect if actual results differ from assumptions management considers historical experience and all available information at the time the fair values of its reporting units are estimated. however, actual amounts realized may differ from those used to evaluate the impairment of goodwill. if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and judgments used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values, we may be exposed to impairment losses that could be material to our results of operations. for example, based on the last quantitative analysis performed as of october 1, 2013, a decline in the terminal growth rate greater than 50 basis points would decrease fair market value by $175.2 million, or an increase in the weighted-average cost of capital by 100 basis points would result in a decrease in fair market value by $482.9 million. even with such changes the fair value of the reporting units would be greater than their net book values, necessitating no step 2 calculations. see note 3 in the "notes to consolidated financial statements" included in part iv, item 15 of this report for additional discussion regarding impairment testing.
description the company provides warranty reserves to cover expected costs from repairing or replacing products with durability, quality or workmanship issues occurring during established warranty periods.
judgments and uncertainties in general, reserves are provided for as a percentage of sales, based on historical experience. in addition, specific reserves are established for known warranty issues and their estimable losses.
effect if actual results differ from assumptions if actual results are not consistent with the assumptions and judgments used to calculate our warranty liability, the company may be at risk of realizing material gains or losses.
accounting for pensions and postretirement benefits:
description the company provides pension and postretirement benefits for its employees.  these amounts are determined using actuarial methodologies and incorporate significant assumptions, including the rate used to discount the future estimated liability, the long-term rate of return on plan assets and several assumptions relating to the employee workforce (salary increases, medical costs, retirement age and mortality).
judgments and uncertainties significant judgments and estimates are used in determining the liabilities and expenses for pensions and other postretirement benefits. the rate used to discount future estimated liabilities is determined considering the rates available at year-end on debt instruments that could be used to settle the obligations of the plan. the long-term rate of
return is estimated by considering historical returns and expected returns on current and projected asset allocations and is generally applied to a five-year average market value of assets.  the differences between actual and expected asset returns are recognized in expense using the normal amortization of gains and losses per asc 715.
effect if actual results differ from assumptions if assumptions used in determining the pension and other postretirement benefits change significantly, these costs can fluctuate materially from period to period. the key assumptions in determining the pension and other postretirement expense and obligation include the discount rate, expected return on assets and health care cost trend rate. for example, a 1% decrease or increase in the discount rate used in determining the pension and postretirement expense would increase expense $2.0 million or decrease expense $2.3 million, respectively. a 1% decrease or increase in the discount rate used in determining the pension and postretirement obligation would increase the obligation $34.7 million or decrease the obligation $42.6 million, respectively. a 1% decrease or increase in the expected return on assets used in determining the pension expense would increase or decrease expense $2.1 million, respectively. if the actual asset values at december 31, 2015 had been 1% lower, the amortization of losses in the following year would decrease $0.1 million. a 1% decrease or increase in the health care cost trend rate used in determining the postretirement expense would increase the expense $0.04 million or decrease expense $0.02 million. a 1% decrease or increase in the health care cost trend rate used in determining the postretirement obligation would increase or decrease the obligation $0.3 million, respectively.
description the company has issued incentive stock units to eligible employees that vest upon attainment of certain cumulative three-year performance goals. the program is structured as a rolling three-year plan; each year starts a new three-year performance cycle with the most recently commenced cycle being 2013-2015. no incentive stock units will vest for performance below the three-year cumulative threshold.  the company utilizes an economic profit measure for this performance goal.  economic profit is a measure of the extent to which the company produces financial results in excess of its cost of capital.  based on the company's achievement of the threshold and three-year cumulative performance, the stock units vested can range from 0% to 200% of the shares granted.
judgments and uncertainties significant judgments and estimates are used in determining the estimated three-year performance, which is then used to estimate the total shares expected to vest over the three year vesting cycle and corresponding expense based on the grant date fair value of the award.  when determining the estimated three-year performance, the company utilizes a combination of historical actual results, budgeted results and forecasts.  in the initial grant year of a performance cycle, the company estimates the three-year performance at 100%.  as actual performance results for a cycle begin to accumulate and the company completes its budgeting and forecasting cycles the performance estimates are updated.  these judgments and estimates are reviewed and updated on a quarterly basis.
effect if actual results differ from assumptions if assumptions used in determining the estimated three-year performance change significantly, stock-based compensation expense related to the unvested incentive stock awards can fluctuate materially from period to period.  for example a 10% decrease or increase in the estimated vesting percentage for incentive stock awards would decrease or increase stock-based compensation expense by approximately $1.4 million and $1.4 million, respectively.
description wabtec records an estimated liability or benefit for income and other taxes based on what it determines will likely be paid in various tax jurisdictions in which it operates in accordance with asc 740-10 accounting for income taxes and accounting for uncertainty in income taxes.
judgments and uncertainties the estimate of our tax obligations are uncertain because management must use judgment to estimate the exposures associated with our various filing positions, as well as realization of our deferred tax assets. asc 740-10 establishes a recognition and measurement threshold to determine the amount of tax benefit that should be recognized related to uncertain tax positions.
effect if actual results differ from assumptions management uses its best judgment in the determination of these amounts. however, the liabilities ultimately realized and paid are dependent on various matters including the resolution of the tax audits in the various affected tax jurisdictions and may differ from the amounts recorded. an adjustment to the estimated liability would be recorded through income in the period in which it becomes probable that the amount of the actual liability differs from the recorded amount. a deferred tax valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
revenue recognition:
description revenue is recognized in accordance with asc-605 "revenue recognition." the company recognizes revenues on long-term contracts based on the percentage of completion method of accounting. the units-of-delivery method or other input-based or output-based measures, as appropriate, are used to measure the progress toward completion of individual contracts. contract revenues and cost estimates are reviewed and revised at a minimum quarterly and adjustments are reflected in the accounting period as such amounts are determined. certain pre-production costs relating to long term production and supply contracts have been deferred and will be recognized over the life of the contracts.
judgments and uncertainties revenue is recognized when products have been shipped to the respective customers, title has passed and the price for the product has been determined. contract accounting involves a judgmental process of estimating the total sales and costs for each contract, which results in the development of estimated profit margin percentages. for each contract with revenue recognized using the percentage of completion method, the amount reported as revenues is determined by calculating cost incurred to date as a percentage of the total expected contract costs to determine the percentage of total contract revenue to be recognized in the current period. due to the size, duration and nature of many of our contracts, the estimation of total sales and costs through completion is complicated and subject to many variables. total contract sales estimates are based on negotiated contract prices and quantities, modified by our assumptions regarding contract options, change orders, and price adjustment clauses (such as inflation or index-based clauses). total contract cost estimates are largely based on negotiated or estimated purchase contract terms, historical performance trends, business base and other economic projections. factors that influence these estimates include inflationary trends, technical and schedule risk, internal and subcontractor performance trends, business volume assumptions, asset utilization, and anticipated labor agreements. for long-term contracts, revenues and cost estimates are reviewed and revised quarterly at a minimum and adjustments are reflected in the accounting period as such amounts are determined. pre-production costs are recognized over the expected life of the contract usually based on the company's progress toward the estimated number of units expected to be delivered under the production or supply contract.
effect if actual results differ from assumptions should market conditions and customer demands dictate changes to our standard shipping terms, the company may be impacted by longer than typical revenue recognition cycles. the development of expected contract costs and contract profit margin percentages involves procedures and personnel in all areas that provide financial or production information on the status of contracts. due to the significance of judgment in the estimation process, it is likely that materially different revenue amounts could be recorded if we used different assumptions or if the underlying circumstances were to change. changes in underlying assumptions/estimates, supplier performance, or circumstances may adversely or positively affect financial performance in future periods. if the combined profit margin for all contracts recognized on the percentage of completion method during 2015 had been estimated to be higher or lower by 1%, it would have increased or decreased revenue and gross profit for the year by approximately $12.2 million. a few of our contracts are expected to be completed in a loss position. provisions are made currently for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts. a charge to expense for unrecognized portions of pre-production costs could be realized if the company's estimate of the number of units to be delivered changes or the underlying contract is cancelled.

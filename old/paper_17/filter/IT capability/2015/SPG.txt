item 1a.    risk factors the following factors, among others, could cause our actual results to differ materially from those contained in forward-looking statements made in this annual report on form 10-k and presented elsewhere by our management from time to time. these factors may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations, funds from operations, or ffo, and prospects, which we refer to herein as a material adverse effect on us or as materially and adversely affecting us, and you should carefully consider them. additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or which are currently not believed to be material may also affect our actual results. we may update these factors in our future periodic reports.
risks relating to retail operations overall economic and market conditions may adversely affect the general retail environment.
our concentration in the retail real estate market means that we are subject to a number of factors that could adversely affect the retail environment generally, including, without limitation:
 changes in international, national, regional and local economic conditions;
 local real estate conditions, such as an oversupply of, or reduction in demand for, retail space or retail goods, decreases in rental rates, declining real estate values and the availability and creditworthiness of tenants;
 the potential for terrorist activities.
we derive our operating results primarily from retail tenants, many of whom have been and continue to be under some degree of economic stress. a significant deterioration in the creditworthiness of our retail tenants could have a material adverse effect on us.
our properties are typically anchored by department stores and other large nationally recognized tenants. the value of some of our properties could be materially and adversely affected if these anchors or other major tenants fail to comply with their contractual obligations or cease their operations.
for example, among department stores and other large stores  often referred to as "big box" stores  corporate merger activity typically results in the closure of duplicate or geographically overlapping store locations. further, sustained adverse pressure on the results of our department stores and major tenants may have a similarly sustained adverse impact upon our own results. certain department stores and other national retailers have experienced, and may continue to experience for the foreseeable future given current macroeconomic uncertainty and less-than-desirable levels of consumer
confidence, considerable decreases in customer traffic in their retail stores, increased competition from alternative retail options such as those accessible via the internet and other forms of pressure on their business models. as pressure on these department stores and national retailers increases, their ability to maintain their stores, meet their obligations both to us and to their external lenders and suppliers, withstand takeover attempts by investors or rivals or avoid bankruptcy and/or liquidation may be impaired and result in closures of their stores or their seeking of a lease modification with us. any lease modification could be unfavorable to us as the lessor and could decrease rents or expense recovery charges. other tenants may be entitled to modify the economic or other terms of, or terminate, their existing leases with us in the event of such closures.
if a department store or major tenant were to close its stores at our properties, we may experience difficulty and delay and incur significant expense in replacing the tenant, as well as in leasing spaces in areas adjacent to the vacant department store or major tenant, at attractive rates, or at all. additionally, department store or major tenant closures may result in decreased customer traffic, which could lead to decreased sales at our properties. if the sales of stores operating in our properties were to decline significantly due to the closing of anchor stores or other national retailers, adverse economic conditions, or other reasons, tenants may be unable to pay their minimum rents or expense recovery charges. in the event of any default by a tenant, we may not be able to fully recover, and/or may experience delays and costs in enforcing our rights as landlord to recover, amounts due to us under the terms of our agreements with such parties.
bankruptcy filings by retailers can occur regularly in the course of our operations. if a tenant files for bankruptcy, the tenant may have the right to reject and terminate one or more of its leases with us, and we cannot be sure that it will affirm one or more of its leases and continue to make rental payments to us in a timely manner. a bankruptcy filing by, or relating to, one of our tenants would bar all efforts by us to collect pre-bankruptcy debts from that tenant, or from their property, unless we receive an order permitting us to do so from the bankruptcy court. in addition, we cannot evict a tenant solely because of its bankruptcy. if a lease is assumed by the tenant in bankruptcy, all pre-bankruptcy balances due under the lease must be paid to us in full. however, if a lease is rejected by a tenant in bankruptcy, we would have only a general unsecured claim for damages in connection with such balances. if a bankrupt tenant vacates a space, it might not do so in a timely manner, and we might be unable to re-lease the vacated space during that time at attractive rates, or at all. furthermore, we may be required to incur significant expense in replacing the bankrupt tenant. any unsecured claim we hold against a bankrupt tenant might be paid only to the extent that funds are available and only in the same percentage as is paid to all other holders of unsecured claims, and there are restrictions under bankruptcy laws that limit the amount of the claim we can make if a lease is rejected. as a result, it is likely that we would recover substantially less than the full value of any unsecured claims we hold. we continually seek to re-lease vacant spaces resulting from tenant terminations. the bankruptcy of a tenant, particularly an anchor tenant or a national tenant with multiple locations, may make the re-leasing of their space difficult and costly, and it also may be more difficult to lease the remainder of the space at the affected properties. future tenant bankruptcies may impact our ability to successfully execute our re-leasing strategy and could materially and adversely affect us.
we face a wide range of competition that could affect our ability to operate profitably.
our properties compete with other retail properties and other forms of retailing such as catalogs and e-commerce websites. competition may come from malls, outlet centers, community/lifestyle centers, and other shopping centers, both existing as well as future development and redevelopment/expansion projects, as well as catalogs and e-commerce. the presence of competitive alternatives affects our ability to lease space and the level of rents we can obtain. new construction, renovations and expansions at competing sites could also negatively affect our properties.
we also compete with other major real estate investors and developers for attractive investment opportunities and prime development sites. competition for the acquisition of existing properties and development sites may result in increased purchase prices and may adversely affect our ability to make attractive investments on favorable terms, or at all. in addition, we compete with other retail property companies for tenants and qualified management.
risks relating to real estate investments and operations we face risks associated with the acquisition, development, redevelopment and expansion of properties.
we regularly acquire and develop new properties and redevelop and expand existing properties, and these activities are subject to various risks. we may not be successful in pursuing acquisition, development or redevelopment/expansion opportunities. in addition, newly acquired, developed or redeveloped/expanded properties may not perform as well as
expected, impacting our anticipated return on investment. we are subject to other risks in connection with any acquisition, development and redevelopment/expansion activities, including the following:
 acquisition or construction costs of a project may be higher than projected, potentially making the project unfeasible or unprofitable;
 occupancy rates and rents may not meet our projections and the project may not be profitable; and
 we may need the consent of third parties such as department stores, anchor tenants, mortgage lenders and joint venture partners, and those consents may be withheld.
if a development or redevelopment/expansion project is unsuccessful, either because it is not meeting our expectations when operational or was not completed according to the project planning, we could lose our investment in the project. further, if we guarantee the property's financing, our loss could exceed our investment in the project.
our properties represent a substantial portion of our total consolidated assets. these investments are relatively illiquid. as a result, our ability to sell one or more of our properties or investments in real estate in response to any changes in economic, industry, or other conditions may be limited. the real estate market is affected by many factors, such as general economic conditions, availability and terms of financing, interest rates and other factors, including supply and demand for space, that are beyond our control. if we want to sell a property, we cannot assure you that we will be able to dispose of it in the desired time period or at all or that the sales price of a property will be attractive at the relevant time or even exceed the carrying value of our investment. moreover, if a property is mortgaged, we may not be able to obtain a release of the lien on that property without the payment of the associated debt and/or a substantial prepayment penalty, which could restrict our ability to dispose of the property, even though the sale might otherwise be desirable.
our international activities may subject us to different or greater risk from those associated with our domestic operations.
as of december 31, 2015, we held interests in joint venture properties that operate in austria, italy, japan, malaysia, mexico, the netherlands, south korea, canada, and the united kingdom. we also have an equity stake in klépierre, a publicly-traded european real estate company which operates in 16 countries in europe. accordingly, our operating results and the value of our international operations may be impacted by any unhedged movements in the foreign currencies in which those operations transact and in which our net investment in the international operation is held. we may pursue additional investment, development and redevelopment/expansion opportunities outside the united states. international investment, ownership, development and redevelopment/expansion activities carry risks that are different from those we face with our domestic properties and operations. these risks include, but are not limited to:
 changes in foreign political and economic environments, regionally, nationally, and locally;
 challenges of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws, including corporate governance, operations, taxes and litigation;
 changes in applicable laws and regulations in the united states that affect international operations;
our international activities represented approximately 7.9% of our net operating income, or noi, for the year ended december 31, 2015. to the extent that we expand our international activities, the above risks could increase in significance, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on us.
as of december 31, 2015, our consolidated mortgages and unsecured indebtedness, excluding related premium and discount, totaled $22.5 billion. as a result of this indebtedness, we are required to use a substantial portion of our cash flows for debt service, including selected repayment at scheduled maturities, which limits our ability to use those cash flows to fund the growth of our business. we are also subject to the risks normally associated with debt financing, including the risk that our cash flows from operations will be insufficient to meet required debt service or that we will be able to refinance such indebtedness on acceptable terms, or at all. our debt service costs generally will not be reduced if developments at the applicable property, such as the entry of new competitors or the loss of major tenants, cause a reduction in the income from the property. our indebtedness could also have other adverse consequences on us, including reducing our access to capital or increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic, industry and market conditions. in addition, if a property is mortgaged to secure payment of indebtedness and income from such property is insufficient to pay that indebtedness, the property could be foreclosed upon by the mortgagee resulting in a loss of income and a decline in our total asset value. if any of the foregoing occurs, we could be materially and adversely affected.
disruption in the capital and credit markets may adversely affect our ability to access external financings for our growth and ongoing debt service requirements.
we depend on external financings, principally debt financings, to fund the growth of our business and to ensure that we can meet ongoing maturities of our outstanding debt. our access to financing depends on the willingness of lending institutions and other debt investors to grant credit to us and conditions in the capital markets in general. an economic recession may cause extreme volatility and disruption in the capital and credit markets. we rely upon the credit facilities as sources of funding for numerous transactions. our access to these funds is dependent upon the ability of each of the participants to the credit facilities to meet their funding commitments to us. when markets are volatile, access to capital and credit markets could be disrupted over an extended period of time and one or more financial institutions may not have the available capital to meet their previous commitments to us. the failure of one or more participants to the credit facilities to meet their funding commitments to us could have a material adverse effect on us, including as a result of making it difficult to obtain the financing we may need for future growth and/or meeting our debt service requirements. we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain the financing we need for the future growth of our business or to meet our debt service requirements, or that a sufficient amount of financing will be available to us on favorable terms, or at all.
adverse changes in our credit rating could affect our borrowing capacity and borrowing terms.
the operating partnership's outstanding senior unsecured notes, credit facilities, the commercial paper program, and simon's preferred stock are periodically rated by nationally recognized credit rating agencies. the credit ratings are based on our operating performance, liquidity and leverage ratios, financial condition and prospects, and other factors viewed by the credit rating agencies as relevant to our industry and the economic outlook in general. our credit rating can affect the amount of capital we can access, as well as the terms of any financing we obtain. since we depend primarily on debt financing to fund the growth of our business, an adverse change in our credit rating, including actual changes and changes in outlook, or even the initiation of a review of our credit rating that could result in an adverse change, could have a material adverse effect on us.
the agreements that govern our indebtedness contain various covenants that impose restrictions on us that might affect our ability to operate freely.
we have a variety of unsecured debt, including the credit facilities, and secured property-level debt. certain of the agreements that govern our indebtedness contain covenants, including, among other things, limitations on our ability to incur secured and unsecured indebtedness, sell all or substantially all of our assets and engage in mergers and certain acquisitions. in addition, certain of the agreements that govern our indebtedness contain financial covenants that require us to maintain certain financial ratios, including certain coverage ratios. these covenants may restrict our ability to pursue certain business initiatives or certain transactions that might otherwise be advantageous to us. in addition, our ability to comply with these provisions might be affected by events beyond our control. failure to comply with any of our financing covenants could result in an event of default, which, if not cured or waived, could accelerate the related indebtedness as well as other of our indebtedness, which could have a material adverse effect on us.
our hedging interest rate protection arrangements may not effectively limit our interest rate risk.
we selectively manage our exposure to interest rate risk by a combination of interest rate protection agreements to effectively fix or cap all or a portion of our variable rate debt. in addition, we refinance fixed rate debt at times when we believe rates and other terms are appropriate. our efforts to manage these exposures may not be successful.
our use of interest rate hedging arrangements to manage risk associated with interest rate volatility may expose us to additional risks, including a risk that a counterparty to a hedging arrangement may fail to honor its obligations or that we could be required to fund our contractual payment obligations under such arrangements in relatively large amounts or on short notice. developing an effective interest rate risk strategy is complex and no strategy can completely insulate us from risks associated with interest rate fluctuations. there can be no assurance that our hedging activities will have the desired beneficial impact on our results of operations, liquidity or financial condition. termination of these hedging agreements typically involves costs, such as transaction fees or breakage costs.
risks relating to income taxes we have elected to be taxed as a reit in the united states and certain of our international operations currently receive favorable tax treatment.
we are subject to certain income-based taxes, both domestically and internationally, and other taxes, including state and local taxes, franchise taxes, and withholding taxes on dividends from certain of our international investments. we currently receive favorable tax treatment in various domestic and international jurisdictions through tax rules and regulations or through international treaties. should we no longer receive such benefits, the amount of taxes we pay may increase.
in the united states, we have elected to be taxed as a reit under sections 856 through 860 of the internal revenue code. we believe we have been organized and operated in a manner which allows us to qualify for taxation as a reit under the internal revenue code. we intend to continue to operate in this manner. however, our qualification and taxation as a reit depend upon our ability to meet, through actual annual operating results, asset diversification, distribution levels and diversity of stock ownership, the various qualification tests imposed under the internal revenue code. reit qualification is governed by highly technical and complex provisions for which there are only limited judicial or administrative interpretations. accordingly, there is no assurance that we have operated or will continue to operate in a manner so as to qualify or remain qualified as a reit.
if we fail to comply with those provisions, we may be subject to monetary penalties or ultimately to possible disqualification as a reit. if such events occurs, and if available relief provisions do not apply:
 we will not be allowed a deduction for distributions to stockholders in computing our reit taxable income;
 we will be subject to corporate level income tax, including any applicable alternative minimum tax, on our reit taxable income at regular corporate rates; and
 unless entitled to relief under relevant statutory provisions, we will also be disqualified from treatment as a reit for the four taxable years following the year during which qualification was lost.
reit distribution requirements could adversely affect our liquidity and our ability to execute our business plan.
in order for us to qualify to be taxed as a reit, and assuming that certain other requirements are also satisfied, we generally must distribute at least 90% of our reit taxable income, determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding any net capital gains, to our stockholders each year, so that federal corporate income tax does not apply to earnings that we distribute. to the extent that we satisfy this distribution requirement and qualify for taxation as a reit, but distribute less than 100% of our reit taxable income, determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and including any net capital gains, we will be subject to federal corporate income tax on our undistributed net taxable income. in addition, we will be subject to a 4% nondeductible excise tax if the actual amount that we distribute to our stockholders in a calendar year is less than "the required minimum distribution amount" specified under federal income tax laws. we intend to make distributions to our stockholders to comply with the reit requirements of the internal revenue code.
from time to time, we might generate taxable income greater than our cash flow as a result of differences in timing between the recognition of taxable income and the actual receipt of cash or the effect of nondeductible capital expenditures, the creation of reserves, or required debt or amortization payments. if we do not have other funds available in these situations, we could be required to access capital on unfavorable terms (the receipt of which cannot be assured), sell assets at disadvantageous prices, distribute amounts that would otherwise be invested in future acquisitions, capital
expenditures or repayment of debt, or make taxable distributions of our capital stock or debt securities to make distributions sufficient to enable us to pay out enough of our taxable income to satisfy the reit distribution requirement and avoid corporate income tax and the 4% excise tax in a particular year. these alternatives could increase our costs or reduce our equity. further, amounts distributed will not be available to fund the growth of our business. thus, compliance with the reit requirements may adversely affect our ability to execute our business plan.
complying with reit requirements might cause us to forego otherwise attractive acquisition opportunities or liquidate otherwise attractive investments.
to qualify to be taxed as a reit for federal income tax purposes, we must ensure that, at the end of each calendar quarter, at least 75% of the value of our assets consist of cash, cash items, government securities and "real estate assets" (as defined in the internal revenue code), including certain mortgage loans and securities. the remainder of our investments (other than government securities, qualified real estate assets and securities issued by a taxable reit subsidiary, or trs) generally cannot include more than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of any one issuer or more than 10% of the total value of the outstanding securities of any one issuer.
additionally, in general, no more than 5% of the value of our total assets (other than government securities, qualified real estate assets and securities issued by a trs) can consist of the securities of any one issuer, and no more than 25% (20% for taxable years beginning after december 31, 2017) of the value of our total assets can be represented by securities of one or more trss. if we fail to comply with these requirements at the end of any calendar quarter, we must correct the failure within 30 days after the end of the calendar quarter or qualify for certain statutory relief provisions to avoid losing our reit qualification and suffering adverse tax consequences. as a result, we might be required to liquidate or forego otherwise attractive investments. these actions could have the effect of reducing our income and amounts available for distribution to our stockholders.
in addition to the asset tests set forth above, to qualify to be taxed as a reit, we must continually satisfy tests concerning, among other things, the sources of our income, the amounts we distribute to our stockholders and the ownership of our shares. we might be unable to pursue investments that would be otherwise advantageous to us in order to satisfy the source-of-income or asset-diversification requirements for qualifying as a reit. thus, compliance with the reit requirements may hinder our ability to make certain attractive investments.
new partnership tax audit rules could have a material adverse effect on us.
the recently enacted bipartisan budget act of 2015 changes the rules applicable to federal income tax audits of partnerships. under the new rules (which are generally effective for taxable years beginning after december 31, 2017), among other changes and subject to certain exceptions, any audit adjustment to items of income, gain, loss, deduction, or credit of a partnership (and any partner's distributive share thereof) is determined, and taxes, interest, or penalties attributable thereto are assessed and collected, at the partnership level. although it is uncertain how these new rules will be implemented, it is possible that they could result in partnerships in which we directly or indirect invest being required to pay additional taxes, interest and penalties as a result of an audit adjustment, and we, as a direct or indirect partner of these partnerships, could be required to bear the economic burden of those taxes, interest, and penalties even though we, as a reit, may not otherwise have been required to pay additional corporate-level taxes had we owned the assets of the partnership directly. the new partnership tax audit rules will apply to the operating partnership and its subsidiaries that are classified as partnerships for federal income tax purposes. the changes created by these new rules are sweeping and in many respects dependent on the promulgation of future regulations or other guidance by the u.s. department of the treasury, or the treasury, and, accordingly, there can be no assurance that these rules will not have a material adverse effect on us.
legislative, administrative, regulatory or other actions affecting reits, including positions taken by the irs, could have a material adverse effect on us or our investors.
the rules dealing with federal income taxation are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process, and by the irs and the treasury. changes to the tax laws or interpretations thereof by the irs and the treasury, with or without retroactive application, could materially and adversely affect us or our investors. new legislation, treasury regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions could significantly and negatively affect our ability to qualify to be taxed as a reit and/or the federal income tax consequences to us and our investors of such qualification.
risks relating to joint ventures we have limited control with respect to some properties that are partially owned or managed by third parties, which may adversely affect our ability to sell or refinance them.
as of december 31, 2015, we owned interests in 94 income-producing properties with other parties. of those, 13 properties are included in our consolidated financial statements. we account for the other 81 properties, or the joint venture properties, as well as our investment in klépierre and our joint ventures with seritage growth properties, or seritage, and hudson's bay company, or hbc, using the equity method of accounting. we serve as general partner or property manager for 58 of these 81 properties; however, certain major decisions, such as approving the operating budget and selling, refinancing and redeveloping the properties require the consent of the other owners. of the properties for which we do not serve as general partner or property manager, 20 are in our international joint ventures. the international properties are managed locally by joint ventures in which we share control of the properties with our partner. the other owners have participating rights that we consider substantive for purposes of determining control over the properties' assets. the remaining joint venture properties, klépierre (a publicly traded, paris-based real estate company), and our joint venture with hbc are managed by third parties.
these investments, and other future similar investments could involve risks that would not be present were a third party not involved, including the possibility that partners or other owners might become bankrupt, suffer a deterioration in their creditworthiness, or fail to fund their share of required capital contributions. partners or other owners could have economic or other business interests or goals that are inconsistent with our own business interests or goals, and could be in a position to take actions contrary to our policies or objectives.
these investments, and other future similar investments, also have the potential risk of creating impasses on decisions, such as a sale or financing, because neither we nor our partner or other owner has full control over the partnership or joint venture. disputes between us and partners or other owners might result in litigation or arbitration that could increase our expenses and prevent our officers and/or directors from focusing their time and efforts on our business. consequently, actions by, or disputes with, partners or other owners might result in subjecting properties owned by the partnership or joint venture to additional risk. in addition, we risk the possibility of being liable for the actions of our partners or other owners.
joint venture debt is the liability of the joint venture and is typically secured by a mortgage on the joint venture property, which is non-recourse to us. nevertheless, the joint venture's failure to satisfy its debt obligations could result in the loss of our investment therein. as of december 31, 2015, the operating partnership guaranteed joint venture related mortgage indebtedness of $353.7 million (of which we have a right of recovery from our venture partners of $112.8 million). a default by a joint venture under its debt obligations may expose us to liability under a guaranty. we may elect to fund cash needs of a joint venture through equity contributions (generally on a basis proportionate to our ownership interests), advances or partner loans, although such fundings are not typically required contractually or otherwise.
risks relating to environmental matters as owners of real estate, we can face liabilities for environmental contamination.
federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment may require us, as a current or previous owner or operator of real property, to investigate and clean up hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum product releases at a property or at impacted neighboring properties. these laws often impose liability regardless of whether the property owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of hazardous or toxic substances. these laws and regulations may require the abatement or removal of asbestos containing materials in the event of damage, demolition or renovation, reconstruction or expansion of a property and also govern emissions of and exposure to asbestos fibers in the air. those laws and regulations also govern the installation, maintenance and removal of underground storage tanks used to store waste oils or other petroleum products. many of our properties contain, or at one time contained, asbestos containing materials or underground storage tanks (primarily related to auto service center establishments or emergency electrical generation equipment). we may be subject to regulatory action and may also be held liable to third parties for personal injury or property damage incurred by the parties in connection with any such laws and regulations or hazardous or toxic substances. the costs of investigation, removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances, and related liabilities, may be substantial and could materially and adversely affect us. the presence of hazardous or toxic substances, or the failure to remediate the related contamination, may also adversely affect our ability to sell, lease or redevelop a property or to borrow money using a property as collateral.
our efforts to identify environmental liabilities may not be successful.
although we believe that our portfolio is in substantial compliance with federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations regarding hazardous or toxic substances, this belief is based on limited testing. nearly all of our properties have been subjected to phase i or similar environmental audits. these environmental audits have not revealed, nor are we aware of, any environmental liability that we believe is reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on us. however, we cannot assure you that:
 previous environmental studies with respect to the portfolio reveal all potential environmental liabilities;
 any previous owner, occupant or tenant of a property did not create any material environmental condition not known to us;
 the current environmental condition of the portfolio will not be affected by tenants and occupants, by the condition of nearby properties, or by other unrelated third parties; or
 future uses or conditions (including, without limitation, changes in applicable environmental laws and regulations or the interpretation thereof) will not result in environmental liabilities.
we face possible risks associated with climate change.
we cannot determine with certainty whether global warming or cooling is occurring and, if so, at what rate. to the extent climate change causes changes in weather patterns, our properties in certain markets could experience increases in storm intensity and rising sea-levels. over time, these conditions could result in volatile or decreased demand for retail space at certain of our properties or, in extreme cases, our inability to operate the properties at all. climate change may also have indirect effects on our business by increasing the cost of (or making unavailable) insurance on favorable terms, or at all, and increasing the cost of energy and snow removal at our properties. moreover, compliance with new laws or regulations related to climate change, including compliance with "green" building codes, may require us to make improvements to our existing properties or increase taxes and fees assessed on us or our properties. at this time, there can be no assurance that climate change will not have a material adverse effect on us.
we maintain insurance coverage with third-party carriers who provide a portion of the coverage for specific layers of potential losses, including commercial general liability, fire, flood, extended coverage and rental loss insurance on all of our properties in the united states. the initial portion of coverage not provided by third-party carriers is either insured through our wholly-owned captive insurance companies or other financial arrangements controlled by us. a third-party carrier has, in turn, agreed, if required, to provide evidence of coverage for this layer of losses under the terms and conditions of the carrier's policy. a similar policy written through our captive insurance companies also provides initial coverage for property insurance and certain windstorm risks at the properties located in coastal windstorm locations.
there are some types of losses, including lease and other contract claims, that generally are not insured or are subject to large insurance deductibles. if an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occurs, or a loss for which a large deductible occurs, we could lose all or a portion of the capital we have invested in a property, as well as the anticipated future revenue it could generate, but may remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial obligation related to the property.
we currently maintain insurance coverage against acts of terrorism on all of our properties in the united states on an "all risk" basis in the amount of up to $1 billion. the current federal laws which provide this coverage are expected to operate through 2020. however, the u.s. government could in the future terminate its reinsurance of terrorism, which would increase the risk of uninsured losses for terrorist acts. despite the existence of this insurance coverage, or actual or threatened terrorist attacks or other activity where we operate could materially and adversely affect us.
we face risks associated with security breaches through cyber-attacks, cyber intrusions or otherwise, as well as other significant disruptions of our information technology (it) networks and related systems.
we face risks associated with security breaches, whether through cyber-attacks or cyber intrusions over the internet, malware, computer viruses, attachments to e-mails, persons inside our organization or persons with access to systems inside our organization, and other significant disruptions of our it networks and related systems. the risk of a security breach or disruption, particularly through cyber-attack or cyber intrusion, including by computer hackers, foreign
governments and cyber terrorists, has generally increased as the number, intensity and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions from around the world have increased. our it networks and related systems are essential to the operation of our business and our ability to perform day-to-day operations (including managing our building systems). although we make efforts to maintain the security and integrity of these types of it networks and related systems, and we have implemented various measures to manage the risk of a security breach or disruption, there can be no assurance that our security efforts and measures will be effective or that attempted security breaches or disruptions would not be successful or damaging. even the most well protected information, networks, systems and facilities remain potentially vulnerable because the techniques used in such attempted security breaches evolve and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, and in some cases are designed not to be detected and, in fact, may not be detected. accordingly, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate security barriers or other preventative measures, and thus it is impossible for us to entirely mitigate this risk.
a breach or significant and extended disruption in the functioning of our systems, including our primary website, could damage our reputation and cause us to lose customers, tenants and revenues, generate third party claims, result in the unintended and/or unauthorized public disclosure or the misappropriation of proprietary, personal identifying and confidential information, and require us to incur significant expenses to address and remediate or otherwise resolve these kinds of issues, and we may not be able to recover these expenses in whole or in any part from our service providers or responsible parties, or their or our insurers.
our success depends, in part, on our ability to attract and retain talented employees, and the loss of any one of our key personnel could adversely impact our business.
the success of our business depends, in part, on the leadership and performance of our executive management team and key employees, and our ability to attract, retain and motivate talented employees could significantly impact our future performance. competition for these individuals is intense, and we cannot assure you that we will retain our key executive management team and employees or that we will be able to attract and retain other highly qualified individuals for these positions in the future. losing any one or more of these persons could have a material adverse effect on us.
our charter contains a general restriction on the accumulation of shares in excess of 8% of our capital stock. the charter permits the members of the simon family and related persons to own up to 18% of our capital stock. ownership is determined by the lower of the number of outstanding shares, voting power or value controlled. our board of directors may, by majority vote, permit exceptions to those levels in circumstances where our board of directors determines our ability to qualify as a reit will not be jeopardized. these restrictions on ownership may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a transaction or a change in control that might otherwise be in the best interest of our stockholders. other provisions of our charter and by-laws could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control even if some stockholders deem such a change to be in their best interests. these include provisions preventing holders of our common stock from acting by written consent and requiring that up to four directors in the aggregate may be elected by holders of class b common stock. in addition, certain provisions of the operating partnership's partnership agreement could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control. these include a provision requiring the consent of a majority in interest of units in order for us, as general partner of the operating partnership, to, among other matters, engage in a merger transaction or sell all or substantially all of our assets.
item 7.    management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto that are included in this annual report on form 10-k.
overview simon property group, inc., simon or the company, is a delaware corporation that operates as a self-administered and self-managed real estate investment trust, or reit, under the internal revenue code of 1986, as amended, or the internal revenue code. reits will generally not be liable for federal corporate income taxes as long as they distribute not less than 100% of their reit taxable income. simon property group, l.p., or the operating partnership, is our majority-owned partnership subsidiary that owns all of our real estate properties and other assets. in this discussion, the terms "we", "us" and "our" refer to simon, the operating partnership, and its subsidiaries.
we own, develop and manage retail real estate properties, which consist primarily of malls, premium outlets®, and the mills®. as of december 31, 2015, we owned or held an interest in 209 income-producing properties in the united states, which consisted of 108 malls, 71 premium outlets, 14 mills, four lifestyle centers, and 12 other retail properties in 37 states and puerto rico. we opened four outlets in 2015 and have three outlets and two other significant retail projects under development. in addition, we have redevelopment and expansion projects, including the addition of anchors, big box tenants, and restaurants, underway at 29 properties in the u.s. and europe. internationally, as of december 31, 2015, we had ownership interests in nine premium outlets in japan, three premium outlets in south korea, two premium outlets in canada, one premium outlet in mexico, and one premium outlet in malaysia. as of december 31, 2015, we had a noncontrolling ownership interest in a joint venture that holds five outlet properties in europe and one outlet property in canada. of the five properties in europe, two are located in italy and one each is located in austria, the netherlands, and the united kingdom. additionally, as of december 31, 2015, we owned a 20.3% equity stake in klépierre sa, or klépierre, a publicly traded, paris-based real estate company, which owns, or has an interest in, shopping centers located in 16 countries in europe.
we generate the majority of our revenues from leases with retail tenants including:
 recoverable expenditures such as property operating, real estate taxes, repair and maintenance, and advertising and promotional expenditures.
we invest in real estate properties to maximize total financial return which includes both operating cash flows and capital appreciation. we seek growth in earnings, funds from operations, or ffo, and cash flows by enhancing the profitability and operation of our properties and investments. we seek to accomplish this growth through the following:
 attracting and retaining high quality tenants and utilizing economies of scale to reduce operating expenses,
 expanding and re-tenanting existing highly productive locations at competitive rental rates,
 selectively acquiring or increasing our interests in high quality real estate assets or portfolios of assets,
 generating consumer traffic in our retail properties through marketing initiatives and strategic corporate alliances, and
we also grow by generating supplemental revenue from the following activities:
 establishing our malls as leading market resource providers for retailers and other businesses and consumer-focused corporate alliances, including payment systems (such as handling fees relating to the sales of bank-issued prepaid cards), national marketing alliances, static and digital media initiatives, business development, sponsorship, and events,
 offering property operating services to our tenants and others, including waste handling and facility services, and the provision of energy services,
 generating interest income on cash deposits and investments in loans, including those made to related entities.
we focus on high quality real estate across the retail real estate spectrum. we expand or redevelop properties to enhance profitability and market share of existing assets when we believe the investment of our capital meets our risk-reward criteria. we selectively develop new properties in markets we believe are not adequately served by existing retail outlet properties.
we routinely review and evaluate acquisition opportunities based on their ability to enhance our portfolio. our international strategy includes partnering with established real estate companies and financing international investments with local currency to minimize foreign exchange risk.
to support our growth, we employ a three-fold capital strategy:
 provide the capital necessary to fund growth,
 maintain sufficient flexibility to access capital in many forms, both public and private, and
 manage our overall financial structure in a fashion that preserves our investment grade credit ratings.
we consider ffo, net operating income, or noi, and comparable property noi (noi for properties owned and operated in both periods under comparison) to be key measures of operating performance that are not specifically defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states, or gaap. we use these measures internally to evaluate the operating performance of our portfolio and provide a basis for comparison with other real estate companies. reconciliations of these measures to the most comparable gaap measure are included below in this discussion.
 improved operating performance and core business fundamentals in 2015 and the impact of our acquisition and expansion activity,
 increased consolidated lease settlement activity of $25.9 million, or $0.07 per diluted share,
 a 2015 gain of $80.2 million, or $0.22 per diluted share, from the sale of marketable securities, and
 a 2015 gain on acquisitions and disposals of $250.5 million, or $0.69 per diluted share, related to a non-cash gain on klépierre's acquisition of corio n.v., or corio, of $206.9 million, or $0.57 per diluted share, and gains of $43.6 million, or $0.12 per diluted share, due to the disposition of our interests in three unconsolidated properties,
 a 2014 gain on acquisitions and disposals of $158.3 million, or $0.44 per diluted share, primarily related to klépierre's sale of a portfolio of 126 retail galleries of which our share of the gain was $133.9 million, or $0.37 per diluted share.
core business fundamentals improved during 2015, primarily driven by higher tenant sales and strong leasing activity. portfolio noi grew by 7.1% in 2015 as compared to 2014. comparable property noi also grew 3.7% for our portfolio of u.s. malls, premium outlets, and the mills. total sales per square foot, or psf, increased 0.1% from $619 psf at december 31, 2014, to $620 psf at december 31, 2015, for our u.s. malls and premium outlets. average base minimum rent for u.s. malls and premium outlets increased 4.1% to $48.96 psf as of december 31, 2015, from $47.01 psf as of december 31, 2014. releasing spreads remained positive in our u.s. malls and premium outlets as we were able to lease available square feet at higher rents than the expiring rental rates on the same space, resulting in a releasing spread (based on total tenant payments  base minimum rent plus common area maintenance) of $10.62 psf ($69.64 openings compared to $59.02 closings) as of december 31, 2015, representing a 18.0% increase over expiring payments. ending occupancy for our u.s. malls and premium outlets was 96.1% as of december 31, 2015, as compared to 97.1% as of december 31, 2014, a decrease of 100 basis points primarily as a result of tenant bankruptcy activity announced in the first quarter of 2015.
our effective overall borrowing rate at december 31, 2015 on our consolidated indebtedness decreased 53 basis points to 3.88% as compared to 4.41% at december 31, 2014. this reduction was primarily due to a decrease in the effective overall borrowing rate on fixed rate debt of 51 basis points (4.12% at december 31, 2015 as compared to 4.63% at december 31, 2014). at december 31, 2015, the weighted average years to maturity of our consolidated indebtedness was 5.9 years as compared to 6.2 years at december 31, 2014.
our financing activities for the year ended december 31, 2015, included:
 acquiring two properties  jersey gardens in elizabeth, new jersey (renamed the mills at jersey gardens) and university park village in fort worth, texas, subject to existing fixed-rate mortgage loans of $350.0 million and $55.0 million, respectively, which mature on november 1, 2020 and may 1, 2028 and bear interest of 3.83% and 3.85%, respectively.
 issuing $500.0 million of senior unsecured notes at a fixed interest rate of 2.50% with a maturity date of september 1,
2020 and $600.0 million of senior unsecured notes at a fixed interest rate of 3.50% with a maturity date of september 1, 2025 on august 17, 2015.
 redeeming at par or repaying at maturity $693.5 million of senior unsecured notes with fixed interest rates ranging from 5.10%
 completing the early redemption of two series of senior unsecured notes comprising $1.0 billion with fixed interest rates of 6.13% and 7.38%. we recorded a $121.0 million loss on extinguishment of debt in the fourth quarter of 2015 as a result of the early redemption.
 issuing €750.0 million ($798.3 million u.s. dollar equivalent) of senior unsecured notes at a fixed interest rate of 1.38% with a maturity date of november 18, 2022.
 increasing our borrowings of $815.0 million on our $4.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility, or credit facility, which we used to partially fund the early redemption of senior unsecured notes on december 21, 2015; we repaid these credit facility borrowings in full on january 14, 2016 with proceeds from a january 13, 2016 unsecured notes issuance.
united states portfolio data the portfolio data discussed in this overview includes the following key operating statistics: ending occupancy, average base minimum rent per square foot, and total sales per square foot for our domestic assets. we include acquired properties in this data beginning in the year of acquisition and remove disposed properties in the year of disposition. the washington prime properties have been removed from the portfolio data for all periods presented. for comparative purposes, we separate the information related to the mills from our other u.s. operations. we also do not include any properties located outside the united states.
 properties we account for under the equity method of accounting as joint ventures, and
total sales per square foot.    total sales include total reported retail tenant sales on a trailing 12-month basis at owned gla (for mall stores with less than 10,000 square feet) in the malls and the mills and stores with less than 20,000 square feet in the premium outlets. retail sales at owned gla affect revenue and profitability levels because sales determine the amount of minimum rent that can be charged, the percentage rent realized, and the recoverable expenses (common area maintenance, real estate taxes, etc.) that tenants can afford to pay.
current leasing activities during 2015, we signed 803 new leases and 1,594 renewal leases (excluding mall anchors and majors, new development, redevelopment, expansion, downsizing and relocation) with a fixed minimum rent across our u.s. malls and premium outlets portfolio, comprising approximately 7.5 million square feet, of which 5.8 million square feet related to consolidated properties. during 2014, we signed 773 new leases and 1,581 renewal leases with a fixed minimum rent,
comprising approximately 7.4 million square feet, of which 5.5 million square feet related to consolidated properties. the average annual initial base minimum rent for new leases was $55.24 per square foot in 2015 and $58.57 per square foot in 2014 with an average tenant allowance on new leases of $36.66 per square foot and $38.83 per square foot, respectively.
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies, including making estimates and assumptions. we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. these judgments affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. if our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions had been different, it is possible that different accounting policies would have been applied resulting in a different presentation of our financial statements. from time to time, we reevaluate our estimates and assumptions. in the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual results, adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current information. below is a discussion of accounting policies that we consider critical in that they may require complex judgment in their application or require estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain. for a summary of our significant accounting policies, see note 3 of the notes to consolidated financial statements.
 we, as a lessor, retain substantially all of the risks and benefits of ownership of the investment properties and account for our leases as operating leases. we accrue minimum rents on a straight-line basis over the terms of their respective leases. substantially all of our retail tenants are also required to pay overage rents based on sales over a stated base amount during the lease year. we recognize overage rents only when each tenant's sales exceed its sales threshold.
 we review investment properties for impairment on a property-by-property basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of investment properties may not be recoverable. these circumstances include, but are not limited to, a decline in a property's cash flows, occupancy or comparable sales per square foot. we measure any impairment of investment property when the estimated undiscounted operating income before depreciation and amortization plus its residual value is less than the carrying value of the property. to the extent impairment has occurred, we charge to income the excess of carrying value of the property over its estimated fair value. we may decide to sell properties that are held for use and the sale prices of these properties may differ from their carrying values. we also review our investments, including investments in unconsolidated entities, if events or circumstances change indicating that the carrying amount of our investments may not be recoverable. we will record an impairment charge if we determine that a decline in the fair value of the investments below carrying value is other-than-temporary. changes in economic and operating conditions that occur subsequent to our review of recoverability of investment property and other investments could impact the assumptions used in that assessment and could result in future charges to earnings if assumptions regarding those investments differ from actual results.
 to maintain our status as a reit, we must distribute at least 90% of our reit taxable income in any given year and meet certain asset and income tests. we monitor our business and transactions that may potentially impact our reit status. in the unlikely event that we fail to maintain our reit status, and available relief provisions do not apply, we would be required to pay federal income taxes at regular corporate income tax rates during the period we did not qualify as a reit. if we lost our reit status, we could not elect to be taxed as a reit for four taxable years following the year during which qualification was lost unless our failure was due to reasonable cause and certain other conditions were met. as a result, failing to maintain reit status would result in a significant increase in the income tax expense recorded and paid during those periods.
 we make estimates as part of our valuation of the purchase price of acquisitions (including the components of excess investment in joint ventures) to the various components of the acquisition based upon the fair value of each component. the most significant components of our valuations are typically the determination of fair value to the buildings as-if-vacant, land and market value of in-place leases. in the case of the fair value of buildings and fair value of land and other intangibles, our estimates of the values of these components will affect the amount of depreciation we record over the estimated useful life of the property acquired or the remaining lease term. in the case of the market value of in-place leases, we make our best estimates of the tenants' ability to pay rents based upon the tenants' operating performance at the property, including the competitive position of the property in its market as well as sales psf, rents psf, and overall occupancy cost for the tenants in place at the acquisition date. our assumptions affect the amount of future revenue that we will recognize over the remaining lease term for the acquired in-place leases.
 a variety of costs are incurred in the development and leasing of properties. after determination is made to capitalize a cost, it is allocated to the specific component of a project that is benefited. determination of when a development project is substantially complete and capitalization must cease involves a degree of judgment.
the costs of land and buildings under development include specifically identifiable costs. the capitalized costs include pre-construction costs essential to the development of the property, development costs, construction costs, interest costs, real estate taxes, salaries and related costs and other costs incurred during the period of development. we consider a construction project as substantially completed and held available for occupancy and cease capitalization of costs upon opening.
results of operations in addition to the activity discussed above in the "results overview" section, the following acquisitions, openings, and dispositions of consolidated properties affected our consolidated results from continuing operations in the comparative periods:
 on january 15, 2015, we acquired a 100% interest in jersey gardens (renamed the mills at jersey gardens) in elizabeth, new jersey and university park village in fort worth, texas, properties previously owned by glimcher realty trust.
 during 2013, we disposed of two malls, four community centers, and two retail properties.
in addition to the activities discussed above and in "results overview", the following acquisitions, dispositions, and openings of joint venture properties affected our income from unconsolidated entities in the comparative periods:
 during the third quarter of 2015, we closed on our previously announced joint venture with hudson's bay company, or hbc, whereby we currently have an 8.9% noncontrolling interest in a joint venture to which hbc contributed 42 of its properties in the u.s. later in the third quarter of 2015, the joint venture acquired an additional
41 properties in germany concurrently with hbc's acquisition of galeria holding, the parent company of germany's leading department store, kaufhof, as further discussed in note 7 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements. all of the joint venture's properties have been leased to affiliates of hbc.
 during the second quarter of 2015, we formed a joint venture with sears holdings, or sears, whereby we have a 50% noncontrolling interest in a joint venture in which sears contributed 10 of its properties located at our malls. seritage growth properties, or seritage, now holds sears' interest in the joint venture.
 on august 14, 2014, we and our partner opened twin cities premium outlets, a 409,000 square foot outlet center. we have a 35%
 on april 16, 2014, klépierre disposed of a portfolio of 126 properties located in france, spain, and italy.
 on april 10, 2014, through a european joint venture, we acquired an additional 22.5% noncontrolling interest in ashford designer outlet, increasing our ownership interest in this property to 45%.
 on october 16, 2013, through a european joint venture, we acquired noncontrolling interests in portions of four designer outlets, which include parndorf (vienna, austria), la reggia (naples, italy), noventa di piave (venice, italy), and roermond (roermond, netherlands).
 on april 19, 2013, we and our partner, mitsubishi estate co., ltd., opened shisui premium outlets, a 230,000
 a $80.2 million gain on the sale of marketable securities in the second quarter of 2015,
property operating expense increased $27.4 million, due to a $12.1 million increase related to the property transactions, and a $15.3 million increase in comparable property activity as a result of inflationary cost increases.
real estate taxes increased $48.7 million, of which the property transactions accounted for $15.3 million, with the remaining increase primarily caused by higher tax estimates in 2015.
during 2015, we recorded a provision for credit losses of $6.6 million whereas in the prior year the provision was $12.0 million, a reflection of the overall strong economic health of our tenants.
other expenses increased $11.2 million primarily due to an increase in legal costs and professional fees as well as acquisition-related costs in the first quarter of 2015, partially offset by a favorable net foreign currency revaluation impact on foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilities.
interest expense decreased $68.9 million primarily due to the net impact of our financing activities during 2015 and 2014 and the reduction in our effective overall borrowing rate as previously discussed.
income from unconsolidated entities increased $58.0 million primarily due to favorable results of operations and financing activity of joint venture properties as well as our acquisition and development activity.
during 2015, we disposed of our interests in three unconsolidated retail properties resulting in a gain of $43.6 million and we recorded a non-cash gain on klépierre's acquisition of corio of $206.9 million as discussed in note 3 of the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements. during 2014, we recorded a gain related to klépierre's sale of a portfolio of 126 properties and our disposal of three retail properties. additionally, in 2014, we acquired the remaining 50% interest in arizona mills from our joint venture partner. the property was previously accounted for under the equity method and we recognized a non-cash gain upon consolidation of this property. the aggregate gain recognized on these 2014 transactions was $158.3 million.
tenant reimbursements increased $104.2 million, due to a $14.8 million increase attributable to the property transactions and an $89.4 million, or 7.6%, increase in the comparable properties primarily due to utility reimbursements, annual fixed contractual increases related to common area maintenance, real estate tax recoveries and additional marketing recoveries related to costs incurred during our property rebranding initiative and increased digital and social media advertising costs.
total other income increased $32.7 million, principally as a result of a $16.1 million increase in lease settlement income, a $8.3 million increase attributable to dividend income and a $7.6 million increase in land sale activity.
property operating expense increased $27.6 million due to a $6.5 million increase related to the property transactions, and a $21.1 million increase related to the comparable properties primarily as a result of increased utility expenses partially due to the harsh winter.
depreciation and amortization expense increased $36.1 million primarily due to the additional depreciable assets related to the property transactions and our continued redevelopment and expansion activities.
advertising and promotion increased $18.8 million primarily related to costs incurred during our property rebranding initiative and increased digital and social media advertising costs.
provision for credit losses increased $4.8 million as a result of increased reserves due to an increase in tenant bankruptcies and a decrease in recoveries as compared to 2013. the 2014 expense is in line with longer term historical levels.
interest expense decreased $89.5 million primarily due to the net impact of our financing activities during 2014 and the reduction in the effective overall borrowing rate.
income from unconsolidated entities increased $20.4 million primarily due to favorable results from operations from the development and redevelopment of joint venture properties and 2013 results including an extinguishment charge related to the refinancing of aventura mall.
during 2014, we recorded a gain related to klépierre's sale of a portfolio of 126 properties and our disposal of three retail properties. additionally, we acquired the remaining 50% interest in arizona mills from our joint venture partner. the property was previously accounted for under the equity method and we recognized a non-cash gain upon consolidation of this property. the aggregate gain recognized on these transactions was $158.3 million. during 2013, we disposed of our interest in two malls, four community centers, and five retail properties and recorded a gain on the acquisition of an outlet center. the aggregate gain recognized on these transactions was approximately $93.4 million.
discontinued operations decreased $117.3 million due to 2014 including approximately five months of ownership of the washington prime properties, whereas 2013 included twelve full months of ownership of those properties. the 2013 results also included a $14.2 million gain on the disposal of three strip centers held within a joint venture portfolio of washington prime properties. additionally, on february 28, 2014 one strip center was sold by that same joint venture for a gain of $0.2 million. in 2014, we also incurred $38.2 million in transaction costs related to the washington prime spin-off.
liquidity and capital resources because we own long-lived income-producing assets, our financing strategy relies primarily on long-term fixed rate debt. floating rate debt comprised only 9.4% of our total consolidated debt at december 31, 2015. we also enter into interest rate protection agreements to manage our interest rate risk. we derive most of our liquidity from positive net cash flow from operations and distributions of capital from unconsolidated entities that totaled $3.8 billion in the aggregate during 2015. in addition, the credit facility, the operating partnership's $2.75 billion supplemental unsecured revolving credit facility, or supplemental facility, and together with the credit facility, the credit facilities, and the commercial paper program provide alternative sources of liquidity as our cash needs vary from time to time. borrowing capacity under these sources may be increased as discussed further below.
on december 31, 2015, we had an aggregate available borrowing capacity of approximately $4.6 billion under the credit facility and the supplemental facility, net of outstanding borrowings of $1.2 billion, and amounts outstanding under the commercial paper program and letters of credit of $36.9 million. for the year ended december 31, 2015, the maximum amount outstanding under the two credit facilities was $1.8 billion and the weighted average amount outstanding was $1.2 billion. the weighted average interest rate was 0.79% for the year ended december 31, 2015. further, on october 6, 2014, the operating partnership entered into the global commercial paper program and on march 2, 2015, increased the maximum aggregate program size from $500.0 million to $1.0 billion as further discussed below.
we have historically had access to public equity and long and short-term unsecured debt markets and access to secured debt and private equity from institutional investors at the property level.
our business model and status as a reit require us to regularly access the debt markets to raise funds for acquisition, development and redevelopment activity, and to refinance maturing debt. we may also, from time to time, access the equity capital markets to accomplish our business objectives. we believe we have sufficient cash on hand and availability under the credit facility, the supplemental facility, and the commercial paper program to address our debt maturities and capital needs through 2016.
cash flows our net cash flow from operating activities and distributions of capital from unconsolidated entities totaled $3.8 billion during 2015. in addition, we had net proceeds from our debt financing and repayment activities, including the $121.0 million debt extinguishment charge, of $1.2 billion in 2015. these activities are further discussed below under "financing and debt." during 2015, we also:
 funded the acquisition of two properties, acquired the land and existing structure anchored to one of our wholly owned properties, funded an additional equity stake in klépierre, funded the acquisition of our joint venture interest in ten assets that are adjacent to our existing properties, funded our portion of a joint venture development project, and funded the purchase of a noncontrolling interest in a joint venture, the aggregate cash portion of which was $1.4 billion,
 paid stockholder dividends and unitholder distributions totaling $2.2 billion,
 funded consolidated capital expenditures of $1.0 billion (including development and other costs of $138.8 million, redevelopment and expansion costs of $699.1 million, and tenant costs and other operational capital expenditures of $183.1 million),
 funded investments in unconsolidated entities of $329.9 million,
 funded the repurchase of our common stock and the purchase of limited partner units of $505.7 million, and
 received proceeds on the sale of marketable securities of $504.0 million.
in general, we anticipate that cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet operating expenses, monthly debt service, recurring capital expenditures, and dividends to stockholders necessary to maintain our reit qualification on a long-term basis. in addition, we expect to be able to generate or obtain capital for nonrecurring capital expenditures, such as acquisitions, major building redevelopments and expansions, as well as for scheduled principal maturities on outstanding indebtedness, from:
 excess cash generated from operating performance and working capital reserves,
 borrowings on our credit facilities and commercial paper program,
 additional secured or unsecured debt financing, or
 additional equity raised in the public or private markets.
we expect to generate positive cash flow from operations in 2016, and we consider these projected cash flows in our sources and uses of cash. these cash flows are principally derived from rents paid by our retail tenants. a significant deterioration in projected cash flows from operations could cause us to increase our reliance on available funds from the credit facilities and commercial paper program, curtail planned capital expenditures, or seek other additional sources of financing as discussed above.
financing and debt unsecured debt at december 31, 2015, our unsecured debt consisted of $13.5 billion of senior unsecured notes of the operating partnership, net of discounts, $1.2 billion outstanding under the credit facility, $240.0 million outstanding under an unsecured term loan, and $878.7 million outstanding under the operating partnership's commercial paper program. the december 31, 2015 balance on the credit facility included $237.8 million (u.s. dollar equivalent) of euro-denominated borrowings and $184.8 million (u.s. dollar equivalent) of yen-denominated borrowings. at december 31, 2015 the outstanding amount under the commercial paper program was $878.7 million, of which $188.1 million was related to the u.s. dollar equivalent of euro-denominated notes. foreign currency denominated borrowings under both the credit facility and commercial paper program are designated as net investment hedges of a portion of our international investments.
on december 31, 2015, we had an aggregate available borrowing capacity of $4.6 billion under the credit facility and the supplemental facility. the maximum aggregate outstanding balance under the two credit facilities during the year ended december 31, 2015 was $1.8 billion and the weighted average outstanding balance was $1.2 billion. letters of credit of $36.9 million were outstanding under the two credit facilities as of december 31, 2015.
the credit facility's initial borrowing capacity of $4.0 billion may be increased to $5.0 billion during its term and provides for borrowings denominated in u.s. dollars, euros, yen, sterling, canadian dollars and australian dollars. borrowings in currencies other than the u.s. dollar are limited to 75% of the maximum revolving credit amount, as defined. the initial maturity date of the credit facility is june 30, 2018 and can be extended for an additional year to june 30, 2019 at our sole option, subject to continued compliance with the terms thereof. the base interest rate on the credit facility is libor plus 80 basis points with an additional facility fee of 10 basis points.
on march 2, 2015, the operating partnership amended and extended the supplemental facility. the initial borrowing capacity of $2.0 billion has been increased to $2.75 billion, may be further increased to $3.5 billion during its term, will initially mature on june 30, 2019 and can be extended for an additional year to june 30, 2020 at our sole option, subject to our continued compliance with the terms thereof. the base interest rate on the amended supplemental facility was reduced to libor plus 80 basis points and the additional facility fee was reduced to 10 basis points. the supplemental facility provides for borrowings denominated in u.s. dollars, euros, yen, sterling, canadian dollars and australian dollars.
on march 2, 2015, the operating partnership increased the maximum aggregate program size of its commercial paper program from $500.0 million to $1.0 billion, or the non-u.s. dollar equivalent thereof. the operating partnership may issue unsecured commercial paper notes, denominated in u.s. dollars, euros and other currencies. notes issued in non-u.s. currencies may be issued by one or more subsidiaries of the operating partnership and are guaranteed by the operating partnership. notes are sold under customary terms in the u.s. and euro commercial paper note markets and rank (either by themselves or as a result of the guarantee described above) pari passu with the operating partnership's other unsecured senior indebtedness. the commercial paper program is supported by the credit facilities and if necessary or appropriate, we may make one or more draws under either of the credit facilities to pay amounts outstanding from time to time on the commercial paper program. at december 31, 2015, we had $878.7 million outstanding under the commercial paper program, comprised of $690.6 million outstanding in u.s. dollar denominated notes and $188.1 million (u.s. dollar equivalent) of euro denominated notes with weighted average interest rates of 0.43% and 0.03%, respectively. the borrowings mature on various dates from january 4, 2016 to april 18, 2016 and reduce amounts otherwise available under the credit facilities.
on august 17, 2015, the operating partnership issued $500.0 million of senior unsecured notes at a fixed interest rate of 2.50% with a maturity date of september 1, 2020 and $600.0 million of senior unsecured notes at a fixed interest rate of 3.50% with a maturity date of september 1, 2025. proceeds from the unsecured notes offering were used to repay debt and for general corporate purposes.
on november 18, 2015, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the operating partnership issued €750.0 million ($798.3 million u.s. dollar equivalent) of senior unsecured notes at a fixed interest rate of 1.38% with a maturity date of november 18, 2022. proceeds from the unsecured notes offering were used to pay down a portion of euro-denominated borrowings on the credit facility.
during 2015, we redeemed at par or repaid at maturity $693.5 million of senior unsecured notes with fixed interest rates ranging from 5.10% to 5.75% and completed the early redemption of two series of senior unsecured notes comprising $1.0 billion with fixed interest rates of 6.13% and 7.38%. we recorded a $121.0 million loss on extinguishment of debt in the fourth quarter of 2015 as a result of the early redemption. further, on february 1, 2016, we redeemed at par $163.3 million of senior unsecured notes with a fixed interest rate of 6.10%.
on january 13, 2016, the operating partnership issued $550.0 million of senior unsecured notes at a fixed interest rate of 2.50% with a maturity date of july 15, 2021 and $800.0 million of senior unsecured notes at a fixed interest rate of 3.30% with a maturity date of january 15, 2026. proceeds from the unsecured notes offering were used to pay down the credit facility, unencumber three assets and redeem senior unsecured notes at par in february 2016 and for general corporate purposes.
during the year ended december 31, 2015, we repaid $259.3 million in mortgage loans, with a weighted average interest rate of 5.51%, unencumbering five properties.
on january 15, 2015, we acquired two properties  jersey gardens in elizabeth, new jersey (renamed the mills at jersey gardens) and university park village in fort worth, texas, subject to existing fixed-rate mortgage loans of $350.0 million and $55.0 million, respectively. the loans mature on november 1, 2020 and may 1, 2028 and bear interest at 3.83% and 3.85%, respectively.
covenants our unsecured debt agreements contain financial covenants and other non-financial covenants. if we were to fail to comply with these covenants, after the expiration of the applicable cure periods, the debt maturity could be accelerated or other remedies could be sought by the lender including adjustments to the applicable interest rate. as of december 31, 2015, we were in compliance with all covenants of our unsecured debt.
at december 31, 2015, we or our subsidiaries were the borrowers under 44 non-recourse mortgage notes secured by mortgages on 49 properties, including four separate pools of cross-defaulted and cross-collateralized mortgages encumbering a total of 11 properties. under these cross-default provisions, a default under any mortgage included in the cross-defaulted pool may constitute a default under all mortgages within that pool and may lead to acceleration of the indebtedness due on each property within the pool. certain of our secured debt instruments contain financial and other non-financial covenants which are specific to the properties which serve as collateral for that debt. if the applicable borrower under these non-recourse mortgage notes fails to comply with these covenants, the lender could accelerate the debt and enforce its right against their collateral. at december 31, 2015, the applicable borrowers under these non-recourse mortgage notes were in compliance with all covenants where non-compliance could individually, or giving effect to applicable cross-default provisions in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity or results of operations.

our off-balance sheet arrangements consist primarily of our investments in joint ventures which are common in the real estate industry and are described in note 7 to the notes to consolidated financial statements. our joint ventures typically fund their cash needs through secured debt financings obtained by and in the name of the joint venture entity. the joint venture debt is secured by a first mortgage, is without recourse to the joint venture partners, and does not represent a liability of the partners, except to the extent the partners or their affiliates expressly guarantee the joint venture debt. as of december 31, 2015, the operating partnership guaranteed joint venture related mortgage indebtedness of $353.7 million (of which we have a right of recovery from our venture partners of $112.8 million). mortgages guaranteed by us are secured by the property of the joint venture which could be sold in order to satisfy the outstanding obligation and which has an estimated fair value in excess of the guaranteed amount. we may elect to fund cash needs of a joint venture through equity contributions (generally on a basis proportionate to our ownership interests), advances or partner loans, although such fundings are not required contractually or otherwise.
acquisitions and dispositions buy-sell, marketing rights, and other exit mechanisms are common in real estate partnership agreements. most of our partners are institutional investors who have a history of direct investment in retail real estate. we and our partners in our joint venture properties may initiate these provisions (subject to any applicable lock up or similar restrictions). if we determine it is in our stockholders' best interests for us to purchase the joint venture interest and we believe we have adequate liquidity to execute the purchase without hindering our cash flows, then we may initiate these provisions or elect to buy our partner's interest. if we decide to sell any of our joint venture interests, we expect to use the net proceeds to reduce outstanding indebtedness or to reinvest in development, redevelopment, or expansion opportunities.
acquisitions.    on january 15, 2015, we acquired a 100% interest in jersey gardens (renamed the mills at jersey gardens) in elizabeth, new jersey and university park village in fort worth, texas, properties previously owned by glimcher realty trust, for $677.9 million of cash and the assumption of existing mortgage debt of $405.0 million.
dispositions.    we continue to pursue the disposition of properties that no longer meet our strategic criteria or that are not a primary retail venue within their trade area.
joint venture formation activity on april 13, 2015, we announced a joint venture with sears, whereby sears contributed 10 of its properties located at our malls to the joint venture in exchange for a 50% noncontrolling interest in the joint venture. we contributed
$114.0 million in cash in exchange for a 50% noncontrolling interest in the joint venture. sears or its affiliates are leasing back each of the 10 properties from the joint venture. the joint venture has the right to recapture not less than 50% of the space leased to sears to be used for purposes of redeveloping and releasing the recaptured space. we will provide development, leasing and management services to the joint venture for any recaptured space. on july 7, 2015, we separately invested approximately $33.0 million in exchange for 1,125,760 common shares of seritage, a public reit recently formed by sears. seritage now holds sears' interest in the joint venture.
on july 22, 2015, we closed on our previously announced joint venture with hbc, to which hbc contributed 42 properties in the u.s. and we committed to contribute $100.0 million for improvements to the properties contributed by hbc in exchange for a noncontrolling interest in the newly formed joint venture. as of december 31, 2015, we have funded $1.0 million of this commitment. on september 30, 2015, hbc announced it had closed on the acquisition of galeria holding, the parent company of germany's leading department store, kaufhof. in conjunction with the closing, the joint venture acquired 41 kaufhof properties in germany from hbc. all of the joint venture's properties have been leased to affiliates of hbc. we contributed an additional $178.5 million to the joint venture upon closing of the galeria holding transaction. our noncontrolling interest in the joint venture is currently approximately 8.9%.
development activity new domestic developments, redevelopments and expansions.    during 2015, construction began on the following properties:
on april 23, 2015, we announced a partnership with swire properties inc. and whitman family development to jointly develop the approximately 500,000 square foot shopping center component of brickell city centre, a mixed-use development in downtown miami. we own a 25% interest in the retail component of this project, which is scheduled to open in september 2016. our share of the estimated cost of this project is approximately $110.0 million.
we routinely incur costs related to construction for significant redevelopment and expansion projects at our properties. redevelopment and expansion projects, including the addition of anchors and big box tenants, are underway at 27 properties in the u.s.
summary of capital expenditures.    the following table summarizes total capital expenditures on consolidated properties on a cash basis (in millions):
operational capital expenditures                                 92            79            75
capital expenditures on washington prime properties                           32            93
our share of the costs of all development and redevelopment projects currently under construction is approximately $2.1 billion. we expect to fund these capital projects with cash flows from operations. our estimated stabilized return on invested capital typically ranges between 8-12% for all of our new development, expansion and redevelopment projects.
international development activity.    we typically reinvest net cash flow from our international joint ventures to fund future international development activity. we believe this strategy mitigates some of the risk of our initial investment and our exposure to changes in foreign currencies. we have also funded most of our foreign investments with local currency-denominated borrowings that act as a natural hedge against fluctuations in exchange rates. our consolidated net income exposure to changes in the volatility of the euro, yen, won, and other foreign currencies is not material. we expect our share of international development costs for 2016 will be approximately $160.0 million, primarily funded through reinvested joint venture cash flow and construction loans.

dividends and stock repurchase program common stock cash dividends during 2015 aggregated $6.05 per share. common stock cash dividends during 2014 aggregated $5.15 per share. in january 2016, our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $1.60 per share of common stock payable on february 29, 2016 to stockholders of record on february 12, 2016. we must pay a minimum amount of dividends to maintain our status as a reit. our future dividends and future distributions of the operating partnership will be determined by our board of directors, in its sole discretion, based on actual and projected financial condition, liquidity and results of operations, cash available for dividends and limited partner distributions, cash reserves as deemed necessary for capital and operating expenditures, financing covenants, if any, and the amount required to maintain our status as a reit.
on april 2, 2015, our board of directors authorized us to repurchase up to $2.0 billion of our common stock over a twenty-four month period as market conditions warrant. we may repurchase the shares in the open market or in privately

non-gaap financial measures industry practice is to evaluate real estate properties in part based on performance measures such as ffo, diluted ffo per share, noi and comparable property noi. we believe that these non-gaap measures are helpful to investors because they are widely recognized measures of the performance of reits and provide a relevant basis for comparison among reits. we also use these measures internally to measure the operating performance of our portfolio.
we determine ffo based on the definition set forth by the national association of real estate investment trusts, or nareit, as consolidated net income computed in accordance with gaap:
 excluding gains and losses from extraordinary items and cumulative effects of accounting changes,
 plus the allocable portion of ffo of unconsolidated entities accounted for under the equity method of accounting based upon economic ownership interest, and
 all determined on a consistent basis in accordance with gaap.
we have adopted nareit's clarification of the definition of ffo that requires us to include the effects of nonrecurring items not classified as extraordinary, cumulative effect of accounting changes, or a gain or loss resulting from the sale or disposal of, or any impairment charges related to, previously depreciated operating properties.
we include in ffo gains and losses realized from the sale of land, outlot buildings, marketable and non-marketable securities, and investment holdings of non-retail real estate. we also include in ffo the impact of foreign currency exchange gains and losses, legal expenses, transaction expenses and other items required by gaap.
you should understand that our computation of these non-gaap measures might not be comparable to similar measures reported by other reits and that these non-gaap measures:
 should not be considered as alternatives to consolidated net income determined in accordance with gaap as a measure of operating performance, and
 are not alternatives to cash flows as a measure of liquidity.

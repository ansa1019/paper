item 1a. risk factors the nature of our business activities subjects us to certain hazards and risks. the following is a summary of some of the material risks relating to our business activities. other risks are described in item 1. "business" and item 7a. "quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk." these risks are not the only risks we face. we could also face additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to the company or that we currently deem to be immaterial. if any of these risks actually occurs, it could materially harm our business, financial conditional or results of operations and the trading price of our shares could decline.
risks related to the oil and natural gas industry and our business market conditions for oil and natural gas, and particularly the ongoing decline in prices for oil and natural gas have, and may continue to, adversely affect our revenue, cash flows, profitability, growth, production and the present value of our estimated reserves.
our revenues, operating results, profitability, future rate of growth and the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties depend significantly upon the prevailing prices for oil and natural gas. historically, oil and natural gas prices have been volatile and are subject to fluctuations in response to changes in supply and demand, market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control, including:
•   the price and quantity of foreign imports;
•   political and economic conditions in oil producing countries, including the middle east, africa, south america and russia;
•   the ability of members of the organization of petroleum exporting countries to agree to and maintain oil price and production controls;
•   weather conditions and other natural disasters;
•   risks associated with operating drilling rigs;
•   the price and availability of alternative fuels;
•   the continued threat of terrorism and the impact of military and other action, including u.s. military operations in the middle east;
•   the proximity, cost, availability and capacity of oil and natural gas pipelines and other transportation facilities; and
•   overall domestic and global economic conditions.
these factors and the volatility of the energy markets make it extremely difficult to predict future oil and natural gas price movements with any certainty. during the past six years, the posted price for west texas intermediate light sweet crude oil, which we refer to as west texas intermediate or wti, has ranged from a low of $34.55 per barrel, or bbl, in december 2015
to a high of $113.39 per bbl in april 2011. the henry hub spot market price of natural gas has ranged from a low of $1.63 per mmbtu in january 2016 to a high of $8.15 per mmbtu in february 2014. during 2015, wti prices ranged from $34.55 to $61.36 per bbl and the henry hub spot market price of natural gas ranged from $1.63 to $3.32 per mmbtu. on january 20, 2016, the wti posted price for crude oil was $26.68 per bbl and the henry hub spot market price of natural gas was $2.28 per mmbtu, representing decreases of 57% and 31%, respectively, from the high of $61.36 per bbl of oil and $3.32 per mmbtu for natural gas during 2015. if the prices of oil and natural gas continue at current levels or decline further, our operations, financial condition and level of expenditures for the development of our oil and natural gas reserves may be materially and adversely affected.
in addition, lower oil and natural gas prices may reduce the amount of oil and natural gas that we can produce economically. this may result in our having to make substantial downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves. if this occurs or if our production estimates change or our exploration or development activities are curtailed, full cost accounting rules may require us to write down, as a non-cash charge to earnings, the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties. reductions in our reserves could also negatively impact the borrowing base under our revolving credit facility, which could further limit our liquidity and ability to conduct additional exploration and development activities.
concerns over general economic, business or industry conditions may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition.
concerns over global economic conditions, energy costs, geopolitical issues, inflation, the availability and cost of credit, the european, asian and the united states financial markets have contributed to increased economic uncertainty and diminished expectations for the global economy. in addition, continued hostilities in the middle east and the occurrence or threat of terrorist attacks in the united states or other countries could adversely affect the global economy. these factors, combined with volatility in commodity prices, business and consumer confidence and unemployment rates, have precipitated an economic slowdown. concerns about global economic growth have had a significant adverse impact on global financial markets and commodity prices. if the economic climate in the united states or abroad deteriorates, worldwide demand for petroleum products could diminish further, which could impact the price at which we can sell our production, affect the ability of our vendors, suppliers and customers to continue operations and ultimately adversely impact our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition.
a significant portion of our net leasehold acreage is undeveloped, or acreage on which wells have not been drilled or completed to a point that would permit the production of commercial quantities of oil and natural gas regardless of whether such acreage contains proved reserves. in addition, many of our oil and natural gas leases require us to drill wells that are commercially productive, and if we are unsuccessful in drilling such wells, we could lose our rights under such leases. our future oil and natural gas reserves and production and, therefore, our future cash flow and income are highly dependent on successfully developing our undeveloped leasehold acreage.
our development and exploration operations and our ability to complete acquisitions require substantial capital and we may be unable to obtain needed capital or financing on satisfactory terms or at all, which could lead to a loss of properties and a decline in our oil and natural gas reserves.
the oil and natural gas industry is capital intensive. we make and expect to continue to make substantial capital expenditures in our business and operations for the exploration for and development, production and acquisition of oil and natural gas reserves. in 2015, our total capital expenditures, including expenditures for leasehold acquisitions, drilling and infrastructure, were approximately $900.9 million. our 2016 capital budget for drilling, completion and infrastructure, including investments in water disposal infrastructure and gathering line projects, is currently estimated to be approximately $250.0 million to $375.0 million, representing a decrease of 26% over our 2015 capital budget. since completing our initial public offering in october 2012, we have financed capital expenditures primarily with borrowings under our revolving credit facility, cash generated by operations and the net proceeds from public offerings of our common stock and the senior notes.
we intend to finance our future capital expenditures with cash flow from operations, proceeds from offerings of our debt and equity securities and borrowings under our revolving credit facility. our cash flow from operations and access to capital are subject to a number of variables, including:
•   our ability to acquire, locate and produce economically new reserves; and
•   our ability to borrow under our credit facility.
we cannot assure you that our operations and other capital resources will provide cash in sufficient amounts to maintain planned or future levels of capital expenditures. further, our actual capital expenditures in 2016 could exceed our capital expenditure budget. in the event our capital expenditure requirements at any time are greater than the amount of capital we have available, we could be required to seek additional sources of capital, which may include traditional reserve base borrowings, debt financing, joint venture partnerships, production payment financings, sales of assets, offerings of debt or equity securities or other means. we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain debt or equity financing on terms favorable to us, or at all.
if we are unable to fund our capital requirements, we may be required to curtail our operations relating to the exploration and development of our prospects, which in turn could lead to a possible loss of properties and a decline in our oil and natural gas reserves, or we may be otherwise unable to implement our development plan, complete acquisitions or take advantage of business opportunities or respond to competitive pressures, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our production, revenues and results of operations. in addition, a delay in or the failure to complete proposed or future infrastructure projects could delay or eliminate potential efficiencies and related cost savings.
our success depends on finding, developing or acquiring additional reserves.
our future success depends upon our ability to find, develop or acquire additional oil and natural gas reserves that are economically recoverable. our proved reserves will generally decline as reserves are depleted, except to the extent that we conduct successful exploration or development activities or acquire properties containing proved reserves, or both. to increase reserves and production, we undertake development, exploration and other replacement activities or use third parties to accomplish these activities. we have made, and expect to make in the future, substantial capital expenditures in our business and operations for the development, production, exploration and acquisition of oil and natural gas reserves. we may not have sufficient resources to acquire additional reserves or to undertake exploration, development, production or other replacement activities, such activities may not result in significant additional reserves and we may not have success drilling productive wells at low finding and development costs. if we are unable to replace our current production, the value of our reserves will decrease, and our business, financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected. furthermore, although our revenues may increase if prevailing oil and natural gas prices increase significantly, our finding costs for additional reserves could also increase.
our failure to successfully identify, complete and integrate pending and future acquisitions of properties or businesses could reduce our earnings and slow our growth.
there is intense competition for acquisition opportunities in our industry. the successful acquisition of producing properties requires an assessment of several factors, including:
•   potential environmental and other liabilities.
the accuracy of these assessments is inherently uncertain and we may not be able to identify attractive acquisition opportunities. in connection with these assessments, we perform a review of the subject properties that we believe to be generally consistent with industry practices. our review will not reveal all existing or potential problems nor will it permit us to become sufficiently familiar with the properties to assess fully their deficiencies and capabilities. inspections may not always be performed on every well, and environmental problems, such as groundwater contamination, are not necessarily observable even when an inspection is undertaken. even when problems are identified, the seller may be unwilling or unable to provide effective contractual protection against all or part of the problems. even if we do identify attractive acquisition opportunities, we may not be able to complete the acquisition or do so on commercially acceptable terms.
competition for acquisitions may increase the cost of, or cause us to refrain from, completing acquisitions. our ability to complete acquisitions is dependent upon, among other things, our ability to obtain debt and equity financing and, in some cases, regulatory approvals. further, these acquisitions may be in geographic regions in which we do not currently operate, which could result in unforeseen operating difficulties and difficulties in coordinating geographically dispersed operations, personnel and facilities. in addition, if we enter into new geographic markets, we may be subject to additional and unfamiliar legal and regulatory requirements. compliance with regulatory requirements may impose substantial additional obligations on us and our management, cause us to expend additional time and resources in compliance activities and increase our exposure to penalties or fines for non-compliance with such additional legal requirements. further, the success of any completed acquisition will depend on our ability to integrate effectively the acquired business into our existing operations. the process of integrating acquired businesses may involve unforeseen difficulties and may require a disproportionate amount of our managerial and financial resources. in addition, possible future acquisitions may be larger and for purchase prices significantly higher than those paid for earlier acquisitions.
no assurance can be given that we will be able to identify additional suitable acquisition opportunities, negotiate acceptable terms, obtain financing for acquisitions on acceptable terms or successfully acquire identified targets. our failure to achieve consolidation savings, to integrate the acquired businesses and assets into our existing operations successfully or to minimize any unforeseen operational difficulties could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. the inability to effectively manage the integration of acquisitions, including our recently completed and pending acquisitions, could reduce our focus on subsequent acquisitions and current operations, which, in turn, could negatively impact our earnings and growth. our financial position and results of operations may fluctuate significantly from period to period, based on whether or not significant acquisitions are completed in particular periods.
properties we acquire may not produce as projected, and we may be unable to determine reserve potential, identify liabilities associated with the properties that we acquire or obtain protection from sellers against such liabilities.
acquiring oil and natural gas properties requires us to assess reservoir and infrastructure characteristics, including recoverable reserves, development and operating costs and potential environmental and other liabilities. such assessments are inexact and inherently uncertain. in connection with the assessments, we perform a review of the subject properties, but such a review will not necessarily reveal all existing or potential problems. in the course of our due diligence, we may not inspect every well or pipeline. we cannot necessarily observe structural and environmental problems, such as pipe corrosion, when an inspection is made. we may not be able to obtain contractual indemnities from the seller for liabilities created prior to our purchase of the property. we may be required to assume the risk of the physical condition of the properties in addition to the risk that the properties may not perform in accordance with our expectations.
we may incur losses as a result of title defects in the properties in which we invest.
it is our practice in acquiring oil and natural gas leases or interests not to incur the expense of retaining lawyers to examine the title to the mineral interest. rather, we rely upon the judgment of oil and gas lease brokers or landmen who perform the fieldwork in examining records in the appropriate governmental office before attempting to acquire a lease in a specific mineral interest. the existence of a material title deficiency can render a lease worthless and can adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
prior to the drilling of an oil or natural gas well, however, it is the normal practice in our industry for the person or company acting as the operator of the well to obtain a preliminary title review to ensure there are no obvious defects in title to the well. frequently, as a result of such examinations, certain curative work must be done to correct defects in the marketability of the title, and such curative work entails expense. our failure to cure any title defects may delay or prevent us from utilizing the associated mineral interest, which may adversely impact our ability in the future to increase production and reserves. additionally, undeveloped acreage has greater risk of title defects than developed acreage. if there are any title defects or defects in the assignment of leasehold rights in properties in which we hold an interest, we will suffer a financial loss.
our project areas, which are in various stages of development, may not yield oil or natural gas in commercially viable quantities.
our project areas are in various stages of development, ranging from project areas with current drilling or production activity to project areas that consist of recently acquired leasehold acreage or that have limited drilling or production history. from inception through december 31, 2015, we drilled a total of 448 gross wells and participated in an additional 42 gross non-operated wells, of which 446 wells were completed as producing wells and 44 wells were in various stages of completion. if future wells or the wells in the process of being completed do not produce sufficient revenues to return a profit or if we drill dry holes in the future, our business may be materially affected.
at an assumed price of approximately $40.00 per bbl wti, we currently have approximately 1,500 gross (960 net) identified economic potential horizontal drilling locations in multiple horizons on our acreage. as of december 31, 2015, only 107 of our gross identified potential horizontal drilling locations and three of our identified vertical drilling locations were attributed to proved reserves. these drilling locations, including those without proved undeveloped reserves, represent a significant part of our growth strategy. our ability to drill and develop these locations depends on a number of uncertainties, including the availability of capital, construction of infrastructure, inclement weather, regulatory changes and approvals, oil and natural gas prices, costs, drilling results and the availability of water. further, our identified potential drilling locations are in various stages of evaluation, ranging from locations that are ready to drill to locations that will require substantial additional interpretation. in addition, we have identified approximately 690 horizontal drilling locations in intervals in which we have drilled very few or no wells, which are necessarily more speculative and based on results from other operators whose acreage may not be consistent with ours. we cannot predict in advance of drilling and testing whether any particular drilling location will yield oil or natural gas in sufficient quantities to recover drilling or completion costs or to be economically viable. the use of technologies and the study of producing fields in the same area will not enable us to know conclusively prior to drilling whether oil or natural gas will be present or, if present, whether oil or natural gas will be present in sufficient quantities to be economically viable. even if sufficient amounts of oil or natural gas exist, we may damage the potentially productive hydrocarbon bearing formation or experience mechanical difficulties while drilling or completing the well, possibly resulting in a reduction in production from the well or abandonment of the well. if we drill additional wells that we identify as dry holes in our current and future drilling locations, our drilling success rate may decline and materially harm our business. while through december 31, 2015, we are the operator of or have participated in a total of 184 horizontal wells completed on our acreage, we cannot assure you that the analogies we draw from available data from these or other wells, more fully explored locations or producing fields will be applicable to our drilling locations. further, initial production rates reported by us or other operators in the permian basin may not be indicative of future or long-term production rates. because of these uncertainties, we do not know if the potential drilling locations we have identified will ever be drilled or if we will be able to produce oil or natural gas from these or any other potential drilling locations. as such, our actual drilling activities may materially differ from those presently identified, which could adversely affect our business.
multi-well pad drilling may result in volatility in our operating results.
we utilize multi-well pad drilling where practical. because wells drilled on a pad are not brought into production until all wells on the pad are drilled and completed and the drilling rig is moved from the location, multi-well pad drilling delays the commencement of production, which may cause volatility in our quarterly operating results.
our acreage must be drilled before lease expiration, generally within three to five years, in order to hold the acreage by production. in a highly competitive market for acreage, failure to drill sufficient wells to hold acreage may result in a substantial lease renewal cost or, if renewal is not feasible, loss of our lease and prospective drilling opportunities.
leases on oil and natural gas properties typically have a term of three to five years, after which they expire unless, prior to expiration, production is established within the spacing units covering the undeveloped acres. as of december 31, 2015, we had leases representing 6,007 net acres expiring in 2016, 15,142 net acres expiring in 2017, no net acres expiring in 2018, no net acres expiring in 2019 and 21 net acres expiring in 2020. the cost to renew such leases may increase significantly, and we may not be able to renew such leases on commercially reasonable terms or at all. any reduction in our current drilling program, either through a reduction in capital expenditures or the unavailability of drilling rigs, could result in the loss of acreage through lease expirations. in addition, in order to hold our current leases expiring in 2016, we will need to operate at least a one-rig program. we cannot assure you that we will have the liquidity to deploy these rigs in this time frame, or that commodity prices will warrant operating such a drilling program. any such losses of leases could materially and adversely affect the growth of our asset basis, cash flows and results of operations.
we have entered into price swap derivatives and may in the future enter into forward sale contracts or additional price swap derivatives for a portion of our production. although we have hedged a portion of our estimated 2016 production, we may still be adversely affected by continuing and prolonged declines in the price of oil.
we use price swap derivatives to reduce price volatility associated with certain of our oil sales. under these swap contracts, we receive a fixed price per barrel of oil and pay a floating market price per barrel of oil to the counterparty based on inter-continental exchange, or ice, pricing for brent crude oil. the fixed-price payment and the floating-price payment are offset, resulting in a net amount due to or from the counterparty. these contracts and any future economic hedging arrangements may expose us to risk of financial loss in certain circumstances, including instances where production is less than expected or oil prices increase.
as of december 31, 2015, we had crude oil swap contracts in place covering ice brent crude oil priced at a weighted average price of $88.72 for 91,000 aggregate bbls for the production period of january through february 2016. as of february 17, 2016, we had not entered into any significant hedging transactions with respect to our anticipated 2016 production. to the extent that the price of oil remains at current levels or declines further, we will not be able to hedge future production at the same level as our current hedges, and our results of operations and financial condition would be negatively impacted.
our derivative transactions expose us to counterparty credit risk.
our derivative transactions expose us to risk of financial loss if a counterparty fails to perform under a derivative contract. disruptions in the financial markets could lead to sudden decreases in a counterparty's liquidity, which could make them unable to perform under the terms of the derivative contract and we may not be able to realize the benefit of the derivative contract.
if production from our permian basin acreage decreases due to decreased developmental activities, production related difficulties or otherwise, we may fail to meet our obligations to deliver specified quantities of oil under our oil purchase contract, which will result in deficiency payments to the counterparty and may have an adverse effect on our operations.
we are a party to an agreement with shell trading (us) company under which we are obligated to deliver specified quantities of oil to shell trading (us) company. our maximum delivery obligation under this agreement is 8,000 gross barrels per day. we have a one-time right to decrease the contract quantity by not more than 20% of the then-current quantity, which decreased quantity will be effective for the remainder of the term of the agreement. if production from our permian basin acreage decreases due to decreased developmental activities, as a result of the low commodity price environment, production related difficulties or otherwise, we may be unable to meet our obligations under the oil purchase agreement, which may result in deficiency payments to the counterparty and may have an adverse effect on our operations.
the inability of one or more of our customers to meet their obligations may adversely affect our financial results.
in addition to credit risk related to receivables from commodity derivative contracts, our principal exposure to credit risk is through receivables from joint interest owners on properties we operate (approximately $41.3 million at december 31, 2015) and receivables from purchasers of our oil and natural gas production (approximately $37.6 million at december 31, 2015). joint interest receivables arise from billing entities that own partial interests in the wells we operate. these entities participate in our wells primarily based on their ownership in leases on which we wish to drill. we are generally unable to control which co-owners participate in our wells.
we are also subject to credit risk due to the concentration of our oil and natural gas receivables with several significant customers. for the year ended december 31, 2015, two purchasers accounted for more than 10% of our revenue: shell trading (us) company (59%); and enterprise crude oil llc (15%). for the year ended december 31, 2014, two purchasers accounted for more than 10% of our revenue: shell trading (us) company (64%); and enterprise crude oil llc (16%). for the year ended december 31, 2013, two purchasers each accounted for more than 10% of our revenue: plains marketing, l.p. (37%); and shell trading (us) company (37%). no other customer accounted for more than 10% of our revenue during these periods. this concentration of customers may impact our overall credit risk in that these entities may be similarly affected by changes in economic and other conditions. current economic circumstances may further increase these risks. we do not require our customers to post collateral. the inability or failure of our significant customers or joint working interest owners to meet their obligations to us or their insolvency or liquidation may materially adversely affect our financial results.
we account for our oil and natural gas producing activities using the full cost method of accounting. accordingly, all costs incurred in the acquisition, exploration and development of proved oil and natural gas properties, including the costs of abandoned properties, dry holes, geophysical costs and annual lease rentals are capitalized. we also capitalize direct operating costs for services performed with internally owned drilling and well servicing equipment. all general and administrative corporate costs unrelated to drilling activities are expensed as incurred. sales or other dispositions of oil and natural gas properties are accounted for as adjustments to capitalized costs, with no gain or loss recorded unless the ratio of cost to proved reserves would significantly change. income from services provided to working interest owners of properties in which we also own an interest, to the extent they exceed related costs incurred, are accounted for as reductions of capitalized costs of oil and natural gas properties. depletion of evaluated oil and natural gas properties is computed on the units of production method, whereby capitalized costs plus estimated future development costs are amortized over total proved reserves. the average depletion rate per barrel equivalent unit of production was $17.84, $23.79 and $24.63 for the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013,
the net capitalized costs of proved oil and natural gas properties are subject to a full cost ceiling limitation in which the costs are not allowed to exceed their related estimated future net revenues discounted at 10%. to the extent capitalized costs of evaluated oil and natural gas properties, net of accumulated depreciation, depletion, amortization and impairment, exceed the discounted future net revenues of proved oil and natural gas reserves, the excess capitalized costs are charged to expense. beginning december 31, 2009, we have used the unweighted arithmetic average first day of the month price for oil and natural gas for the 12-month period preceding the calculation date in estimating discounted future net revenues.
an impairment on proved oil and natural gas properties of $814.8 million was recorded for the year ended december 31, 2015. no impairment on proved oil and natural gas properties was recorded for the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013. see item 7. "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations-critical accounting policies and estimates-method of accounting for oil and natural gas properties" for a more detailed description of our method of accounting. if prices of oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids continue to decline, we may be required to further write down the value of our oil and natural gas properties, which could negatively affect our results of operations.
our estimated reserves and eurs are based on many assumptions that may turn out to be inaccurate. any material inaccuracies in these reserve estimates or underlying assumptions will materially affect the quantities and present value of our reserves.
oil and natural gas reserve engineering is not an exact science and requires subjective estimates of underground accumulations of oil and natural gas and assumptions concerning future oil and natural gas prices, production levels, ultimate recoveries and operating and development costs. as a result, estimated quantities of proved reserves, projections of future production rates and the timing of development expenditures may be incorrect. our historical estimates of proved reserves as of december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 (which include those attributable to viper) are based on reports prepared by ryder scott, which conducted a well-by-well review of all our properties for the periods covered by its reserve reports using information provided by us. the eurs for our horizontal wells are based on management's internal estimates. over time, we may make material changes to reserve estimates taking into account the results of actual drilling, testing and production. also, certain assumptions regarding future oil and natural gas prices, production levels and operating and development costs may prove incorrect. any significant variance from these assumptions to actual figures could greatly affect our estimates of reserves, the economically recoverable quantities of oil and natural gas attributable to any particular group of properties, the classifications of reserves based on risk of recovery and estimates of future net cash flows. a substantial portion of our reserve estimates are made without the benefit of a lengthy production history, which are less reliable than estimates based on a lengthy production history. numerous changes over time to the assumptions on which our reserve estimates are based, as described above, often result in the actual quantities of oil and natural gas that we ultimately recover being different from our reserve estimates.  reserve estimates do not include any value for probable or possible reserves that may exist, nor do they include any value for unproved undeveloped acreage. the reserve estimates represent our net revenue interest in our properties.
the estimates of reserves as of december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 included in this report were prepared using an average price equal to the unweighted arithmetic average of hydrocarbon prices received on a field-by-field basis on the first day of each month within the 12-month periods december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, in accordance with the sec guidelines applicable to reserve estimates for such periods. commodity prices have deteriorated significantly since that time, and accordingly, using more recent prices in estimating our proved reserves, without giving effect to any acquisition or development activities we have executed during 2016, would result in a reduction in proved reserve volumes due to economic limits.
the timing of both our production and our incurrence of costs in connection with the development and production of oil and natural gas properties will affect the timing of actual future net cash flows from proved reserves.
the present value of future net cash flow from our proved reserves, or standardized measure, and our related pv-10 calculation, may not represent the current market value of our estimated proved oil reserves. in accordance with sec requirements, we base the estimated discounted future net cash flow from our estimated proved reserves on the 12-month average oil index prices, calculated as the unweighted arithmetic average for the first-day-of-the-month price for each month and costs in effect as of the date of the estimate, holding the prices and costs constant throughout the life of the properties.
actual future prices and costs may differ materially from those used in the net present value estimate, and future net present value estimates using then current prices and costs may be significantly less than current estimates. in addition, the 10% discount factor we use when calculating discounted future net cash flow for reporting requirements in compliance with the financial accounting standard board codification 932, "extractive activities-oil and gas," may not be the most appropriate discount factor based on interest rates in effect from time to time and risks associated with us or the oil and natural gas industry in general.
sec rules could limit our ability to book additional proved undeveloped reserves in the future.
sec rules require that, subject to limited exceptions, proved undeveloped reserves may only be booked if they relate to wells scheduled to be drilled within five years after the date of booking. this requirement has limited and may continue to limit our ability to book additional proved undeveloped reserves as we pursue our drilling program. moreover, we may be required to write down our proved undeveloped reserves if we do not drill those wells within the required five-year timeframe because they have become uneconomic or otherwise.
the development of our proved undeveloped reserves may take longer and may require higher levels of capital expenditures than we currently anticipate.
approximately 41.3% of our total estimated proved reserves as of december 31, 2015, were proved undeveloped reserves and may not be ultimately developed or produced. recovery of proved undeveloped reserves requires significant capital expenditures and successful drilling operations. the reserve data included in the reserve reports of our independent petroleum engineers assume that substantial capital expenditures are required to develop such reserves. we cannot be certain that the estimated costs of the development of these reserves are accurate, that development will occur as scheduled or that the results of such development will be as estimated. delays in the development of our reserves, increases in costs to drill and develop such reserves, or further decreases in commodity prices will reduce the future net revenues of our estimated proved undeveloped reserves and may result in some projects becoming uneconomical. in addition, delays in the development of reserves could force us to reclassify certain of our proved reserves as unproved reserves.
our producing properties are located in the permian basin of west texas, making us vulnerable to risks associated with operating in a single geographic area. in addition, we have a large amount of proved reserves attributable to a small number of producing horizons within this area.
all of our producing properties are geographically concentrated in the permian basin of west texas. as a result of this concentration, we may be disproportionately exposed to the impact of regional supply and demand factors, delays or interruptions of production from wells in this area caused by governmental regulation, processing or transportation capacity constraints, availability of equipment, facilities, personnel or services market limitations or interruption of the processing or transportation of crude oil, natural gas or natural gas liquids. in addition, the effect of fluctuations on supply and demand may become more pronounced within specific geographic oil and natural gas producing areas such as the permian basin, which may cause these conditions to occur with greater frequency or magnify the effects of these conditions. due to the concentrated nature of our portfolio of properties, a number of our properties could experience any of the same conditions at the same time, resulting in a relatively greater impact on our results of operations than they might have on other companies that have a more diversified portfolio of properties. such delays or interruptions could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
in addition to the geographic concentration of our producing properties described above, as of december 31, 2015, all of our proved reserves were attributable to the wolfberry play. this concentration of assets within a small number of producing horizons exposes us to additional risks, such as changes in field-wide rules and regulations that could cause us to permanently or temporarily shut-in all of our wells within a field.
we depend upon several significant purchasers for the sale of most of our oil and natural gas production. the loss of one or more of these purchasers could, among other factors, limit our access to suitable markets for the oil and natural gas we produce.
the availability of a ready market for any oil and/or natural gas we produce depends on numerous factors beyond the control of our management, including but not limited to the extent of domestic production and imports of oil, the proximity and capacity of natural gas pipelines, the availability of skilled labor, materials and equipment, the effect of state and federal regulation of oil and natural gas production and federal regulation of natural gas sold in interstate commerce. in addition, we depend upon several significant purchasers for the sale of most of our oil and natural gas production. for the year ended december 31, 2015, two purchasers accounted for more than 10% of our revenue: shell trading (us) company (59%); and enterprise crude oil llc (15%). for the year ended december 31, 2014, two purchasers accounted for more than 10% of our revenue: shell trading
(us) company (64%); and enterprise crude oil llc (16%). for the year ended december 31, 2013, two purchasers each accounted for more than 10% of our revenue: plains marketing, l.p. (37%); and shell trading (us) company (37%). no other customer accounted for more than 10% of our revenue during these periods. we cannot assure you that we will continue to have ready access to suitable markets for our future oil and natural gas production. the loss of one or more of these customers, and our inability to sell our production to other customers on terms we consider acceptable, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.
the unavailability, high cost or shortages of rigs, equipment, raw materials, supplies, oilfield services or personnel may restrict our operations.
the oil and natural gas industry is cyclical, which can result in shortages of drilling rigs, equipment, raw materials (particularly sand and other proppants), supplies and personnel. when shortages occur, the costs and delivery times of rigs, equipment and supplies increase and demand for, and wage rates of, qualified drilling rig crews also rise with increases in demand. we cannot predict whether these conditions will exist in the future and, if so, what their timing and duration will be. in accordance with customary industry practice, we rely on independent third party service providers to provide most of the services necessary to drill new wells. if we are unable to secure a sufficient number of drilling rigs at reasonable costs, our financial condition and results of operations could suffer, and we may not be able to drill all of our acreage before our leases expire. in addition, we do not have long-term contracts securing the use of our existing rigs, and the operator of those rigs may choose to cease providing services to us. shortages of drilling rigs, equipment, raw materials (particularly sand and other proppants), supplies, personnel, trucking services, tubulars, fracking and completion services and production equipment could delay or restrict our exploration and development operations, which in turn could impair our financial condition and results of operations.
our operations are substantially dependent on the availability of water. restrictions on our ability to obtain water may have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
water is an essential component of deep shale oil and natural gas production during both the drilling and hydraulic fracturing processes. historically, we have been able to purchase water from local land owners for use in our operations. over the past several years, texas has experienced extreme drought conditions. as a result of this severe drought, some local water districts have begun restricting the use of water subject to their jurisdiction for hydraulic fracturing to protect local water supply. if we are unable to obtain water to use in our operations from local sources, or we are unable to effectively utilize flowback water, we may be unable to economically drill for or produce oil and natural gas, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
our business is difficult to evaluate because we have a limited operating history.
diamondback energy, inc. commenced business operations on october 11, 2012. prior to that time, all of our historical oil and natural gas assets, operations and results described in this report were those of windsor permian llc and windsor ut llc. in connection with our initial public offering, windsor permian llc became our wholly-owned subsidiary and we acquired the oil and natural gas assets of gulfport energy corporation located in the permian basin. as a result, there is only limited historical financial and operating information available upon which to base your evaluation of our performance.
we may have difficulty managing growth in our business, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
we commenced business operations in october 2012 and growth in accordance with our business plan, if achieved, could place a significant strain on our financial, technical, operational and management resources. as we expand our activities and increase the number of projects we are evaluating or in which we participate, there will be additional demands on our financial, technical, operational and management resources. the failure to continue to upgrade our technical, administrative, operating and financial control systems or the occurrences of unexpected expansion difficulties, including the failure to recruit and retain experienced managers, geologists, engineers and other professionals in the oil and natural gas industry, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and our ability to timely execute our business plan.
our development of and participation in an increasingly larger number of drilling locations has required and will continue to require substantial capital expenditures. the uncertainty and risks described in this report may impede our ability to economically find, develop and acquire oil and natural gas reserves. as a result, we may not be able to achieve or sustain profitability or positive cash flows from our operating activities in the future.
part of our strategy involves drilling in existing or emerging shale plays using the latest available horizontal drilling and completion techniques; therefore, the results of our planned exploratory drilling in these plays are subject to risks associated with drilling and completion techniques and drilling results may not meet our expectations for reserves or production.
our operations involve utilizing the latest drilling and completion techniques as developed by us and our service providers. risks that we face while drilling include, but are not limited to, landing our well bore in the desired drilling zone, staying in the desired drilling zone while drilling horizontally through the formation, running our casing the entire length of the well bore and being able to run tools and other equipment consistently through the horizontal well bore. risks that we face while completing our wells include, but are not limited to, being able to fracture stimulate the planned number of stages, being able to run tools the entire length of the well bore during completion operations and successfully cleaning out the well bore after completion of the final fracture stimulation stage. in addition, to the extent we engage in horizontal drilling, those activities may adversely affect our ability to successfully drill in one or more of our identified vertical drilling locations. furthermore, certain of the new techniques we are adopting, such as infill drilling and multi-well pad drilling, may cause irregularities or interruptions in production due to, in the case of infill drilling, offset wells being shut in and, in the case of multi-well pad drilling, the time required to drill and complete multiple wells before any such wells begin producing. the results of our drilling in new or emerging formations are more uncertain initially than drilling results in areas that are more developed and have a longer history of established production. newer or emerging formations and areas often have limited or no production history and consequently we are less able to predict future drilling results in these areas.
ultimately, the success of these drilling and completion techniques can only be evaluated over time as more wells are drilled and production profiles are established over a sufficiently long time period. if our drilling results are less than anticipated or we are unable to execute our drilling program because of capital constraints, lease expirations, access to gathering systems, and/or declines in natural gas and oil prices, the return on our investment in these areas may not be as attractive as we anticipate. further, as a result of any of these developments we could incur material write-downs of our oil and natural gas properties and the value of our undeveloped acreage could decline in the future.
fuel conservation measures, alternative fuel requirements, increasing consumer demand for alternatives to oil and natural gas, technological advances in fuel economy and energy generation devices could reduce demand for oil and natural gas. the impact of the changing demand for oil and natural gas services and products may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
the marketability of our production is dependent upon transportation and other facilities, certain of which we do not control. if these facilities are unavailable, our operations could be interrupted and our revenues reduced.
the marketability of our oil and natural gas production depends in part upon the availability, proximity and capacity of transportation facilities owned by third parties. our oil production is transported from the wellhead to our tank batteries by our gathering system. our purchasers then transport the oil by truck to a pipeline for transportation. our natural gas production is generally transported by our gathering lines from the wellhead to an interconnection point with the purchaser. we do not control these trucks and other third party transportation facilities and our access to them may be limited or denied. insufficient production from our wells to support the construction of pipeline facilities by our purchasers or a significant disruption in the availability of our or third party transportation facilities or other production facilities could adversely impact our ability to deliver to market or produce our oil and natural gas and thereby cause a significant interruption in our operations. for example, on certain occasions we have experienced high line pressure at our tank batteries with occasional flaring due to the inability of the gas gathering systems in the areas in which we operate to support the increased production of natural gas in the permian basin. if, in the future, we are unable, for any sustained period, to implement acceptable delivery or transportation arrangements or encounter production related difficulties, we may be required to shut in or curtail production. in addition, the amount of oil and natural gas that can be produced and sold may be subject to curtailment in certain other circumstances outside of our control, such as pipeline interruptions due to maintenance, excessive pressure, ability of downstream processing facilities to accept unprocessed gas, physical damage to the gathering or transportation system or lack of contracted capacity on such systems. the curtailments arising from these and similar circumstances may last from a few days to several months, and in many cases, we are provided with limited, if any, notice as to when these circumstances will arise and their duration. any such shut in or curtailment, or an inability to obtain favorable terms for delivery of the oil and natural gas produced from our fields, would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
our oil and natural gas operations are subject to various federal, state and local governmental regulations that may be changed from time to time in response to economic and political conditions. matters subject to regulation include discharge permits for drilling operations, drilling bonds, reports concerning operations, the spacing of wells, unitization and pooling of properties and taxation. from time to time, regulatory agencies have imposed price controls and limitations on production by restricting the rate of flow of oil and natural gas wells below actual production capacity to conserve supplies of oil and gas. in addition, the production, handling, storage, transportation, remediation, emission and disposal of oil and natural gas, by-products thereof and other substances and materials produced or used in connection with oil and natural gas operations are subject to regulation under federal, state and local laws and regulations primarily relating to protection of human health and the environment. failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of sanctions, including administrative, civil or criminal penalties, permit revocations, requirements for additional pollution controls and injunctions limiting or prohibiting some or all of our operations. moreover, these laws and regulations have continually imposed increasingly strict requirements for water and air pollution control and solid waste management. significant expenditures may be required to comply with governmental laws and regulations applicable to us. we believe the trend of more expansive and stricter environmental legislation and regulations will continue. see item 1. "business-regulation" for a description of certain laws and regulations that affect us.
federal and state legislative and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing could result in increased costs and additional operating restrictions or delays.
hydraulic fracturing is an important common practice that is used to stimulate production of hydrocarbons, particularly natural gas, from tight formations, including shales. the process, which involves the injection of water, sand and chemicals under pressure into formations to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production, is typically regulated by state oil and natural gas commissions. however, several federal agencies have asserted regulatory authority over certain aspects of the process. for example, the epa has recently taken the position that hydraulic fracturing with fluids containing diesel fuel is subject to regulation under the underground injection control program, specifically as "class ii" underground injection control wells under the safe drinking water act. furthermore, legislation to amend the safe drinking water act to repeal the exemption for hydraulic fracturing from the definition of "underground injection" and require federal permitting and regulatory control of hydraulic fracturing, as well as legislative proposals to require disclosure of the chemical constituents of the fluids used in the fracturing process, have been proposed in recent sessions of congress.
in addition, on may 9, 2014, the epa issued an advanced notice of proposed rulemaking seeking comment on the development of regulations under the toxic substances control act to require companies to disclose information regarding the chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing. the epa plans to develop a notice of proposed rulemaking by december 2016, which would describe a proposed mechanism - regulatory, voluntary, or a combination of both - to collect data on hydraulic fracturing chemical substances and mixtures. also, on april 7, 2015, the epa published a proposed rule establishing federal pre-treatment standards for wastewater discharged from onshore unconventional oil and gas extraction facilities to potw. the epa asserts that wastewater from such facilities can be generated in large quantities and can contain constituents that may disrupt potw operations and/or be discharged, untreated, from the potw to receiving waters. if adopted, the new pre-treatment rule would require unconventional oil and gas facilities to pre-treat wastewater before transferring it to a potw. the public comment period ended on july 17, 2015, and the epa is expected to publish a final rule by august 2016. the epa is also conducting a study of private wastewater treatment facilities (also known as centralized waste treatment, or cwt, facilities) accepting oil and gas extraction wastewater. the epa is collecting data and information related to the extent to which cwt facilities accept such wastewater, available treatment technologies (and their associated costs), discharge characteristics, financial characteristics of cwt facilities, and the environmental impacts of discharges from cwt facilities.
on august 16, 2012, the epa published final regulations under the federal clean air act that establish new air emission controls for oil and natural gas production and natural gas processing operations. specifically, the epa's rule package includes new source performance standards to address emissions of sulfur dioxide and volatile organic compounds and a separate set of emission standards to address hazardous air pollutants frequently associated with oil and natural gas production and processing activities. the final rule seeks to achieve a 95% reduction in volatile organic compounds emitted by requiring the use of reduced emission completions or "green completions" on all hydraulically-fractured wells constructed or refractured after january 1, 2015. the epa received numerous requests for reconsideration of these rules from both industry and the environmental community, and court challenges to the rules were also filed. in response, the epa has issued, and will likely continue to issue, revised rules responsive to some of the requests for reconsideration.
furthermore, there are certain governmental reviews either underway or being proposed that focus on environmental aspects of hydraulic fracturing practices. the epa is currently evaluating the potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water resources. in june 2015, the epa released its draft assessment report for peer review and public comment, finding that, while there are certain mechanisms by which hydraulic fracturing activities could potentially impact drinking water resources, there is no evidence available showing that those mechanisms have led to widespread, systemic impacts. also, on february 6,
2015, the epa released a report with findings and recommendations related to public concern about induced seismic activity from disposal wells. the report recommends strategies for managing and minimizing the potential for significant injection-induced seismic events. other governmental agencies, including the u.s. department of energy, the u.s. geological survey, and the u.s. government accountability office, have evaluated or are evaluating various other aspects of hydraulic fracturing. these ongoing or proposed studies could spur initiatives to further regulate hydraulic fracturing, and could ultimately make it more difficult or costly for us to perform fracturing and increase our costs of compliance and doing business.
several states, including texas, and local jurisdictions, have adopted, or are considering adopting, regulations that could restrict or prohibit hydraulic fracturing in certain circumstances, impose more stringent operating standards and/or require the disclosure of the composition of hydraulic fracturing fluids. for a more detailed discussion of state and local laws and initiatives concerning hydraulic fracturing, see "items 1 and 2. business and properties-regulation-regulation of hydraulic fracturing." we use hydraulic fracturing extensively in connection with the development and production of certain of our oil and natural gas properties and any increased federal, state, local, foreign or international regulation of hydraulic fracturing could reduce the volumes of oil and natural gas that we can economically recover, which could materially and adversely affect our revenues and results of operations.
there has been increasing public controversy regarding hydraulic fracturing with regard to the use of fracturing fluids, induced seismic activity, impacts on drinking water supplies, use of water and the potential for impacts to surface water, groundwater and the environment generally. a number of lawsuits and enforcement actions have been initiated across the country implicating hydraulic fracturing practices. if new laws or regulations that significantly restrict hydraulic fracturing are adopted, such laws could make it more difficult or costly for us to perform fracturing to stimulate production from tight formations as well as make it easier for third parties opposing the hydraulic fracturing process to initiate legal proceedings based on allegations that specific chemicals used in the fracturing process could adversely affect groundwater. in addition, if hydraulic fracturing is further regulated at the federal, state or local level, our fracturing activities could become subject to additional permitting and financial assurance requirements, more stringent construction specifications, increased monitoring, reporting and recordkeeping obligations, plugging and abandonment requirements and also to attendant permitting delays and potential increases in costs. such legislative changes could cause us to incur substantial compliance costs, and compliance or the consequences of any failure to comply by us could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. at this time, it is not possible to estimate the impact on our business of newly enacted or potential federal, state or local laws governing hydraulic fracturing.
our operations may be exposed to significant delays, costs and liabilities as a result of environmental, health and safety requirements applicable to our business activities.
we may incur significant delays, costs and liabilities as a result of federal, state and local environmental, health and safety requirements applicable to our exploration, development and production activities. these laws and regulations may, among other things: (i) require us to obtain a variety of permits or other authorizations governing our air emissions, water discharges, waste disposal or other environmental impacts associated with drilling, producing and other operations; (ii) regulate the sourcing and disposal of water used in the drilling, fracturing and completion processes; (iii) limit or prohibit drilling activities in certain areas and on certain lands lying within wilderness, wetlands, frontier and other protected areas; (iv) require remedial action to prevent or mitigate pollution from former operations such as plugging abandoned wells or closing earthen pits; and/or (v) impose substantial liabilities for spills, pollution or failure to comply with regulatory filings. in addition, these laws and regulations may restrict the rate of oil or natural gas production. these laws and regulations are complex, change frequently and have tended to become increasingly stringent over time. failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, imposition of cleanup and site restoration costs and liens, the suspension or revocation of necessary permits, licenses and authorizations, the requirement that additional pollution controls be installed and, in some instances, issuance of orders or injunctions limiting or requiring discontinuation of certain operations. under certain environmental laws that impose strict as well as joint and several liability, we may be required to remediate contaminated properties currently or formerly operated by us or facilities of third parties that received waste generated by our operations regardless of whether such contamination resulted from the conduct of others or from consequences of our own actions that were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time those actions were taken. in addition, claims for damages to persons or property, including natural resources, may result from the environmental, health and safety impacts of our operations. in addition, the risk of accidental and/or unpermitted spills or releases from our operations could expose us to significant liabilities, penalties and other sanctions under applicable laws. moreover, public interest in the protection of the environment has increased dramatically in recent years. the trend of more expansive and stringent environmental legislation and regulations applied to the crude oil and natural gas industry could continue, resulting in increased costs of doing business and consequently affecting profitability. to the extent laws are enacted or other governmental action is taken that restricts drilling or imposes more stringent and costly operating, waste handling, disposal and cleanup requirements, our business, prospects, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected.
restrictions on drilling activities intended to protect certain species of wildlife may adversely affect our ability to conduct drilling activities in some of the areas where we operate.
oil and natural gas operations in our operating areas can be adversely affected by seasonal or permanent restrictions on drilling activities designed to protect various wildlife. seasonal restrictions may limit our ability to operate in protected areas and can intensify competition for drilling rigs, oilfield equipment, services, supplies and qualified personnel, which may lead to periodic shortages when drilling is allowed. these constraints and the resulting shortages or high costs could delay our operations and materially increase our operating and capital costs. permanent restrictions imposed to protect endangered species could prohibit drilling in certain areas or require the implementation of expensive mitigation measures. the designation of previously unprotected species in areas where we operate as threatened or endangered could cause us to incur increased costs arising from species protection measures or could result in limitations on our exploration and production activities that could have an adverse impact on our ability to develop and produce our reserves.
the adoption of derivatives legislation by the u.s. congress could have an adverse effect on our ability to use derivative instruments to reduce the effect of commodity price, interest rate and other risks associated with our business.
the adoption of derivatives legislation by the u.s. congress could have an adverse effect on our ability to use derivative instruments to reduce the effect of commodity price, interest rate and other risks associated with our business. the u.s. congress adopted the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act, or dodd-frank act, which, among other provisions, establishes federal oversight and regulation of the over-the-counter derivatives market and entities that participate in that market. the legislation was signed into law by the president on july 21, 2010. in its rulemaking under the legislation, the commodities futures trading commission has issued a final rule on position limits for certain futures and option contracts in the major energy markets and for swaps that are their economic equivalents (with exemptions for certain bona fide hedging transactions). the commodities futures trading commission's final rule was set aside by the u.s. district court for the district of columbia on september 28, 2012 and remanded to the commodities futures trading commission to resolve ambiguity as to whether statutory requirements for such limits to be determined necessary and appropriate were satisfied. as a result, the rule has not yet taken effect, although the commodities futures trading commission has indicated that it intends to appeal the court's decision and that it believes the dodd-frank act requires it to impose position limits. the impact of such regulations upon our business is not yet clear. certain of our hedging and trading activities and those of our counterparties may be subject to the position limits, which may reduce our ability to enter into hedging transactions.
in addition, the dodd-frank act does not explicitly exempt end users (such as us) from the requirement to use cleared exchanges, rather than hedging over-the-counter, and the requirements to post margin in connection with hedging activities. while it is not possible at this time to predict when the commodities futures trading commission will finalize certain other related rules and regulations, the dodd-frank act and related regulations may require us to comply with margin requirements and with certain clearing and trade-execution requirements in connection with our derivative activities, although whether these requirements will apply to our business is uncertain at this time. if the regulations ultimately adopted require that we post margin for our hedging activities or require our counterparties to hold margin or maintain capital levels, the cost of which could be passed through to us, or impose other requirements that are more burdensome than current regulations, our hedging would become more expensive and we may decide to alter our hedging strategy. the financial reform legislation may also require us to comply with margin requirements and with certain clearing and trade-execution requirements in connection with our existing or future derivative activities, although the application of those provisions to us is uncertain at this time. the financial reform legislation may also require the counterparties to our derivative instruments to spin off some of their derivatives activities to separate entities, which may not be as creditworthy as the current counterparties. the new legislation and any new regulations could significantly increase the cost of derivative contracts (including through requirements to post collateral which could adversely affect our available liquidity), materially alter the terms of derivative contracts, reduce the availability of derivatives to protect against risks we encounter, reduce our ability to monetize or restructure our derivative contracts in existence at that time, and increase our exposure to less creditworthy counterparties. if we reduce or change the way we use derivative instruments as a result of the legislation and regulations, our results of operations may become more volatile and our cash flows may be less predictable, which could adversely affect our ability to plan for and fund capital expenditures. finally, the legislation was intended, in part, to reduce the volatility of oil and natural gas prices, which some legislators attributed to speculative trading in derivatives and commodity instruments related to oil and natural gas. our revenues could therefore be adversely affected if a consequence of the legislation and regulations is to lower commodity prices. any of these consequences could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
certain federal income tax deductions currently available with respect to natural gas and oil exploration and development may be eliminated, and additional state taxes on natural gas extraction may be imposed, as a result of future legislation.
from time to time, legislative proposals are made that would, if enacted, make significant changes to u.s. tax laws. these proposed changes have included, but are not limited to, (i) eliminating the immediate deduction for intangible drilling
and development costs, (ii) eliminating the deduction from income for domestic production activities relating to oil and natural gas exploration and development, (iii) the repeal of the percentage depletion allowance for oil and natural gas properties; (iv) an extension of the amortization period for certain geological and geophysical expenditures and (v) implementing certain international tax reforms. further, in february 2016, the president's administration issued a proposed budget, which includes, among other things, a proposed tax of $10.25 per barrel equivalent on petroleum products.
these proposed changes in the u.s. tax law, if adopted, or other similar changes that tax our production or reduce or eliminate deductions currently available with respect to natural gas and oil exploration and development, could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
in recent years, federal, state and local governments have taken steps to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases. the epa has finalized a series of greenhouse gas monitoring, reporting and emissions control rules for the oil and natural gas industry, and the u.s. congress has, from time to time, considered adopting legislation to reduce emissions. almost one-half of the states have already taken measures to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases primarily through the development of greenhouse gas emission inventories and/or regional greenhouse gas cap-and-trade programs. while we are subject to certain federal greenhouse gas monitoring and reporting requirements, our operations currently are not adversely impacted by existing federal, state and local climate change initiatives. for a description of existing and proposed greenhouse gas rules and regulations, see "items 1 and 2. business and properties-regulation-environmental regulation-climate change."
in december 2015, the united states joined the international community at the 21st conference of the parties of the united nations framework convention on climate change in paris, france. the resulting paris agreement calls for the parties to undertake "ambitious efforts" to limit the average global temperature, and to conserve and enhance sinks and reservoirs of greenhouse gases. the agreement, if ratified, establishes a framework for the parties to cooperate and report actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
restrictions on emissions of methane or carbon dioxide that may be imposed could adversely affect the oil and natural gas industry. at this time, it is not possible to accurately estimate how potential future laws or regulations addressing greenhouse gas emissions would impact our business.
in addition, claims have been made against certain energy companies alleging that greenhouse gas emissions from oil and natural gas operations constitute a public nuisance under federal and/or state common law. as a result, private individuals may seek to enforce environmental laws and regulations against us and could allege personal injury or property damages. while our business is not a party to this litigation, we could be named in actions making similar allegations. an unfavorable ruling in any such case could significantly impact our operations and could have an adverse impact on our financial condition.
moreover, there has been public discussion that climate change may be associated with extreme weather conditions such as more intense hurricanes, thunderstorms, tornadoes and snow or ice storms, as well as rising sea levels. another possible consequence of climate change is increased volatility in seasonal temperatures. some studies indicate that climate change could cause some areas to experience temperatures substantially colder than their historical averages. extreme weather conditions can interfere with our production and increase our costs and damage resulting from extreme weather may not be fully insured. however, at this time, we are unable to determine the extent to which climate change may lead to increased storm or weather hazards affecting our operations.
section 1(b) of the natural gas act of 1938 exempts natural gas gathering facilities from regulation by the ferc. we believe that the natural gas pipelines in our gathering systems meet the traditional tests ferc has used to establish whether a pipeline performs a gathering function and therefore are exempt from ferc's jurisdiction under the natural gas act of 1938. however, the distinction between ferc-regulated transmission services and federally unregulated gathering services is a fact-based determination. the classification of facilities as unregulated gathering is the subject of ongoing litigation, so the classification and regulation of our gathering facilities are subject to change based on future determinations by ferc, the courts or congress, which could cause our revenues to decline and operating expenses to increase and may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. additional rules and legislation pertaining to those and other matters may be considered or adopted by ferc from time to time. failure to comply with those regulations in the future could subject us to civil penalty liability, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
we operate in areas of high industry activity, which may affect our ability to hire, train or retain qualified personnel needed to manage and operate our assets.
our operations and drilling activity are concentrated in the permian basin in west texas, an area in which industry activity has increased rapidly. as a result, demand for qualified personnel in this area, and the cost to attract and retain such personnel, has increased over the past few years due to competition and may increase substantially in the future. moreover, our competitors may be able to offer better compensation packages to attract and retain qualified personnel than we are able to offer.
any delay or inability to secure the personnel necessary for us to continue or complete our current and planned development activities could lead to a reduction in production volumes.  any such negative effect on production volumes, or significant increases in costs, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
many key responsibilities within our business have been assigned to a small number of employees. the loss of their services could adversely affect our business. in particular, the loss of the services of one or more members of our executive team, including our chief executive officer, travis d. stice, could disrupt our operations. we have employment agreements with these executives which contain restrictions on competition with us in the event they cease to be employed by us. however, as a practical matter, such employment agreements may not assure the retention of our employees. further, we do not maintain "key person" life insurance policies on any of our employees. as a result, we are not insured against any losses resulting from the death of our key employees.
drilling for and producing oil and natural gas are high-risk activities with many uncertainties that may result in a total loss of investment and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.
our drilling activities are subject to many risks. for example, we cannot assure you that new wells drilled by us will be productive or that we will recover all or any portion of our investment in such wells. drilling for oil and natural gas often involves unprofitable efforts, not only from dry wells but also from wells that are productive but do not produce sufficient oil or natural gas to return a profit at then realized prices after deducting drilling, operating and other costs. the seismic data and other technologies we use do not allow us to know conclusively prior to drilling a well that oil or natural gas is present or that it can be produced economically. the costs of exploration, exploitation and development activities are subject to numerous uncertainties beyond our control, and increases in those costs can adversely affect the economics of a project. further, our drilling and producing operations may be curtailed, delayed, canceled or otherwise negatively impacted as a result of other factors, including:
•   title problems;
•   facility or equipment malfunctions;
•   compliance with environmental and other governmental requirements; and
•   adverse weather conditions.
our development and exploratory drilling efforts and our well operations may not be profitable or achieve our targeted returns.
historically, we have acquired significant amounts of unproved property in order to further our development efforts and expect to continue to undertake acquisitions in the future. development and exploratory drilling and production activities
are subject to many risks, including the risk that no commercially productive reservoirs will be discovered. we acquire unproved properties and lease undeveloped acreage that we believe will enhance our growth potential and increase our earnings over time. however, we cannot assure you that all prospects will be economically viable or that we will not abandon our investments. additionally, we cannot assure you that unproved property acquired by us or undeveloped acreage leased by us will be profitably developed, that new wells drilled by us in prospects that we pursue will be productive or that we will recover all or any portion of our investment in such unproved property or wells.
drilling for oil and natural gas may involve unprofitable efforts, not only from dry wells but also from wells that are productive but do not produce sufficient commercial quantities to cover the drilling, operating and other costs. the cost of drilling, completing and operating a well is often uncertain, and many factors can adversely affect the economics of a well or property. drilling operations may be curtailed, delayed or canceled as a result of unexpected drilling conditions, equipment failures or accidents, shortages of equipment or personnel, environmental issues and for other reasons. in addition, wells that are profitable may not meet our internal return targets, which are dependent upon the current and expected future market prices for oil and natural gas, expected costs associated with producing oil and natural gas and our ability to add reserves at an acceptable cost.
operating hazards and uninsured risks may result in substantial losses and could prevent us from realizing profits.
our operations are subject to all of the hazards and operating risks associated with drilling for and production of oil and natural gas, including the risk of fire, explosions, blowouts, surface cratering, uncontrollable flows of natural gas, oil and formation water, pipe or pipeline failures, abnormally pressured formations, casing collapses and environmental hazards such as oil spills, gas leaks and ruptures or discharges of toxic gases. in addition, our operations are subject to risks associated with hydraulic fracturing, including any mishandling, surface spillage or potential underground migration of fracturing fluids, including chemical additives. the occurrence of any of these events could result in substantial losses to us due to injury or loss of life, severe damage to or destruction of property, natural resources and equipment, pollution or other environmental damage, clean-up responsibilities, regulatory investigations and penalties, suspension of operations and repairs required to resume operations.
we endeavor to contractually allocate potential liabilities and risks between us and the parties that provide us with services and goods, which include pressure pumping and hydraulic fracturing, drilling and cementing services and tubular goods for surface, intermediate and production casing. under our agreements with our vendors, to the extent responsibility for environmental liability is allocated between the parties, (i) our vendors generally assume all responsibility for control and removal of pollution or contamination which originates above the surface of the land and is directly associated with such vendors' equipment while in their control and (ii) we generally assume the responsibility for control and removal of all other pollution or contamination which may occur during our operations, including pre-existing pollution and pollution which may result from fire, blowout, cratering, seepage or any other uncontrolled flow of oil, gas or other substances, as well as the use or disposition of all drilling fluids. in addition, we generally agree to indemnify our vendors for loss or destruction of vendor-owned property that occurs in the well hole (except for damage that occurs when a vendor is performing work on a footage, rather than day work, basis) or as a result of the use of equipment, certain corrosive fluids, additives, chemicals or proppants. however, despite this general allocation of risk, we might not succeed in enforcing such contractual allocation, might incur an unforeseen liability falling outside the scope of such allocation or may be required to enter into contractual arrangements with terms that vary from the above allocations of risk. as a result, we may incur substantial losses which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
in accordance with what we believe to be customary industry practice, we historically have maintained insurance against some, but not all, of our business risks. our insurance may not be adequate to cover any losses or liabilities we may suffer. also, insurance may no longer be available to us or, if it is, its availability may be at premium levels that do not justify its purchase. the occurrence of a significant uninsured claim, a claim in excess of the insurance coverage limits maintained by us or a claim at a time when we are not able to obtain liability insurance could have a material adverse effect on our ability to conduct normal business operations and on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flow. in addition, we may not be able to secure additional insurance or bonding that might be required by new governmental regulations. this may cause us to restrict our operations, which might severely impact our financial position. we may also be liable for environmental damage caused by previous owners of properties purchased by us, which liabilities may not be covered by insurance.
since hydraulic fracturing activities are part of our operations, they are covered by our insurance against claims made for bodily injury, property damage and clean-up costs stemming from a sudden and accidental pollution event. however, we may not have coverage if we are unaware of the pollution event and unable to report the "occurrence" to our insurance company within the time frame required under our insurance policy. we have no coverage for gradual, long-term pollution events. in addition, these policies do not provide coverage for all liabilities, and we cannot assure you that the insurance coverage will be adequate to cover claims that may arise, or that we will be able to maintain adequate insurance at rates we consider reasonable.
a loss not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
competition in the oil and natural gas industry is intense, which may adversely affect our ability to succeed.
the oil and natural gas industry is intensely competitive, and we compete with other companies that have greater resources than us. many of these companies not only explore for and produce oil and natural gas, but also carry on midstream and refining operations and market petroleum and other products on a regional, national or worldwide basis. these companies may be able to pay more for productive oil and natural gas properties and exploratory prospects or define, evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than our financial or human resources permit. in addition, these companies may have a greater ability to continue exploration activities during periods of low oil and natural gas market prices. our larger competitors may be able to absorb the burden of present and future federal, state, local and other laws and regulations more easily than we can, which would adversely affect our competitive position. our ability to acquire additional properties and to discover reserves in the future will be dependent upon our ability to evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate transactions in a highly competitive environment. in addition, because we have fewer financial and human resources than many companies in our industry, we may be at a disadvantage in bidding for exploratory prospects and producing oil and natural gas properties.
even when properly used and interpreted, 2-d and 3-d seismic data and visualization techniques are only tools used to assist geoscientists in identifying subsurface structures and hydrocarbon indicators and do not enable the interpreter to know whether hydrocarbons are, in fact, present in those structures. in addition, the use of 3-d seismic and other advanced technologies requires greater predrilling expenditures than traditional drilling strategies, and we could incur losses as a result of such expenditures. as a result, our drilling activities may not be successful or economical.
we may not be able to keep pace with technological developments in our industry.
the oil and natural gas industry is characterized by rapid and significant technological advancements and introductions of new products and services using new technologies. as others use or develop new technologies, we may be placed at a competitive disadvantage or may be forced by competitive pressures to implement those new technologies at substantial costs. in addition, other oil and natural gas companies may have greater financial, technical and personnel resources that allow them to enjoy technological advantages and that may in the future allow them to implement new technologies before we can. we may not be able to respond to these competitive pressures or implement new technologies on a timely basis or at an acceptable cost. if one or more of the technologies we use now or in the future were to become obsolete, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.
we are subject to certain requirements of section 404 of the sarbanes-oxley act. if we fail to comply with the requirements of section 404 or if we or our auditors identify and report material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting, our investors may lose confidence in our reported information and our stock price may be negatively affected.
we are required to comply with certain provisions of section 404 of the sarbanes-oxley act of 2002, or sarbanes-oxley act. section 404 requires that we document and test our internal control over financial reporting and issue management's assessment of our internal control over financial reporting. this section also requires that our independent registered public accounting firm opine on those internal controls. if we fail to comply with the requirements of section 404 of the sarbanes-oxley act, or if we or our auditors identify and report material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting, the accuracy and timeliness of the filing of our annual and quarterly reports may be materially adversely affected and could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our common stock. in addition, a material weakness in the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting could result in an increased chance of fraud and the loss of customers, reduce our ability to obtain financing and require additional expenditures to comply with these requirements, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
increased costs of capital could adversely affect our business.
our business and operating results could be harmed by factors such as the availability, terms and cost of capital, increases in interest rates or a reduction in our credit rating. changes in any one or more of these factors could cause our cost of doing business to increase, limit our access to capital, limit our ability to pursue acquisition opportunities, reduce our cash flows available for drilling and place us at a competitive disadvantage. continuing disruptions and volatility in the global financial
markets may lead to an increase in interest rates or a contraction in credit availability impacting our ability to finance our operations. we require continued access to capital. a significant reduction in the availability of credit could materially and adversely affect our ability to achieve our planned growth and operating results.
we recorded stock-based compensation expense in 2015, 2014 and 2013, and we may incur substantial additional compensation expense related to our future grants of stock compensation which may have a material negative impact on our operating results for the foreseeable future.
as a result of outstanding stock-based compensation awards, for the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 we incurred $24.6 million, $14.3 million and $2.7 million, respectively, of stock based compensation expense, of which we capitalized $6.0 million, $4.4 million and $1.0 million respectively, pursuant to the full cost method of accounting for oil and natural gas properties. in addition, our compensation expenses may increase in the future as compared to our historical expenses because of the costs associated with our existing and possible future incentive plans. these additional expenses could adversely affect our net income. the future expense will be dependent upon the number of share-based awards issued and the fair value of the options or shares of common stock at the date of the grant; however, they may be significant. we will recognize expenses for restricted stock awards and stock options generally over the vesting period of awards made to recipients.
we are heavily dependent on our information systems and computer based programs, including our well operations information, seismic data, electronic data processing and accounting data. if any of such programs or systems were to fail or create erroneous information in our hardware or software network infrastructure, possible consequences include our loss of communication links, inability to find, produce, process and sell oil and natural gas and inability to automatically process commercial transactions or engage in similar automated or computerized business activities. any such consequence could have a material adverse effect on our business.
terrorist activities, anti-terrorist efforts and other armed conflicts involving the united states or other countries may adversely affect the united states and global economies and could prevent us from meeting our financial and other obligations. if any of these events occur, the resulting political instability and societal disruption could reduce overall demand for oil and natural gas, potentially putting downward pressure on demand for our services and causing a reduction in our revenues. oil and natural gas related facilities could be direct targets of terrorist attacks, and our operations could be adversely impacted if infrastructure integral to our customers' operations is destroyed or damaged. costs for insurance and other security may increase as a result of these threats, and some insurance coverage may become more difficult to obtain, if available at all.
we are subject to cyber security risks. a cyber incident could occur and result in information theft, data corruption, operational disruption and/or financial loss.
the oil and natural gas industry has become increasingly dependent on digital technologies to conduct certain exploration, development, production, and processing activities. for example, the oil and natural gas industry depends on digital technologies to interpret seismic data, manage drilling rigs, production equipment and gathering systems, conduct reservoir modeling and reserves estimation, and process and record financial and operating data. at the same time, cyber incidents, including deliberate attacks or unintentional events, have increased. the u.s. government has issued public warnings that indicate that energy assets might be specific targets of cyber security threats. our technologies, systems, networks, and those of its vendors, suppliers and other business partners, may become the target of cyberattacks or information security breaches that could result in the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss or destruction of proprietary and other information, or other disruption of its business operations. in addition, certain cyber incidents, such as surveillance, may remain undetected for an extended period. our systems and insurance coverage for protecting against cyber security risks may not be sufficient. as cyber incidents continue to evolve, we may be required to expend additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any vulnerability to cyber incidents. we do not maintain specialized insurance for possible liability resulting from a cyberattack on our assets that may shut down all or part of our business.
risks related to our indebtedness our substantial level of indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under the senior notes and our other indebtedness.
as of december 31, 2015, we had total long-term debt of $495.5 million, including $450.0 million outstanding under the senior notes, and we had unused borrowing base availability of $489.0 million under our revolving credit facility. as of
december 31, 2015, viper, one of our subsidiaries, had $34.5 million in outstanding borrowings, and $165.5 million available for borrowing, under its revolving credit facility. we may in the future incur significant additional indebtedness under our revolving credit facility or otherwise in order to make acquisitions, to develop our properties or for other purposes. our level of indebtedness could have important consequences to you and affect our operations in several ways, including the following:
•   our high level of indebtedness could make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to the senior notes, including any repurchase obligations that may arise thereunder;
•   a high level of debt could increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;
•   the covenants contained in the agreements governing our outstanding indebtedness will limit our ability to borrow additional funds, dispose of assets, pay dividends and make certain investments;
•   a high level of debt may place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that are less leveraged and, therefore, may be able to take advantage of opportunities that our indebtedness would prevent us from pursuing;
•   our debt covenants may also limit management's discretion in operating our business and our flexibility in planning for, and reacting to, changes in the economy and in our industry;
•   a high level of debt may make it more likely that a reduction in our borrowing base following a periodic redetermination could require us to repay a portion of our then-outstanding bank borrowings;
•   a high level of debt could limit our ability to access the capital markets to raise capital on favorable terms;
•   a high level of debt may impair our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, general corporate or other purposes; and
•   we may be vulnerable to interest rate increases, as our borrowings under our revolving credit facility are at variable interest rates.
a high level of indebtedness increases the risk that we may default on our debt obligations. our ability to meet our debt obligations and to reduce our level of indebtedness depends on our future performance. general economic conditions, oil and natural gas prices and financial, business and other factors affect our operations and our future performance. many of these factors are beyond our control. we may not be able to generate sufficient cash flows to pay the interest on our debt, and future working capital, borrowings or equity financing may not be available to pay or refinance such debt. factors that will affect our ability to raise cash through an offering of our capital stock or a refinancing of our debt include financial market conditions, the value of our assets and our performance at the time we need capital.
restrictive covenants in our revolving credit facility, the indenture governing the senior notes and future debt instruments may limit our ability to respond to changes in market conditions or pursue business opportunities.
our revolving credit facility and the indenture governing the senior notes contain, and the terms of any future indebtedness may contain, restrictive covenants that limit our ability to, among other things:
•   incur or guarantee additional indebtedness;
•   create additional liens;
•   merge or consolidate with another entity;
•   engage in transactions with affiliates; and
in connection with the closing of viper's initial public offering on june 23, 2014, we entered into an amendment to our revolving credit facility, which modified certain provisions of our revolving credit facility to allow us, among other things, to designate one or more of our subsidiaries as "unrestricted subsidiaries" that are not subject to certain restrictions contained in the revolving credit facility. under the amended revolving credit facility, we designated viper, the general partner and viper's subsidiary as unrestricted subsidiaries, and upon such designation, they were automatically released from any and all obligations under the amended revolving credit facility, including the related guaranty, and all liens on the assets of, and the equity interests in, viper, the general partner and viper's subsidiary under the amended revolving credit facility were automatically released. further, in connection with the closing of viper's initial public offering, we designated viper, the general partner and viper's subsidiary as unrestricted subsidiaries under the indenture governing the senior notes and upon such designation, viper energy partners llc, which was a guarantor under the indenture governing the senior notes prior to such designation, was released as a guarantor under the indenture governing the senior notes.
we may be prevented from taking advantage of business opportunities that arise because of the limitations imposed on us by the restrictive covenants contained in our revolving credit facility and the indenture governing the senior notes. in addition, our revolving credit facility requires us to maintain certain financial ratios and tests. the requirement that we comply with these provisions may materially adversely affect our ability to react to changes in market conditions, take advantage of business opportunities we believe to be desirable, obtain future financing, fund needed capital expenditures or withstand a continuing or future downturn in our business.
a breach of any of these restrictive covenants could result in default under our revolving credit facility. if default occurs, the lenders under our revolving credit facility may elect to declare all borrowings outstanding, together with accrued interest and other fees, to be immediately due and payable, which would result in an event of default under the indenture governing the senior notes. the lenders will also have the right in these circumstances to terminate any commitments they have to provide further borrowings. if we are unable to repay outstanding borrowings when due, the lenders under our revolving credit facility will also have the right to proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure the indebtedness. if the indebtedness under our revolving credit facility and the senior notes were to be accelerated, we cannot assure you that our assets would be sufficient to repay in full that indebtedness.
any significant reduction in our borrowing base under our revolving credit facility as a result of the periodic borrowing base redeterminations or otherwise may negatively impact our ability to fund our operations, and we may not have sufficient funds to repay borrowings under our revolving credit facility if required as a result of a borrowing base redetermination.
availability under our revolving credit facility is currently subject to a borrowing base of $750.0 million, of which we have elected a commitment amount of $500.0 million. the borrowing base is subject to scheduled semiannual and other elective collateral borrowing base redeterminations based on our oil and natural gas reserves and other factors. as of december 31, 2015, we had outstanding borrowings of $11.0 million which bore a weighted average interest rate of 1.92%. we intend to continue borrowing under our revolving credit facility in the future. any significant reduction in our borrowing base as a result of such borrowing base redeterminations or otherwise may negatively impact our liquidity and our ability to fund our operations and, as a result, may have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operation and cash flow. further if, the outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility were to exceed the borrowing base as a result of any such redetermination, we would be required to repay the excess. we may not have sufficient funds to make such repayments. if we do not have sufficient funds and we are otherwise unable to negotiate renewals of our borrowings or arrange new financing, we may have to sell significant assets. any such sale could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.
our ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of, to pay interest on or to refinance our indebtedness, including the senior notes, depends on our future performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. our business may not generate cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to service our debt and make necessary capital expenditures. if we are unable to generate such cash flow, we may be required to adopt one or more
alternatives, such as reducing or delaying capital expenditures, selling assets, restructuring debt or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive. however, we cannot assure you that undertaking alternative financing plans, if necessary, would allow us to meet our debt obligations. in the absence of such cash flows, we could have substantial liquidity problems and might be required to sell material assets or operations to attempt to meet our debt service and other obligations. our revolving credit facility and the indenture governing the senior notes restrict our ability to use the proceeds from asset sales. we may not be able to consummate those asset sales to raise capital or sell assets at prices that we believe are fair, and proceeds that we do receive may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due. our ability to refinance our indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at the time. we may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms, which could result in a default on our debt obligations and have an adverse effect on our financial condition.
we may still be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future, which could further exacerbate the risks that we and our subsidiaries face.
we and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future. the terms of our revolving credit facility and the indenture governing the senior notes restrict, but in each case do not completely prohibit, us from doing so. as of december 31, 2015, our borrowing base under our revolving credit facility was set at $750.0 million, of which we have elected a commitment amount of $500.0 million and we had outstanding borrowings of $11.0 million under this facility. as of december 31, 2015, viper had $34.5 million in outstanding borrowings, and $165.5 million available for borrowing, under its revolving credit facility. in addition, the indenture governing the senior notes allows us to issue additional notes under certain circumstances which will also be guaranteed by the guarantors. the indenture governing the senior notes also allows us to incur certain other additional secured debt and allows us to have subsidiaries that do not guarantee the senior notes and which may incur additional debt, which would be structurally senior to the senior notes. in addition, the indenture governing the senior notes does not prevent us from incurring other liabilities that do not constitute indebtedness. if we or a guarantor incur any additional indebtedness that ranks equally with the senior notes (or with the guarantees thereof), including additional unsecured indebtedness or trade payables, the holders of that indebtedness will be entitled to share ratably with holders of the senior notes in any proceeds distributed in connection with any insolvency, liquidation, reorganization, dissolution or other winding-up of us or a guarantor. if new debt or other liabilities are added to our current debt levels, the related risks that we and our subsidiaries now face could intensify.
if we experience liquidity concerns, we could face a downgrade in our debt ratings which could restrict our access to, and negatively impact the terms of, current or future financings or trade credit.
our ability to obtain financings and trade credit and the terms of any financings or trade credit is, in part, dependent on the credit ratings assigned to our debt by independent credit rating agencies. we cannot provide assurance that any of our current ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if, in its judgment, circumstances so warrant. factors that may impact our credit ratings include debt levels, planned asset purchases or sales and near-term and long-term production growth opportunities, liquidity, asset quality, cost structure, product mix and commodity pricing levels. a ratings downgrade could adversely impact our ability to access financings or trade credit and increase our borrowing costs.
borrowings under our and viper's revolving credit facilities expose us to interest rate risk.
our earnings are exposed to interest rate risk associated with borrowings under our revolving credit facility. the terms of our revolving credit facility provide for interest on borrowings at a floating rate equal to an alternative base rate (which is equal to the greatest of the prime rate, the federal funds effective rate plus 0.50% and 3-month libor plus 1.0%) or libor, in each case plus the applicable margin. the applicable margin ranges from 0.50% to 1.50% in the case of the alternative base rate and from 1.50% to 2.50% in the case of libor, in each case depending on the amount of the loan outstanding in relation to the borrowing base. as of december 31, 2015, we had $11.0 million in borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility. our weighted-average interest rate on borrowings from our revolving credit facility was 1.92% during the year ended december 31, 2015. viper's weighted average interest rate on borrowings from its revolving credit facility was 1.70% during the year ended december 31, 2015. as of december 31, 2015, viper, one of our subsidiaries, had $34.5 million in outstanding borrowings, and $165.5 million available for borrowing, under its revolving credit facility. if interest rates increase, so will our interest costs, which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
risks related to our common stock the corporate opportunity provisions in our certificate of incorporation could enable wexford, our equity sponsor prior to our initial public offering, or other affiliates of ours to benefit from corporate opportunities that might otherwise be available to us.
subject to the limitations of applicable law, our certificate of incorporation, among other things:
•   permits us to enter into transactions with entities in which one or more of our officers or directors are financially or otherwise interested;
•   permits any of our stockholders, officers or directors to conduct business that competes with us and to make investments in any kind of property in which we may make investments; and
•   provides that if any director or officer of one of our affiliates who is also one of our officers or directors becomes aware of a potential business opportunity, transaction or other matter (other than one expressly offered to that director or officer in writing solely in his or her capacity as our director or officer), that director or officer will have no duty to communicate or offer that opportunity to us, and will be permitted to communicate or offer that opportunity to such affiliates and that director or officer will not be deemed to have (i) acted in a manner inconsistent with his or her fiduciary or other duties to us regarding the opportunity or (ii) acted in bad faith or in a manner inconsistent with our best interests.
these provisions create the possibility that a corporate opportunity that would otherwise be available to us may be used for the benefit of one of our affiliates.
wexford continues to own shares of our common stock, and its interests may conflict with those of our other stockholders.
as of february 12, 2016, wexford beneficially owned less than 1% of our common stock. in addition, an individual affiliated with wexford serves as the chairman of our board of directors. as a result, wexford may be able to exercise influence over matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors, changes to our organizational documents and significant corporate transactions. the interests of wexford with respect to matters potentially or actually involving or affecting us, such as future acquisitions, financings and other corporate opportunities and attempts to acquire us, may conflict with the interests of our other stockholders.
we have engaged in transactions with our affiliates and expect to do so in the future. the terms of such transactions and the resolution of any conflicts that may arise may not always be in our or our stockholders' best interests.
we have engaged in transactions and expect to continue to engage in transactions with affiliated companies. these transactions include, among others, drilling services provided to us by bison, real property leased by us from fasken midland, llc, and hydraulic fracturing sand purchased by us from muskie. each of these entities is either controlled by or affiliated with wexford, and the resolution of any conflicts that may arise in connection with such related party transactions, including pricing, duration or other terms of service, may not always be in our or our stockholders' best interests because wexford may have the ability to influence the outcome of these conflicts.
we incur increased costs as a result of being a public company, which may significantly affect our financial condition.
we completed our initial public offering in october 2012. as a public company, we incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company. we also incur costs associated with our public company reporting requirements and with corporate governance requirements, including requirements under the sarbanes-oxley act, as well as rules implemented by the sec and the financial industry regulatory authority. these rules and regulations increase our legal and financial compliance costs and make some activities more time-consuming and costly. these rules and regulations make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance and we may be required to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage. as a result, it may be more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified individuals to serve on our board of directors or as executive officers.
although our common stock is listed on the nasdaq select global market, we cannot assure you that an active public market will continue for our common stock. if an active public market for our common stock does not continue, the trading price and liquidity of our common stock will be materially and adversely affected. if there is a thin trading market or "float" for
our stock, the market price for our common stock may fluctuate significantly more than the stock market as a whole. without a large float, our common stock would be less liquid than the stock of companies with broader public ownership and, as a result, the trading prices of our common stock may be more volatile. in addition, in the absence of an active public trading market, investors may be unable to liquidate their investment in us. furthermore, the stock market is subject to significant price and volume fluctuations, and the price of our common stock could fluctuate widely in response to several factors, including:
•   investment recommendations by securities analysts following our business or our industry;
•   additions or departures of key personnel;
•   changes in the business, earnings estimates or market perceptions of our competitors;
•   our failure to achieve operating results consistent with securities analysts' projections;
•   changes in industry, general market or economic conditions; and
the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations in recent years that have significantly affected the quoted prices of the securities of many companies, including companies in our industry. the changes often appear to occur without regard to specific operating performance. the price of our common stock could fluctuate based upon factors that have little or nothing to do with our company and these fluctuations could materially reduce our stock price.
sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that these sales may occur, could cause the market price of our common stock to decline. in addition, the sale of such shares, or the perception that such sales may occur, could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional common or preferred stock. except for any shares purchased by our affiliates, all of the shares of common stock sold in our initial public offering and our subsequent equity offering are freely tradable. in the event that one or more of our stockholders sells a substantial amount of our common stock in the public market, or the market perceives that such sales may occur, the price of our stock could decline.
a change of control could limit our use of net operating losses.
as of december 31, 2015, we had a net operating loss, or nol, carry forward of approximately $82.6 million for federal income tax purposes. transfers of our stock could result in an ownership change. in such a case, our ability to use the nols generated through the ownership change date could be limited. in general, the amount of nols we could use for any tax year after the date of the ownership change would be limited to the value of our stock (as of the ownership change date) multiplied by the long-term tax-exempt rate.
if securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, if they adversely change their recommendations regarding our stock or if our operating results do not meet their expectations, our stock price could decline.
the trading market for our common stock will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business. if one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to publish reports on us regularly, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline. moreover, if one or more of the analysts who cover our company downgrade our stock or if our operating results do not meet their expectations, our stock price could decline.
our certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue, without the approval of our stockholders, one or more classes or series of preferred stock having such designations, preferences, limitations and relative rights, including preferences over our common stock respecting dividends and distributions, as our board of directors may determine. the terms of one or more classes or series of preferred stock could adversely impact the voting power or value of our common stock. for example, we might grant holders of preferred stock the right to elect some number of our directors in all events or on the happening of specified
provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and delaware law make it more difficult to effect a change in control of the company, which could adversely affect the price of our common stock.
•   provisions regulating the ability of our stockholders to nominate directors for election or to bring matters for action at annual meetings of our stockholders;
•   limitations on the ability of our stockholders to call a special meeting and act by written consent;
•   the ability of our board of directors to adopt, amend or repeal bylaws, and the requirement that the affirmative vote of holders representing at least 66 2/3% of the voting power of all outstanding shares of capital stock be obtained for stockholders to amend our bylaws;
•   the requirement that the affirmative vote of holders representing at least 66 2/3% of the voting power of all outstanding shares of capital stock be obtained to remove directors;
•   the requirement that the affirmative vote of holders representing at least 66 2/3% of the voting power of all outstanding shares of capital stock be obtained to amend our certificate of incorporation; and
•   the authorization given to our board of directors to issue and set the terms of preferred stock without the approval of our stockholders.
these provisions also could discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for you and other stockholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions. as a result, these provisions could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if doing so would benefit our stockholders, which may limit the price that investors are willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock.
we have not paid dividends since our inception and we currently anticipate that we will retain all future earnings, if any, to finance the growth and development of our business. we do not intend to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future. any future determination as to the declaration and payment of cash dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon our financial condition, results of operations, contractual restrictions, capital requirements, business prospects and other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors. in addition, the terms of our revolving credit facility prohibit us from paying dividends and making other distributions. as a result, only appreciation of the price of our common stock, which may not occur, will provide a return to our stockholders.
item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k. the following discussion contains "forward-looking statements" that reflect our future plans, estimates, beliefs, and expected performance. actual results and the timing of events may differ materially from those contained in these forward-looking statements due to a number of factors. see item 1a. "risk factors" and "cautionary statement regarding forward-looking statements."
overview we are an independent oil and natural gas company focused on the acquisition, development, exploration and exploitation of unconventional, onshore oil and natural gas reserves in the permian basin in west texas. our activities are primarily directed at the clearfork, spraberry, wolfcamp, cline, strawn and atoka formations which we refer to as the wolfberry play. we intend to continue to develop our reserves and increase production through development drilling and exploitation and exploration activities on our multi-year inventory of identified potential drilling locations and through acquisitions that meet our strategic and financial objectives, targeting oil-weighted reserves. substantially all of our revenues are generated through the sale of oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas production. our production was approximately 75% oil, 14% natural gas liquids and 11% natural gas for the year ended december 31, 2015, approximately 76% oil, 14% natural gas liquids and 10% natural gas for the year ended december 31, 2014 and approximately 76% oil, 13% natural gas liquids and 11% natural gas for the year ended december 31, 2013. on december 31, 2015, our net acreage position in the permian basin was approximately 84,683 net acres.
2015 transactions and recent developments common stock transactions in january 2015, we completed an underwritten public offering of 2,012,500 shares of common stock, which included 262,500 shares of common stock issued pursuant to an option to purchase additional shares granted to the underwriter. the stock was sold to the underwriter at $59.34 per share and we received proceeds of approximately $119.4 million from the sale of these shares of common stock, net of offering expenses and underwriting discounts and commissions.

leasehold and mineral interest transactions since january 1, 2015, we have acquired from unrelated third party sellers an aggregate of approximately 16,940 gross (12,672 net) acres in the midland basin, primarily in northwest howard county, for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $437.5 million, subject to certain adjustments. approximately 83% of this acreage is held by production. we believe the acreage is prospective for horizontal drilling in the lower spraberry, wolfcamp a and wolfcamp b horizons, and have identified an aggregate of approximately 232 net potential horizontal drilling locations in these horizons based on 660 foot spacing between wells. we currently estimate that approximately 42% of the potential horizontal locations will have approximately 10,000 foot laterals, which can provide higher rates of return and capital efficiency than shorter laterals. the average lateral length for these potential horizontal locations is estimated to be approximately 8,357 feet. we also believe that additional development potential may exist in the middle spraberry horizon. salt water disposal infrastructure is already in place on the acreage in northwest howard county, and the acquisitions included 3-d seismic data that can be used to geosteer the drilling of horizontal wells. on
july 9, 2015, we completed the sale of an approximate average 1.5% overriding royalty interest in certain of its acreage primarily located in howard county, texas to the partnership for $31.1 million.
operational update in january 2016, we completed our first three well pad in glasscock county targeting the lower spraberry, wolfcamp a and wolfcamp b with an average lateral length of 7,400 feet. the wells are in various stages of flowback and artificial lift but produced in excess of 3,600 boe/d (81% oil) on a combined basis over seven days. our second pad in glasscock county, with two wells targeting the wolfcamp a and wolfcamp b, was still cleaning up as of february 15, 2016.
we intend to release one of our three horizontal drilling rigs in march 2016. we will continue monitoring the commodity price environment and expect to retain the financial flexibility to adjust our drilling and completion plans in response to market conditions.
2016 capital budget we expect a 2016 total capital spend of $250.0 million to $375.0 million, consisting of $210.0 million to $315.0 million for horizontal drilling and completions, $25.0 million to $35.0 million for infrastructure and $15.0 million to $25.0 million for non-operated activity and other expenditures. we expect to drill and complete 30 to 70 gross horizontal wells in 2016.
we intend to release one of our three horizontal drilling rigs in march 2016. we will continue monitoring the ongoing commodity price environment and expect to retain the financial flexibility to adjust our drilling and completion plans as conditions warrant. we are prepared to decelerate our drilling program if commodity prices deteriorate and accelerate our drilling program if commodity prices improve. if necessary, we can release a second rig in the second quarter of 2016 and continue to operate one rig to hold acreage.
basis of presentation transfers of a business between entities under common control are accounted for as if the transfer occurred at the beginning of the period, and prior years are retrospectively adjusted to furnish comparative information. the windsor ut llc contribution was accounted for as a transaction between entities under common control. accordingly, the financial information and production data contained in this report have been retrospectively adjusted to include the historical results of windsor ut llc at historical carrying values and its operations prior to october 11, 2012, the effective date of the windsor ut llc contribution.
reserves and pricing ryder scott prepared estimates of our proved reserves at december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 (which include estimated proved reserves attributable to viper). the prices used to estimate proved reserves for all periods did not give effect to derivative transactions, were held constant throughout the life of the properties and have been adjusted for quality, transportation fees, geographical differentials, marketing bonuses or deductions and other factors affecting the price received at the wellhead.
unweighted arithmetic average first-day-of-the-month prices oil (per bbl)                      $45.07                $87.15                $92.59
sources of our revenue our revenues are derived from the sale of oil and natural gas production, as well as the sale of natural gas liquids that are extracted from our natural gas during processing. our oil and natural gas revenues do not include the effects of derivatives. for the year ended december 31, 2015, our revenues were derived 91% from oil sales, 5% from natural gas liquids sales and 4% from natural gas sales. for the year ended december 31, 2014, our revenues were derived 91% from oil sales, 6% from natural gas liquids sales and 3% from natural gas sales. for the year ended december 31, 2013, our revenues were derived 91% from oil sales, 6% from natural gas liquids sales and 3% from natural gas sales. our revenues may vary significantly from period to period as a result of changes in volumes of production sold, production mix or commodity prices.
since our production consists primarily of oil, our revenues are more sensitive to fluctuations in oil prices than they are to fluctuations in natural gas liquids or natural gas prices. oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas prices have historically been volatile. during 2015, west texas intermediate posted prices ranged from $34.55 to $61.36 per bbl and the henry hub spot market price of natural gas ranged from $1.63 to $3.32 per mmbtu. on december 31, 2015, the west texas intermediate posted price for crude oil was $37.13 per bbl and the henry hub spot market price of natural gas was $2.28 per mmbtu.
over the past several months, oil prices have declined from over $61.00 per bbl in june 2015 to below $27.00 per bbl in january 2016 due in large part to increasing supplies and weakening demand growth. lower prices may not only decrease our revenues, but also potentially the amount of oil and natural gas that we can produce economically. lower oil and natural gas prices may also result in a reduction in the borrowing base under our credit agreement, which may be determined at the discretion of our lenders.
principal components of our cost structure lease operating and natural gas transportation and treating expenses. these are daily costs incurred to bring oil and natural gas out of the ground and to the market, together with the daily costs incurred to maintain our producing properties. such costs also include maintenance, repairs and workover expenses related to our oil and natural gas properties.
production and ad valorem taxes. production taxes are paid on produced oil and natural gas based on a percentage of revenues from products sold at fixed rates established by federal, state or local taxing authorities. where available, we benefit from tax credits and exemptions in our various taxing jurisdictions. we are also subject to ad valorem taxes in the counties where our production is located. ad valorem taxes are generally based on the valuation of our oil and gas properties.
general and administrative. these are costs incurred for overhead, including payroll and benefits for our corporate staff, costs of maintaining our headquarters, costs of managing our production and development operations, franchise taxes, audit and other fees for professional services and legal compliance.
depreciation, depletion and amortization. under the full cost accounting method, we capitalize costs within a cost center and then systematically expense those costs on a units of production basis based on proved oil and natural gas reserve quantities. we calculate depletion on the following types of costs: (i) all capitalized costs, other than the cost of investments in unproved properties and major development projects for which proved reserves cannot yet be assigned, less accumulated amortization; (ii) the estimated future expenditures to be incurred in developing proved reserves; and (iii) the estimated dismantlement and abandonment costs, net of estimated salvage values. depreciation of other property and equipment is computed using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives, which range from three to fifteen years.
interest expense. we have financed a portion of our working capital requirements, capital expenditures and acquisitions with borrowings under our revolving credit facility and our net proceeds from the issuance of the senior notes. we incur interest expense that is affected by both fluctuations in interest rates and our financing decisions. we reflect interest paid to our lender in interest expense. in addition, we include the amortization of deferred financing costs (including origination and amendment fees), commitment fees and annual agency fees in interest expense.
gain/loss on derivative instruments. we utilize commodity derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in the price of crude oil. this amount represents (i) the recognition of the change in the fair value of open non-hedge derivative contracts as commodity prices change and commodity derivative contracts expire or new ones are entered into, and (ii) our gains and losses on the settlement of these commodity derivative instruments.
loss from equity investment. this line item represents our proportionate share of the earnings and losses from our investment in the membership interests of muskie, an equity method investment.
we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences of (1) temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of existing assets and liabilities and (2) operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. deferred income tax assets and liabilities are based on enacted tax rates applicable to the future period when those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. the effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period the rate change is enacted. a valuation allowance is provided for deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not the deferred tax assets will not be realized.

(1)   hedged prices reflect the effect of our commodity derivative transactions on our average sales prices. our calculation of such effects include realized gains and losses on cash settlements for commodity derivatives, which we do not designate for hedge accounting.
oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas revenues. our oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas revenues decreased by approximately $49.0 million, or 10%, to $446.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2015 from $495.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2014. our revenues are a function of oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas production volumes sold and average sales prices received for those volumes. average daily production sold increased by 13,624 boe/d to 33,098 boe/d during the year ended december 31, 2015 from 19,474 boe/d during the year ended december 31, 2014. the total decrease in revenue of approximately $49.0 million is largely attributable to lower average sales prices partially offset by higher oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas production volumes for the year ended december 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2014. the increases in production volumes were due to a combination of increased drilling activity and growth through acquisitions. our production increased by 3,699,559 bbls of oil, 675,632 bbls of natural gas liquids and 3,585,321 mcf of natural gas for the year ended december 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2014.
lease operating expense. lease operating expense was $82.6 million ($6.84 per boe) for the year ended december 31, 2015, an increase of $27.2 million, or 49%, from $55.4 million ($7.79 per boe) for the year ended december 31, 2014. the increase is due to increased drilling activity and acquisitions, which resulted in 169 additional producing wells for the year ended december 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2014. upon becoming the operator of wells acquired in our acquisitions, we seek to achieve the efficiencies in those wells that we have established with our existing portfolio of wells.
production and ad valorem tax expense. production and ad valorem taxes increased to $33.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2015 from $32.6 million for the year ended december 31, 2014. in general, production taxes and ad valorem taxes are directly related to commodity price changes; however, texas ad valorem taxes are based upon prior year commodity prices, whereas production taxes are based upon current year commodity prices. during the year ended december 31, 2015, our production taxes per boe decreased by $1.86 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2014, primarily reflecting the impact of lower oil and natural gas prices on production taxes in 2015, offset by an increased production as a result of our acquisitions and drilling.
general and administrative expense. general and administrative expense increased $10.7 million from $21.3 million for the year ended december 31, 2014 to $32.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2015. the increase was due to increases in salaries and benefits expense as a result of an increase in workforce and equity-based compensation.
net interest expense. net interest expense for the year ended december 31, 2015 was $41.5 million as compared to $34.5 million for the year ended december 31, 2014, an increase of $7.0 million. this increase was due primarily to the higher average level of outstanding borrowings under our credit facility during 2015.
derivatives. we are required to recognize all derivative instruments on the balance sheet as either assets or liabilities measured at fair value. we have not designated our derivative instruments as hedges for accounting purposes. as a result, we mark our derivative instruments to fair value and recognize the cash and non-cash changes in fair value on derivative instruments in our consolidated statements of operations under the line item captioned "gain (loss) on derivative instruments, net." for the years ended december 31, 2015 and 2014, we had a cash gain on settlement of derivative instruments of $144.9 million and $10.4 million, respectively. for the year ended december 31, 2015, we had a negative change in the fair value of open derivative instruments of $112.9 million as compared to a positive change in the fair value of open derivative instruments of $117.1 million during the year ended december 31, 2014.
income tax benefit (expense). we recorded an income tax benefit of $201.3 million for the year ended december 31, 2015 as compared to an income tax expense of $109.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2014. our effective tax rate was 26.9% for the year ended december 31, 2015 as compared to 35.7% for the year ended december 31, 2014.
oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas revenues. our oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas revenues increased by approximately $287.7 million, or 138%, to $495.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2014 from $208.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2013. our revenues are a function of oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas production volumes sold and average sales prices received for those volumes. average daily production sold increased by 12,153 boe/d to 19,474 boe/d during the year ended december 31, 2014 from 7,321 boe/d during the year ended december 31, 2013. the total increase in revenue of approximately $287.7 million was largely attributable to higher oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas production volumes for the year ended december 31, 2014 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2013, partially offset by lower average sales prices. the increases in production volumes were due to a combination of increased drilling activity and growth through acquisitions. our production increased by 3,358,827 bbls of oil, 640,912 bbls of natural gas liquids and 2,615,419 mcf of natural gas for the year ended december 31, 2014 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2013.
lease operating expense. lease operating expense was $55.4 million ($7.79 per boe) for the year ended december 31, 2014, an increase of $34.2 million, or 162%, from $21.2 million ($7.92 per boe) for the year ended december 31, 2013. the increase was due to increased drilling activity and acquisitions, which resulted in 389 additional producing wells for the year ended december 31, 2014 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2013. upon becoming the operator of wells acquired in our acquisitions, we seek to achieve the efficiencies in those wells that we have established with our existing portfolio of wells. on a per boe basis, lease operating expense remained stable as new volumes came on line and expenses were held in line or were reduced.
production and ad valorem tax expense. production and ad valorem taxes increased to $32.6 million for the year ended december 31, 2014 from $12.9 million for the year ended december 31, 2013. in general, production taxes and ad valorem taxes are directly related to commodity price changes; however, texas ad valorem taxes are based upon prior year commodity prices, whereas production taxes are based upon current year commodity prices. during the year ended december 31, 2014, our production taxes per boe decreased by $0.24 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2013, primarily reflecting the impact of lower oil and natural gas prices on production taxes. our ad valorem taxes have increased primarily as a result of increased valuations on our properties.
the increases in depletion of proved oil and natural gas properties of $102.9 million for the year ended december 31, 2014 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2013 resulted primarily from higher total production levels, increased net book value on new reserves added and an increase in capitalized interest to the full cost pool. on a per boe basis, depreciation, depletion and amortization expense decreased primarily due to the increased net book value on new reserves and acquisitions.
general and administrative expense. general and administrative expense increased $10.2 million from $11.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2013 to $21.3 million for the year ended december 31, 2014. the increase was due to increases in equity-based compensation, salary, legal, professional service and advisory service expenses. these increases were partially offset by increases in general and administrative costs related to exploration and development activity capitalized to the full cost pool and increases in copas overhead reimbursements due to increased drilling activity.
derivatives. we are required to recognize all derivative instruments on the balance sheet as either assets or liabilities measured at fair value. we have not designated our derivative instruments as hedges for accounting purposes. as a result, we mark our derivative instruments to fair value and recognize the cash and non-cash changes in fair value on derivative instruments in our consolidated statements of operations under the line item captioned "gain (loss) on derivative instruments, net." for the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013, we had a cash gain on settlement of derivative instruments of $10.4 million and a cash loss on settlement of derivative instruments of $7.2 million, respectively. for the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013, we had a positive change in the fair value of open derivative instruments of $117.1 million and $5.3 million, respectively.
liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of liquidity have been proceeds from our public equity offerings, borrowings under our revolving credit facility, proceeds from the issuance of the senior notes and cash flows from operations. our primary use of capital has been for the acquisition, development and exploration of oil and natural gas properties. as we pursue reserves and production growth, we regularly consider which capital resources, including equity and debt financings, are available to meet our future financial obligations, planned capital expenditure activities and liquidity requirements. our future ability to grow proved reserves and production will be highly dependent on the capital resources available to us.
liquidity and cash flow our cash flows for the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 are presented below:
net cash provided by operating activities      $416,501                  $356,389                $155,777
net cash used in investing activities          (895,050    )           (1,481,997    )           (940,140    )
net cash provided by financing activities      $468,481                $1,140,236                $773,560
operating activities net cash provided by operating activities was $416.5 million for the year ended december 31, 2015 as compared to $356.4 million for the year ended december 31, 2014. the increase in operating cash flows is primarily the result of the increase in our oil and natural gas revenues due to a 70.0% increase in our net boe production partially offset by a 47.0% decrease in our net realized sales prices.
net cash provided by operating activities was $356.4 million for the year ended december 31, 2014 as compared to $155.8 million for the year ended december 31, 2013. the increase in operating cash flows is primarily a result of the increase in our oil and natural gas revenues due to a 166.0% increase in our net boe production partially offset by a 10.4% decrease in our net realized sales prices.
our operating cash flow is sensitive to many variables, the most significant of which is the volatility of prices for the oil and natural gas we produce. prices for these commodities are determined primarily by prevailing market conditions. regional and worldwide economic activity, weather and other substantially variable factors influence market conditions for these products. these factors are beyond our control and are difficult to predict. see "-sources of our revenue" and item 1a. "risk factors" above.
investing activities the purchase and development of oil and natural gas properties accounted for the majority of our cash outlays for investing activities. we used cash for investing activities of $895.1 million, $1,482.0 million and $940.1 million during the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 respectively.
during the year ended december 31, 2015, we spent $419.5 million on capital expenditures in conjunction with our drilling program, in which we drilled 64 gross (54 net) horizontal wells and four gross (three net) vertical wells and participated in the drilling of 15 gross (six net) non-operated wells, $437.5 million on leasehold acquisitions, $43.9 million on royalty interest acquisitions and $1.2 million for the purchase of other property and equipment.
during the year ended december 31, 2014, we spent $499.8 million on capital expenditures in conjunction with our drilling program and related infrastructure projects, in which we drilled 82 gross (67 net) horizontal wells and 27 gross (22 net) vertical wells and participated in the drilling of four gross (two net) non-operated wells. we spent an additional $845.8 million on leasehold costs, $44.2 million for the purchase of other property and equipment, $57.7 million on the acquisitions of mineral interests underlying approximately 10,364 gross (3,261 net) acres in the midland and delaware basins and approximately $33.9 million for a minor equity interest in an entity that owns mineral, overriding royalty, net profits, leasehold and other similar interests.
during the year ended december 31, 2013, we spent $297.7 million on capital expenditures in conjunction with our drilling program in which drilled 77 gross (70 net) wells and participated in the drilling of four gross (two net) non-operated wells. we spent an additional $444.1 million on the acquisition of mineral interests, $177.3 million on leasehold costs, $2.2 million for the purchase of other property and equipment and $0.3 million, net, on the settlement of non-hedge derivative instruments and $18.6 million for the post-closing adjustment associated with our acquisition of gulfport energy corporation's oil and natural gas assets in the permian basin in connection with our initial public offering in october 2012.
our investing activities for the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 are summarized in the following table:
acquisition of leasehold interests               (437,455      )         (845,826        )            (177,343    )

financing activities net cash provided by financing activities for the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 was $468.5 million, $1,140.2 million and $773.6 million, respectively. the 2015 amount provided by financing activities was primarily attributable to the aggregate proceeds from our january, may and august 2015 equity offerings of $650.7 million partially offset by repayments of net borrowings of $184.5 million, under our credit facility. during the year ended december 31, 2014, the amount provided by financing activities was primarily attributable to the net proceeds of $208.4 million from our february 2014 equity offering, net proceeds of $137.2 million from the viper offering, net proceeds of $485.0 million from our july 2014 equity offering, net proceeds of $94.8 million from the viper september 2014 equity offering and borrowings, net of repayment, of $213.5 million under our credit facility. for the year ended december 31, 2013, the amount provided by financing activities was primarily attributable to (a) the net proceeds of $144.4 million from our may 2013 equity offering, $177.5 million from our august 2013 equity offering, $450.0 million from our september 2013 senior note offering and (b) net borrowings of $10.0 million under our revolving credit facility. in both 2014 and 2013, these proceeds were used primarily to acquire property and fund our drilling costs.
senior notes on september 18, 2013, we completed an offering of $450.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 7.625% senior unsecured notes due 2021, which we refer to as the senior notes. the senior notes bear interest at the rate of 7.625% per annum, payable semi-annually, in arrears on april 1 and october 1 of each year and will mature on october 1, 2021. on june 23, 2014, in connection with the viper offering, we designated viper, the general partner and viper energy partners llc, as unrestricted subsidiaries and, upon such designation, viper energy llc, which was a guarantor under the indenture governing of the senior notes, was released as a guarantor under the indenture. as of december 31, 2015, the senior notes were fully and unconditionally guaranteed by diamondback o&g llc, diamondback e&p llc and white fang energy llc and will also be guaranteed by any of our future restricted subsidiaries. the net proceeds from the senior notes were used to fund the acquisition of mineral interests underlying approximately 14,804 gross (12,687 net) acres in midland county, texas in the permian basin.
the senior notes were issued under, and are governed by, an indenture among us, the subsidiary guarantors party thereto and wells fargo bank, n.a., as the trustee, as amended and supplemented, or the indenture. we may issue additional senior notes under the indenture, and all senior notes issued under the indenture will constitute part of a single class of securities for all purposes of the indenture. the indenture contains certain covenants that, subject to certain exceptions and qualifications, among other things, limit our ability and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to incur or guarantee additional indebtedness, make certain investments, declare or pay dividends or make other distributions on, or redeem or repurchase, capital stock, prepay subordinated indebtedness, sell assets including capital stock of subsidiaries, agree to payment restrictions affecting our restricted subsidiaries, consolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets, enter into transactions with affiliates, incur liens, engage in business other than the oil and gas business and designate certain of our subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries. if we experience certain kinds of changes of control or if we sell certain of our assets, holders of the senior notes may have the right to require us to repurchase their senior notes.
we have the option to redeem the senior notes, in whole or in part, at any time on or after october 1, 2016 at the redemption prices (expressed as percentages of principal amount) of 105.719% for the 12-month period beginning on october 1, 2016, 103.813% for the 12-month period beginning on october 1, 2017, 101.906% for the 12-month period beginning on october 1, 2018 and 100.000% beginning on october 1, 2019 and at any time thereafter with any accrued and unpaid interest
to, but not including, the date of redemption. in addition, prior to october 1, 2016, we may redeem all or a part of the senior notes at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the redemption date, plus a "make-whole" premium at the redemption date. furthermore, before october 1, 2016, we may, at any time or from time to time, redeem up to 35% of the aggregate principal amount of the senior notes with the net cash proceeds of certain equity offerings at a redemption price of 107.625% of the principal amount of the senior notes being redeemed plus any accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption, if at least 65% of the aggregate principal amount of the senior notes originally issued under the indenture remains outstanding immediately after such redemption and the redemption occurs within 120 days of the closing date of such equity offering.
in connection with the issuance of the senior notes, we and the subsidiary guarantors entered into a registration rights agreement with the initial purchasers on september 18, 2013, pursuant to which we and the subsidiary guarantors agreed to offer to exchange the senior notes for a new issue of substantially identical debt securities registered under the securities act. the exchange offer was completed on october 23, 2014.
second amended and restated credit facility our second amended and restated credit agreement, dated november 1, 2013, as amended on june 9, 2014 and november 13, 2014, with a syndicate of banks, including wells fargo, as administrative agent, sole book runner and lead arranger, provides for a revolving credit facility in the maximum amount of $2.0 billion, subject to scheduled semi-annual and other elective collateral borrowing base redeterminations based on our oil and natural gas reserves and other factors. the borrowing base is scheduled to be re-determined semi-annually with effective dates of may 1st and november 1st. in addition, we may request up to three additional redeterminations of the borrowing base during any 12-month period. as of december 31, 2015, the borrowing base was set at $750.0 million, although we elected a commitment amount of $500.0 million. as of december 31, 2015, we had outstanding borrowings of $11.0 million, which bore a weighted-average interest rate of 1.92%, and $489.0 million available for future borrowings under this facility.
the june 9, 2014 amendment modified certain provisions of the credit agreement to, among other things, allow us to designate one or more of our subsidiaries as "unrestricted subsidiaries" that are not subject to certain restrictions contained in the credit agreement. in connection with the viper offering, we designated viper, the general partner and viper energy partners llc as unrestricted subsidiaries under the credit agreement. as of december 31, 2015, the loan was guaranteed by us, diamondback e&p llc and white fang energy llc and will also be guaranteed by any of our future restricted subsidiaries. the credit agreement is also secured by substantially all of our assets and the assets of diamondback o&g llc and the guarantors.
the outstanding borrowings under the credit agreement bear interest at a rate elected by us that is equal to an alternative base rate (which is equal to the greatest of the prime rate, the federal funds effective rate plus 0.50% and 3-month libor plus 1.0%) or libor, in each case plus the applicable margin. the applicable margin ranges from 0.50% to 1.50% in the case of the alternative base rate and from 1.50% to 2.50% in the case of libor, in each case depending on the amount of the loan outstanding in relation to the borrowing base. we are obligated to pay a quarterly commitment fee ranging from 0.375% to 0.500% per year on the unused portion of the borrowing base, which fee is also dependent on the amount of the loan outstanding in relation to the borrowing base. loan principal may be optionally repaid from time to time without premium or penalty (other than customary libor breakage), and is required to be repaid (a) to the extent that the loan amount exceeds the borrowing base, whether due to a borrowing base redetermination or otherwise (in some cases subject to a cure period), (b) in an amount equal to the net cash proceeds from the sale of property when a borrowing base deficiency or event of default exists under the credit agreement and (c) at the maturity date of november 1, 2018.
the credit agreement contains various affirmative, negative and financial maintenance covenants. these covenants, among other things, limit additional indebtedness, additional liens, sales of assets, mergers and consolidations, dividends and distributions, transactions with affiliates and entering into certain swap agreements and require the maintenance of the financial ratios described below.
financial covenant                                                           required ratio ratio of total debt to ebitdax                                               not greater than 4.0 to 1.0
ratio of current assets to liabilities, as defined in the credit agreement   not less than 1.0 to 1.0
the covenant prohibiting additional indebtedness allows for the issuance of unsecured debt of up to $750.0 million in the form of senior or senior subordinated notes and, in connection with any such issuance, the reduction of the borrowing base by 25% of the stated principal amount of each such issuance. a borrowing base reduction in connection with such issuance may
as of december 31, 2015, we were in compliance with all financial covenants under our revolving credit facility. the lenders may accelerate all of the indebtedness under our revolving credit facility upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any event of default. the credit agreement contains customary events of default, including non-payment, breach of covenants, materially incorrect representations, cross-default, bankruptcy and change of control. with certain specified exceptions, the terms and provisions of our revolving credit facility generally may be amended with the consent of the lenders holding a majority of the outstanding loans or commitments to lend.
viper's facility-wells fargo bank on july 8, 2014, viper entered into a secured revolving credit agreement with wells fargo bank, as the administrative agent, sole book runner and lead arranger. the credit agreement, which was amended august 15, 2014 to add additional lenders to the lending group, provides for a revolving credit facility in the maximum amount of $500.0 million, subject to scheduled semi-annual and other elective collateral borrowing base redeterminations based on viper's oil and natural gas reserves and other factors. the borrowing base is scheduled to be re-determined semi-annually with effective dates of april 1st and october 1st. in addition, viper may request up to three additional redeterminations of the borrowing base during any 12-month period. the credit agreement was further amended on may 22, 2015 to, among other things, increase the borrowing base from $110.0 million to $175.0 million and to provide for certain restrictions on purchasing margin stock. on november 13, 2015, the borrowing base was increased from $175.0 million to $200.0 million. as of december 31, 2015, the borrowing base was set at $200.0 million. viper had $34.5 million outstanding under its credit agreement.
the outstanding borrowings under viper's credit agreement bear interest at a rate elected by viper that is equal to an alternative base rate (which is equal to the greatest of the prime rate, the federal funds effective rate plus 0.5% and 3-month libor plus 1.0%) or libor, in each case plus the applicable margin. the applicable margin ranges from 0.50% to 1.50% in the case of the alternative base rate and from 1.50% to 2.50% in the case of libor, in each case depending on the amount of the loan outstanding in relation to the borrowing base. viper is obligated to pay a quarterly commitment fee ranging from 0.375% to 0.500% per year on the unused portion of the borrowing base, which fee is also dependent on the amount of the loan outstanding in relation to the borrowing base. loan principal may be optionally repaid from time to time without premium or penalty (other than customary libor breakage), and is required to be repaid (a) to the extent that the loan amount exceeds the borrowing base, whether due to a borrowing base redetermination or otherwise (in some cases subject to a cure period) and (b) at the maturity date of july 8, 2019. the loan is secured by substantially all of the assets of viper and its subsidiaries.
the viper credit agreement contains various affirmative, negative and financial maintenance covenants. these covenants, among other things, limit additional indebtedness, purchases of margin stock, additional liens, sales of assets, mergers and consolidations, dividends and distributions, transactions with affiliates and entering into certain swap agreements and require the maintenance of the financial ratios described below.
financial covenant                                                           required ratio ratio of total debt to ebitdax                                               not greater than 4.0 to 1.0
ratio of current assets to liabilities, as defined in the credit agreement   not less than 1.0 to 1.0
the covenant prohibiting additional indebtedness allows for the issuance of unsecured debt of up to $250.0 million in the form of senior unsecured notes and, in connection with any such issuance, the reduction of the borrowing base by 25% of the stated principal amount of each such issuance. a borrowing base reduction in connection with such issuance may require a portion of the outstanding principal of the loan to be repaid.
the lenders may accelerate all of the indebtedness under viper's revolving credit facility upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any event of default. the viper's credit agreement contains customary events of default, including non-payment, breach of covenants, materially incorrect representations, cross-default, bankruptcy and change of control. there are no cure periods for events of default due to non-payment of principal and breaches of negative and financial covenants, but non-payment of interest and breaches of certain affirmative covenants are subject to customary cure periods.
capital requirements and sources of liquidity our board of directors approved a 2016 capital budget for drilling and infrastructure of $250.0 million to $375.0 million, representing a decrease of 26% over our 2015 capital budget. we estimate that, of these expenditures, approximately:
•   $15.0 million to $25.0 million will be spent on non-operated activity and other expenditures.
during the year ended december 31, 2015, our aggregate capital expenditures for drilling and infrastructure were $419.5 million. we do not have a specific acquisition budget since the timing and size of acquisitions cannot be accurately forecasted. during the year ended december 31, 2015, we spent approximately $437.5 million on acquisitions of leasehold interests.
the amount and timing of these capital expenditures is largely discretionary and within our control. we could choose to defer a portion of these planned capital expenditures depending on a variety of factors, including but not limited to the success of our drilling activities, prevailing and anticipated prices for oil and natural gas, the availability of necessary equipment, infrastructure and capital, the receipt and timing of required regulatory permits and approvals, seasonal conditions, drilling and acquisition costs and the level of participation by other interest owners. we currently intend to release one of our three horizontal drilling rigs in march 2016 and we have the option to release a second rig in the second quarter of 2016.
based upon current oil and natural gas price and production expectations for 2016, we believe that our cash flow from operations and borrowings under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to fund our operations through year-end 2016. however, future cash flows are subject to a number of variables, including the level of oil and natural gas production and prices, and significant additional capital expenditures will be required to more fully develop our properties. further, our 2016 capital expenditure budget does not allocate any funds for leasehold interest and property acquisitions.
we monitor and adjust our projected capital expenditures in response to success or lack of success in drilling activities, changes in prices, availability of financing, drilling and acquisition costs, industry conditions, the timing of regulatory approvals, the availability of rigs, contractual obligations, internally generated cash flow and other factors both within and outside our control. if we require additional capital, we may seek such capital through traditional reserve base borrowings, joint venture partnerships, production payment financing, asset sales, offerings of debt and or equity securities or other means. we cannot assure you that the needed capital will be available on acceptable terms or at all. if we are unable to obtain funds when needed or on acceptable terms, we may be required to curtail our drilling programs, which could result in a loss of acreage through lease expirations. in addition, we may not be able to complete acquisitions that may be favorable to us or finance the capital expenditures necessary to replace our reserves. further, if the decline in commodity continues, our revenues, cash flows, results of operations, liquidity and reserves may be materially and adversely affected.
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations and commitments as of december 31, 2015:

(1)   includes the outstanding principal amount under the revolving credit facilities, the table does not include interest expense or other fees payable under this floating rate facility as we cannot predict the timing of future borrowings and repayments or interest rates to be charged.
(3)   includes only the minimum amount of interest and commitment fees due which, as of december 31, 2015, includes a commitment fee equal to 0.375% per year of the unused portion of the borrowing base of viper's credit agreement.
(4)   amounts represent our estimates of future asset retirement obligations. because these costs typically extend many years into the future, estimating these future costs requires management to make estimates and judgments that are subject to future revisions based upon numerous factors, including the rate of inflation, changing technology and the political and regulatory environment. see note 6 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements set forth in part iv, item 15 of this form 10-k.
(5)   drilling commitments represent future minimum expenditure commitments for drilling rig services under contracts to which the company was a party on december 31, 2015.
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states. below, we have provided expanded discussion of our more significant accounting policies, estimates and judgments. we believe these accounting policies reflect our more significant estimates and assumptions used in preparation of our financial statements. see note 2 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements set forth in part iv, item 15 of this form 10-k.
use of estimates certain amounts included in or affecting our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures must be estimated by our management, requiring certain assumptions to be made with respect to values or conditions that cannot be known with certainty at the time the consolidated financial statements are prepared. these estimates and assumptions affect the amounts we report for assets and liabilities and our disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements. actual results could differ from those estimates.
we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis, using historical experience, consultation with experts and other methods we consider reasonable in the particular circumstances. nevertheless, actual results may differ significantly from our estimates. any effects on our business, financial position or results of operations resulting from revisions to these estimates are recorded in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known. significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include estimates of proved oil and gas reserves and related present value estimates of future net cash flows therefrom, the carrying value of oil and natural gas properties, asset retirement obligations, the fair value determination of acquired assets and liabilities, equity-based compensation, fair value estimates of commodity derivatives and estimates of income taxes.
method of accounting for oil and natural gas properties we account for our oil and natural gas producing activities using the full cost method of accounting. accordingly, all costs incurred in the acquisition, exploration and development of proved oil and natural gas properties, including the costs of abandoned properties, dry holes, geophysical costs and annual lease rentals are capitalized. we also capitalize direct operating costs for services performed with internally owned drilling and well servicing equipment. internal costs capitalized to the full cost pool represent management's estimate of costs incurred directly related to exploration and development activities such as geological and other administrative costs associated with overseeing the exploration and development activities. all internal costs unrelated to drilling activities are expensed as incurred. sales or other dispositions of oil and natural gas properties are accounted for as adjustments to capitalized costs, with no gain or loss recorded unless the ratio of cost to proved reserves would significantly change. income from services provided to working interest owners of properties in which we also own an interest, to the extent they exceed related costs incurred, are accounted for as reductions of capitalized costs of oil and natural gas properties. depletion of evaluated oil and natural gas properties is computed on the units of production method, whereby capitalized costs plus estimated future development costs are amortized over total proved reserves.
costs associated with unevaluated properties are excluded from the full cost pool until we have made a determination as to the existence of proved reserves. we assess all items classified as unevaluated property on an annual basis for possible impairment. we assess properties on an individual basis or as a group if properties are individually insignificant. the assessment includes consideration of the following factors, among others: intent to drill; remaining lease term; geological and geophysical evaluations; drilling results and activity; the assignment of proved reserves; and the economic viability of development if proved reserves are assigned. during any period in which these factors indicate an impairment, the cumulative drilling costs incurred to date for such property and all or a portion of the associated leasehold costs are transferred to the full cost pool and are then subject to amortization.
oil and natural gas reserve quantities and standardized measure of future net revenue our independent engineers and technical staff prepare our estimates of oil and natural gas reserves and associated future net revenues. the sec has defined proved reserves as the estimated quantities of oil and gas which geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions. the process of estimating oil and gas reserves is complex, requiring significant decisions in the evaluation of available geological, geophysical, engineering and economic data. the data for a given property may also change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors, including additional development activity, evolving production history and a continual reassessment of the viability of production under changing economic conditions. as a result, material revisions to existing reserve estimates occur from time to time. although every reasonable effort is made to ensure that reserve estimates reported represent the most accurate assessments possible, the subjective decisions and variances in available data for various properties increase the likelihood of significant changes in these estimates. if such changes are material, they could significantly affect future amortization of capitalized costs and result in impairment of assets that may be material.
there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved oil and natural gas reserves. oil and natural gas reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and natural gas that cannot be precisely measured and the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment. results of drilling, testing and production subsequent to the date of the estimate may justify revision of such estimate. accordingly, reserve estimates are often different from the quantities of oil and natural gas that are ultimately recovered.
revenue recognition oil and natural gas revenues are recorded when title passes to the purchaser, net of royalty interests, discounts and allowances, as applicable. we account for oil and natural gas production imbalances using the sales method, whereby a liability is recorded when our volumes exceed our estimated remaining recoverable reserves. no receivables are recorded for those wells where we have taken less than our ownership share of production. we did not have any gas imbalances as of december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013. revenues from oil and natural gas services are recognized as services are provided.
impairment we use the full cost method of accounting for our oil and natural gas properties. under this method, all acquisition, exploration and development costs, including certain internal costs, are capitalized and amortized on a composite unit of production method based on proved oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas reserves. internal costs capitalized to the full cost pool represent management's estimate of costs incurred directly related to exploration and development activities such as geological and other administrative costs associated with overseeing the exploration and development activities. all internal costs not directly associated with exploration and development activities were charged to expense as they were incurred. costs associated with unevaluated properties are excluded from the full cost pool until we have made a determination as to the existence of proved reserves. the inclusion of our unevaluated costs into the amortization base is expected to be completed within three to five years. sales of oil and natural gas properties, whether or not being amortized currently, are accounted for as adjustments of capitalized costs, with no gain or loss recognized, unless such adjustments would significantly alter the relationship between capitalized costs and proved reserves of oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas.
under this method of accounting, we are required to perform a ceiling test each quarter. the test determines a limit, or ceiling, on the book value of the proved oil and gas properties. net capitalized costs are limited to the lower of unamortized cost net of deferred income taxes, or the cost center ceiling. the cost center ceiling is defined as the sum of (a) estimated future net revenues, discounted at 10% per annum, from proved reserves, based on the trailing 12-month unweighted average of the first-day-of-the-month price, adjusted for any contract provisions and excluding the estimated abandonment costs for properties with asset retirement obligations recorded on the balance sheet, (b) the cost of properties not being amortized, if any, and (c) the lower of cost or market value of unproved properties included in the cost being amortized, including related deferred taxes for differences between the book and tax basis of the oil and natural gas properties. if the net book value, including related deferred taxes, exceeds the ceiling, an impairment or non-cash writedown is required.
asset retirement obligations we measure the future cost to retire our tangible long-lived assets and recognize such cost as a liability for legal obligations associated with the retirement of long-lived assets that result from the acquisition, construction or normal operation of a long-lived asset. the fair value of a liability for an asset's retirement obligation is recorded in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made and the corresponding cost is capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the related long-lived asset. the liability is accreted to its then present value each period, and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset. if the liability is settled for an amount other than the recorded amount, the difference is recorded in oil and natural gas properties.
our asset retirement obligations primarily relate to the future plugging and abandonment of wells and related facilities. estimating the future restoration and removal costs is difficult and requires management to make estimates and judgments because most of the removal obligations are many years in the future and asset removal technologies and costs are constantly changing, as are regulatory, political, environmental, safety and public relations considerations. we estimate the future plugging and abandonment costs of wells, the ultimate productive life of the properties, a risk-adjusted discount rate and an inflation factor in order to determine the current present value of this obligation. to the extent future revisions to these assumptions impact the present value of the existing asset retirement obligation liability, a corresponding adjustment is made to the oil and gas property balance.
derivatives from time to time, we have used energy derivatives for the purpose of mitigating the risk resulting from fluctuations in the market price of crude oil. we recognize all of our derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities at fair value. the accounting for changes in the fair value (i.e., gains or losses) of a derivative instrument depends on whether it has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship and further on the type of hedging relationship. none of our derivatives were designated as hedging instruments during the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013. for derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments, changes in the fair value of these instruments are recognized in earnings during the period of change.
accounting for equity-based compensation we grant various types of equity-based awards including stock options and restricted stock units. these plans and related accounting policies are defined and described more fully in note 10-equity-based compensation. stock compensation awards are measured at fair value on the date of grant and are expensed, net of estimated forfeitures, over the required service period.
income taxes we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences of (1) temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of existing assets and liabilities and (2) operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. deferred income tax assets and liabilities are based on enacted tax rates applicable to the future period when those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. the effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period the rate change is enacted. a valuation allowance is provided for deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
recent accounting pronouncements in may 2014, the financial accounting standards board issued accounting standards update 2014-09, "revenue from contracts with customers". this update supersedes most of the existing revenue recognition requirements in gaap and requires (i) an entity to recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services and (ii) requires expanded disclosures regarding the nature, amount, timing, and certainty of revenue and cash flows from contracts with customers. the standard will be effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after december 15, 2017, with early application not permitted. the standard allows for either full retrospective adoption, meaning the standard is applied to all periods presented in the financial statements, or modified retrospective adoption, meaning the standard is applied only to the most current period presented. we are currently evaluating the impact, if any, that the adoption of this update will have on our financial position, results of operations and liquidity.
in april 2015, the financial accounting standards board issued accounting standards update 2015-03, "interest-imputation of interest". this update requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability (except costs associated with revolving debt arrangements) be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from that debt liability, consistent with the presentation of a debt discount to simplify the presentation of debt issuance costs. the standard will be effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december 15, 2015, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after december 15, 2016. early application will be permitted for financial statements that have not previously been issued. adoption of the new guidance will only affect the presentation of our consolidated balance sheets and will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
in july 2015, the financial accounting standards board issued accounting standards update 2015-11, "inventory". this update applies to all inventory that is not measured using last-in, first-out or the retail inventory method. under this update, an entity should measure inventory at the lower of cost and net realizable value. this standard will be effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years. this standard should be applied prospectively with early adoption permitted as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period. we are currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of this update will have on our financial position, results of operations and liquidity.
in november 2015, the financial accounting standards board issued accounting standards update 2015-17, "income taxes". this update requires that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position. the standard will be effective for financial statements issued for annual periods beginning after december 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. early application will be permitted as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period. this standard may be applied either prospectively to all deferred tax liabilities and assets or retrospectively to all periods presented. adoption of the new guidance will only affect the presentation of our consolidated balance sheets and will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
inflation inflation in the united states has been relatively low in recent years and did not have a material impact on results of operations for the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013. although the impact of inflation has been insignificant in recent years, it is still a factor in the united states economy and we tend to experience inflationary pressure on the cost of oilfield services and equipment as increasing oil and gas prices increase drilling activity in our areas of operations.
off-balance sheet arrangements we had no off-balance sheet arrangements as of december 31, 2015. please read note 15 included in notes to the consolidated financial statements set forth in part iv, item 15 of this form 10-k, for a discussion of our commitments and contingencies, some of which are not recognized in the balance sheets under gaap.

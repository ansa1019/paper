item 1a.   risk factors the statements in this section describe the major risks to our business and should be considered carefully. in addition, these statements constitute our cautionary statements under the private securities litigation reform act of 1995.
our disclosure and analysis in this 2015 form 10-k and in our 2015 annual report to shareholders contain forward-looking statements that set forth anticipated results based on management's plans and assumptions. from time to time, we also provide forward-looking statements in other materials we release to the public, as well as oral forward-looking statements. such forward-looking statements involve substantial risks and uncertainties. we have tried, wherever possible, to identify such statements by using words such as "will," "may," "could," "likely," "ongoing," "anticipate," "estimate," "expect," "project," "intend," "plan," "believe," "target," "forecast," "goal," "objective," "aim" and other words and terms of similar meaning or by using future dates in connection with any discussion of, among other things, our anticipated future operating and financial performance, business plans and prospects, in-line products and product candidates, strategic reviews, capital allocation, business-development plans, and plans relating to share repurchases and dividends. in particular, these include statements relating to future actions, business plans and prospects, our recent acquisition of hospira, our pending combination with allergan, prospective products or product approvals, future performance or results of current and anticipated products, sales efforts, expenses, interest rates, foreign exchange rates, the outcome of contingencies, such as legal proceedings, plans relating to share repurchases and dividends, government regulation and financial results, including, in particular, the financial guidance set forth in the overview of our performance, operating environment, strategy and outlook-our financial guidance for 2016 section in our 2015 financial report; the anticipated costs and cost savings set forth in the overview of our performance, operating environment, strategy and outlook and costs and expenses-restructuring charges and other costs associated with acquisitions and cost-reduction/productivity initiatives sections in our 2015 financial report and in notes to consolidated financial statements-note 3. restructuring charges and other costs associated with acquisitions and cost-reduction/productivity initiatives; the benefits, including synergies, expected from our recent acquisition of hospira, the expected timing of completion, tax treatment and benefits of our pending combination with allergan and the expected timing of a decision regarding a potential separation of our innovative products and established products businesses, set forth in the overview of our performance, operating environment, strategy and outlook section in our 2015 financial report; the planned capital spending set forth in the analysis of financial condition, liquidity and capital resources-selected measures of liquidity and capital resources-contractual obligations section in our 2015 financial report; and the contributions that we expect to make from our general assets to the company's pension and postretirement plans during 2016 set forth in the analysis of financial condition, liquidity and capital resources-selected measures of liquidity and capital resources-contractual obligations and in the notes to consolidated financial statements-note 11. pension and postretirement benefit plans and defined contribution plans in our 2015 financial report section in our 2015 financial report.
we cannot guarantee that any forward-looking statement will be realized, although we believe we have been prudent in our plans and assumptions. achievement of anticipated results is subject to substantial risks, uncertainties and inaccurate assumptions. should known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove inaccurate, actual results could vary materially from past results and those anticipated, estimated or projected. you should bear this in mind as you consider forward-looking statements, and you are cautioned not to put undue reliance on forward-looking statements.
we undertake no obligation to publicly update forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law or by the rules and regulations of the sec. you are advised, however, to consult any further disclosures we make on related subjects in our form 10-q and 8-k reports and our other filings with the sec. also note that we provide the following cautionary discussion of risks, uncertainties and possibly inaccurate assumptions relevant to our businesses. these are factors that, individually or in the aggregate, may cause our actual results to differ materially from expected and historical results. we note these factors for investors as permitted by the private securities litigation reform act of 1995. you should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors. consequently, you should not consider the following to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties.
risks related to our business, industry and operations:
generic competition competition from manufacturers of generic drugs is a major challenge for our branded products around the world, and the loss or expiration of intellectual property rights can have a significant adverse effect on our revenues. the date at which generic competition commences may be different from the date that the patent or regulatory exclusivity expires. however, upon the expiration or loss of patent protection for one of our products, or upon the "at-risk" launch (despite pending patent infringement litigation against the generic product) by a generic manufacturer of a generic version of one of our patented products, we can lose the major portion of revenues for that product in a very short period of time, which can adversely affect our business. a number of our current innovative products are expected to face significantly increased generic competition over the next few years.
also, the patents covering several of our medicines, including sutent, epipen, toviaz, tygacil extended-release capsules and precedex premix in the u.s. are being challenged by generic manufacturers. our licensing and collaboration partners also face challenges by generic drug manufacturers to patents covering several of their products that may impact our licenses or co-promotion rights to such products. in addition, our patent-protected products may face competition in the form of generic versions of competitors' branded products that lose their market exclusivity.
competitive products we cannot predict with accuracy the timing or impact of the introduction of competitive products, including new product entrants, in-line branded products, generic products, private label products and product candidates that treat diseases and conditions similar to those treated by our in-line drugs and drug candidates. the introduction of competitive products can result in erosion of the sales of our existing products and potential sales of products in development, as well as unanticipated product obsolescence. products that compete with ours, including some of our best-selling medicines, are launched from time to time. competitive product launches have occurred in recent years, and certain potentially competitive products are in various stages of development, some of which have been filed for approval with the fda and with regulatory authorities in other countries.
we also produce generic and biosimilar pharmaceutical products that compete with branded products from competitors, as well as other generic and biosimilar manufacturers. the ability to launch a generic or biosimilar pharmaceutical product at or before generic or biosimilar market formation is important to that product's profitability. prices for products typically decline, sometimes dramatically, following market formation, as additional companies receive approvals to market that product and competition intensifies. if a company can be "first-to-market" such that the branded drug is the only other competition for a period of time, higher levels of sales and profitability can be achieved until other competitors enter the market. with increasing competition in the generic or biosimilar product market, the timeliness with which we can market new generic or biosimilar products will increase in importance. if we are unable to bring our generic or biosimilar products to market on a timely basis, and secure "first-to-market" positions, our sales and profit opportunities could be adversely impacted.
dependence on key in-line products we recorded direct product revenues of more than $1 billion for each of seven biopharmaceutical products: prevnar/prevenar 13, lyrica, enbrel, lipitor, viagra, sutent and the premarin family of products, as well as more than $1 billion in alliance revenues (primarily eliquis) in 2015. those products and alliance revenues accounted for 44% of our total revenues in 2015. if these products or any of our other major products were to become subject to problems such as loss of patent protection (if applicable), changes in prescription growth rates, material product liability litigation, unexpected side effects, regulatory proceedings, publicity affecting doctor or patient confidence, pressure from existing competitive products, changes in labeling or, if a new, more effective treatment should be introduced, the adverse impact on our revenues could be significant. patents covering several of our best-selling medicines have recently expired or will expire in the next few years (including some of our billion-dollar and previously billion-dollar products), and patents covering a number of our best-selling medicines are, or have been, the subject of pending legal challenges. for example, in december 2014, generic versions of celebrex became available pursuant to settlement agreements with several generic manufacturers. in addition, our revenues could be significantly impacted by the timing and rate of commercial acceptance of key new products. for additional information, see the overview of our performance, operating environment, strategy and outlook--our operating environment-industry-specific challenges-intellectual property rights and collaboration/licensing rights-recent losses and expected losses of product exclusivity section in our 2015 financial report.
further, our alliance revenues have been and will continue to be adversely affected by the termination or expiration of collaboration and co-promotion agreements that we have entered into and that we may enter into from time to time. for additional information, see the overview of our performance, operating environment, strategy and outlook--our operating environment-industry-specific challenges-intellectual property rights and collaboration/licensing rights-recent losses and expected losses of collaboration rights section in our 2015 financial report.
research and development investment the discovery and development of safe, effective new products, as well as the development of additional uses for existing products, are necessary for the continued strength of our businesses. our product lines must be replenished over time in order to offset revenue losses when products lose their market exclusivity, as well as to provide for earnings growth. our growth potential depends in large part on our ability to identify and develop new products or new indications for existing products that address unmet medical needs and receive reimbursement from payers, either through internal r&d or through collaborations, acquisitions, joint ventures or licensing or other arrangements with third parties. however, balancing current growth, investment for the future and the delivery of shareholder return remains a major challenge. our ongoing investments in new product introductions and in r&d for new products and existing product extensions could exceed corresponding sales growth.
additionally, our r&d investment plans and resources may not be correctly matched between science and markets, and failure to invest in the right technology platforms, therapeutic segments, product classes, geographic markets and/or in-licensing and out-licensing opportunities in order to deliver a robust pipeline could adversely impact the productivity of our pipeline. further, even if the areas with the greatest market attractiveness are identified, the science may not work for any given program despite the significant investment required for r&d, and the commercial potential of the product may not be as competitive as expected because of the highly dynamic market environment and the hurdles in terms of access and reimbursement.
we continue to strengthen our global r&d organization and pursue strategies intended to improve innovation and overall productivity in r&d to achieve a sustainable pipeline that will deliver value in the near term and over time. there can be no assurance that these strategies will deliver the desired result, which could affect profitability in the future.
biotechnology products abbreviated legal pathways for the approval of biosimilars exist in certain international markets and, since the passage of the aca, a framework for such approval exists in the u.s. if competitors are able to obtain marketing approval for biosimilars referencing our biotechnology products, our biotechnology products may become subject to competition from biosimilars, with attendant competitive pressure, and price reductions could follow. the expiration or successful challenge of applicable patent rights could trigger this competition, assuming any relevant exclusivity period that has expired. we may face litigation with respect to the validity and/or scope of patents relating to our biotechnology products.
we are developing biosimilar medicines. the evolving pathway for registration and approval of biosimilar products by the fda and regulatory authorities in certain other countries could diminish the value of our past and future investments in biosimilars. other risks related to our development of biosimilars include the potential for steeper than anticipated price erosion due to increased competitive intensity, coupled with high costs associated with clinical development or intellectual property challenges that may preclude timely commercialization of our potential biosimilar products. there is also a risk of lower prescriptions of biosimilars due to potential concerns over comparability with innovator medicines.
research studies decisions about research studies made early in the development process of a drug candidate can have a substantial impact on the marketing strategy and payer reimbursement possibilities once the drug receives regulatory approval. for example, more detailed studies can lead to approval for a broader set of indications that may impact the marketing and payer reimbursement process, but each additional indication must be balanced against the time and resources required to demonstrate benefit and the potential delays to approval of the primary indication. we try to plan clinical trials prudently and to reasonably foresee and address challenges, but there is no guarantee that an optimal balance between trial conduct, speed and desired outcome will be achieved each time. the degree to which these challenges are foreseen and addressed could affect our future results.
risks affecting international operations our international operations could be affected by currency fluctuations, capital and exchange controls, expropriation and other restrictive government actions, changes in intellectual property legal protections and remedies, trade regulations and procedures and actions affecting approval, production, pricing, and marketing of, reimbursement for and access to our products, as well as by political unrest, unstable governments and legal systems and inter-governmental disputes. any of these changes could adversely affect our business.
many emerging markets have experienced growth rates in excess of developed markets, leading to an increased contribution to the industry's global performance. as a result, we have been employing strategies to grow in emerging markets, including the full integration of emerging markets into each of our three operating segments: gip, voc and gep. however, there is no assurance that our strategies in emerging markets will be successful or that these countries will continue to sustain these growth rates. in addition, some emerging market countries may be particularly vulnerable to periods of financial or political instability or significant currency fluctuations or may have limited resources for healthcare spending, which, as discussed above, can adversely affect our results.
specialty pharmaceuticals specialty pharmaceuticals are medicines that treat rare or life-threatening conditions that typically have smaller patient populations. the growing availability and use of innovative specialty pharmaceuticals, combined with their relative higher cost as compared to other types of pharmaceutical products, has generated payer interest in developing cost-containment strategies targeted to this sector. while the impact of payers' efforts to control access to and pricing of specialty pharmaceuticals has had limited impact on pfizer to date, a number of factors may lead to a more significant adverse business impact in the future given our growing specialty business portfolio. these include the increasing use of health technology assessment in markets around the world, u.s. pbms seeking to negotiate greater discounts, deteriorating finances of certain governments and the uptake of biosimilars as they become available.
consumer healthcare the consumer healthcare business may be impacted by economic volatility, the timing and severity of the cough, cold and flu season, generic or store brand competition affecting consumer spending patterns and market share gains of competitors' branded products or generic store brands. in addition, regulatory and legislative outcomes regarding the safety, efficacy or unintended uses of specific ingredients in our consumer healthcare products may require withdrawal, reformulation and/or relabeling of certain products (e.g., cough/cold products). see the global economic environment risk factor below.
product manufacturing and marketing risks difficulties or delays in product manufacturing or marketing could affect future results through regulatory actions, shut-downs, approval delays, withdrawals, recalls, penalties, supply disruptions or shortages, reputational harm, product liability, unanticipated costs or otherwise. examples of such difficulties or delays include, but are not limited to, the inability to increase production capacity commensurate with demand; the failure to predict market demand for, or to gain market acceptance of, approved products; the possibility that the supply of incoming materials may be delayed or become unavailable and that the quality of incoming materials may be substandard and not detected; the possibility that we may fail to maintain appropriate quality standards throughout the internal and external supply network and/or comply with cgmps and other applicable regulations such as serialization (which allows for track and trace of products in the supply chain to enhance patient safety); risks to supply chain continuity as a result of natural or man-made disasters at our facilities or at a supplier or vendor, including those that may be related to climate change; or failure to maintain the integrity of our supply chains against intentional and criminal acts such as economic adulteration, product diversion, product theft, and counterfeit goods.
regulatory agencies periodically inspect our drug manufacturing facilities to ensure compliance with applicable cgmp requirements. failure to comply with these requirements may subject us to possible legal or regulatory actions, such as suspension of manufacturing, seizure of product or voluntary recall of a product.
outsourcing and enterprise resource planning we outsource certain services to third parties in areas including transaction processing, accounting, information technology, manufacturing, clinical trial execution, non-clinical research, safety services and other areas. for example, in 2015, we placed the majority of our clinical trial execution services with four strategic clinical research organizations (cros). service performance issues with these cros may adversely impact the progression of our clinical trial programs. outsourcing of services to third parties could also expose us to sub-optimal quality of service delivery or deliverables, which may result in missed deadlines or other timeliness issues, supply disruptions, non-compliance (including with applicable legal requirements and industry standards) or reputational harm, all with potential negative implications for our results.
we continue to pursue a multi-year initiative to outsource some transaction-processing activities within certain accounting processes and are migrating to a consistent enterprise resource planning system across the organization. these are enhancements of ongoing activities to support the growth of our financial shared service capabilities and standardize our financial systems. if any difficulties in the migration to or in the operation of our enterprise resource planning system were to occur, they could adversely affect our operations, including, among other ways, through a failure to meet demand for our products, or adversely affect our ability to meet our financial reporting obligations.
could also result in non-compliance or reputational harm, all with potential negative implications for our product pipeline and business.
difficulties of our wholesale distributors in 2015, our largest wholesale distributor accounted for approximately 14% of our total revenues (and 30% of our total u.s. revenues), and our top three wholesale distributors accounted for approximately 34% of our total revenues (and 74% of our total u.s. revenues). if one of our significant wholesale distributors should encounter financial or other difficulties, such distributor might decrease the amount of business that it does with us, and we might be unable to collect all the amounts that the distributor owes us on a timely basis or at all, which could negatively impact our results of operations.
business development activities we expect to continue to enhance our in-line products and product pipeline through collaborations, alliances, licenses, joint ventures, equity- or debt-based investments, mergers and acquisitions. however, these enhancement plans are subject to the availability and cost of appropriate opportunities, competition from other pharmaceutical companies that are seeking similar opportunities and our ability to successfully identify, structure and execute transactions, including the ability to satisfy the conditions to closing of announced transactions (including the pending combination with allergan) in the anticipated timeframe or at all, and integrate acquisitions. further, while we seek to mitigate risks and liabilities of such transactions through, among other things, due diligence, there may be risks and liabilities that such due diligence efforts fail to discover, that are not disclosed to us, or that we inadequately assess. additionally, we may not realize the anticipated benefits of such transactions, including the possibility that expected synergies and accretion will not be realized or will not be realized within the expected time frame.
counterfeit products a counterfeit medicine is one that has been deliberately and fraudulently mislabeled as to its identity and source. a counterfeit pfizer medicine, therefore, is one manufactured by someone other than pfizer, but which appears to be the same as an authentic pfizer medicine. the prevalence of counterfeit medicines is a significant and growing industry-wide issue due to a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, the following: the widespread use of the internet, which has greatly facilitated the ease by which counterfeit medicines can be advertised, purchased and delivered to individual patients; the availability of sophisticated technology that makes it easier for counterfeiters to make counterfeit medicines; the growing involvement in the medicine supply chain of under-regulated wholesalers and repackagers; the importation of medicines across borders; and the relatively modest risk of penalties faced by counterfeiters. further, laws against pharmaceutical counterfeiting vary greatly from country to country, and the enforcement of existing law varies greatly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. for example, in some countries, pharmaceutical counterfeiting is not a crime; in others, it may result in only minimal sanctions. in addition, those involved in the distribution of counterfeit medicines use complex transport routes in order to evade customs controls by disguising the true source of their products.
counterfeit medicines pose a risk to patient health and safety because of the conditions under which they are manufactured-often in unregulated, unlicensed, uninspected and unsanitary sites-as well as the lack of regulation of their contents. failure to mitigate the threat of counterfeit medicines, which is exacerbated by the complexity of the supply chain, could adversely impact our business, by, among other things, causing the loss of patient confidence in the pfizer name and in the integrity of our medicines, potentially resulting in lost sales, product recalls, and an increased threat of litigation.
we undertake significant efforts to counteract the threats associated with counterfeit medicines, including, among other things, working with the fda and other regulatory authorities and multinational coalitions to combat the counterfeiting of medicines and supporting efforts by law enforcement authorities to prosecute counterfeiters; assessing new and existing technologies to seek to make it more difficult for counterfeiters to copy our products and easier for patients and healthcare providers to distinguish authentic from counterfeit medicines; implementing business practices designed to protect patient health; promoting public policies intended to hinder counterfeiting; working diligently to raise public awareness about the dangers of counterfeit medicines; and working collaboratively with wholesalers, pharmacies, customs offices, and law enforcement agencies to increase inspection coverage, monitor distribution channels, and improve surveillance of distributors and repackagers. no assurance can be given, however, that our efforts and the efforts of others will be entirely successful, and the presence of counterfeit medicines may continue to increase.
pricing and reimbursement u.s. and international governmental regulations mandating price controls and limitations on patient access to our products impact our business, and our future results could be adversely affected by changes in such regulations or policies.
states are considering, pharmaceutical price controls or patient access constraints under the medicaid program, and some states are considering price-control regimes that would apply to broader segments of their populations that are not medicaid-eligible. private third-party payers, such as health plans, increasingly challenge pharmaceutical and medical device product pricing, which could result in lower prices, lower reimbursement rates and a reduction in demand for our products. pricing pressures for our products may occur as a result of highly competitive insurance markets. healthcare provider purchasers, directly or through group purchasing organizations, are seeking enhanced discounts or implementing more rigorous bidding or purchasing review processes.
we encounter similar regulatory and legislative issues in most other countries. in certain international markets, such as europe, japan, china, canada and south korea, governments provide healthcare at low direct cost to patients and regulate pharmaceutical prices or patient reimbursement levels to control costs for the government-sponsored healthcare system, and we have seen government-mandated reductions in prices and access restrictions for certain biopharmaceutical products to control costs in those markets, particularly under recent global economic pressures. as a result, we expect that pressures on the pricing component of operating results will continue.
the adoption of restrictive price controls in new jurisdictions or more restrictive ones in existing jurisdictions, failure to obtain timely or adequate government-approved pricing or formulary placement where required for our products or obtaining such pricing or placement at unfavorable pricing could also adversely impact revenue. in our vaccines business, we participate in a tender process in many countries for participation in national immunization programs. failure to secure participation in national immunization programs or to obtain acceptable pricing in the tender process could adversely affect our business.
u.s. healthcare reform/healthcare legislation the u.s. healthcare industry is highly regulated and subject to frequent and substantial changes. for example, the aca was enacted by congress in march 2010 and its provisions become effective on various dates. we expect that the rebates, discounts, taxes and other costs resulting from the aca over time will have a significant effect on our expenses and profitability in the future. see the discussion under the overview of our performance, operating environment, strategy and outlook-our operating environment-industry-specific challenges-regulatory environment/pricing and access-u.s. healthcare legislation section in our 2015 financial report and in item 1. business under the caption government regulation and price constraints-in the united states. we also face the uncertainties that might result from any modification, repeal or invalidation of any of the provisions of the aca. there is no assurance that the aca, as currently enacted or as amended in the future, will not adversely affect our business and financial results, and we cannot predict how future federal or state legislative or administrative changes relating to healthcare reform will affect our business. in addition, certain regulatory changes to be implemented in 2016 may affect pfizer's obligations under the medicaid drug rebate program, but the impact of those changes is not yet known.
other u.s. federal or state legislative or regulatory action could adversely affect our business, including, among others, changes in patent laws, the importation of prescription drugs from outside the u.s. at prices that are regulated by governments of various foreign countries, restrictions on u.s. direct-to-consumer advertising, limitations on interactions with healthcare professionals, or the use of comparative effectiveness methodologies that could be implemented in a manner that focuses primarily on cost differences and minimizes the therapeutic differences among pharmaceutical products and restricts access to innovative medicines.
u.s. deficit-reduction actions any significant spending reductions or cost controls affecting medicare, medicaid or other publicly funded or subsidized health programs that may be implemented, and/or any significant additional taxes or fees that may be imposed on us, as part of any broad deficit-reduction effort could have an adverse impact on our results of operations.
substantial regulation we are subject to extensive, complex, costly and evolving regulation by federal and state governmental authorities in the u.s., principally by the fda and the dea, and foreign regulatory authorities. failure to comply with all applicable regulatory requirements may subject us to operating restrictions and criminal prosecution, monetary penalties and other disciplinary actions, including, sanctions, warning letters, product seizures, recalls, fines, injunctions, suspension, revocation of approvals, or exclusion from future participation in government healthcare programs.
and completion dates, regulatory submission and approval dates, and launch dates for product candidates, or as to whether or when we will receive regulatory approval for new products or for new indications or dosage forms for existing products, which will depend on the assessment by regulatory authorities of the benefit-risk profile suggested by the totality of the efficacy and safety information submitted. decisions by regulatory authorities regarding labeling, ingredients and other matters could adversely affect the availability or commercial potential of our products. there is no assurance that we will be able to address the comments in complete response letters received by us with respect to certain of our drug applications to the satisfaction of the fda, any of our late stage pipeline products will receive regulatory approval and/or be commercially successful or that recently approved products will be approved in other markets and/or be commercially successful. there is also a risk that we may not adequately address existing regulatory agency findings concerning the adequacy of our regulatory compliance processes and systems or implement sustainable processes and procedures to maintain regulatory compliance and to address future regulatory agency findings, should they occur. in addition, there are risks associated with interim data, including the risk that final results of studies for which interim data have been provided and/or additional clinical trials may be different from (including less favorable than) the interim data results and may not support further clinical development of the applicable product candidate or indication.
there are many considerations that can affect the marketing of our products around the world. regulatory delays, the inability to successfully complete or adequately design and implement clinical trials within the anticipated quality, time and cost guidelines or in compliance with applicable regulatory expectations, claims and concerns about safety and efficacy, new discoveries, patent disputes and claims about adverse side effects are a few of the factors that can adversely affect the realization of r&d and product-related, forward-looking statements. further, claims and concerns about safety and efficacy can result in a negative impact on product sales, product recalls or withdrawals, and/or consumer fraud, product liability and other litigation and claims. increasing regulatory scrutiny of drug safety and efficacy, with regulatory authorities increasingly focused on product safety and the risk/benefit profile of products as they relate to already-approved products, has resulted in a more challenging, expensive and lengthy regulatory approval process due to requests for, among other things, additional clinical trials prior to granting approval or increased post-approval requirements, such as risk evaluation and mitigation strategies.
in addition, failure to put in place adequate controls and/or resources for effective collection, reporting and management of adverse events from clinical trials and post-marketing surveillance, in compliance with current and evolving regulatory requirements could result in risks to patient safety, regulatory actions and risks to product sales.
the fda, along with other regulatory agencies around the world, has been experiencing a backlog of generic drug applications, which has delayed approvals of new generic products. these delays have become longer, and while the fda has stated that it is taking steps to address the backlog of pending applications, continued approval delays may be experienced by generic drug applicants over the next few years.
post-approval data as a condition to granting marketing approval of a product, the fda may require a company to conduct additional clinical trials. the results generated in these phase 4 trials could result in the loss of marketing approval, changes in product labeling, and/or new or increased concerns about the side effects or efficacy of a product. regulatory agencies in countries outside the u.s. often have similar authority and may impose comparable requirements. post-marketing studies, whether conducted by us or by others and whether mandated by regulatory agencies or voluntary, and other emerging data about marketed products, such as adverse event reports, may also adversely affect the availability or commercial potential of our products. further, the discovery of significant problems with a product similar to one of our products that implicate (or are perceived to implicate) an entire class of products could have an adverse effect on the availability or commercial potential of the affected products. accordingly, new data about our products, or products similar to our products, could negatively impact demand for our products due to real or perceived side effects or uncertainty regarding efficacy and, in some cases, could result in updated labeling, restrictions on use, product withdrawal or recall.
changing regulation of medical devices in 2014, the fda issued a final guidance document entitled "infusion pumps total product life cycle." through this final guidance, the fda has established additional pre-market requirements for infusion pumps. at the same time, the fda is also generally enhancing its pre-market requirements for medical devices. although we cannot predict with certainty the future impact of these initiatives, it appears likely that the process for obtaining regulatory approvals to market infusion pumps and medical devices will become more costly and time consuming.
interactions with healthcare professionals and government officials risks and uncertainties apply if we provide something of value to a healthcare professional and/or government official. if the interaction is found to be improper, government enforcement actions and penalties could result. these risks may increase as non-u.s. jurisdictions adopt or increase enforcement efforts of new anti-bribery laws and regulations.
changes in laws and accounting standards our future results could be adversely affected by changes in laws and regulations, including, among others, changes in accounting standards, taxation requirements (including tax rate changes, new tax laws and revised tax law and regulatory interpretations, including changes affecting the taxation by the u.s. of income earned outside the u.s. that may result from pending and possible future proposals), competition laws, privacy laws and environmental laws in the u.s. and other countries.
legal proceedings we and certain of our subsidiaries are involved in various patent, product liability, consumer, commercial, securities, antitrust, environmental, employment and tax litigations and claims, government investigations and other legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business. litigation is inherently unpredictable, and excessive verdicts do occur. although we believe we have substantial defenses in these matters, we could in the future incur judgments, enter into settlements of claims or revise our expectations regarding the outcomes of certain matters, and such developments could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which the amounts are accrued and/or our cash flows in the period in which the amounts are paid.
claims against our patents include challenges to the coverage and/or validity of our patents on various products or processes. although we believe we have substantial defenses to these challenges with respect to all of our material patents, there can be no assurance as to the outcome of these matters, and a loss in any of these cases could result in a loss of patent protection for the product at issue, which could lead to a significant loss of sales of that product and could materially affect future results of operations.
like other pharmaceutical companies, we are subject to investigations and extensive regulation by government agencies in the u.s., other developed markets and multiple emerging markets in which we operate. as a result, we have interactions with government agencies on an ongoing basis. criminal charges, and substantial fines and/or civil penalties, as well as limitations on our ability to conduct business in applicable jurisdictions, could result from government investigations.
our activities relating to the sale and marketing and the pricing of our products are subject to extensive regulation under the ffdca, the medicaid drug rebate program, the fcpa and other federal and state statutes, including those discussed elsewhere in this 2015 form 10-k, as well as anti-kickback and false claims laws, and similar laws in international jurisdictions. like many companies in our industry, we have from time to time received inquiries and subpoenas and other types of information demands from government authorities, and been subject to claims and other actions related to our business activities brought by governmental authorities, as well as by consumers and private payers. in some instances, we have incurred significant expense, civil payments, fines and other adverse consequences as a result of these claims, actions and inquiries. for example, these claims, actions and inquiries may relate to alleged failures to accurately interpret or identify or prevent non-compliance with the laws and regulations associated with the dissemination of product information (approved and unapproved), potentially resulting in government enforcement and damage to our reputation. this risk may be heightened by digital marketing, including social media, mobile applications and blogger outreach.
environmental claims and proceedings we and certain of our subsidiaries are subject to contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business relating to environmental claims and proceedings. amounts recorded for contingencies can result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties and can rely heavily on estimates and assumptions. while we have accrued for worldwide environmental liabilities, there is no guarantee that additional costs will not be incurred beyond the amounts accrued. if we fail to properly manage the safety of our facilities and the environmental risks associated therewith or if we are required to increase our accruals for contingencies for environmental claims and proceedings in the future, it could potentially have an adverse effect on our results of operations.
may be subject to challenges by third parties regarding our intellectual property, including, among others, claims regarding validity, enforceability, scope and effective term.
our ability to enforce our patents also depends on the laws of individual countries and each country's practice with respect to enforcement of intellectual property rights, and the extent to which certain sovereigns may seek to engage in a policy of routine compulsory licensing of pharmaceutical intellectual property as a result of local political pressure or in the case of national emergencies. in countries that provide some form of regulatory exclusivity, mechanisms exist permitting some form of challenge to our patents by competitors or generic drug marketers prior to or immediately following the expiration of such regulatory exclusivity, and generic companies are increasingly employing aggressive strategies, such as "at risk" launches to challenge our patent rights. most of the suits by generic drug manufacturers involve claims that patents covering our products, processes or dosage forms are invalid and/or do not cover the product of the generic drug manufacturer. also, counterclaims, as well as various independent actions, have been filed alleging that our assertions of, or attempts to enforce, our patent rights with respect to certain products constitute unfair competition and/or violations of antitrust laws. in various jurisdictions, we are party to other patent damages suits pursuant to which generic drug manufacturers, payers, governments or other parties are seeking damages from us for alleged delay of generic entry related to patent enforcement litigation. further, if we are unable to maintain our existing license agreements or other agreements pursuant to which third parties grant us rights to intellectual property, including because such agreements expire or are terminated, our operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.
likewise, in the u.s. and other countries, we currently hold issued trademark registrations and have trademark applications pending, any of which may be the subject of a governmental or third-party objection, which could prevent the maintenance or issuance of the same. as our products mature, our reliance on our trademarks to differentiate us from our competitors increases and as a result, if we are unable to prevent third parties from adopting, registering or using trademarks and trade dress that infringe, dilute or otherwise violate our trademark rights, our business could be materially adversely affected. we actively seek to protect our proprietary information, including our trade secrets and proprietary know-how, by requiring our employees, consultants, other advisors and other third parties to execute proprietary information and confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of their employment, engagement or other relationship. despite these efforts and precautions, we may be unable to prevent a third party from copying or otherwise obtaining and using our trade secrets or our other intellectual property without authorization, and legal remedies in some countries may not adequately compensate us for the damages caused by such unauthorized use. further, others may independently and lawfully develop substantially similar or identical products that circumvent our intellectual property by means of alternative designs or processes or otherwise.
third party intellectual property claims a properly functioning intellectual property regime is essential to our business model. we are committed to respecting the valid intellectual property rights of other companies, but the patent granting process is imperfect. accordingly, the pursuit of valid business opportunities may require us to challenge intellectual property rights held by other companies that we believe were improperly granted. such challenges may include negotiation and litigation, which may not be successful.
part of our established products business depends upon successfully identifying generic pharmaceutical product and biosimilar opportunities and launching products to take advantage of those opportunities, which may involve litigation, associated costs and time delays, and may ultimately not be successful. these opportunities may arise in situations where patent protection of equivalent branded products has expired, where patents have been declared invalid, or where products do not infringe the patents of others. to achieve a "first-to-market" or early market position for generic pharmaceutical products and biosimilars, we may take action, such as litigation, asserting that our products do not infringe patents of existing products or that those patents are invalid or unenforceable.
third parties may claim that our products infringe their intellectual property rights. claims of intellectual property infringement can be costly and time-consuming to resolve, may delay or prevent product launches, and may result in significant damages. we are involved in patent-related disputes with companies over our attempts to market generic pharmaceutical products. once we have final regulatory approval of the related generic pharmaceuticals, we may decide to commercially market these products even though associated legal proceedings have not been resolved. if those proceedings ultimately determine that our products infringe the patent rights of another company, we may face damages, including a requirement to pay a reasonable royalty or the lost profits from the sale of the branded product. remedies also may include or consist of an injunction preventing us from further manufacture or sales of the affected product for a period of time. any of these adverse consequences could have a material adverse effect on our profitability and financial condition.
risk related to technology:
maintain the confidentiality and integrity of such confidential information. we also have outsourced significant elements of our operations to third parties, including significant elements of our information technology infrastructure and, as a result, we are managing many independent vendor relationships with third parties who may or could have access to our confidential information. the size and complexity of our information technology and information security systems, and those of our third-party vendors with whom we contract (and the large amounts of confidential information that is present on them), make such systems potentially vulnerable to service interruptions or to security breaches from inadvertent or intentional actions by our employees or vendors, or from attacks by malicious third parties. such attacks are of ever-increasing levels of sophistication and are made by groups and individuals with a wide range of motives (including, but not limited to, industrial espionage) and expertise, including organized criminal groups, "hacktivists," nation states and others. as a global pharmaceutical company, our systems are subject to frequent attacks. due to the nature of some of these attacks, there is a risk that they may remain undetected for a period of time. while we have invested in the protection of data and information technology, there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent service interruptions or security breaches. any such interruption or breach of our systems could adversely affect our business operations and/or result in the loss of critical or sensitive confidential information or intellectual property, and could result in financial, legal, business and reputational harm to us. we maintain cyber liability insurance; however this insurance may not be sufficient to cover the financial, legal, business or reputational losses that may result from an interruption or breach of our systems.
risks related to our strategic transactions:
hospira acquisition we may fail to realize all of the anticipated benefits from our acquisition of hospira.
the success of our acquisition of hospira will depend, in part, on our ability to realize the anticipated benefits and cost savings from combining our businesses. anticipated benefits and cost savings may not be realized fully or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected. the integration process may result in the loss of key employees, the disruption of ongoing business, including third-party relationships, or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies. we also may fail to generate the revenue growth for the acquired business that we expected at the time of entering into the transaction. in addition, hospira has experienced manufacturing disruptions, device remediations and increased regulatory scrutiny due to quality issues. future manufacturing problems, as well as any corrective actions and their operational implementation, could adversely impact the revenue we generate from products acquired from hospira and result in substantial unanticipated costs.
pending combination with allergan we and allergan must obtain required shareholder approvals and governmental and regulatory consents to consummate the merger, which, if delayed or not granted or granted with unacceptable conditions, may prevent, delay or impair the consummation of the merger, result in additional expenditures of money and resources and/or reduce the anticipated benefits of the merger.
on november 23, 2015, we announced that we have entered into a definitive merger agreement with allergan under which we have agreed to combine with allergan. completion of the proposed transaction with allergan is subject to certain closing conditions, including, among others, the receipt of required approvals of our shareholders and allergan shareholders, clearance of the merger by certain governmental and regulatory authorities, including the expiration or termination of applicable waiting periods under the hart-scott-rodino antitrust improvements act and other filings or approvals as may be required pursuant to the antitrust and competition laws of certain foreign jurisdictions, including the eu. the governmental agencies with which we and allergan will make these filings and seek certain of these approvals and consents have broad discretion in administering the governing regulations. we can provide no assurance that all required approvals and consents will be obtained. moreover, as a condition to their approval of the transaction, certain governmental agencies may impose requirements, limitations or costs or require divestitures or place restrictions on the conduct of the business of the combined company after the closing of the merger. any one of these requirements, limitations, costs, divestitures or restrictions could jeopardize or delay the effective time of the merger or reduce the anticipated benefits of the transaction. further, no assurance can be given that the required shareholder approvals will be obtained or that the required closing conditions will be satisfied, and, if all required consents and approvals are obtained and the closing conditions are satisfied, no assurance can be given as to the terms, conditions and timing of the approvals or clearances. finally, the closing of the merger is subject to the closing of allergan's pending divestiture of its generics business to teva pharmaceuticals industries ltd., which itself is subject to certain closing conditions, including receipt of governmental and regulatory consents, and no assurance can be given that the closing of such divestiture will occur on a timely basis or at all. if we and allergan agree to any requirements, limitations, costs, divestitures or restrictions in order to obtain any approvals or clearances required to consummate the transaction, these requirements, limitations, costs, divestitures or restrictions could adversely affect the integration of the two companies' operations and/or reduce the anticipated benefits of the merger. in addition, future potential changes to the tax laws, if adopted prior to closing, could give rise to a right of pfizer or allergan to terminate the merger agreement. the occurrence of any of the foregoing could result in a failure to consummate the merger or have a material adverse effect on the business and results of operations of the combined company.
addition, some costs related to the merger must be paid whether or not the merger is completed. we may also experience negative reactions from our shareholders, customers and employees. in addition, in specified circumstances, we could be required to reimburse expenses of allergan or pay allergan a termination fee of up to $3.5 billion.
while the merger is pending, we and allergan will be subject to business uncertainties that could adversely affect our respective businesses and operations. these uncertainties could also adversely affect the combined company following the completion of the merger.
uncertainty about the effect of the merger on employees, customers and suppliers may have an adverse effect on us and allergan. these uncertainties may impair our or allergan's ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel until the merger is consummated and for a period of time thereafter, and could cause customers, suppliers and others who deal with us or allergan to seek to change existing business relationships with us and/or allergan. employee retention may be challenging during the pendency of the merger, as certain employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles. if key employees depart because of issues related to the uncertainty and difficulty of integration or a desire not to remain with the businesses, the business of the combined company following the merger could be seriously harmed.
in addition, until the merger is completed, the merger agreement restricts us and allergan from taking specified actions without the consent of the other party. these restrictions may, among other things, prevent us or allergan from pursuing attractive business opportunities that may arise prior to the completion of the merger.
we may fail to realize all of the anticipated benefits of the merger or those benefits may take longer to realize than expected. the combined company may also encounter significant difficulties in integrating the two businesses.
our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the merger will depend, to a large extent, on the combined company's ability to integrate the two businesses. the combination of two independent businesses is a complex, costly and time-consuming process. as a result, we will be required to devote significant management attention and resources to integrating our business practices and operations with allergan's business practices and operations. the integration process may be disruptive to the businesses and, if implemented ineffectively, may restrict the full realization of expected benefits. the failure to meet the challenges involved in integrating the two businesses and to realize the anticipated benefits of the transactions could cause an interruption of, or a loss of momentum in, the activities of the combined company and could adversely affect the results of operations of the combined company.
in addition, the overall integration of the businesses may result in material unanticipated problems, expenses, liabilities, competitive responses, loss of customer and other business relationships and diversion of management attention. the difficulties of combining the operations of the companies include, among others:
•   the diversion of management attention to integration matters;
•   difficulties in integrating operations and systems;
•   challenges in conforming standards, controls, procedures and accounting and other policies, business cultures and compensation structures between the two companies;
•   difficulties in assimilating employees and in attracting and retaining key personnel;
•   challenges in keeping existing customers and obtaining new customers;
•   difficulties in achieving anticipated cost savings, synergies, accretion targets, business opportunities and growth prospects from the combination;
•   potential unknown liabilities, adverse consequences and unforeseen increased expenses associated with the merger.
many of these factors are outside of our control and/or will be outside the control of the combined company, and any one of them could result in increased costs, decreased expected revenues and diversion of management time and energy, which could materially impact the business, financial condition and results of operations of the combined company. in addition, even if the operations of the businesses are integrated successfully, the full benefits of the merger may not be realized, including the anticipated synergies, cost savings and sales or growth opportunities. these benefits may not be achieved within the anticipated time frame, or at all. further, additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the integration of the businesses, as well as prior to the consummation of the combination. all of these factors could cause dilution to the earnings per share of the combined company, decrease or delay the expected accretive effect of the merger and negatively impact the price of the combined company ordinary shares. as a result, it cannot be assured that the pending combination with allergan will result in the full realization of the benefits anticipated from the transaction within the anticipated time frames or at all.
in addition, although the combined company is expected, under current law, to be treated as a foreign corporation for u.s. federal income tax purposes, the irs may not agree with this treatment. even if treated as a foreign corporation, certain adverse tax consequences may apply to the combined company that could erode some of the synergies expected from the combination. similarly, future changes in tax law could affect the combined company's status as a foreign corporation for u.s. federal income tax purposes or could otherwise materially and adversely affect some of the synergies expected from the combination. any such changes in law or treatment by the irs could have prospective or retroactive application, and may apply even if enacted or asserted after the merger is consummated. moreover, various u.s. federal and state legislative and other proposals that would deny governmental contracts to u.s. companies (and subsidiaries of u.s. companies) that move (or have moved) their corporate location abroad may affect pfizer if adopted. any such changes in law or treatment by the irs or other governmental agencies could have a material adverse effect on the anticipated results of the operations of the combined company.
finally, our expectations regarding the timing and amount of accretion following consummation of the merger reflect the impact of anticipated share repurchases by us. the actual timing and size of any such share repurchases will depend on actual and expected financial results and the sufficiency of distributable reserves, as well as assessments at the time regarding capital allocation alternatives. reduced or delayed share repurchase activity may result in less accretion.
our shareholders cannot be sure of the value of the consideration they will receive in the merger, and may receive a form of consideration different from what they elect. our shareholders will receive ordinary shares of the combined company as a result of the allergan merger, which have rights different from shares of our common stock and our preferred shares.
because the market price of allergan ordinary shares and shares of our common stock will fluctuate, our shareholders cannot be sure of the value of the consideration they will receive in the merger. in addition, because the exchange ratio is fixed, the number of ordinary shares of the combined company to be received by holders of pfizer common stock in the merger will not change between now and the time the merger is completed to reflect changes in the trading prices of pfizer common stock or allergan ordinary shares, share repurchases or other factors. furthermore, although our shareholders will be entitled to elect to receive allergan ordinary shares or cash consideration for their shares of our common stock, such elections will be subject to proration procedures set forth in the merger agreement, such that our existing shareholders will receive in the aggregate no less than $6 billion and no more than $12 billion in cash, and therefore our existing shareholders may receive a form of consideration different from what they elect.
upon completion of the allergan merger, the rights of our existing shareholders who receive allergan ordinary shares, which will become the ordinary shares of the combined company, will be governed by the memorandum of association and articles of association of allergan, which, subject to the amendments contemplated by the merger agreement, will become the memorandum of association and articles of the combined company, and by irish law. the rights associated with shares of our common stock and our preferred shares are different from the rights associated with these ordinary shares. in addition, the laws of ireland differ from the laws in effect in the u.s. and may afford less protection to holders of securities in the combined company.
finally, it is expected that our existing shareholders as a group will receive shares in the merger constituting approximately 56% of the outstanding ordinary shares of the combined company on a fully diluted basis immediately following the effective time of the merger (based on the closing price of pfizer common stock and certain other assumptions as of november 20, 2015). as a result, our shareholders will have a reduced ownership and voting interest after the merger and will exercise less influence over management.
the market value of our common stock may be adversely affected as a result of financial statement charges and cash costs associated with our proposed transaction with allergan.
we expect to account for the proposed merger using the acquisition method of accounting, which will result in charges to our earnings that could adversely affect our reported operating results. under this method, we will allocate the total purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed from allergan based on their fair values as of the date of the completion of the proposed merger, and record any excess of the purchase price over those fair values as goodwill. for certain tangible and intangible assets, reevaluating fair value as of the completion date of the proposed merger will result in pfizer incurring additional depreciation and/or amortization expense that exceed the combined amounts recorded by pfizer and allergan prior to the proposed merger. this increased expense will be recorded by us over the useful lives of the underlying assets. in addition, to the extent the value of goodwill or intangible assets were to become impaired, we may be required to incur charges relating to the impairment of those assets.
integration of the businesses will allow us to more than offset incremental transaction- and integration-related costs over time, but this net benefit may not be achieved in the near term, or at all.
the global economic environment in addition to industry-specific factors, we, like other businesses, are exposed to the economic cycle, which impacts our biopharmaceutical operations globally. we believe that patients, who are experiencing increases in co-pays and restrictions on access to medicines as payers seek to control costs, sometimes switch to generic products, delay treatments, skip doses or use less effective treatments. we are exposed to negative pricing pressure in various markets around the world. the u.s. has highly competitive insurance markets. europe, japan, china, canada, south korea and a number of other international markets have government-mandated reductions in prices and access restrictions for certain biopharmaceutical products to control costs for the government-sponsored healthcare system, particularly under recent global economic pressures. furthermore, some government agencies and third-party payers use health technology assessments in ways that, at times, lead to restricted access to and lower prices for new medicines.
the global economic environment has not had, nor do we anticipate it will have, a material impact on our liquidity or capital resources. due to our significant operating cash flows, financial assets, access to capital markets and available lines of credit and revolving credit agreements, we continue to believe that we have, and will maintain, the ability to meet our liquidity needs for the foreseeable future. as market conditions change, we continue to monitor our liquidity position. however, there can be no assurance that possible future changes in global financial markets and global economic conditions will not affect our liquidity or capital resources or impact our ability to obtain financing in the future. we continue to monitor the credit and economic situations in several international markets, including venezuela and greece, where economic conditions remain challenging and uncertain. we cannot predict the likelihood of future changes in these economic conditions, or what impact they may have on our results of operations, financial condition or business.
other potential impacts of variations in the economic cycle include declining sales; increased costs; changes in foreign exchange rates; a decline in the value of, or a lower rate of return on, our financial assets and pension plan investments, which may require us to increase our pension funding obligations; adverse government actions; delays or failures in the performance of customers, suppliers, and other third parties on whom we may depend for the performance of our business; and the risk that our allowance for doubtful accounts may not be adequate.
foreign exchange and interest rate risk significant portions of our revenues and earnings, as well as our substantial international net assets, are exposed to changes in foreign exchange rates. 56% of our total 2015 revenues were derived from international operations, including 23% from europe and 20% from japan and the rest of asia. as we operate in multiple foreign currencies, including the euro, the japanese yen, the chinese renminbi, the u.k. pound, the canadian dollar and approximately 100 other currencies, changes in those currencies relative to the u.s. dollar will impact our revenues and expenses. if the u.s. dollar were to weaken against another currency, assuming all other variables remained constant, our revenues would increase, having a positive impact on earnings, and our overall expenses would increase, having a negative impact on earnings. conversely, if the u.s. dollar were to strengthen against another currency, assuming all other variables remained constant, our revenues would decrease, having a negative impact on earnings, and our overall expenses would decrease, having a positive impact on earnings. therefore, significant changes in foreign exchange rates can impact our results and our financial guidance.
the impact of possible currency devaluations in countries experiencing high inflation rates or significant exchange fluctuations can impact our results and financial guidance. for example, in february 2013, the venezuelan government devalued its currency from an official rate of 4.3 to 6.3 of venezuelan currency to the u.s. dollar. in the fourth quarter of 2015, we resolved that our venezuela bolivar-denominated net monetary assets that are subject to revaluation are no longer expected to be settled at the 6.3 rate, but at the simadi rate of 200, resulting in a foreign currency loss. news reports state the venezuelan government announced that, effective february 18, 2016, the official rate of 6.3 would be replaced by a rate of 10.0; and, the operation of the simadi rate would change. see the analysis of financial condition, liquidity and capital resources-global economic conditions--venezuela operations section in our 2015 financial report for more information.
in addition, our interest-bearing investments and borrowings, and our pension benefit obligations, net, and our postretirement benefit obligations, net, are subject to risk from changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates. these risks and the measures we have taken to help contain them are discussed in the forward-looking information and factors that may affect future results-financial risk management section in our 2015 financial report. for additional details, see the notes to consolidated financial statements-note 7e. financial instruments: derivative financial instruments and hedging activities and -note 11. pension and postretirement benefit plans and defined contribution plans in our 2015 financial report and the significant accounting policies and application of critical accounting estimates and assumptions--benefit plans section in our 2015 financial report. those sections of our 2015 financial report are incorporated by reference.
notwithstanding our efforts to foresee and mitigate the effects of changes in external fiscal circumstances, we cannot predict with certainty changes in currency and interest rates, inflation or other related factors affecting our businesses.
cost and expense control/unusual events/failure to realize the anticipated benefits of strategic initiatives and acquisitions/intangible assets, goodwill and equity-method investments growth in costs and expenses, changes in product, segment and geographic mix and the impact of acquisitions, divestitures, restructurings, internal reorganizations, product withdrawals, recalls and other unusual events that could result from evolving business strategies, evaluation of asset realization and organizational restructuring could adversely affect future results. such risks and uncertainties include, in particular, our ability to realize the projected benefits of (i) our cost-reduction and productivity initiatives; (ii) our internal separation of our commercial operations into our current operating structure; (iii) any other corporate strategic initiatives; (iv) any acquisitions, divestitures or other initiatives, such as our recent acquisition of hospira; and (v) our pending combination with allergan.
in addition, our consolidated balance sheet contains significant amounts of intangible assets, including goodwill. for ipr&d assets, the risk of failure is significant, and there can be no certainty that these assets ultimately will yield successful products. the nature of the biopharmaceutical business is high-risk and requires that we invest in a large number of projects in an effort to achieve a successful portfolio of approved products. our ability to realize value on these significant investments is often contingent upon, among other things, regulatory approvals and market acceptance. as such, we expect that many of these ipr&d assets will become impaired and be written off at some time in the future. for goodwill, all reporting units can confront events and circumstances that can lead to a goodwill impairment charge (such as, among other things, unanticipated competition, an adverse action or assessment by a regulator, a significant adverse change in legal matters or in the business climate and/or a failure to replace the contributions of products that lose exclusivity). any such charge may be significant. our other intangible assets, including developed technology rights and brands, face similar risks for impairment and charges related to such assets may be significant as well. for additional details, see the significant accounting policies and application of critical accounting estimates and assumptions section in our 2015 financial report.
we also regularly review our equity-method investments for impairment. an impairment charge may result from the occurrence of unexpected adverse events or management decisions that impact our estimates of expected cash flows to be generated from these investments. we may recognize impairment charges as a result of a weak economic environment, events related to particular customers or asset types, challenging market conditions or decisions by management.
internal control over financial reporting the accuracy of our financial reporting depends on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements and may not prevent or detect misstatements. failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, or lapses in disclosure controls and procedures, could undermine the ability to provide accurate disclosure (including with respect to financial information) on a timely basis, which could cause investors to lose confidence in our disclosures (including with respect to financial information), require significant resources to remediate the lapse or deficiency, and expose us to legal or regulatory proceedings.
terrorist activity our future results could be adversely affected by changes in business, political and economic conditions, including the cost and availability of insurance, due to the threat of terrorist activity in the u.s. and other parts of the world and related u.s. military action overseas.

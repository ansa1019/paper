item 1a. risk factors you should carefully consider all of the risks described below, as well as the other information contained in this document, when evaluating your investment in our securities.
risks relating to our business our business depends on the demand for our wireless infrastructure, driven primarily by demand for wireless connectivity, and we may be adversely affected by any slowdown in such demand. additionally, a reduction in carrier network investment may materially and adversely affect our business (including reducing demand for tenant additions or network services).
demand for our wireless infrastructure depends on the demand for antenna space from our customers, which, in turn, depends on the demand for wireless connectivity by their customers. the willingness of our customers to utilize our wireless infrastructure, or renew or extend existing leases on our wireless infrastructure, is affected by numerous factors, including:
•   consumer demand for wireless connectivity;
•   availability or capacity of our wireless infrastructure or associated land interests;
•   location of our wireless infrastructure;
•   financial condition of our customers, including their profitability and availability or cost of capital;
•   willingness of our customers to maintain or increase their network investment or changes in their capital allocation strategy;
•   availability and cost of spectrum for commercial use;
•   increased use of network sharing, roaming, joint development, or resale agreements by our customers;
•   mergers or consolidations among our customers;
•   changes in, or success of, our customers' business models;
•   governmental regulations, including local or state restrictions on the proliferation of wireless infrastructure;
•   cost of constructing wireless infrastructure;
•   technological changes, including those (1) affecting the number or type of wireless infrastructure needed to provide wireless connectivity to a given geographic area or which may otherwise serve as substitute or alternative to our wireless infrastructure or (2) resulting in the obsolescence or decommissioning of certain existing wireless networks; or
•   our ability to efficiently satisfy our customers' service requirements.
a slowdown in demand for wireless connectivity or our wireless infrastructure may negatively impact our growth or otherwise have a material adverse effect on us. if our customers or potential customers are unable to raise adequate capital to fund their business plans, as a result of disruptions in the financial and credit markets or otherwise, they may reduce their spending, which could adversely affect our anticipated growth or the demand for our wireless infrastructure or network services.
the amount, timing, and mix of our customers' network investment is variable and can be significantly impacted by the various matters described in these risk factors. changes in carrier network investment typically impact the demand for our wireless infrastructure. as a result, changes in carrier plans such as delays in the implementation of new systems, new technologies (including small cells), or plans to expand coverage or capacity may reduce demand for our wireless infrastructure. furthermore, the wireless industry could experience a slowdown or slowing growth rates as a result of numerous factors, including a reduction in consumer demand for wireless connectivity or general economic conditions. there can be no assurances that weakness or uncertainty in the economic environment will not adversely impact the wireless industry, which may materially and adversely affect our business, including by reducing demand for our wireless infrastructure or network services. in addition, a slowdown may increase competition for site rental customers or network services. a wireless industry slowdown or a reduction in carrier network investment may materially and adversely affect our business. for a further discussion of our risks relating to network services, see "-our network services business has historically experienced significant volatility in demand, which reduces the predictability of our results" below.
a substantial portion of our revenues is derived from a small number of customers, and the loss, consolidation or financial instability of any of our limited number of customers may materially decrease revenues or reduce demand for our wireless infrastructure and network services.
for 2015, our site rental revenues by customer were as follows:
the loss of any one of our large customers as a result of consolidation, merger, bankruptcy, insolvency, network sharing, roaming, joint development, resale agreements by our customers or otherwise may result in (1) a material decrease in our revenues, (2) uncollectible account receivables, (3) an impairment of our deferred site rental receivables, wireless infrastructure assets, intangible assets, or (4) other adverse effects to our business. we cannot guarantee that leases with our major customers will not be terminated or that these customers will renew their leases with us. in addition to our four largest customers, we also derive a portion of our revenues and anticipated future growth from new entrants offering or contemplating offering wireless services; such customers may be smaller or have less financial resources than our four largest customers, have business models which may not be successful, or may require additional capital. see also "item 1. business-the company" and note 16 to our consolidated financial statements.
consolidation among our customers will likely result in duplicate or overlapping parts of networks, for example where they are co-residents on a tower, which may result in the termination or non-renewal of tenant leases and impact revenues from our wireless infrastructure. we expect that any termination of tenant leases as a result of this potential consolidation would be spread over multiple years. such consolidation may result in a reduction in such customers' future network investment in the aggregate because their expansion plans may be similar. wireless carrier consolidation could decrease the demand for our wireless infrastructure, which in turn may result in a reduction in our revenues or cash flows.
in recent years, at&t, t-mobile and sprint acquired leap wireless, metropcs, and clearwire, respectively. during 2016, we expect site rental revenues to be impacted by non-renewals of $70 million to $80 million as a result of the decommissioning of the acquired networks. the acquired networks represented approximately 10% of our net revenues for the year ended december 31, 2015. we currently expect potential non-renewals from the decommissioning of the acquired networks to be approximately 60% of current run-rate site rental revenues related to the acquired networks, with the majority of such non-renewals to occur predominately from 2016 through 2018. depending on the eventual network deployment and decommissioning plans of at&t, t-mobile and sprint, the impact and timing of such non-renewals may vary from our expectations.
see note 15 to our consolidated financial statements for a tabular presentation of the minimum rental cash payments due to us by tenants pursuant to tenant agreements without consideration of tenant renewal options.
the business model for our small cell operations contains certain differences from our traditional site rental business, resulting in different operational risks. if we do not successfully operate that business model or identify or manage those operational risks, such operations may produce results that are less than anticipated.
the business model for our small cell operations contains certain differences from our traditional tower operations, including differences relating to customer contract terms, landlord demographics, ownership of certain network assets, operational oversight requirements (including requirements for service level agreements regarding network performance and maintenance), and applicable laws. while our small cell operations have certain risks that are similar to our tower operations, they also have certain operational risks that are different from our traditional site rental business, including the (1) use of competitive local exchange carrier, which we refer to as clec status, (2) use of public rights-of-ways and franchise agreements, (3) use of poles owned solely by, or jointly with, third parties, or (4) risks relating to overbuilding. we cannot be certain that we will be successful in maintaining right-of-way agreements, obtaining future agreements on acceptable terms, or that our clec status will be recognized. in addition, the rate at which wireless carriers adopt or prioritize small cells may be lower or slower than we anticipate. our small cell operations will also expose us to different safety or liability risks or hazards than our traditional site rental business as a result of numerous factors, including the location or nature of the assets involved. because small cells are comparatively new technologies and are continuing to evolve, there may be other risks related to small cells of which we are not yet aware.
our substantial level of indebtedness could adversely affect our ability to react to changes in our business, and the terms of our debt instruments and convertible preferred stock limit our ability to take a number of actions that our management might otherwise believe to be in our best interests. in addition, if we fail to comply with our covenants, our debt could be accelerated.
•   we may be more vulnerable to general adverse economic or industry conditions;
•   we may find it more difficult to obtain additional financing to fund discretionary investments or other general corporate requirements or to refinance our existing indebtedness;
•   we are or will be required to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to the payment of principal or interest on our debt, thereby reducing the available cash flows to fund other projects, including the discretionary investments discussed in "item 1. business";
•   we may have limited flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business or in the industry;
•   we may have a competitive disadvantage relative to other companies in our industry with less debt;
•   we may be adversely impacted by changes in interest rates;
•   we may be required to issue equity securities or securities convertible into equity or sell some of our assets, possibly on unfavorable terms, in order to meet payment obligations;
•   we may be limited in our ability to take advantage of strategic business opportunities, including wireless infrastructure development or mergers and acquisitions; or
•   we could fail to remain qualified for taxation as a reit as a result of limitations on our ability to declare and pay dividends to stockholders as a result of restrictive covenants in our debt instruments or the terms of our 4.50% mandatory convertible preferred stock, series a ("convertible preferred stock").
currently we have debt instruments in place that limit in certain circumstances our ability to incur additional indebtedness, pay dividends, create liens, sell assets, or engage in certain mergers and acquisitions, among other things. in addition, the credit agreement governing our senior unsecured credit facility agreement ("2016 credit facility") contains financial maintenance covenants. our ability to comply with these covenants or to satisfy our debt obligations will depend on our future operating performance. if we violate the restrictions in our debt instruments or fail to comply with our financial maintenance covenants, we will be in default under those instruments, which in some cases would cause the maturity of a substantial portion of our long-term indebtedness to be accelerated. furthermore, if the limits on our ability to pay dividends prevent us from satisfying our reit distribution requirements, we could fail to remain qualified for taxation as a reit. if these limits do not jeopardize our qualification for taxation as a reit but nevertheless prevent us from distributing 100% of our reit taxable income, we will be subject to
federal and state corporate income taxes, and potentially a nondeductible excise tax, on our undistributed taxable income. if our operating subsidiaries were to default on their debt, the trustee could seek to foreclose the collateral securing such debt, in which case we could lose the wireless infrastructure and the revenues associated with the wireless infrastructure. see "item 7. md&a-liquidity and capital resources-debt covenants" for a further discussion of our debt covenants.
ccic is a holding company that conducts all of its operations through its subsidiaries. accordingly, ccic's sources of cash to pay interest or principal on its outstanding indebtedness are distributions relating to its respective ownership interests in its subsidiaries from the net earnings and cash flows generated by such subsidiaries or from proceeds of debt or equity offerings. earnings and cash flows generated by ccic's subsidiaries are first applied by such subsidiaries to conduct their operations, including servicing their respective debt obligations, after which any excess cash flows generally may be paid to such holding company, in the absence of any special conditions such as a continuing event of default. however, ccic's subsidiaries are legally distinct from the holding company and, unless they guarantee such debt, have no obligation to pay amounts due on their debt or to make funds available to us for such payment.
if we fail to pay scheduled dividends on the convertible preferred stock, in cash, common stock, or any combination of cash and common stock, we will be prohibited from paying dividends on our common stock, which may jeopardize our status as a reit.
we have a substantial amount of indebtedness. in the event we do not repay or refinance such indebtedness, we could face substantial liquidity issues and might be required to issue equity securities or securities convertible into equity securities, or sell some of our assets to meet our debt payment obligations.
we have a substantial amount of indebtedness (approximately $12.1 billion as of february 15, 2016), which we will need to refinance or repay. see "item 7. md&a-liquidity and capital resources" for a tabular presentation of our contractual debt maturities. there can be no assurances we will be able to refinance our indebtedness (1) on commercially reasonable terms, (2) on terms, including with respect to interest rates, as favorable as our current debt, or (3) at all.
economic conditions and the credit markets have historically experienced, and may continue to experience, periods of volatility, uncertainty, or weakness that could impact the availability or cost of debt financing, including any refinancing of the obligations described above or on our ability to draw the full amount of our $2.5 billion revolving credit facility ("2016 revolver"), that, as of february 15, 2016, has $2.1 billion of undrawn availability.
if we are unable to repay or refinance our debt, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to generate enough cash flows from operations or that we will be able to obtain enough capital to service our debt, fund our planned capital expenditures or pay future dividends. in such an event, we could face substantial liquidity issues and might be required to issue equity securities or securities convertible into equity securities, or sell some of our assets to meet our debt payment obligations. failure to repay or refinance indebtedness when required could result in a default under such indebtedness. if we incur additional indebtedness, any such indebtedness could exacerbate the risks described above.
sales or issuances of a substantial number of shares of our common stock may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.
future sales or issuances of common stock or other equity related securities may adversely affect the market price of our common stock, including any shares of our common stock issued to finance capital expenditures, finance acquisitions or repay debt. our business strategy contemplates access to external financing to fund certain discretionary investments, which may include issuances of common stock or other equity related securities. in august 2015, we established an "at-the-market" stock offering program ("atm program") through which we may, from time to time, issue and sell shares of our common stock having an aggregate gross sales price of up to $500.0 million to or through sales agents. as of february 15, 2016, we had 333.8 shares of common stock outstanding.
we have reserved 12.3 million and 14.5 million of shares of common stock, respectively, for issuance in connection with awards granted under our various stock compensation plans and our convertible preferred stock, which will automatically convert into common stock on november 1, 2016. see "item 7. md&a-liquidity and capital resources-preferred stock." the dividends on our convertible preferred stock may also be paid in cash or, subject to certain limitations, shares of common stock or any combination of cash and shares of common stock.
further, a small number of common stockholders own a significant percentage of our outstanding common stock. if any one of these common stockholders, or any group of our common stockholders, sells a large quantity of shares of our common stock, or the public market perceives that existing common stockholders might sell a large quantity of shares of our common stock, the market price of our common stock may significantly decline.
as a result of competition in our industry, we may find it more difficult to achieve favorable rental rates on our new or renewing tenant leases.
our growth is dependent on our entering into new tenant leases (including amendments to leases upon modification of an existing installation), as well as renewing or renegotiating tenant leases when existing tenant leases terminate. competition in our industry may make it more difficult for us to attract new customers, maintain or increase our gross margins, or maintain or increase our market share. we face competition for site rental tenants from various sources, including (1) other independent wireless infrastructure owners or operators, including towers, rooftops, broadcast towers, utility poles, fiber providers, das or other small cells, or (2) new alternative deployment methods in the wireless industry.
our small cell operations may have different competitors than our traditional site rental business, including other owners of small cells or fiber, as well as new entrants into small cells, some of which may have larger networks or greater financial resources than we have.
new technologies may reduce demand for our wireless infrastructure or negatively impact our revenues.
improvements in the efficiency, architecture, and design of wireless networks may reduce the demand for our wireless infrastructure. for example, new technologies that may promote network sharing, joint development, or resale agreements by our customers, such as signal combining technologies or network functions virtualization, may reduce the need for our wireless infrastructure. in addition, other technologies, such as wifi, das, femtocells, other small cells, or satellite (such as low earth orbiting) and mesh transmission systems may, in the future, serve as substitutes for, or alternatives to, leasing that might otherwise be anticipated or expected on wireless infrastructure had such technologies not existed. in addition, new technologies that enhance the range, efficiency, and capacity of wireless equipment could reduce demand for our wireless infrastructure. any significant reduction in demand for our wireless infrastructure resulting from the new technologies may negatively impact our revenues or otherwise have a material adverse effect on us.
the expansion or development of our business, including through acquisitions, increased product offerings or other strategic growth opportunities, may cause disruptions in our business, which may have an adverse effect on our business, operations or financial results.
we seek to expand and develop our business, including through acquisitions, increased product offerings (such as small cells and fiber), or other strategic growth opportunities. in the ordinary course of our business, we review, analyze, and evaluate various potential transactions or other activities in which we may engage. such transactions or activities could cause disruptions in, increase risk or otherwise negatively impact our business. among other things, such transactions and activities may:
•   disrupt our business relationships with our customers, depending on the nature of or counterparty to such transactions and activities;
•   direct the time or attention of management away from other business operations;
•   fail to achieve revenue or margin targets, operational synergies or other benefits contemplated;
•   increase operational risk or volatility in our business; or
•   result in current or prospective employees experiencing uncertainty about their future roles with us, which might adversely affect our ability to retain or attract key managers or other employees.
if we fail to retain rights to our wireless infrastructure, including the land interests under our towers, our business may be adversely affected.
the property interests on which our wireless infrastructure resides, including the land interests under our towers, consist of leasehold and sub-leasehold interests, fee interests, easements, licenses, and rights-of-way. a loss of these interests may interfere with our ability to conduct our business or generate revenues. for various reasons, we may not always have the ability to access, analyze, or verify all information regarding titles or other issues prior to purchasing wireless infrastructure. further, we may not be able to renew ground leases on commercially viable terms. our ability to retain rights to the land interests on which our towers reside depends on our ability to purchase such land, including fee interests and perpetual easements, or renegotiate or extend the terms of the leases relating to such land. approximately 11% of our site rental gross margins for the year ended december 31, 2015 were derived from towers where the leases for the interests under such towers had final expiration dates of less than ten years. if we are unable to retain rights to the property interests on which our wireless infrastructure resides, our business may be adversely affected.
as of december 31, 2015, approximately 54% of our towers were leased or subleased or operated and managed under master leases, subleases, or other agreements with at&t, sprint, and t-mobile. we have the option to purchase these towers at the end of their respective lease terms. we have no obligation to exercise such purchase options. we may not have the required available capital to exercise our right to purchase some or all of these towers at the time these options are exercisable. even if we do have
available capital, we may choose not to exercise our right to purchase these towers or some or all of the t-mobile or at&t towers for business or other reasons. in the event that we do not exercise these purchase rights, or are otherwise unable to acquire an interest that would allow us to continue to operate these towers after the applicable period, we will lose the cash flows derived from such towers, which may have a material adverse effect on our business. in the event that we decide to exercise these purchase rights, the benefits of the acquisition of these towers may not exceed the costs, which could adversely affect our business. additional information concerning these towers and the applicable purchase options as of december 31, 2015 is as follows:
•   approximately 23% of our towers are leased or subleased or operated and managed under a master prepaid lease or other related agreements with at&amp;t for a weighted-average initial term of approximately 28 years, weighted on site rental gross margin. we have the option to purchase the leased and subleased towers from at&amp;t at the end of the respective lease or sublease terms for aggregate option payments of approximately $4.2 billion, which payments, if exercised, would be due between 2032 and 2048.
•   approximately 16% of our towers are leased or subleased or operated and managed for an initial period of 32 years (through may 2037) under master leases, subleases or other agreements with sprint. we have the option to purchase in 2037 all (but not less than all) of the leased and subleased sprint towers from sprint for approximately $2.3 billion.
•   approximately 15% of our towers are leased or subleased or operated and managed under a master prepaid lease or other related agreements with t-mobile for a weighted-average initial term of approximately 28 years, weighted on site rental gross margin. we have the option to purchase the leased and subleased towers from t-mobile at the end of the respective lease or sublease terms for aggregate option payments of approximately $2.0 billion, which payments, if exercised, would be due between 2035 and 2049. in addition, through the t-mobile acquisition, there are another approximately 1% of our towers subject to a lease and sublease or other related arrangements with at&amp;t. we have the option to purchase these towers that we do not otherwise already own at the end of their respective lease terms for aggregate option payments of up to approximately $405 million, which payments, if exercised, would be due between 2018 and 2032 (less than $10 million would be due before 2025).
under master lease or master prepaid lease arrangements we have with at&t, sprint and t-mobile, certain of our subsidiaries lease or sublease, or are otherwise granted the right to manage and operate, towers from bankruptcy remote subsidiaries of such carriers. if one of these bankruptcy remote subsidiaries should become a debtor in a bankruptcy proceeding and is permitted to reject the underlying ground lease, our subsidiaries could lose their interest in the applicable sites. if our subsidiaries were to lose their interest in the applicable sites or if the applicable ground leases were to be terminated, we would lose the cash flow derived from the towers on those sites, which may have a material adverse effect on our business. we have similar bankruptcy risks with respect to sites that we operate under management agreements.
our network services business has historically experienced significant volatility in demand, which reduces the predictability of our results.
the operating results of our network services business for any particular period may vary significantly and should not necessarily be considered indicative of longer-term results for this activity. our network services business is generally driven by demand for our wireless infrastructure and may be adversely impacted by various factors, including:
•   competition;
•   the timing and amount of customer network investments;
•   the rate and volume of customer deployment plans;
•   unforeseen delays or challenges relating to work performed;
•   economic weakness or uncertainty;
•   our market share; or
•   changes in the size, scope, or volume of work performed.
new wireless technologies may not deploy or be adopted by customers as rapidly or in the manner projected.
there can be no assurances that new wireless services or technologies will be introduced or deployed as rapidly or in the manner projected by the wireless carriers. in addition, demand or customer adoption rates for such new technologies may be lower or slower than anticipated for numerous reasons. as a result, growth opportunities or demand for our wireless infrastructure arising from such technologies may not be realized at the times or to the extent anticipated.
if we fail to comply with laws or regulations which regulate our business and which may change at any time, we may be fined or even lose our right to conduct some of our business.
a variety of federal, state, local, and foreign laws and regulations apply to our business, including those discussed in "item 1. business." failure to comply with applicable requirements may lead to civil penalties or require us to assume indemnification obligations or breach contractual provisions. we cannot guarantee that existing or future laws or regulations, including state and local tax laws, will not adversely affect our business, increase delays or result in additional costs. these factors may have a material adverse effect on us.
if radio frequency emissions from wireless handsets or equipment on our wireless infrastructure are demonstrated to cause negative health effects, potential future claims could adversely affect our operations, costs or revenues.
the potential connection between radio frequency emissions and certain negative health effects, including some forms of cancer, has been the subject of substantial study by the scientific community in recent years. we cannot guarantee that claims relating to radio frequency emissions will not arise in the future or that the results of such studies will not be adverse to us.
public perception of possible health risks associated with cellular or other wireless connectivity services may slow or diminish the growth of wireless companies, which may in turn slow or diminish our growth. in particular, negative public perception of, and regulations regarding, these perceived health risks may slow or diminish the market acceptance of wireless services. if a connection between radio frequency emissions and possible negative health effects were established, our operations, costs, or revenues may be materially and adversely affected. we currently do not maintain any significant insurance with respect to these matters.
certain provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation ("charter"), amended and restated by-laws ("by-laws") and operative agreements, and domestic and international competition laws may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us or for us to acquire control of a third party, even if such a change in control would be beneficial to our stockholders.
we have a number of anti-takeover devices in place that will hinder takeover attempts or may reduce the market value of our common stock. our anti-takeover provisions include:
•   the authority of the board of directors to issue preferred stock without approval of the holders of our common stock; and
•   advance notice requirements for director nominations or actions to be taken at annual meetings.
our by-laws permit special meetings of the stockholders to be called only upon the request of our chief executive officer or a majority of the board of directors, and deny stockholders the ability to call such meetings. such provisions, as well as the provisions of section 203 of the delaware general corporation law, may impede a merger, consolidation, takeover, or other business combination or discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us.
in addition, domestic or international competition laws may prevent or discourage us from acquiring wireless infrastructure in certain geographical areas or impede a merger, consolidation, takeover, or other business combination or discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us.
we may be vulnerable to security breaches that could adversely affect our operations, business, operations, and reputation.
despite existing security measures, certain of our wireless infrastructure may be vulnerable to damage, disruptions, or shutdowns due to unauthorized access, computer viruses, cyber-attacks, and other security breaches. an attack attempt or security breach could potentially result in (1) interruption or cessation of certain of our services to our customers, (2) our inability to meet expected levels of service, or (3) data transmitted over our customers' networks being compromised. we cannot guarantee that our security measures will not be circumvented, resulting in customer network failures or interruptions that could impact our customers' network availability and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or operational results. we may be required to expend significant resources to protect against or recover from such threats. if an actual or perceived breach of our security occurs, the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed, and we could lose customers. further, the perpetrators of cyber-attacks are not restricted to particular groups or persons. these attacks may be committed by our employees or external actors operating in any geography. any such events could result in legal claims or penalties, disruption in operations, misappropriation of sensitive data, damage to our reputation, negative market perception, or costly response measures, which could adversely affect our business.
risks relating to our reit election
future dividend payments to our stockholders will reduce the availability of our cash on hand available to fund future discretionary investments, and may result in a need to incur indebtedness or issue equity securities to fund growth opportunities.  in such event, the then current economic, credit market or equity market conditions will impact the availability or cost of such financing, which may hinder our ability to grow our per share results of operations.
during each of the first three quarters of 2015, we paid a quarterly common stock dividend of $0.82 per share, totaling approximately $821.1 million. in october 2015, we increased our quarterly dividend, beginning in the fourth quarter of 2015, from an annual amount of $3.28 per share to an annual amount of $3.54 per share. as such, we declared a quarterly dividend of $0.885 per share in october 2015, which represented an increase of 8% from the quarterly dividend declared during each of the first three quarters of 2015. we currently expect such dividends to result in aggregate annual cash payments of approximately $1.2 billion during the next 12 months. over time, we expect to increase our dividend per share generally commensurate with our realized growth in cash flows. future dividends are subject to the approval of our board of directors. see notes 12 and 19 to our consolidated financial statements.
effective january 1, 2014, we commenced operating as a reit for u.s. federal income tax purposes. to remain qualified and be taxed as a reit, we will generally be required to distribute at least 90% of our reit taxable income after the utilization of any available nols, (determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding net capital gain) each year to our stockholders. our quarterly cash common stock dividend will delay the utilization of our nols and may cause certain of the nols to expire without utilization. see also "item 7. md&a-general overview-common stock dividend" and "item 1. business-2015 industry highlights and company developments-reit election."
as discussed in "item 1. md&a-business-strategy," we seek to invest our capital, including the net cash provided by our operating activities as well as external financing sources, in a manner that we believe will increase long-term stockholder value on a risk-adjusted basis. our historical discretionary investments have included the following (in no particular order): purchasing our common stock, acquiring or constructing wireless infrastructure, acquiring land interests under towers, improving or structurally enhancing our existing wireless infrastructure, or purchasing, repaying or redeeming our debt. external financing, including debt, equity, and equity-related issuances to fund future discretionary investments either (1) may not be available to us or (2) may not be accessible by us at terms that would result in the investment of the net proceeds raised yielding incremental growth in our per share operating results. as a result, future dividend payments may hinder our ability to grow our per share results of operations or otherwise adversely affect our ability to execute our business plan.
see also "-if we fail to pay scheduled dividends on the convertible preferred stock, in cash, common stock, or any combination of cash and common stock, we will be prohibited from paying dividends on our common stock, which may jeopardize our status as a reit" below.
remaining qualified to be taxed as a reit involves highly technical and complex provisions of the us internal revenue code. failure to remain qualified as a reit would result in our inability to deduct dividends to stockholders when computing our taxable income, which would reduce our available cash.
effective january 1, 2014, we commenced operating as a reit for u.s. federal tax purposes. as a reit, we are generally entitled to a deduction for dividends that we pay and therefore are not subject to u.s. federal corporate income tax on our net taxable income that is currently distributed to our common stockholders.
while we intend to operate so that we remain qualified as a reit, given the highly complex nature of the rules governing reits, the ongoing importance of factual determinations, and the possibility of future changes in our circumstances, no assurance can be given that we will qualify as a reit for any particular year.
if, in any taxable year, we fail to qualify for taxation as a reit and are not entitled to relief under the code , then:
•   we will not be allowed a deduction for dividends paid to stockholders in computing our taxable income;
•   if such failure to qualify occurs after the effective date of our election to be taxed as a reit for u.s. federal income tax purposes, we would be disqualified from re-electing reit status for the four taxable years following the year during which we were so disqualified.
although we may have federal nols available to reduce any taxable income, to the extent our federal nols have been utilized or are otherwise unavailable, any such corporate tax liability could be substantial, would reduce the amount of cash available for other purposes and might necessitate the borrowing of additional funds or the liquidation of some investments to pay any additional tax liability. accordingly, funds available for investment would be reduced.
under the code, for taxable years beginning before 2018, no more than 25% of the value of the assets of a reit may be represented by securities of one or more trss or other non-qualifying assets. for taxable years beginning in 2018, the limit on the value of assets of a reit that may be represented by securities of one or more trss or other non-qualifying assets will reduce to 20%. these current or future limitations may affect our ability to make additional investments in non-reit qualifying operations or assets, or in any operations held through trss. the net income of our trss is not required to be distributed to us, and income that is not distributed to us generally will not be subject to the reit income distribution requirement. however, there may be limitations on our ability to accumulate earnings in our trss and the accumulation or reinvestment of significant earnings in our trss could result in adverse tax treatment. in particular, if the accumulation of cash in our trss causes the fair market value of our securities in our trss or certain other non-qualifying assets to exceed current or future limitations of the fair market value of our assets at the end of any quarter, then we may fail to remain qualified as a reit.
complying with reit requirements, including the 90% distribution requirement, may limit our flexibility or cause us to forgo otherwise attractive opportunities, including certain discretionary investments and potential financing alternatives.
to remain qualified and be taxed as a reit, we will generally be required to distribute at least 90% of our reit taxable income after the utilization of any available nols (determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding net capital gain) each year to our stockholders. we commenced declaring regular quarterly dividends to our common stockholders beginning with the first quarter of 2014. see notes 12 and 19 to our consolidated financial statements. any such dividends, however, are subject to the determination and approval of our board of directors based on then-current and anticipated future conditions, including our earnings, net cash provided by operating activities, capital requirements, financial condition, our relative market capitalization, our existing federal nols of approximately $1.3 billion, of which substantially all are available to offset reit taxable income, or other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors.
to the extent that we satisfy the 90% distribution requirement, but distribute less than 100% of our reit taxable income (after the application of available nols, if any), we will be subject to federal corporate income tax on our undistributed taxable income. in addition, we will be subject to a 4% nondeductible excise tax if the actual amount that we pay out to our stockholders for a calendar year is less than a minimum amount specified under the code.
from time to time, we may generate reit taxable income greater than our cash flow as a result of differences in timing between the recognition of taxable income and the actual receipt of cash or the effect of nondeductible capital expenditures, the creation of reserves or required debt or amortization payments. if we do not have other funds available in these situations, we could be required to borrow funds on unfavorable terms, sell assets at disadvantageous prices, or distribute amounts that would otherwise be invested in future acquisitions to make distributions sufficient to enable us to pay out enough of our taxable income to satisfy the reit dividend requirement and to avoid corporate income tax and the 4% excise tax in a particular year. these alternatives could increase our costs or reduce our equity. thus, compliance with the reit requirements may hinder our ability to grow, which could adversely affect the value of our common stock. furthermore, the reit dividend requirements may increase the financing we need to fund capital expenditures, future growth, or expansion initiatives, which would increase our total leverage.
in addition to satisfying the distribution test, to remain qualified as a reit for tax purposes, we will need to continually satisfy tests concerning, among other things, the sources of our income, the nature and diversification of our assets and the ownership of our capital stock. compliance with these tests will require us to refrain from certain activities and may hinder our ability to make certain attractive investments, including the purchase of non-qualifying assets, the expansion of non-real estate activities, or investments in the businesses to be conducted by our trss, and to that extent, limit our opportunities and our flexibility to change our business strategy. furthermore, acquisition opportunities in domestic or international markets may be adversely affected if we need or require the target company to comply with some reit requirements prior to completing any such acquisition. in addition, our conversion to a reit may result in investor pressures not to pursue growth opportunities that are not immediately accretive.
moreover, if we fail to comply with certain asset ownership tests, at the end of any calendar quarter, we must correct the failure within 30 days after the end of the calendar quarter or qualify for certain statutory relief provisions to avoid losing our reit qualification. as a result, we may be required to liquidate assets in adverse market conditions or forgo otherwise attractive investments. these actions may reduce our income and amounts available for distribution to our stockholders.
if we fail to pay scheduled dividends on the convertible preferred stock, in cash, common stock, or any combination of cash and common stock, we will be prohibited from paying dividends on our common stock, which may jeopardize our status as a reit.
the terms of the convertible preferred stock provide that, unless accumulated dividends have been paid or set aside for payment on all outstanding convertible preferred stock for all past dividend periods, no dividends may be declared or paid on our common stock. if that were to occur, the inability to pay dividends on our common stock might jeopardize our status as a reit for u.s. federal income tax purposes. see note 12 to our consolidated financial statements.
we have limited experience operating as a reit. our failure to successfully operate as a reit may adversely affect our financial condition, cash flow, the per share trading price of our common stock, or our ability to satisfy debt service obligations.
we have limited operating history as a reit. in addition, our senior management team has limited experience operating a reit. we cannot assure you that our past experience will be sufficient to operate our company successfully as a reit, including our ability to remain qualified as a reit. failure to maintain reit status could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, or ability to satisfy debt service obligations.
reit related ownership limitations and transfer restrictions may prevent or restrict certain transfers of our capital stock.
in order for us to continue to satisfy the requirements for reit qualification, our capital stock must be beneficially owned by 100 or more persons during at least 335 days of a taxable year of 12 months or during a proportionate part of a shorter taxable year (other than the first year for which an election to be a reit has been made). also, not more than 50% of the value of the outstanding shares of our capital stock may be owned, directly or indirectly, by five or fewer "individuals" (as defined in the code to include certain entities such as private foundations) during the last half of a taxable year (other than the first taxable year for which an election to be a reit has been made). in order to facilitate compliance with the reit rules, our charter includes provisions that implement reit-related ownership limitations and transfer restrictions that generally prohibit any person (as defined in our charter) from beneficially or constructively owning, or being deemed to beneficially or constructively own by virtue of the attribution provisions of the code, more than 9.8%, by value or number of shares, whichever is more restrictive, of the outstanding shares of our common stock, or 9.8% in aggregate value of the outstanding shares of all classes and series of our capital stock, including our common stock and any shares of our convertible preferred stock. in addition, our charter provides for certain other ownership limitations and transfer restrictions. under applicable constructive ownership rules, any shares of capital stock owned by certain affiliated owners generally would be added together for purposes of the ownership limitations. these ownership limitations and transfer restrictions could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a transaction or a change in control of our company that might involve a premium price for our capital stock or otherwise might be in the best interest of our stockholders.

item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general overview overview we own, operate, and lease shared wireless infrastructure. see "item 1. business" for a further discussion of our business, including our long-term strategy, our reit status, certain key terms of our lease agreements, and growth trends in the wireless industry. site rental revenues represented 82% of our 2015 consolidated net revenues. the vast majority of our site rental revenues is of a recurring nature and has been contracted for in a prior year.
business fundamentals and results the following are certain highlights of our business fundamentals and results as of and for the year ended december 31, 2015:
•   effective january 1, 2014, we commenced operating as a reit for u.s. federal income tax purposes (see "item 1. business-2015 industry highlights and company developments-reit election").
•   potential growth resulting from wireless network expansion and new entrants
◦   we expect wireless carriers will continue their focus on improving network quality and expanding capacity by adding additional antennas or other equipment on our wireless infrastructure.
◦   we expect existing and potential new wireless carrier demand for our wireless infrastructure will result from (1) new technologies, (2) increased usage of wireless applications (including mobile entertainment, mobile internet usage, and machine-to-machine applications), (3) adoption of other emerging and embedded wireless devices (including smartphones, laptops, tablets, and other devices), (4) increasing smartphone penetration, (5) wireless carrier focus on expanding quality and capacity, or (6) the availability of additional spectrum.
◦   substantially all of our wireless infrastructure can accommodate additional tenancy, either as currently constructed or with appropriate modifications to the structure.
◦   wireless carriers continue to invest in their networks.
◦   our site rental revenues grew $152 million, or 5%, from full year 2014 to 2015. this growth was predominately comprised of the following, exclusive of the impact of straight-line accounting:
▪   an approximate 6% increase from new leasing activity.
▪   an approximate 4% decrease in site rental revenues caused by the non-renewal of tenant leases, primarily resulting from sprint's decommissioning of its legacy nextel iden network.
•   site rental revenues under long-term tenant leases with contractual escalations
◦   initial terms of five to 15 years with multiple renewal periods at the option of the tenant of five to ten years each.
◦   weighted-average remaining term of approximately six years, exclusive of renewals at the tenant's option, currently representing approximately $20 billion of expected future cash inflows.
◦   approximately 90% of our site rental revenues were derived from at&amp;t, t-mobile, verizon, and sprint. see also "item 1a. risk factors" and note 16 to our consolidated financial statements.
•   majority of land interests under our towers under long-term control
◦   nearly 90% and more than 75% of our site rental gross margin is derived from towers that reside on land that we own or control for greater than ten and 20 years, respectively. the aforementioned amounts include towers that reside on land interests that are owned, including fee interests and perpetual easements, which represent approximately one-third of our site rental gross margin.
•   relatively fixed wireless infrastructure operating costs
◦   our wireless infrastructure operating costs tend to increase at approximately the rate of inflation and are not typically influenced by tenant additions.
•   minimal sustaining capital expenditure requirements
◦   sustaining capital expenditures represented approximately 3% of net revenues.
•   debt portfolio with long-dated maturities extended over multiple years, with the majority of such debt having a fixed rate (see "item 7a. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk" for a further discussion of our debt)
◦   our debt service coverage and leverage ratios were comfortably within their respective financial maintenance covenants. see "item 7. md&amp;a-liquidity and capital resources-debt covenants" for a further discussion of our debt covenants.
◦   during the second quarter 2015, we (1) issued $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of the may 2015 tower revenue notes, (2) repaid $250.0 million of august 2010 tower revenue notes with an anticipated repayment date
of august 2015, (3) repaid all of the previously outstanding wcp securitized notes, and (4) repaid a portion of our outstanding borrowings under our previously outstanding 2012 credit facility.
◦   in january 2016, we completed a new senior unsecured $5.5 billion 2016 credit facility and utilized the proceeds, together with cash on hand, to repay all outstanding borrowings under the previously outstanding 2012 credit facility. see "item 7. md&amp;a-liquidity and capital resources-credit facility."
◦   in february 2016, we issued $1.5 billion aggregate principal amount of investment grade senior unsecured notes and utilized the proceeds, along with cash on hand, to (1) repay in full all outstanding borrowings under the $1.0 billion senior unsecured 364-day revolving credit facility ("364-day facility")(and, in connection therewith, terminate all commitments thereunder), and (2) to repay $500.0 million of outstanding borrowings under the 2016 revolver. see "item 7. md&amp;a-liquidity and capital resources-financing activities."
◦   collectively, the completion of the 2016 credit facility, the repayment of the 2012 credit facility, the issuance of $1.5 billion senior unsecured notes and the use of proceeds from such notes are referred to herein as the "2016 refinancings."
◦   net cash provided by operating activities was $1.8 billion.
◦   we expect to grow our core business of providing access to our wireless infrastructure as a result of contractual escalators and anticipated demand for our wireless infrastructure.
•   returning cash flows provided by operations to stockholders in the form of dividends (see also "item 1. business")
◦   during 2015, we paid common stock dividends totaling approximately $1.1 billion. see "item 7. md&amp;a-general overview-common stock dividend" for a discussion of the increase to our quarterly dividend in the fourth quarter of 2015.
•   investing capital efficiently to grow long-term dividends per share (see also "item 1. business")
◦   discretionary capital expenditures of $804.0 million, including wireless infrastructure improvements in order to support additional site rentals, construction of wireless infrastructure, and land purchases. see also discussion of the sunesys acquisition below.
common stock dividend during each of the first three quarters of 2015, we paid a quarterly common stock dividend of $0.82 per share, totaling approximately $821.1 million. in october 2015, we increased our quarterly dividend, beginning in the fourth quarter of 2015, from an annual amount of $3.28 per share to an annual amount of $3.54 per share. as such, we declared a quarterly dividend of $0.885 per share in october 2015, which represented an increase of 8% from the quarterly dividend declared during each of the first three quarters of 2015. we currently expect such dividends to result in aggregate annual cash payments of approximately $1.2 billion during the next 12 months. over time, we expect to increase our dividend per share generally commensurate with our realized growth in cash flows. future dividends are subject to the approval of our board of directors. see notes 12 and 19 to our consolidated financial statements.
sale of ccal in may 2015, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell our 77.6% owned australian subsidiary, ccal, to a consortium of investors led by macquarie infrastructure and real assets. on may 28, 2015, we completed the sale of ccal. at closing, we received net proceeds of approximately $1.1 billion after accounting for our ownership interest, repayment of intercompany debt owed to us by ccal and estimated transaction fees and expenses, exclusive of the impact of foreign currency swaps related to the ccal sale. see note 3 to our consolidated financial statements.
as part of the sale of ccal, in january 2016, we received an installment payment of approximately $124 million from the buyer, inclusive of the impact of the related foreign currency swap (see note 9 to our consolidated financial statements). during the second quarter 2015, we used net proceeds from the sale of ccal, together with net proceeds from the may 2015 tower revenue notes, to (1) repay $250.0 million aggregate principal amount of august 2010 tower revenue notes with an anticipated repayment date of august 2015, (2) repay all of the previously outstanding wcp securitized notes, (3) repay portions of outstanding borrowings under our previously outstanding 2012 credit facility, and (4) to pay related fees and expenses. see note 8 to our consolidated financial statements.
we entered into foreign currency swaps to manage and reduce our foreign currency risk associated with the sale of ccal. these swaps are not included in discontinued operations. see note 9 to our consolidated financial statements.
sunesys acquisition in april 2015, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire sunesys for approximately $1.0 billion in cash, subject to certain limited adjustments. on august 4, 2015, we closed the sunesys acquisition utilizing $835.0 million in 2012 revolver borrowings and cash on hand. prior to the closing, sunesys was a wholly owned subsidiary of quanta services, inc., and a fiber services provider that owned or had rights to nearly 10,000 miles of fiber in major metropolitan markets across the u.s., including los angeles, philadelphia, chicago, atlanta, silicon valley, and northern new jersey. approximately 60% of sunesys' fiber miles were located in the top 10 btas. see note 4 to our consolidated financial statements.
outlook highlights the following are certain highlights of our 2016 outlook that impact our business fundamentals described above.
•   we expect that our full year 2016 site rental revenue growth will benefit from similar levels of tenant additions as in 2015, as large wireless carriers continue to upgrade and enhance their networks, partially offset by an increase in non-renewals of tenant leases primarily resulting from anticipated non-renewals from our customers' decommissioning of the acquired networks. see "item 1a. risk factors" for a further discussion of non-renewals. see note 15 to our consolidated financial statements.
•   we expect total capital expenditures for 2016 to equal or exceed 2015 levels with a continued increase in the construction of new small cells. we also expect sustaining capital expenditures of approximately 2% of net revenues for full year 2016.
results of operations the following discussion of our results of operations should be read in conjunction with "item 1. business," "item 7. md&a-liquidity and capital resources" and our consolidated financial statements. the following discussion of our results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the u.s. ("gaap") which require us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts (see "item 7. md&a-accounting and reporting matters-critical accounting policies and estimates" and note 2 to our consolidated financial statements).

results of operations we have determined that presently, following the sale of ccal, we have one reportable operating segment consisting of our u.s. operations, which is consistent with our current operational and financial reporting structure. our financial results are currently reported to the chief operating decision maker and the board of directors in this manner.
prior to its sale in may 2015, ccal, our previously 77.6% owned subsidiary that owned and operated towers in australia, was a reportable segment. as a result of the sale of ccal, our historical financial statements have been reclassified for all periods presented to include ccal on a discontinued operations basis. see also "item 7. md&a-general overview-sale of ccal."
we will continue our evaluation of our operating segments following the disposition of ccal, and our change in strategic focus primarily to our u.s. business. to the extent we make changes to our financial reporting or organizational structure, including the integration of the sunesys acquisition, we will evaluate any impact such changes may have to our segment reporting.
our measurement of profit or loss currently used to evaluate our operating performance and operating segments is earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and accretion, as adjusted ("adjusted ebitda"). our measure of adjusted ebitda may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, including companies in the tower sector or other similar providers of wireless infrastructure, and is not a measure of performance calculated in accordance with u.s. gaap. see "item 2. md&a-accounting and reporting matters-non-gaap financial measures" for a discussion of our use of adjusted ebitda, including its definition and a reconciliation to net income (loss).
2015 and 2014. see note 4 in our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the impact of the sunesys acquisition.
net revenues for 2015 increased by $125.1 million, or 4%, from 2014. this increase in net revenues resulted from (1) an increase in site rental revenues of $151.8 million, or 5%, and (2) a decrease in network services and other revenues of $26.7 million, or 4%, in each case as compared to 2014. this increase in site rental revenues was impacted by the following items, inclusive of straight-line accounting, in no particular order: tenant additions across our entire portfolio, renewals or extensions of tenant leases, escalations, construction of new wireless infrastructure including small cells, acquisitions, including the sunesys acquisition, and non-renewals of tenant leases, predominately sprint's decommissioning of its legacy nextel iden network. tenant additions were influenced by our customers' ongoing efforts to improve network quality and capacity. see also "item 1. business-the company" and "item 1. business-2015 industry highlights and company developments."
site rental gross margins for 2015 increased by $94.1 million, or 5%, from 2014. the increase in the site rental gross margins was related to the previously mentioned 5% increase in site rental revenues.
network services and other revenues for 2015 decreased $26.7 million, or 4%, from 2014, and is a reflection of (1) the volume of activity from carrier network enhancements and (2) the volume and mix of network services and other work. our network services offering is of a variable nature as these revenues are not under long-term contracts. network services and other gross margin for 2015 increased by $16.2 million, or 6%, from 2014, and is a reflection of changes in the volume and mix of network services and other work.
general and administrative expenses for 2015 increased by $53.6 million, or 21%, from 2014 and represented 8% of net revenues in 2015 and 7% of net revenues in 2014. general and administrative expenses are inclusive of stock-based compensation charges. see also note 13 to our consolidated financial statements. the increase in general and administrative expenses was related to the growth in our business, including the expansion in size of our wireless infrastructure portfolio primarily due to acquisitions and growth in small cells.
adjusted ebitda for 2015 increased by $67.9 million, or 3%, from 2014. adjusted ebitda was positively impacted by the growth in our site rental activities, partially offset by the aforementioned increase in general and administrative expenses.
depreciation, amortization, and accretion for 2015 increased by $50.4 million, or 5%, from 2014. this increase predominately resulted from capital expenditures and acquisitions, including the sunesys acquisition.
interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs decreased by $46.2 million, or 8%, from 2014 to 2015, primarily as a result of a $44.4 million decrease in the amortization of previously settled interest rate swaps.
as a result of repaying and redeeming certain of our debt, we incurred net losses of $4.2 million and $44.6 million for 2015 and 2014, respectively. for a further discussion of the debt refinancings, see note 8 to our consolidated financial statements, "item 7. md&a-liquidity and capital resources" and "item 7a. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk."
our acquisition and integration expenses for 2014 were $34.1 million and were related to our 2012 and 2013 acquisitions. see notes 1 and 4 to our consolidated financial statements.
other income (expense) for 2015 was income of $57.0 million, compared to income of $12.0 million for 2014. this change was predominately a result of gains recorded during 2015 on foreign currency swaps that we entered into to manage and reduce our foreign currency risk related to our may 2015 sale of ccal. see note 9 to our consolidated financial statements.
the benefit (provision) for income taxes for 2015 was a benefit of $51.5 million compared to a benefit of $11.2 million for 2014. for 2015, the effective tax rate differed from the federal statutory rate predominately due to (1) our reit status, including the dividends paid deduction, and (2) the de-recognition of net deferred tax liabilities related to the inclusion of small cells in the reit in january 2016, which resulted in a non-cash income tax benefit of $33.8 million. for 2014, the effective tax rate differed from the federal statutory rate predominately due to our reit status, including the dividends paid deduction. see "item 7. md&a-accounting and reporting matters-critical accounting policies and estimates" and note 11 to our consolidated financial statements.
income from discontinued operations, net of tax, decreased from 2014 to 2015 due to the sale of ccal occurring mid-period on may 28, 2015. in addition, during 2015, we recorded a gain on the sale of discontinued operations, net of tax, of $1.0 billion.
net income (loss) attributable to ccic stockholders for 2015 was income of $1.5 billion compared to income of $390.5 million for 2014. the increase in net income was predominately due to a the gain recorded on the sale of ccal.
2014 and 2013. see note 4 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the impact of the the at&t acquisition.
net revenues for 2014 increased by $673.0 million, or 23%, from 2013. this increase in net revenues resulted from an increase in (1) site rental revenues of $495.2 million, or 21%, and (2) network services and other revenues of $177.8 million, or 36%, in each case as compared to 2013. the at&t acquisition increased our site rental revenues for 2014 compared to 2013. see note 4 to our consolidated financial statements. this increase in site rental revenues was also impacted by the following items, inclusive of straight-line accounting, in no particular order: tenant additions across our entire portfolio, renewals or extensions of tenant leases, escalations, construction of new wireless infrastructure, other acquisitions, and non-renewals of tenant leases. tenant additions were influenced by our customers' upgrading to long-term evolution ("lte") networks and their ongoing efforts to improve network quality and capacity. see also "item 1. business-the company."
site rental gross margins for 2014 increased by $276.0 million, or 16%, from 2013. the increase in site rental gross margins was related to the previously mentioned 21%, increase in site rental revenues, primarily as a result of the at&t acquisition (which had lower initial margins due to lower average tenancy that the average tenancy for our other wireless infrastructure) and the growth in our site rental activities.
network services and other revenues for 2014 increased $177.8 million, or 36%, from 2013, and is a reflection of (1) the volume of activity from carrier network enhancements such as lte upgrades, (2) changes in volume and mix, and (3) the expansion in size of our wireless infrastructure portfolio due to the t-mobile acquisition and at&t acquisition. our network services offering is of a variable nature as these revenues are not under long-term contracts. network services and other gross margin for 2014 increased by $81.5 million, or 43%, from 2013, primarily as a result of the previously mentioned factors that increased network services and other revenues.
general and administrative expenses for 2014 increased by $43.8 million, or 21%, from 2013 and represented 7% of net revenues in both 2014 and 2013. general and administrative expenses are inclusive of stock-based compensation charges. see also note 13 to our consolidated financial statements. the increase in general and administrative expenses in nominal dollars was commensurate with the growth in our business, including (1) the expansion in size of our wireless infrastructure portfolio primarily due to acquisitions and (2) the growth in network services. typically, our general and administrative expenses do not significantly increase as a result of tenant additions on our existing wireless infrastructure.
adjusted ebitda for 2014 increased by $335.5 million, or 20%, from 2013. adjusted ebitda was positively impacted by the at&t acquisition and the growth in our site rental and network services activities.
depreciation, amortization, and accretion for 2014 increased by $244.4 million, or 33%, from 2013. the increase predominately resulted from the fixed asset and intangible asset additions recorded related to the at&t acquisition.
interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs decreased $16.3 million, or 3%, from 2013 to 2014, as a result of our refinancing activities, partially offset by additional borrowings under the 2012 credit facility to partially fund the at&t acquisition. during 2014, we issued $850.0 million of 4.875% senior notes, which provided us with funding to (1) repay $300.0
million of the january 2010 tower revenue notes and (2) redeem all of the previously outstanding 7.125% senior notes. in 2013 and 2014, we completed several debt transactions, resulting in (1) lowering our average cost of debt, (2) funding for our acquisitions, (3) the refinancing of certain of our debt, and (4) the extension of certain of our debt maturities. as a result of repaying and redeeming certain of our debt, we incurred net losses of $44.6 million and $37.1 million for 2014 and 2013, respectively. for a further discussion of the debt refinancings, see note 8 to our consolidated financial statements, "item 7. md&a-liquidity and capital resources" and "item 7a. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk."
our acquisition and integration expenses for 2014 and 2013 were $34.1 million and $25.6 million, respectively, and related to our 2012 and 2013 acquisitions. see note 4 to our consolidated financial statements.
the benefit (provision) for income taxes for 2014 was a benefit of $11.2 million compared to a provision of $191.0 million for 2013. for 2014, the effective tax rate differed from the federal statutory rate predominately due to our reit status, including the dividends paid deduction. for 2013, the effective tax rate differed from the federal statutory rate predominately due to the de-recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities related to our reit election resulting in a non-cash income tax charge of $67.4 million. see "item 7. md&a-accounting and reporting matters-critical accounting policies and estimates" and note 11 to our consolidated financial statements.
net income (loss) attributable to ccic stockholders for 2014 was income of $390.5 million compared to income of $90.1 million for 2013. the increase in net income was predominately due to a change in our benefit (provision) for income taxes due to our reit status as further discussed herein.
dividends on preferred stock for 2014 and 2013 represented the dividends related to our convertible preferred stock.
liquidity and capital resources overview general. our core business generates revenues under long-term leases (see "item 7. md&a-general overview-overview") predominately from the largest u.s. wireless carriers. our strategy is to create long-term stockholder value via a combination of (1) growing cash flows generated from our portfolio of wireless infrastructure, (2) returning a meaningful portion of our cash provided by operating activities to our stockholders in the form of dividends and (3) investing capital efficiently to grow cash flows and long-term dividends per share. we measure our efforts to create "long-term stockholder value" by the combined payment of dividends to stockholders and growth in our per share results. see "item 1. business-strategy" for a further discussion of our strategy.
we have and expect to continue to engage in discretionary investments that we believe will maximize long-term stockholder value. our historical discretionary investments include (in no particular order): purchasing our common stock, acquiring or constructing wireless infrastructure, acquiring land interests under towers, improving and structurally enhancing our existing wireless infrastructure, and purchasing, repaying, or redeeming our debt. based on recent small cell activity, we expect to spend an increased percentage of our discretionary investments on the construction of new small cell networks. we seek to fund our discretionary investments with both net cash provided by operating activities and cash available from financing capacity, such as the use of our undrawn availability from the 2016 revolver, debt financings and issuances of equity or equity related securities.
we seek to maintain a capital structure that we believe drives long-term stockholder value and optimizes our weighted-average cost of capital.  we target a leverage ratio of approximately four to five times adjusted ebitda and interest coverage of approximately three times adjusted ebitda, subject to various factors such as the availability and cost of capital and the potential long-term return on our discretionary investments. we may choose to increase or decrease our leverage or coverage from these targets for various periods of time.
effective january 1, 2014, we commenced operating as a reit for u.s. federal income tax purposes. we expect to continue to pay minimal cash income taxes as a result of our reit status and our nols. see "item 1. business-2015 industry highlights and company developments-reit election," "item 7. md&a-general overview" and note 11 to our consolidated financial statements.
liquidity position. the following is a summary of our capitalization and liquidity position. see "item 7a. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk" and note 8 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our debt.

(c)   amounts represent the company's capitalization and liquidity position as of december 31, 2015, after giving effect to the receipt of the installment payment from the sale of ccal in january 2016 and our 2016 refinancings.
•   our liquidity sources may include (1) cash on hand, (2) net cash provided by operating activities (net of cash interest payments), (3) undrawn availability from our 2016 revolver, and (4) issuances of equity pursuant to our atm program. our liquidity uses over the next 12 months are expected to include (1) debt service obligations of approximately $89 million (principal payments), (2) common stock dividend payments expected to be $3.54 per share, or an aggregate of approximately $1.2 billion, subject to future approval by our board of directors (see "item 7. md&amp;a-general overview-common stock dividend"), (3) convertible preferred stock dividend payments of approximately $45 million, and (4) sustaining and discretionary capital expenditures (expected to be equal to or greater than current levels). during the next 12 months, we expect that our liquidity sources should be sufficient to cover our expected uses. as ccic is a holding company, this cash flow from operations is generated by our operating subsidiaries.
•   we have no scheduled contractual debt maturities other than principal payments on amortizing debt. see "item 7a. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk" for a tabular presentation of our debt maturities as of december 31, 2015 and a discussion of anticipated repayment dates.

operating activities the increase in net cash provided by operating activities for 2015 from 2014 was due primarily to growth in our core business, including a net benefit from changes in working capital. the increase in net cash provided by operating activities for 2014 from 2013 was due primarily to (1) the at&t acquisition, (2) growth in our core business and net benefit from changes in working capital, and (3) growth in our network services. changes in working capital (including changes in accounts receivable, deferred site rental receivables, deferred rental revenues, prepaid ground leases, restricted cash, and accrued interest) can have a significant impact on net cash provided by operating activities, largely due to the timing of prepayments and receipts. we expect to grow our net cash provided by operating activities in the future (exclusive of movements in working capital) if we realize expected growth in our core business.
investing activities capital expenditures our capital expenditures are categorized as discretionary or sustaining, as described below.
•   discretionary capital expenditures are those capital expenditures made with respect to activities which we believe exhibit sufficient potential to enhance long-term stockholder value. they consist of improvements to existing wireless infrastructure, construction of new wireless infrastructure, and, to a lesser extent, purchases of land assets under towers as we seek to manage our interests in the land beneath our towers. improvements to existing wireless infrastructure to accommodate tenant additions typically vary based on, among other factors: (1) the type of wireless infrastructure, (2) the scope, volume, and mix of work performed on the wireless infrastructure, (3) existing capacity prior to installation, or (4) changes in structural engineering regulations and standards. our decisions regarding capital expenditures are influenced by the availability and cost of capital and expected returns on alternative uses of cash, such as payments of dividends and investments.
•   sustaining capital expenditures consist of (1) corporate-related capital improvements and (2) maintenance on our wireless infrastructure assets that enable our customers' ongoing quiet enjoyment of the wireless infrastructure.
a summary of our capital expenditures for the last three years is as follows (in thousands of dollars):
discretionary capital expenditures increased from 2014 to 2015 primarily as a result of (1) improvements to existing wireless infrastructure to accommodate new leasing and (2) the construction of new small cells. our sustaining capital expenditures have historically been less than 2% of net revenues annually and were approximately 3% of net revenues in 2015 due to expansion of our office facilities. see "item 7. md&a-general overview-outlook highlights" for a discussion of our expectations surrounding 2016 capital expenditures.
sale of ccal. see note 3 to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our may 2015 sale of ccal, our previously 77.6% owned australian subsidiary.
foreign currency swaps. during may 2015, in conjunction with our sale of ccal, we entered into foreign currency swaps to manage and reduce our foreign currency risk associated with the sale of ccal. see note 9 to our consolidated financial statements.
acquisitions.  acquisitions consist of the acquisition of businesses such as towers and small cells, including fiber portfolios. see notes 4 and 6 to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the 2015 sunesys acquisition, 2014 land acquisitions, and 2013 at&t acquisition.
financing activities we seek to allocate cash generated by our operations in a manner that will enhance long-term stockholder value, which may include various financing activities, such as (in no particular order) paying dividends on our common stock (currently expected to total an aggregate of approximately $1.2 billion during the next 12 months, subject to future approval by our board of directors), paying dividends on our convertible preferred stock (expected to be approximately $45 million in 2016), purchasing our common stock, or purchasing, repaying, or redeeming our debt. see note 12 to our consolidated financial statements.
in 2014, our financing activities predominately related to (1) paying an aggregate of $624.3 million in dividends on our common stock, (2) amending our previously outstanding 2012 credit facility and (3) issuing $850.0 million of 4.875% senior notes, due in april 2022, which provided us with funding to repay $300.0 million of january 2010 tower revenue notes and redeem all of the previously outstanding 7.125% senior notes. see "item 7. md&a-liquidity and capital resources-overview" and note 8 to our consolidated financial statements.
in 2015, our financing activities predominately related to (1) paying an aggregate of $1.1 billion in dividends on our common stock, (2) amending our previously outstanding 2012 credit facility and (3) issuing $1.0 billion in may 2015 tower revenue notes which provided us with funding to repay $250.0 million aggregate principal amount of august 2010 tower revenue notes, redeem all of the previously outstanding wcp securitized notes, and repay portions of outstanding borrowings under our previously outstanding 2012 credit facility. see also "item 7. md&a-general overview-common stock dividend" for a discussion of the increase to our common stock dividend during the fourth quarter of 2015.
in january 2016, we completed a new senior unsecured $5.5 billion 2016 credit facility and utilized the proceeds, together with cash on hand, to repay all outstanding borrowings under the previously outstanding 2012 credit facility. see "item 7. md&a-liquidity and capital resources-credit facility."
in february 2016, we issued $1.5 billion aggregate principal amount of investment grade senior unsecured notes ("2016 senior unsecured notes"), which consist of (1) $600.0 million aggregated principal amount of 3.4% senior notes with a final maturity date of february 2021, and (2) $900.0 million aggregate principal amount of 4.45% senior notes with a final maturity date of february 2026.
we used the net proceeds from the 2016 senior unsecured notes offering, together with cash on hand, to (1) repay in full all outstanding borrowings under the 364-day facility (and, in connection therewith, terminate all commitments thereunder), and (2) to repay $500.0 million of outstanding borrowings under the 2016 revolver.
incurrences, purchases and repayments of debt. see notes 8 and 19 to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our recent issuances, purchases, and repayments of debt. our debt issuances extended the maturities of our debt portfolio, provided funding for our acquisitions and our repayment of previously existing debt, and lowered our cost of debt. see "item 7. md&a-liquidity and capital resources-overview-liquidity position." after giving effect to our 2016 refinancings, approximately 48% of our debt is secured. certain of our wireless infrastructure is held in subsidiaries whose equity interests have been pledged, directly or indirectly, along with other collateral to secure such indebtedness. see notes 8 and 19 to our consolidated financial statements.
common stock. as of december 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, we had 333.8 million, 333.9 million, and 334.1 million common shares outstanding, respectively. in october 2013, we issued 41.4 million shares of common stock, the net proceeds of which were used to partially fund the at&t acquisition. during the year ended december 31, 2015, we paid an aggregate of $1.1 billion in dividends on our common stock. see "item 1. business-strategy" and note 12 to our consolidated financial statements.
atm program. in august 2015, we established an atm program through which we may, from time to time, issue and sell shares of our common stock having an aggregate gross sales price of up to $500.0 million to or through sales agents. sales, if any, under the atm program may be made by means of ordinary brokers' transactions on the new york stock exchange or otherwise at market prices prevailing at the time of sale, at prices related to prevailing market prices or, subject to our specific instructions, at negotiated prices. we intend to use the net proceeds from any sales under the atm program for general corporate purposes, which may include the funding of future acquisitions or investments and the repayment or repurchase of any outstanding
indebtedness. as of february 15, 2016, no shares of common stock were sold under the atm program. see note 12 to our consolidated financial statements.
convertible preferred stock. in october 2013, we issued 9.8 million shares of convertible preferred stock, the net proceeds of which were used to partially fund the at&t acquisition. unless converted earlier, each outstanding share of the convertible preferred stock will automatically convert on november 1, 2016. currently, each share of convertible preferred stock will convert into shares of common stock at a conversion rate between 1.1538 shares (based on the current maximum conversion price of $86.67) and 1.4421 shares (based on the current minimum conversion price of $69.34), depending on the applicable market value of the common stock and subject to certain anti-dilution adjustments. at any time prior to november 1, 2016, holders of the convertible preferred stock may elect to convert all or a portion of their shares into common stock at the minimum conversion rate of 1.1538, subject to certain anti-dilution adjustments.
credit facility.
in january 2016, we completed a new unsecured $5.5 billion 2016 credit facility, consisting of (1) a $2.5 billion unsecured 2016 revolver maturing on january 21, 2021, (2) a $1.0 billion senior unsecured 364-day revolving credit facility ("364-day facility") maturing on january 19, 2017, and (3) a $2.0 billion senior unsecured term loan a facility ("2016 term loan a") maturing on january 21, 2021. as of february 15, 2016, the 364-day facility was terminated. see note 19 to our consolidated financial statements.
the 2016 credit facility bears interest at a per annum rate equal to libor plus 1.125% to 2.000%, based on our senior unsecured debt rating.
the proceeds of the loans under the 2016 credit facility, together with cash on hand, were used to repay all outstanding borrowings under the previously outstanding 2012 credit facility.
the 2016 revolver may be used for general corporate purposes, which may include the financing of capital expenditures, acquisitions, and purchases of our common stock. see notes 4, 8, and 19 to our consolidated financial statements.
as of february 15, 2016, there was approximately $2.1 billion in availability under the 2016 revolver.
restricted cash. pursuant to the indentures governing certain of our operating companies' debt securities, all rental cash receipts of the issuers of these debt instruments and their subsidiaries are restricted and held by an indenture trustee. the restricted cash in excess of required reserve balances is subsequently released to us in accordance with the terms of the indentures. during 2012, $316.6 million of restricted cash was held by the trustee in connection with the redemption of the 7.75% secured notes. that amount was subsequently released in january 2013 when the 7.75% secured notes were redeemed in their entirety. see also notes 2 and 8 to our consolidated financial statements.
contractual cash obligations the following table summarizes our contractual cash obligations as of december 31, 2015, after giving effect to our 2016 refinancings. these contractual cash obligations relate primarily to our outstanding borrowings or lease obligations for land interests under our towers. the debt maturities reflect contractual maturity dates and do not consider the impact of the principal payments that will commence following the anticipated repayment dates on the tower revenue notes (see footnote (b)).
(a)   the following items are in addition to the obligations disclosed in the above table:
•   we have a legal obligation to perform certain asset retirement activities, including requirements upon lease and easement terminations to remove wireless infrastructure or remediate the land upon which our wireless infrastructure resides. the cash obligations disclosed in the above table, as of december 31, 2015, are exclusive of estimated undiscounted future cash outlays for asset retirement obligations of approximately $1.1 billion. as of december 31, 2015, the net present value of these asset retirement obligations was approximately $132.1 million.
•   we are contractually obligated to pay or reimburse others for property taxes related to our wireless infrastructure.
•   we have the option to purchase approximately 54% of our towers that are leased or subleased or operated and managed under master leases, subleases, and other agreements with at&amp;t, sprint, and t-mobile at the end of their respective lease terms. we have no obligation to exercise such purchase options. see note 1 to our consolidated financial statements.
•   we have legal obligations for open purchase order commitments obtained in the ordinary course of business that have not yet been fulfilled.
(b)   the impact of principal payments that will commence following the anticipated repayment dates of our tower revenue notes are not considered. the january 2010 tower revenue notes consist of two series of notes with principal amounts of $350.0 million and $1.3 billion, having anticipated repayment dates in 2017 and 2020, respectively. the august 2010 tower revenue notes consist of two series of notes with principal amounts of $300.0 million and $1.0 billion, having anticipated repayment dates in 2017 and 2020, respectively. see notes 8 and 19 to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our recent refinancing activities.
(c)   if the tower revenue notes are not repaid in full by the applicable anticipated repayment dates, the applicable interest rate increases by approximately 5% per annum and monthly principal payments commence using the excess cash flow (as defined in the indenture governing the applicable tower revenue notes) of the issuers of the tower revenue notes. the tower revenue notes are presented based on their contractual maturity dates ranging from 2037 to 2045 and include the impact of an assumed 5% increase in interest rate that would occur following the anticipated repayment dates but exclude the impact of monthly principal payments that would commence using excess cash flow (as defined in the indenture governing the applicable tower revenue notes) of the issuers of the tower revenue notes. the full year 2015 excess cash flow (as defined in the indenture governing the applicable tower revenue notes) of the issuers of the tower revenue notes was approximately $495.4 million. we currently expect to refinance these notes on or prior to the respective anticipated repayment dates.
(e)   amounts relate primarily to lease obligations for the land interests on which our wireless infrastructure resides and are based on the assumption that payments will be made through the end of the period for which we hold renewal rights. see table below summarizing remaining terms to expiration.
the following chart summarizes our rights to the land interests under our towers, including renewal terms at our option, as of december 31, 2015. as of december 31, 2015, the leases for land interests under our towers had an average remaining life in excess of 30 years, weighted based on site rental gross margin. see "item 1a. risk factors."
(a)   without consideration of the term of the tenant lease.
debt covenants the credit agreement governing the 2016 credit facility contains financial maintenance covenants. we are currently in compliance with these financial maintenance covenants and, based upon our current expectations, we believe we will continue to comply with these financial maintenance covenants. in addition, certain of our debt agreements also contain restrictive covenants that place restrictions on us and may limit our ability to, among other things, incur additional debt and liens, purchase our securities, make capital expenditures, dispose of assets, undertake transactions with affiliates, make other investments, pay dividends or distribute excess cash flow. see note 8 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our debt covenants. see "item 1a. risk factors." the following are ratios applicable to the financial maintenance covenants under the credit agreement governing our 2016 credit facility as of december 31, 2015 after giving effect to the receipt of the installment payment from the sale of ccal in january 2016 and our 2016 refinancings.
borrower / issuer   financial maintenance covenant(a)(b)      covenant level requirement   as of december 31, 2015
ccic                total net leverage ratio                  ≤ 6.50x                      5.4x ccic                total senior secured leverage ratio       ≤ 3.50x                      2.5x ccic                consolidated interest coverage ratio(c)   n/a                          n/a
(a)   failure to comply with the financial maintenance covenants would, absent a waiver, result in an event of default under the credit agreement governing our 2016 credit facility.
(b)   as defined in the credit agreement governing our 2016 credit facility.
(c)   applicable solely to the extent that the senior unsecured debt rating by any two of s&amp;p, moody's and fitch is lower than bbb-, baa3 or bbb-, respectively. if applicable, the consolidated interest coverage ratio must be greater than or equal to 2.50.
off-balance sheet arrangements we have no off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in item 303(a)(4)(ii) of regulation s-k.
accounting and reporting matters critical accounting policies and estimates the following is a discussion of the accounting policies and estimates that we believe (1) are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations or (2) require our most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. the critical accounting policies and estimates for 2015 are not intended to be a comprehensive list of our accounting policies and estimates. see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for a summary of our significant accounting policies. in many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by gaap. in other cases, management is required to exercise judgment in the application of accounting principles with respect to particular transactions.
revenue recognition. 82% of our total revenue for 2015 consists of site rental revenues, which are recognized on a monthly basis over the fixed, non-cancelable term of the relevant lease (generally ranging from five to 15 years), regardless of whether the payments from the tenant are received in equal monthly amounts. if the payment terms call for fixed escalations (as in fixed dollar or fixed percentage increases), upfront payments or rent free periods, the revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the fixed, non-cancelable term of the lease. when calculating our straight-line rental revenues, we consider all fixed elements of tenant contractual escalation provisions, even if such escalation provisions contain a variable element (such as an escalator tied to an inflation-based index) in addition to a minimum. to the extent we acquire below-market tenant leases for contractual interests with tenants on the acquired wireless infrastructure (for example with respect to small cells) we record deferred credits and amortize such deferred credits to site rental revenues over their estimated lease term. since we recognize revenue on a straight-line basis, a portion of the site rental revenue in a given period represents cash collected or contractually collectible in other periods. our assets related to straight-line site rental revenues are included in "other current assets" and "deferred site rental receivables, net." amounts billed or received prior to being earned are deferred and reflected in "deferred revenues" and "other long-term liabilities." see notes 2 and 7 to our consolidated financial statements.
as part of our effort to provide comprehensive wireless infrastructure solutions, we offer certain network services relating to our wireless infrastructure, which represent approximately 18% of our total revenues for 2015. network services and other revenue consists of (1) site development services and (2) installation services. network services revenues are recognized after completion of the applicable service. we account for network services separately from the customer's site rental. see "item 1. business-the company" for a further discussion of our business.
accounting for acquisitions - general. as described in "item 1. business," much of our wireless infrastructure has been acquired in various transactions from the four largest wireless carriers (or their predecessors) through transactions consummated since 1999. we evaluate each of our acquisitions to determine if it should be accounted for as a business combination or as an acquisition of assets. for our business combinations, we allocate the purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair value at the date of acquisition. any purchase price in excess of the net fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is allocated to goodwill. see "item 7. md&a-accounting and reporting matters-accounting for acquisitions-valuation" below.
the determination of the final purchase price allocation could extend over several quarters resulting in the use of preliminary estimates that are subject to adjustment until finalized. such changes could have a significant impact on our financial statements.
accounting for acquisitions - leases. with respect to business combinations that include towers that we lease and operate, such as the at&t, t-mobile, and sprint leased and subleased towers, we evaluate such agreements to determine treatment as capital or operating leases. the evaluation of such agreements for capital or operating lease treatment includes consideration of each of the lease classification criteria under asc 840-10-25, namely (1) the transfer of ownership provisions, (2) the existence of bargain purchase options, (3) the length of the remaining lease term, and (4) the present value of the minimum lease payments. with respect to the at&t acquisition, t-mobile acquisition, and the sprint towers acquired in the global signal acquisition, we determined that the tower leases were capital leases and the underlying land leases were operating leases based upon the lease term criterion, after considering the fragmentation criteria applicable under asc 840-10-25 to leases involving both land and buildings (i.e., towers). we determined that the fragmentation criteria was met, and the tower leases could be accounted for as capital leases apart from the land leases, which are accounted for as operating leases, since (1) the fair value of the land in the aforementioned business combinations was greater than 25% of the total fair value of the leased property at inception and (2) the tower lease expirations occur beyond 75% of the estimated economic life of the tower assets.
accounting for acquisitions - valuation. as of december 31, 2015, our largest asset was property and equipment, which primarily consists of wireless infrastructure, followed by goodwill and intangible assets. our identifiable intangible assets predominately relate to the site rental contracts and customer relationships intangible assets. see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the nature and composition of the site rental contracts and customer relationships intangible assets.
the fair value of the vast majority of our assets and liabilities is determined by using either:
(1)   estimates of replacement costs (for tangible fixed assets such as towers), or
(2)   discounted cash flow valuation methods (for estimating identifiable intangibles such as site rental contracts and customer relationships and above-market and below-market leases).
the purchase price allocation requires subjective estimates that, if incorrectly estimated, could be material to our consolidated financial statements, including the amount of depreciation, amortization, and accretion expense. the most important estimates for measurement of tangible fixed assets are (1) the cost to replace the asset with a new asset and (2) the economic useful life after giving effect to age, quality, and condition. the most important estimates for measurement of intangible assets are (1) discount rates and (2) timing and amount of cash flows including estimates regarding customer renewals and cancellations. the most important estimates for measurement of above and below-market leases is the determination of (1) favorability or unfavorability to the current market terms and (2) applicable lease term, including whether renewals or extensions should be measured. with respect to business combinations that include towers that we lease and operate, such as the t-mobile, sprint, and at&t leased and subleased towers, we evaluate such agreements to determine treatment as capital or operating leases and identification of any bargain purchase options.
we record the fair value of obligations to perform certain asset retirement activities, including requirements, pursuant to our ground leases or easements, to remove wireless infrastructure or remediate the land upon which our wireless infrastructure resides. in determining the fair value of these asset retirement obligations we must make several subjective and highly judgmental estimates such as those related to: (1) timing of cash flows, (2) future costs, (3) discount rates, and (4) the probability of enforcement to remove the towers or small cells or remediate the land. see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements.
accounting for long-lived assets - useful lives. we are required to make subjective assessments as to the useful lives of our tangible and intangible assets for purposes of determining depreciation, amortization, and accretion expense that, if incorrectly estimated, could be material to our consolidated financial statements. depreciation expense for our property and equipment is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of our various classes of tangible assets. the substantial portion of our property and equipment represents the cost of our wireless infrastructure which is depreciated with an estimated useful life equal to the shorter of (1) 20 years or (2) the term of the lease (including optional renewals) for the land interests under the wireless infrastructure.
the useful life of our intangible assets is estimated based on the period over which the intangible asset is expected to benefit us and gives consideration to the expected useful life of other assets to which the useful life may relate. we review the expected useful lives of our intangible assets on an ongoing basis and adjust if necessary. amortization expense for intangible assets is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of each of the intangible assets. the useful life of the site rental contracts and customer relationships intangible assets is limited by the maximum depreciable life of the wireless infrastructure (20 years), as a result of the interdependency of the wireless infrastructure and site rental contracts and customer relationships. in contrast, the site rental contracts and customer relationships are estimated to provide economic benefits for several decades because of the low rate of tenant cancellations and high rate of renewals experienced to date. thus, while site rental contracts and customer relationships are valued based upon the fair value of the site rental contracts and customer relationships which includes assumptions regarding both (1) tenants' exercise of optional renewals contained in the acquired leases and (2) renewals of the acquired leases past the contractual term including exercisable options, the site rental contracts are amortized over a period not to exceed 20 years as a result of the useful life being limited by the depreciable life of the wireless infrastructure.
accounting for long-lived assets - impairment evaluation - intangibles. we review the carrying values of property and equipment, intangible assets, or other long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable. we utilize the following dual grouping policy for purposes of determining the unit of account for testing impairment of the site rental contracts and customer relationships:
(1)   we pool site rental contracts and customer relationships intangible assets and property and equipment into portfolio groups, and
(2)   we separately pool site rental contracts and customer relationships by significant tenant or by tenant grouping for individually insignificant tenants, as appropriate.
we first pool site rental contracts and customer relationships intangible assets and property and equipment into portfolio groups for purposes of determining the unit of account for impairment testing, because we view wireless infrastructure as portfolios and wireless infrastructure in a given portfolio and its related tenant leases are not largely independent of the other wireless infrastructure in the portfolio. we re-evaluate the appropriateness of the pooled groups at least annually. this use of grouping is based in part on (1) our limitations regarding disposal of wireless infrastructure, (2) the interdependencies of wireless infrastructure portfolios, and (3) the manner in which wireless infrastructure is traded in the marketplace. the vast majority of our site rental contracts and customer relationships intangible assets and property and equipment are pooled into the u.s. owned wireless infrastructure group. secondly, and separately, we pool site rental contracts and customer relationships by significant tenant or by tenant grouping for individually insignificant tenants, as appropriate, for purposes of determining the unit of account for impairment testing because we associate the value ascribed to site rental contracts and customer relationships intangible assets to the underlying contracts and related customer relationships acquired.
our determination that an adverse event or change in circumstance has occurred that indicates that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable will generally involve (1) a deterioration in an asset's financial performance compared to historical results, (2) a shortfall in an asset's financial performance compared to forecasted results, or (3) changes affecting the utility and estimated future demands for the asset. when considering the utility of our assets, we consider events that would meaningfully impact (1) our wireless infrastructure or (2) our customer relationships. for example, consideration would be given to events that impact (1) the structural integrity and longevity of our wireless infrastructure or (2) our ability to derive benefit from our existing customer relationships, including events such as bankruptcy or insolvency or loss of a significant customer. during 2015, there were no events or circumstances that caused us to review the carrying value of our intangible assets or property and equipment due in part to our assets performing consistently with or better than our expectations.
if the sum of the estimated future cash flows (undiscounted) from an asset, or portfolio group, significant tenant or tenant group (for individually insignificant tenants), as applicable, is less than its carrying amount, an impairment loss may be recognized. if the carrying value were to exceed the undiscounted cash flows, measurement of an impairment loss would be based on the fair value of the asset, which is based on an estimate of discounted future cash flows. the most important estimates for such calculations of undiscounted cash flows are (1) the expected additions of new tenants and equipment on our wireless infrastructure and (2) estimates regarding tenant cancellations and renewals of leases. we could record impairments in the future if changes in long-term market conditions, expected future operating results or the utility of the assets results in changes for our impairment test calculations which negatively impact the fair value of our property and equipment and intangible assets, or if we changed our unit of account in the future.
when grouping assets into pools for purposes of impairment evaluation, we also consider individual towers, nodes, and third party land interests within a grouping for which we currently have no tenants. approximately 2% of our total towers currently have no tenants. we continue to pay operating expenses on these towers in anticipation of obtaining tenants on these towers in the future, primarily because of the individual tower site demographics. we estimate, based on current visibility, potential tenants on approximately half of these towers. to the extent we do not believe there are long-term prospects of obtaining tenants on an individual tower, node, or third party land interest and all other possible avenues for recovering the carrying value has been exhausted, including sale of the asset, we appropriately reduce the carrying value of such assets to fair value.
accounting for long-lived assets - impairment evaluation - goodwill. we test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis, regardless of whether adverse events or changes in circumstances have occurred. the annual test begins with goodwill and all intangible assets being allocated to applicable reporting units. we then perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is "more likely than not" that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. if it is concluded that it is "more likely than not" that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, it is necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test. otherwise the two-step goodwill impairment test is not required. during 2015, we sold our australian operations and our reporting units changed from u.s. operations and australian operations to towers and small cells. we performed a relative fair value allocation of goodwill when the change in reporting units occurred. see notes 3 and 16 to our consolidated financial statements regarding the sale of ccal and change in reportable segments.we performed our most recent annual goodwill impairment test as of october 1, 2015, which resulted in no impairments. this assessment included consideration of our market capitalization which exceeded over three times the aggregate carrying amount of the reporting units as of december 31, 2015.
deferred income taxes. effective january 1, 2014, we commenced operating as a reit for u.s. federal income tax purposes. our reit taxable income is generally not subject to federal and state income taxes as a result of the deduction for dividends paid and any usage of our remaining nols. accordingly, the only provision or benefit for federal income taxes for the year ended december 31, 2015 relates to trss.  furthermore, as a result of the deduction for dividends paid, some or all of our nols related to our reit may expire without utilization.  see "item 1. business-2015 industry highlights and company developments-reit election" for a discussion of the impact of our reit election.
our trss will continue to be subject, as applicable, to federal and state income taxes and foreign taxes in the jurisdictions in which such assets and operations are located.  see "item 1. business-2015 industry highlights and company developments-reit election" for a discussion of  our inclusion of small cells in the reit effective january 1, 2016. our ability to utilize our nols is dependent, in part, upon our having sufficient future earnings to utilize our nols before they expire. if market conditions change materially and we determine that we will be unable to generate sufficient taxable income in the future to utilize our nols, we would be required to record an additional valuation allowance, which would reduce our earnings. such adjustments could cause a material effect on our results of operations for the period of the adjustment. the change in our valuation allowance has no effect on our cash flows. for a further discussion of our benefit (provision) for income taxes and our reit conversion, see "item 7. md&a-results of operations" and note 11 to our consolidated financial statements.

non-gaap financial measures our measurement of profit or loss currently used to evaluate the operating performance of our operating segments is earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, and accretion, as adjusted, or adjusted ebitda. our definition of adjusted ebitda is set forth in "item 7. md&a-results of operations." our measure of adjusted ebitda may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, including companies in the tower sector and other similar providers of wireless infrastructure, and is not a measure of performance calculated in accordance with gaap. adjusted ebitda should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for operating income or loss, net income or loss, net cash provided by (used for) operating, investing and financing activities, or other income statement or cash flow statement data prepared in accordance with gaap.
we define adjusted ebitda as net income (loss) plus restructuring charges (credits), asset write-down charges, acquisition and integration costs, depreciation, amortization and accretion, amortization of prepaid lease purchase price adjustments, interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs, gains (losses) on retirement of long-term obligations, net gain (loss) on interest rate swaps, gains (losses) on foreign currency swaps, impairment of available-for-sale securities, interest income, other income (expense), benefit (provision) for income taxes, cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle, income (loss) from discontinued operations and stock-based compensation expense. the reconciliation of adjusted ebitda to our net income (loss) is set forth below. adjusted ebitda is not intended as an alternative measure of operating results or cash flows from operations
as determined in accordance with gaap, and our definition of adjusted ebitda may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.
asset write-down charges                                               33,468                    14,246                    13,595
acquisition and integration costs                                      15,678                    34,145                    25,574
interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs         527,128                   573,291                   589,630
gains (losses) on retirement of long-term obligations                   4,157                    44,629                    37,127
benefit (provision) for income taxes                                  (51,457    )              (11,244    )              191,000
adjusted ebitda(a)                                                 $2,119,183                $2,051,257                $1,715,718
(a)   the above reconciliation excludes the items included in the company's adjusted ebitda definition which are not applicable to the periods shown.
we believe adjusted ebitda is useful to an investor in evaluating our operating performance because:
•   it is the primary measure used by our management to evaluate the economic productivity of our operations, including the efficiency of our employees and the profitability associated with their performance, the realization of lease revenue under our long-term leases, our ability to obtain and maintain our tenants, and our ability to operate our wireless infrastructure effectively;
•   it is the primary measure of profit and loss used by management for purposes of making decisions about allocating resources to, and assessing the performance of, our operating segment;
•   it is similar to the measure of current financial performance generally used in our debt covenant calculations;
•   although specific definitions may vary, it is widely used in the tower sector and other similar providers of wireless infrastructure to measure operating performance without regard to items such as depreciation, amortization and accretion, which can vary depending upon accounting methods and the book value of assets; and
•   we believe it helps investors meaningfully evaluate and compare the results of our operations (1) from period to period and (2) to our competitors by removing the impact of our capital structure (primarily interest charges from our outstanding debt) and asset base (primarily depreciation, amortization and accretion) from our operating results.
our management uses adjusted ebitda:
•   with respect to compliance with our debt covenants, which require us to maintain certain financial ratios including, or similar to, adjusted ebitda;
•   as the primary measure of profit and loss for purposes of making decisions about allocating resources to, and assessing the performance of, our operating segments;
•   as a performance goal in employee annual incentive compensation;
•   as a measurement of operating performance because it assists us in comparing our operating performance on a consistent basis as it removes the impact of our capital structure (primarily interest charges from our outstanding debt) and asset base (primarily depreciation, amortization, and accretion) from our operating results;
•   in presentations to our board of directors to enable it to have the same measurement of operating performance used by management;
•   for planning purposes, including preparation of our annual operating budget;
•   as a valuation measure in strategic analyses in connection with the purchase and sale of assets; and
•   in determining self-imposed limits on our debt levels, including the evaluation of our leverage ratio and interest coverage ratio.
there are material limitations to using a measure such as adjusted ebitda, including the difficulty associated with comparing results among more than one company, including our competitors, and the inability to analyze certain significant items, including depreciation and interest expense, that directly affect our net income or loss. management compensates for these limitations by considering the economic effect of the excluded expense items independently as well as in connection with their analysis of net income (loss).

item 1a. risk factors.
in addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the following factors which could materially affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. the risks described below are not the only risks we face. additional factors not presently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, cash flows, financial condition or results of operations in future periods.
worldwide and domestic economic trends and financial market conditions we are subject to risks associated with adverse economic conditions, including economic slowdown, inflation, and the disruption, volatility and tightening of credit and capital markets. unfavorable global or regional economic conditions could adversely impact our business, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations. unemployment, tax increases, governmental spending cuts or a return of high levels of inflation could affect consumer spending patterns and purchases of our products. these could also create or exacerbate credit issues, cash flow issues and other financial hardships for us and our suppliers, distributors, retailers and consumers. the inability of suppliers, distributors and retailers to access liquidity could impact our ability to produce and distribute our products. we have a committed credit facility and additional liquidity facilities available to us. while to date we have not experienced problems with accessing these facilities, to the extent that the financial institutions that participate in these facilities were to default on their obligation to fund, those funds would not be available to us.
global operations, currency rate fluctuations, interest rate fluctuations and geopolitical uncertainty our products are produced and sold in numerous countries throughout the world. as a result of the beer business acquisition, we also have operations in mexico.
risks associated with international operations, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations, include:
•   changes in local political, economic, social and labor conditions;
•   restrictions on foreign ownership and investments or on repatriation of cash earned in countries outside the u.s.;
•   changes in laws, governmental regulations and policies in many countries outside the u.s.;
•   changes in tax laws and regulations, including with respect to income taxes in countries outside the u.s.;
•   import and export requirements;
•   currency exchange rate fluctuations;
•   a less developed and less certain legal and regulatory environment, which among other things can create uncertainty with regard to liability issues;
•   laws regarding the enforcement of contract and intellectual property rights;
•   inadequate levels of compliance with applicable anti-bribery laws, including the foreign corrupt practices act; and
•   other challenges caused by distance, language and cultural differences.
our success will depend, in part, on our ability to overcome the challenges we encounter with respect to these factors and other matters generally affecting u.s. companies with global operations. although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with u.s. and foreign laws and regulations, including anti-corruption laws, there can be no assurance that our employees, business partners or agents will not violate our policies or take action determined to be in violation of the law. any determination that our operations or activities were not in compliance with applicable u.s. or foreign laws or regulations could result in the imposition of fines and penalties, interruptions of business, terminations of necessary licenses and permits, and other legal and equitable sanctions.
we are also exposed to risks associated with currency fluctuations and risks associated with interest rate fluctuations. currency exchange rates between the u.s. dollar and foreign currencies in the markets in which we do business have fluctuated in recent years and are likely to continue to do so in the future. we manage our exposure to foreign currency and interest rate risks utilizing derivative instruments and other means to reduce those risks. we could experience changes in our ability to hedge against or manage fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates or interest rates and, accordingly, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in reducing those risks. we could also be affected by nationalization of our international operations, unstable governments, unfamiliar or biased legal systems or intergovernmental disputes. these currency, economic and political uncertainties may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition, especially to the extent these matters, or the decisions, policies or economic strength of our suppliers and distributors, affect our global operations.
competition we are in a highly competitive industry and the dollar amount and unit volume of our sales could be negatively affected by numerous factors including:
•   our inability to maintain or increase prices;
•   new entrants in our market or categories;
•   the decision of wholesalers or consumers to purchase a competitor's product instead of ours.
unit volume and dollar amount of sales could also be affected by pricing, purchasing, financing, operational, advertising or promotional decisions made by wholesalers, state and provincial agencies, and retailers which could affect their supply of, or consumer demand for, our products. we could also experience higher than expected selling, general and administrative expenses if we find it necessary to increase the number of our personnel or our advertising or marketing expenditures to maintain our competitive position or for other reasons.
dependence on sales of our mexican beer brands since the beer business acquisition, sales of the mexican beer brands in the u.s. have become a more significant portion of our business. accordingly, if the growth rate, amount or profitability of our sales of the mexican beer brands in the u.s. declines, our business could be more adversely affected than as compared to a time prior to the beer business acquisition. further, consumer preferences and tastes may shift away from the mexican beer brands, the categories in which they compete, or beer generally due to, among other reasons, changing taste preferences, demographics or perceived value. consequently, any material shift in consumer preferences and taste away from the mexican beer brands, or from the categories in which they compete, could have a material adverse effect on our business, our financial condition and results of operations.
supply of mexican beer brands in order to fulfill our current and projected mexican beer brands product requirements, we are currently dependent on our nava brewery which is a single facility located in nava, coahuila, mexico, and an interim supply agreement for our supply of mexican beer brands through june 2017. although we are in the process of
constructing an additional brewery in mexicali, baja california, mexico with the first phase targeted for completion in calendar 2019, our nava brewery may for a period of time become our sole source of supply for our mexican beer brands. the nava brewery currently has the capacity to fill approximately 60% of our current product requirements and before the end of calendar 2016 its capacity is expected to increase to allow it to fill approximately 80% of our projected product requirements. we are in the process of further expanding the nava brewery's capacity over a three-year period. the first phase, which was intended to make us self-sufficient, is targeted to be complete in calendar 2016. the second phase to support further growth in the business is targeted for completion in calendar 2017, and the third phase, to support additional growth of the business, is targeted for completion in calendar 2018. in 2013, we entered into an interim supply agreement for a supply of additional mexican beer brands products for an initial period of three years. this agreement also provides for up to two one-year extensions. however, the united states, acting though the doj, will have a right of approval, in its sole discretion, of any extension of the term of this interim supply agreement beyond three years. the term of this interim supply agreement has been extended for one additional year as to a select number of products to ensure additional supply beyond the initial nava expansion to support the robust growth levels of our mexican beer portfolio and continue a smooth transition as we ramp up incremental capacity. the interim supply agreement will now expire in june 2017. there can be no assurance that any additional requested extension would be granted.
our nava brewery supply is also dependent upon an adequate supply of glass bottles. we formed the mexican glass plant joint venture which acquired the glass plant adjacent to our nava brewery. the mexican glass plant joint venture plans to expand production of the glass plant facility by early calendar 2018 in order to increase bottle output to support increased production at our nava brewery.
we may not be able to satisfy all of our product supply requirements for the mexican beer brands in the event of a significant partial destruction or the total destruction of the nava brewery or our interim supplier's breweries. also, if the contemplated initial expansion of our nava brewery is not completed within three years after consummation of the beer business acquisition, and the additional incremental expansions of the nava brewery and construction of the mexicali brewery to support further growth of our business are not completed by their targeted completion dates, we may not be able to produce sufficient mexican beer brands to satisfy our needs. under such circumstances, we may be unable to obtain mexican beer brands at a reasonable price from another source, if at all. a significant disruption at our nava brewery or at our supplier's breweries, even on a short-term basis, could impair our ability to produce and ship products to market on a timely basis. alternative facilities with sufficient capacity or capabilities may not readily be available, may cost substantially more or may take a significant time to start production, any of which could negatively affect our business and financial performance. similarly, although we have additional sources of supply of glass bottles, a significant partial destruction or the total destruction of the joint venture's mexican glass plant or the failure of the joint venture to complete the glass plant expansion could impair our ability to bottle and ship our mexican beer products to market. additionally, our general insurance policies may not cover certain types of catastrophes that might affect our supply of the mexican beer brands. a major uninsured catastrophe could result in significant unrecoverable losses.
supply of quality water, agricultural and other raw materials, certain raw materials and packaging materials purchased under short-term supply contracts, limited group of suppliers of glass bottles the quality and quantity of water available for use is important to the supply of our agricultural raw materials and our ability to operate our business. water is a limited resource in many parts of the world and if climate patterns change and droughts become more severe, there may be a scarcity of water or poor water quality which may affect our production costs or impose capacity constraints. we are dependent on sufficient amounts of quality water for operation of our breweries, our wineries and our distillery, as well as to irrigate our vineyards and conduct our other operations. the suppliers of the agricultural raw materials we purchase are also dependent upon sufficient supplies of quality water for their vineyards and fields.
we have substantial wine operations in the state of california, which has endured an extended period of drought and has instituted restrictions on water usage. while we have undertaken a number of water saving initiatives and we currently believe we have sufficient water available for our california vineyards and wineries, continued or more severe drought conditions in california could have an adverse effect upon those operations, which effect could become more significant depending upon actual future drought conditions. our nava brewery
and the glass plant receive water originating from a mountain aquifer. although we anticipate our breweries and the glass plant will receive water adequate to support their on-going requirements, including as a result of the anticipated expansions, there is no guarantee that the water available to them or their water requirements will not change materially in the future.
if water available to our operations or the operations of our suppliers becomes scarcer or the quality of that water deteriorates, we may incur increased production costs or face manufacturing constraints which could negatively affect our business and financial performance. even if quality water is widely available, including to our breweries, our wineries, our distillery and our vineyards, water purification and waste treatment infrastructure limitations could increase costs or constrain operation of our production facilities and vineyards. any of these factors could have a material and adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
our breweries, the glass plant, our wineries and our distillery also use a large volume of agricultural and other raw materials to produce their products. as to the nava brewery, these include corn starch, malt, hops and water; the glass plant uses large amounts of soda ash and silica sand; the ballast point breweries use large amounts of malt, hops, yeast and water, as well as corn sugars, spices and fruits; the wineries use large amounts of grapes and water; and the distillery uses large amounts of grain and water. our breweries, our wineries and our distillery all use large amounts of various packaging materials, including glass, aluminum, cardboard and other paper products. our production facilities, including the glass plant, also use a significant amount of energy in their operations, including electricity, natural gas and diesel fuel. certain raw materials and packaging materials are purchased under contracts of varying maturities. the supply and price of raw materials, packaging materials and energy can be affected by a number of factors beyond our control, including market demand, global geopolitical events (especially as to their impact on crude oil prices), droughts and other weather conditions, economic factors affecting growth decisions, inflation, plant diseases and theft. to the extent any of the foregoing factors, including supply of goods and energy, affect the prices of ingredients or packaging or we do not effectively or completely hedge changes in commodity price risks, or are unable to recoup costs through increases in the price of our finished products, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely impacted.
glass bottle costs are one of our largest components of cost of product sold. we currently have a small number of suppliers of glass bottles for our mexican beer brands. in the u.s. and canada, glass bottles have only a small number of producers. currently, one producer supplies most of our glass container requirements for our u.s. operations and a portion of our glass container requirements for our canadian operations, with the remaining portion of our glass container requirements for our canadian operations supplied by another producer. the inability of any of our glass bottle suppliers to satisfy our requirements could adversely affect our business.
catastrophic loss to wineries, production facilities or distribution systems throughout the years, we have consolidated several of our winery and production facility operations. approximately 80% of our total annual wine and spirits product volume is produced in the us, and three of our largest wineries are the woodbridge winery in acampo, ca, the mission bell winery in madera, ca, and the canandaigua winery in canandaigua, ny. these three facilities produce approximately 36 million cases (or approximately 70% of our us production) which is approximately 55% of the total annual constellation wine and spirits product volume globally. additionally, many of our vineyards and production and distribution facilities, such as our california wineries, our lodi distribution center in lodi, ca, and our planned mexicali brewery are located in areas which are prone to seismic activity. if any of these vineyards and facilities were to experience a catastrophic loss, it could disrupt our operations, delay production, shipments and revenue, and result in potentially significant expenses to repair or replace the vineyard or facility. if such a disruption were to occur, we could breach agreements, our reputation could be harmed, and our business and operating results could be adversely affected. in addition, since we have consolidated certain of our operations and various production and distribution facilities, we are more likely to experience an interruption of our operations in the event of a catastrophic event in any one location, such as through acts of war or terrorism, fires, floods, earthquakes, hurricanes or other natural or man-made disasters. although we carry insurance for property damage and business interruption, certain catastrophes are not covered by our insurance policies as we believe this to be a prudent financial decision. economic conditions and uncertainties in global markets may adversely affect the cost and other terms upon which we are able to obtain insurance. if our insurance coverage is adversely affected, or to the extent we have elected to self-insure, we may
be at greater risk that we may experience an adverse impact to our financial results. we take steps to minimize the damage that would be caused by a catastrophic event, but there is no certainty that our efforts would prove successful. if one or more significant uninsured events occur, we could suffer a major financial loss.
expansion issues, construction issues and operational disruptions we are currently expanding our nava brewery and constructing our mexicali brewery and our joint venture with owens-illinois is expanding the glass plant. while these multi-million dollar expansion and construction activities are progressing consistent with our plans, there is always the potential risk of completion delays and cost overruns. our supply of mexican beer brands would be negatively impacted if a serious delay in these expansion or construction activities were to occur, leading to a negative impact upon our results of operation and financial condition.
expansion of current production facilities and construction of new production facilities required to support future growth is subject to various regulatory and developmental risks, including but not limited to: (i) our ability to obtain timely certificate authorizations, necessary approvals and permits from regulatory agencies and on terms that are acceptable to us; (ii) potential changes in federal, state and local statutes and regulations, including environmental requirements, that prevent a project from proceeding or increase the anticipated cost of the project; (iii) inability to acquire rights-of-way or land or water rights on a timely basis on terms that are acceptable to us; and (iv) inability to acquire the necessary energy supplies, including electricity, natural gas and diesel fuel.
many of our production facilities, such as our breweries, wineries and distillery, and the mexican glass plant held by the joint venture with owens-illinois are asset intensive. our profitability could be affected by operational disruption of any of our production or bottling lines or the glass furnace. in such event we may experience an adverse effect to our business operations and profitability due to higher maintenance charges, unexpected capital spending or product supply constraints.
acquisition, divestiture and joint venture strategy we have made a number of acquisitions and divestitures and may, from time to time, acquire additional businesses, assets or securities of companies that we believe would provide a strategic fit with our business. recently, these have included the meiomi wine brand, the ballast point craft beer business and our agreement to acquire the prisoner wine company brand portfolio. we may also divest ourselves of businesses, assets or securities of companies that we believe no longer provide a strategic fit with our business. we will need to integrate acquired businesses with our existing operations; our overall internal control over financial reporting processes; and our financial, operations and information systems. if the financial performance of our business, as supplemented by the assets and businesses acquired, does not meet our expectations, it may make it more difficult for us to service our debt obligations and our results of operations may fail to meet market expectations.
we cannot assure you that we will realize the expected benefits of acquisitions or joint ventures, such as revenue, earnings or operating efficiency, and we may not effectively assimilate the business or product offerings of acquired companies into our business successfully or within the anticipated costs or timeframes. complications with on-going integration of any acquisition or joint venture, including our beer business acquisition or the acquisition of a mexican glass plant by our joint venture with owens-illinois, could result from the following circumstances, among others:
•   failure to implement our business plan for the combined business;
•   unanticipated issues in integrating, migrating or changing manufacturing, logistics, information, communications, financial, internal control and other systems;
•   failure to retain key customers and suppliers;
•   unanticipated changes in applicable laws and regulations;
•   operating risks inherent in the acquired businesses and assets and our business;
•   unanticipated issues, expenses and liabilities;
•   failure to realize fully anticipated cost savings, growth opportunities and other potential synergies; and
•   unfamiliarity with operating new locations.
the integration of the beer business acquisition can be further impacted by the following circumstances:
•   mexican brewery operations will be dependent upon the operational experience of employees who are relatively new to our organization;
•   our ability to secure or expand mexican brewery capacity beyond the initial nava brewery expansion, both incremental nava brewery expansions and construction of the mexicali brewery in order to support future growth of our beer business; and
our joint venture with owens-illinois to operate a glass plant adjacent to our nava brewery is fully consolidated into our financial results and the entire output of that facility will be utilized to support our mexican beer business and the production at our nava brewery. the integration of the mexican glass plant acquisition can be further impacted by the following circumstances:
•   we share control of the joint venture with owens-illinois and while owens-illinois has deep experience running glass plants, we are not as experienced in that particular business;
•   glass plant operations will be dependent upon the operational experience of employees who are relatively new to our organization; and
•   the ability of the joint venture to expand the glass plant capacity as planned in order to support the future growth of our beer business.
if any of these circumstances were to occur with respect to any of our acquisitions, including our beer business acquisition or the mexican glass plant joint venture's acquisition of the glass plant, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be negatively impacted.
we may provide various indemnifications in connection with the sale of assets or portions of our business. additionally, our final determinations and appraisals of the estimated fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in our acquisitions may vary materially from earlier estimates. we cannot assure you that the fair value of acquired businesses will remain constant.
we have entered into joint ventures such as our mexican glass plant joint venture with owens-illinois and we may enter into additional joint ventures for other purposes and with other parties. we share control of our joint ventures. we have also acquired or retained ownership interests in companies which we do not control, such as investments recently made through our constellation ventures function, such as our minority interests in crafthouse cocktails and nelson's green brier tennessee whiskey. our joint venture partners or the other parties that hold the remaining ownership interests in companies which we do not control may at any time have economic, business or legal interests or goals that are inconsistent with our goals or the goals of the joint ventures or those companies. similarly, in 2016, we announced that we are evaluating the merits of executing an initial public offering of a portion of our canadian wine business. our joint venture arrangements and the arrangements through which we acquired or hold our other equity or membership interests may require us, among other matters, to pay certain costs, to make capital investments, to fulfill alone our joint venture partners' obligations, or to purchase other parties' interests. even though we share control of our mexican glass plant joint venture, the financial results of that joint venture are consolidated into our financial results. our failure to adequately manage the risks associated with any acquisition, or the failure of an entity in which we have an equity or membership interest, could adversely affect our financial condition or our valuation of these types of investments.
we cannot assure you that any of our acquisitions, investments or joint ventures will be profitable or that forecasts regarding acquisition, divestiture, joint venture or investment activities will be accurate.
indebtedness in recent years, we have incurred substantial indebtedness to finance acquisitions such as our acquisition of ballast point, repurchase shares of our common stock and fund the beer business acquisition. in the future, we may continue to incur substantial additional indebtedness to finance acquisitions, repurchase shares of our stock and
fund other general corporate purposes, including our nava brewery expansions, our mexicali brewery construction and expansion of the glass plant held through the mexican glass plant joint venture. we cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations to meet all of our debt service requirements, to pay dividends and to fund our general corporate and capital requirements.
our ability to satisfy our debt obligations will depend upon our future operating performance. we do not have complete control over our future operating performance because it is subject to prevailing economic conditions, levels of interest rates and financial, business and other factors.
•   our ability to obtain financing for future working capital needs or acquisitions or other purposes may be limited;
•   our funds available for operations, expansions, dividends or other distributions may be reduced because we dedicate a significant portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness;
•   our ability to conduct our business could be limited by restrictive covenants; and
•   our vulnerability to adverse economic conditions may be greater than less leveraged competitors and, thus, our ability to withstand competitive pressures may be limited.
restrictive covenants in our senior credit facility and in our indentures place limits on our ability to conduct our business. covenants in our senior credit facility include those that restrict our ability to make acquisitions, incur debt, encumber or sell assets, pay dividends, engage in mergers and consolidations, enter into transactions with affiliates, make investments and permit our subsidiaries to enter into certain restrictive agreements. it additionally contains certain financial covenants, including a net debt coverage ratio test and an interest coverage ratio test. covenants in our indentures are generally less restrictive than those in our senior credit facility but nevertheless, among other things, limit our ability under certain circumstances to create liens or enter into sale-leaseback transactions and impose conditions on our ability to engage in mergers, consolidations and sales of all or substantially all of our assets.
these agreements also contain certain change of control provisions which, if triggered, may result in an acceleration of our obligation to repay the debt. if we fail to comply with the obligations contained in the senior credit facility, our existing or future indentures or other loan agreements, we could be in default under such agreements, which could require us to immediately repay the related debt and also debt under other agreements that may contain cross-acceleration or cross-default provisions.
potential decline in the consumption of products we sell we rely on consumers' demand for our products. consumer preferences may shift due to a variety of factors, including changes in demographic or social trends, public health policies, and changes in leisure, dining and beverage consumption patterns. our continued success will require us to anticipate and respond effectively to shifts in consumer behavior and drinking tastes. if consumer preferences were to move away from our premium brands, including our mexican beer brands, in any of our major markets, our financial results might be adversely affected.
while over the past several years there have been modest increases in consumption of beverage alcohol in most of our product categories and geographic markets, there have been periods in the past in which there were sequential declines in the overall per capita consumption of certain beverage alcohol product categories in the u.s. and other markets in which we participate. a limited or general decline in consumption in one or more of our product categories could occur in the future due to a variety of factors, including:
•   a general decline in economic or geopolitical conditions;
•   consumer dietary preferences favoring lighter, lower calorie beverages such as diet soft drinks, sports drinks and water products;
•   the increased activity of anti-alcohol groups;
•   increased federal, state, provincial and foreign excise or other taxes on beverage alcohol products and possible restrictions on beverage alcohol advertising and marketing;
•   increased regulation placing restrictions on the purchase or consumption of beverage alcohol products or increasing prices due to the imposition of duties or excise tax;
in addition, our continued success depends, in part, on our ability to develop new products. the launch and ongoing success of new products are inherently uncertain especially with regard to their appeal to consumers. the launch of a new product can give rise to a variety of costs and an unsuccessful launch, among other things, can affect consumer perception of existing brands and our reputation. unsuccessful implementation or short-lived popularity of our product innovations may result in inventory write-offs and other costs.
reliance on wholesale distributors, major retailers and government agencies local market structures and distribution channels vary worldwide. within our primary market in the u.s., we offer a range of beverage alcohol products across the imported beer, craft beer, branded wine and spirits categories, with separate distribution networks utilized for our imported and craft beer portfolios and our wine and spirits portfolio. in the u.s., we sell our products principally to wholesalers for resale to retail outlets including grocery stores, club and discount stores, package liquor stores and restaurants and also directly to government agencies, while in canada, we sell our products principally to government agencies. in the u.s., we have entered into exclusive arrangements with certain wholesalers that generate a large portion of our u.s. wine and spirits sales. the replacement or poor performance of our major wholesalers, retailers or government agencies could result in temporary or longer-term sales disruptions or could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition for a particular period. our inability to collect accounts receivable from our major wholesalers, retailers or government agencies could also materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
our industry is being affected by the trend toward consolidation in the wholesale and retail distribution channels, particularly in the u.s. if we are unable to adapt successfully to this changing environment, our net income, market share and volume growth could be negatively affected. in addition, wholesalers and retailers of our products offer products which compete directly with our products for retail shelf space, promotional support and consumer purchases. accordingly, wholesalers or retailers may give higher priority to products of our competitors.
reliance upon complex information systems and third party global networks we depend on information technology to enable us to operate efficiently and interface with customers and suppliers, as well as maintain financial accuracy and efficiency. if we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build and sustain the proper technology infrastructure, we could be subject to transaction errors, processing inefficiencies, the loss of customers, business disruptions, or the loss of or damage to intellectual property through security breach. we recognize that many groups on a world-wide basis have experienced increases in cyber attacks and other hacking activity. we have dedicated internal and external resources to review and address such threats. however, as with all large information technology systems, our systems could be penetrated by outside parties intent on extracting confidential or proprietary information, corrupting our information, disrupting our business processes, or engaging in the unauthorized use of strategic information about us or our employees, customers or consumers. such unauthorized access could disrupt our business operations and could result in the loss of assets or revenues, litigation, remediation costs, damage to our reputation, or the failure by us to retain or attract customers following such an event. such events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
we have outsourced various functions to third-party service providers and may outsource other functions in the future. we rely on those third-party service providers to provide services on a timely and effective basis. although we believe we have robust service level agreements with such third parties, closely monitor their performance and maintain contingency plans in case they are unable to perform as agreed, we do not ultimately control their performance. their failure to perform as expected or as required by contract could result in significant disruptions and costs to our operations, which could materially affect our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flow, and could impair our ability to make required filings with various reporting agencies on a timely or accurate basis.
in connection with the beer business acquisition, we currently have the right to receive various services pursuant to our amended transition services agreement with abi. these currently include certain limited services which are available for the time periods as set forth in that transition services agreement, which include certain raw material supplies such as glass bottles and specialty malts.
the failure of abi (or any third party that abi is permitted to outsource to) to perform as expected or as required by our contract or the glass plant joint venture's contract could result in significant disruptions and costs to our operations, and could also materially affect our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flow, and could impair our ability to make required filings with various reporting agencies on a timely or accurate basis.
various diseases, pests and certain weather conditions various diseases, pests, fungi, viruses, drought, frosts and certain other weather conditions could affect the quality and quantity of barley, hops, grapes and other agricultural raw materials available, decreasing the supply of our products and negatively impacting profitability. we cannot guarantee that our grape suppliers or our suppliers of other agricultural raw materials will succeed in preventing contamination in existing vineyards or fields or that we will succeed in preventing contamination in our existing vineyards or future vineyards we may acquire. future government restrictions regarding the use of certain materials used in growing grapes or other agricultural raw materials may increase vineyard costs and/or reduce production of grapes or other crops. growing agricultural raw materials also requires adequate water supplies. a substantial reduction in water supplies could result in material losses of grape crops and vines or other crops, which could lead to a shortage of our product supply.
climate change, or legal, regulatory or market measures to address climate change our business depends upon agricultural activity and natural resources. there has been much public discussion related to concerns that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere may have an adverse impact on global temperatures, weather patterns and the frequency and severity of extreme weather and natural disasters. severe weather events, such as drought in california or a prolonged cold winter in new york and canada, and climate change may negatively affect agricultural productivity in the regions from which we presently source our various agricultural raw materials. decreased availability of our raw materials may increase the cost of goods for our products. severe weather events or changes in the frequency or intensity of weather events can also disrupt our supply chain, which may affect production operations, insurance cost and coverage, as well as delivery of our products to wholesalers, retailers and consumers.
control by the sands family our class b common stock is principally held by members of the sands family, either directly or through entities controlled by members of the sands family. holders of class a common stock are entitled to one vote per share and holders of class b common stock are entitled to 10 votes per share. holders of class 1 common stock generally do not have voting rights. the stock ownership of the sands family and entities controlled by members of the sands family represents a majority of the combined voting power of all classes of our common stock as of april 19, 2016, voting as a single class. as a result, the sands family has the power to elect a majority of our directors and approve actions requiring the approval of the stockholders of the company voting as a single class.
import and excise duties or other taxes or government regulations, including significant additional labeling or warning requirements or limitations in the marketing or sale of our products the u.s., canada and other countries in which we operate impose import and excise duties and other taxes on beverage alcohol products in varying amounts which are subject to change. significant increases in import and excise duties or other taxes on beverage alcohol products could materially and adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations. the u.s. federal budget and individual state, provincial or local municipal budget deficits could result in increased taxes on our products, business, customers or consumers. various proposals to increase taxes on beverage alcohol products have been made at the federal and state or provincial level in recent years. many u.s. states have considered proposals to increase, and some of these states have increased, state alcohol excise taxes. there may be further consideration by federal, state, provincial, local and foreign governmental entities to increase taxes upon beverage alcohol products as governmental entities explore available alternatives for raising funds during the current macroeconomic climate.
in addition, federal, state, provincial, local and foreign governmental agencies extensively regulate the beverage alcohol products industry concerning such matters as licensing, warehousing, trade and pricing practices, permitted and required labeling, advertising and relations with wholesalers and retailers. certain federal, state or provincial regulations also require warning labels and signage. new or revised regulations or increased licensing fees, requirements or taxes could also have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. additionally, various jurisdictions may seek to adopt significant additional product labeling or warning requirements or limitations on the marketing or sale of our products as a result of what they contain or allegations that they cause adverse health effects. if these types of requirements become applicable to one or more of our major products under current or future environmental or health laws or regulations, they may inhibit sales of such products.
damage to our reputation maintaining a good reputation is critical to selling our branded products. product contamination or tampering or the failure to maintain our standards for product quality, safety and integrity, including with respect to raw materials, naturally occurring compounds, packaging materials or product components obtained from suppliers, may reduce demand for our products or cause production and delivery disruptions. although we maintain standards for the materials and product components we receive from our suppliers, and we also audit our suppliers' compliance with our standards, it is possible that a supplier may not provide materials or product components which meet our required standards or may falsify documentation associated with the fulfillment of those requirements. if any of our products becomes unsafe or unfit for consumption, is misbranded or causes injury, we may have to engage in a product recall and/or be subject to liability and incur additional costs. a widespread product recall, multiple product recalls, or a significant product liability judgment could cause our products to be unavailable for a period of time, which could further reduce consumer demand and brand equity. our reputation could be impacted negatively by public perception, adverse publicity (whether or not valid), negative comments in social media, or our responses relating to:
•   a perceived failure to maintain high ethical, social and environmental standards for all of our operations and activities;
•   a perceived failure to address concerns relating to the quality, safety or integrity of our products;
•   our environmental impact, including use of agricultural materials, packaging, water and energy use, and waste management; or
failure to comply with local laws and regulations, to maintain an effective system of internal controls, to provide accurate and timely financial statement information, or to protect our information systems against service interruptions, misappropriation of data or breaches of security, could also hurt our reputation. damage to our reputation or loss of consumer confidence in our products for any of these or other reasons could result in decreased demand for our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation, competitive position and brand equity.
contamination the success of our brands depends upon the positive image that consumers have of those brands. contamination, whether arising accidentally or through deliberate third-party action, or other events that harm the integrity or consumer support for our brands, could adversely affect their sales. contaminants in raw materials, packaging materials or product components purchased from third parties and used in the production of our beer, wine or spirits products or defects in the fermentation or distillation process could lead to low beverage quality as well as illness among, or injury to, consumers of our products and may result in reduced sales of the affected brand or all of our brands.
dependence upon trademarks and proprietary rights, failure to protect our intellectual property rights our future success depends significantly on our ability to protect our current and future brands and products and to defend our intellectual property rights. we have been granted numerous trademark registrations covering our brands and products and have filed, and expect to continue to file, trademark applications seeking to protect newly-developed brands and products. we cannot be sure that trademark registrations will be issued with respect to any of our trademark applications. there is also a risk that we could, by omission, fail to timely renew or protect a trademark or that our competitors will challenge, invalidate or circumvent any existing or future trademarks issued to, or licensed by, us.
cost of energy or environmental regulatory compliance we have experienced increases in energy costs in the past, and energy costs could rise in the future, which would result in higher transportation, freight and other operating costs. we may experience significant future increases in the costs associated with environmental regulatory compliance, including fees, licenses, and the cost of capital improvements to our operating facilities in order to meet environmental regulatory requirements. our future operating expenses and margins will be dependent on our ability to manage the impact of cost increases. we cannot guarantee that we will be able to pass along increased energy costs or increased costs associated with environmental regulatory compliance to our customers through increased prices.
in addition, we may be party to various environmental remediation obligations arising in the normal course of our business or in connection with historical activities of businesses we acquire. due to regulatory complexities, uncertainties inherent in litigation and the risk of unidentified contaminants in our current and former properties, the potential exists for remediation, liability and indemnification costs to differ materially from the costs that we have estimated. we cannot assure you that our costs in relation to these matters will not exceed our projections or otherwise have an adverse effect upon our business reputation, financial condition or results of operations.
intangible assets, such as goodwill and trademarks we continue to have a significant amount of intangible assets such as goodwill and trademarks and may acquire more intangible assets in the future. intangible assets are subject to a periodic impairment evaluation under applicable accounting standards. the write-down of any of these intangible assets could materially and adversely affect our net income.
benefit cost increases and labor relations our profitability is affected by employee medical costs and other employee benefits. in recent years, employee medical costs have increased due to factors such as the increase in health care costs in the u.s. these factors, plus the enactment of the patient protection and affordable care act in march 2010, are expected to continue to put pressure on our business and financial performance due to higher employee benefit costs. although we actively seek to control increases in employee benefit costs and encourage employees to maintain healthy lifestyles to reduce future potential medical costs, there can be no assurance that we will succeed in limiting future cost increases. continued employee benefit cost increases could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
we believe our subsidiaries have good working relations with their employees. however, if their employees were to engage in a strike or other work stoppage, they could experience an operational disruption and/or experience higher on-going labor costs which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
class action or other litigation relating to alcohol abuse, the misuse of alcohol, product liability, or marketing or sales practices there has been public attention directed at the beverage alcohol industry, which we believe is due to concern over problems related to harmful use of alcohol, including drinking and driving, underage drinking and health consequences from the misuse of alcohol. we also could be exposed to lawsuits relating to product liability or marketing or sales practices. adverse developments in lawsuits concerning these types of matters or a significant decline in the social acceptability of beverage alcohol products that may result from lawsuits could have a material adverse effect on our business.

•   critical accounting estimates. this section identifies those accounting policies that are considered important to our results of operations and financial condition, require significant judgment and involve significant management estimates. our significant accounting policies, including those considered to be critical accounting policies, are summarized in note 1 of the notes to the financial statements.
overview we are a leading international beverage alcohol company with a broad portfolio of consumer-preferred high-end imported and craft beer brands, premium wine and spirits brands and other select beverage alcohol products. we are the third-largest producer and marketer of beer for the u.s. market and the world's leading premium wine company. we are the largest multi-category supplier of beverage alcohol in the u.s., the leading producer and marketer of wine in canada, and a leading supplier of wine from new zealand and italy to our core north american markets.
our internal management financial reporting consists of two business divisions:  (i)  beer and (ii)  wine and spirits, and we report our operating results in three segments:  (i)  beer, (ii)  wine and spirits, and (iii)  corporate operations and other. in the beer segment, our portfolio consists of high-end imported and craft beer brands. we have an exclusive perpetual brand license to import, market and sell in the u.s. our mexican beer portfolio. in the
wine and spirits segment, we sell a large number of wine brands across all categories - table wine, sparkling wine and dessert wine - and across all price points - popular, premium and luxury categories, primarily within the $5 to $25 price range at u.s. retail - complemented by certain premium spirits brands. amounts included in the corporate operations and other segment consist of costs of executive management, corporate development, corporate finance, human resources, internal audit, investor relations, legal, public relations and information technology. the amounts included in the corporate operations and other segment are general costs that are applicable to the consolidated group and are therefore not allocated to the other reportable segments. all costs reported within the corporate operations and other segment are not included in our chief operating decision maker's evaluation of the operating income performance of the other reportable segments. the business segments reflect how our operations are managed, how resources are allocated, how operating performance is evaluated by senior management and the structure of our internal financial reporting.
strategy our business strategy in the beer segment focuses on strengthening our position in the high-end of the u.s. beer market, and includes the following:
•   continued focus on growing our mexican beer portfolio in the u.s. through expanding distribution for key brands, as well as new product development and innovation within the existing portfolio of brands;
•   completion of the required expansion of our nava brewery from 10 million hectoliters production capacity to 20 million hectoliters production capacity by december 31, 2016, with a goal to complete the expansion in june 2016;
•   completion of an additional 7.5 million hectoliters production capacity expansion of the nava brewery, from 20 million to 25 million by summer of calendar 2017 and from 25 million to 27.5 million by early calendar 2018;
see "expansions and acquisitions" below for additional discussion regarding certain of these activities.
our business strategy in the wine and spirits segment is centered on continued focus on consumer-preferred premium wine brands, complemented by premium spirits. in this segment, we continue to focus on the premiumization of our branded wine and spirits portfolio. in markets where it is feasible, we have a consolidated u.s. distribution network in order to obtain dedicated distributor selling resources which focus on our u.s. wine and spirits portfolio to drive organic growth. this consolidated u.s. distribution network currently represents about 70% of our branded wine and spirits volume in the u.s. throughout the terms of these contracts, we generally expect shipments on an annual basis to these distributors to essentially equal the distributors' shipments to retailers. in addition, we dedicate a large share of our sales and marketing resources to our u.s. focus brands as they represent a majority of our u.s. wine and spirits revenue and profitability, and generally have strong positions in their respective price categories.
marketing, sales and distribution of our products are managed on a geographic basis in order to fully leverage leading market positions. in addition, market dynamics and consumer trends vary across each of our markets. within our primary market in the u.s., we offer a range of beverage alcohol products across the imported beer, craft beer, branded wine and spirits categories, with separate distribution networks utilized for our imported and craft beer portfolio and our wine and spirits portfolio. within our next largest market, canada, we offer a range of beverage alcohol products primarily across the branded wine category. the environment for our products is competitive in each of our markets.
we remain committed to our long-term financial model of growing sales, expanding margins and increasing cash flow in order to achieve earnings per share growth, reduce borrowings and pay quarterly cash dividends.
recent developments potential canadian wine business initial public offering in april 2016, we announced our plan to evaluate the merits of executing an initial public offering for a portion of our canadian wine business in order to create better visibility to this business and additional capital to develop higher growth, higher margin opportunities across our businesses. a decision regarding whether to pursue a potential initial public offering is expected to be made during calendar 2016.
prisoner acquisition in april 2016, we signed a definitive agreement to acquire prisoner for approximately $285 million, subject to customary closing conditions and adjustments. this acquisition, which includes a portfolio of five fast-growing, higher-margin, super-luxury wine brands, aligns with our portfolio premiumization strategy and strengthens our position in the super-luxury wine category. the results of operations of prisoner will be reported in the wine and spirits segment and will be included in our consolidated results of operations from the date of acquisition.
expansions and acquisitions beer segment construction of mexicali brewery in january 2016, we announced details related to the construction of the mexicali brewery. initially, the mexicali brewery will be built to provide 10 million hectoliters production capacity with the ability to scale to 20 million hectoliters in the future. we expect to complete construction of the 10 million hectoliters production capacity by calendar year-end 2020, with the first 5 million hectoliters production capacity expected to be completed by calendar year-end 2019.
ballast point acquisition in december 2015, we acquired ballast point for $998.5 million, net of cash acquired. the transaction primarily included the acquisition of goodwill, trademarks and property, plant and equipment. this acquisition provides us with a high-growth premium platform that will enable us to compete in the fast-growing craft beer category, further strengthening our position in the high-end u.s. beer market. the results of operations of ballast point are reported in the beer segment and have been included in our consolidated results of operations from the date of acquisition.
glass production plant acquisition in december 2014, we completed the formation of an equally-owned joint venture with owens-illinois, the world's largest glass container manufacturer, and the acquisition of a state-of-the-art glass production plant that is located adjacent to our nava brewery in mexico. the joint venture owns and operates the glass production plant which provides bottles exclusively for our nava brewery. the glass production plant currently has one operational glass furnace and plans are in place to expand it to four furnaces by early calendar 2018. when fully operational with four furnaces, this facility is expected to supply approximately 50% of our glass requirements for the nava brewery. we have determined that we are the primary beneficiary of this vie and accordingly, the results of operations of the joint venture are reported in the beer segment and have been included in our consolidated results of operations from the date of acquisition. in addition, we also purchased a high-density warehouse, land and rail infrastructure at the same site.
beer business acquisition in june 2013, we completed the beer business acquisition for an aggregate purchase price of $5,226.4 million. the beer business acquisition resulted in the acquisition of:
•   the remaining 50% equity interest in crown imports;
•   all of the equity interests of a company which owns and operates the nava brewery and of a company which provides personnel and services for the operation and maintenance of the nava brewery; and
•   an irrevocable, fully-paid license to produce in mexico (or worldwide under certain circumstances) and exclusively import, market and sell modelo's mexican beer portfolio sold in the u.s. and guam as of the date of the acquisition, and certain extensions.
the beer business acquisition positioned us as the third-largest producer and marketer of beer for the u.s. market and the largest multi-category supplier of beverage alcohol in the u.s.
in connection with the beer business acquisition, we are required to build out and expand the nava brewery from 10 million hectoliters to a nominal capacity of at least 20 million hectoliters of packaged beer annually by december 31, 2016. in addition, an interim supply agreement and a transition services agreement were entered into in association with the beer business acquisition. the interim supply agreement obligates the supplier to provide us with a supply of product not produced by the nava brewery and the transition services agreement provided for certain specified services and production materials, both for a specified period of time. the associated agreements provide, among other things, that the united states will have approval rights, in its sole discretion, for amendments or modifications to the associated agreements as well as a right of approval, in its sole discretion, of any extension of the term of the interim supply agreement beyond three years. while we remain on track with all nava brewery expansion activity, we have extended the interim supply agreement in order to support the robust growth levels of our mexican beer portfolio and continue a smooth transition as we ramp up incremental capacity. this agreement is expected to continue through june 2017.
the results of operations of the beer business acquisition are reported in the beer segment and are included in our consolidated results of operations from the date of acquisition. it is a significant acquisition that has had and will continue to have a material impact on our future results of operations, financial position and cash flows.
in october 2014, we announced an incremental 5 million hectoliter expansion of our nava brewery that will increase production capacity from 20 million hectoliters to 25 million hectoliters when completed. we currently expect this incremental expansion to be completed by the summer of calendar 2017.
in january 2016, we announced an additional incremental 2.5 million hectoliter expansion of our nava brewery that will increase production capacity to 27.5 million hectoliters when completed. we currently expect this incremental expansion to be completed by early calendar 2018.
wine and spirits segment meiomi acquisition in august 2015, we acquired meiomi, which primarily included the acquisition of the meiomi trademark, related inventories and certain grape supply contracts. the acquisition of this higher-margin, luxury growth brand has complemented our existing portfolio and further strengthened our position in the u.s. pinot noir category. the results of operations of meiomi are reported in the wine and spirits segment and are included in our consolidated results of operations from the date of acquisition.
for additional information on these acquisitions, refer to note 2 of the notes to the financial statements.
results of operations references to organic throughout the following discussion exclude the impact of (i)  beer acquired in the acquisition of ballast point (on a consolidated and segment basis), (ii)  branded wine acquired in the acquisition of meiomi (on a consolidated and segment basis) and (iii)  beer acquired in the beer business acquisition on a consolidated basis, as appropriate. prior to the beer business acquisition, the results of operations of the beer segment were eliminated in consolidation as our preexisting 50% equity interest in crown imports was accounted for under the equity method of accounting.
financial highlights financial highlights for fiscal 2016:
•   our beer segment continued to drive improvement within our results of operations, combined with improvement in the wine and spirits segment.
•   our net sales increased 9% primarily due to strong consumer demand within the mexican beer portfolio and net sales of branded wine acquired in the acquisition of meiomi.
•   operating income increased 18% primarily due to strong consumer demand within the mexican beer portfolio, lower cost of product sold across all segments and benefits from the acquisition of meiomi, partially offset by increased marketing spend.
•   net income attributable to cbi and diluted net income per common share attributable to cbi increased 26% and 24%, respectively, primarily due to the items discussed above, combined with higher earnings from unconsolidated investments and lower interest expense.
comparable adjustments management excludes items that affect comparability from its evaluation of the results of each operating segment as these comparable adjustments are not reflective of core operations of the segments. segment operating performance and segment management compensation are evaluated based on core segment operating income (loss). as such, the performance measures for incentive compensation purposes for segment management do not include the impact of these items.
as more fully described herein and in the related notes to the financial statements, the comparable adjustments that impacted comparability in our results for each period are as follows:

cost of product sold undesignated commodity derivative contracts net gain (loss) on undesignated commodity derivative contracts represents a net gain (loss) from the changes in fair value of undesignated commodity derivative contracts. the net gain (loss) is reported outside of segment operating results until such time that the underlying exposure is recognized in the segment operating results. at settlement, the net gain (loss) from the changes in fair value of the undesignated commodity derivative contracts is reported in the appropriate operating segment, allowing the results of our operating segments to reflect the economic effects of the commodity derivative contracts without the resulting unrealized mark to fair value volatility.
favorable interim supply agreement in connection with the beer business acquisition, a temporary supply agreement was negotiated under a favorable pricing arrangement for the required volume of beer needed to fulfill expected u.s. demand in excess of the nava brewery's capacity. amortization of favorable interim supply agreement reflects amounts associated with non-nava brewery product purchased from the date of acquisition which has been sold to our u.s. customers during the respective period.
inventory step-up in connection with acquisitions, the allocation of purchase price in excess of book value for certain inventory on hand at the date of acquisition is referred to as inventory step-up. inventory step-up represents an assumed manufacturing profit attributable to the acquired company prior to acquisition. flow through of inventory step-up was primarily associated with the meiomi acquisition (fiscal 2016) and the beer business acquisition (fiscal 2014).
selling, general and administrative expenses restructuring and related charges restructuring and related charges consist primarily of employee termination benefit costs recognized in connection with our plan initiated in may 2015 to streamline and simplify processes, and shift resources and investment to long-term, profitable growth opportunities across the business (fiscal 2016).
transaction, integration and other acquisition-related costs transaction, integration and other acquisition-related costs were primarily associated with the june 2013 beer business acquisition (fiscal 2016, fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2014) and the december 2014 glass production plant acquisition (fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015), and the august 2015 meiomi acquisition (fiscal 2016).
other gains (losses)
other gains (losses) consist primarily of a gain from an adjustment to a certain guarantee originally recorded in connection with a prior divestiture (fiscal 2015), a net gain on the sale of and the write-down of certain property, plant and equipment (fiscal 2015), and a prior period correction of previously unrecognized deferred compensation costs that were associated with certain employment agreements (fiscal 2014).
impairment of goodwill and intangible assets impairment losses consist of impairments of goodwill and certain trademarks related to our wine and spirits' canadian reporting unit.
gain on remeasurement to fair value of equity method investment prior to the beer business acquisition, we accounted for our investment in crown imports under the equity method of accounting. in applying the acquisition method of accounting, our preexisting 50% equity interest was remeasured to its estimated fair value resulting in the recognition of a gain in connection with the beer business acquisition.
earnings (losses) from unconsolidated investments earnings from unconsolidated investments consist of dividend income from a retained interest in a previously divested business (fiscal 2016).

total wine and spirits       2,925.8                 2,839.4                 3       %
net sales increased $520.4 million due to increases in beer's net sales of $434.0 million (driven predominately by volume growth within our mexican beer portfolio) and wine and spirits' net sales of $86.4 million (due largely to net sales of branded wine acquired in the acquisition of meiomi).
the increase in beer's net sales is primarily due to (i)  the volume growth within our mexican beer portfolio, which benefited from continued consumer demand and increased marketing spend; (ii)  a favorable impact from pricing in select markets and (iii)  net sales of beer acquired in the acquisition of ballast point of $27.2 million.

(1)   depletions represent distributor shipments of our respective branded products to retail customers, based on third-party data, including acquired brands from the date of acquisition and for the comparable prior year period.
the increase in wine and spirits' net sales is primarily due to (i)  net sales of branded wine acquired in the acquisition of meiomi of $73.8 million, (ii)  organic branded wine and spirits volume growth (due partly to the overlap of a planned reduction in inventory levels by one of our exclusive distributors in the u.s. for fiscal 2015); and (iii)  favorable product mix shift (predominantly within the u.s. organic branded wine portfolio); partially offset by (i)  an unfavorable year-over-year foreign currency translation impact and (ii)  the unfavorable overlap of the recognition of a contractually required payment for fiscal 2015 from the distributor noted above equal to the approximate profit lost on the reduced sales associated with the inventory reduction.
gross profit fiscal 2016         fiscal 2015          % increase
wine and spirits                1,235.0             1,172.3                 5       %
consolidated gross profit      $2,942.3            $2,578.6                14       %
gross profit increased $363.7 million primarily due to increases in beer of $310.2 million and wine and spirits of $62.7 million. the increase in beer is primarily due to (i)  the volume growth within our mexican beer portfolio, (ii)  the favorable impact from pricing in select markets and (iii)  lower organic cost of product sold. the increase in wine and spirits is primarily due to (i)  branded wine acquired in the acquisition of meiomi, (ii)  lower organic cost of product sold and (iii)  higher organic branded wine volume; partially offset by the unfavorable year-over-year foreign currency translation impact.
gross profit as a percent of net sales increased to 44.9% for fiscal 2016 compared with 42.8% for fiscal 2015 primarily due to (i)  lower beer and wine and spirits' cost of product sold, (ii)  the favorable impact from beer pricing in select markets and (iii)  the acquisitions of meiomi and ballast point.
wine and spirits                                                  508.0                   498.0                 2       %
selling, general and administrative expenses increased $98.8 million primarily due to increases in beer of $63.9 million, corporate operations and other of $16.4 million and wine and spirits of $10.0 million.
the increases in beer and wine and spirits are both primarily attributable to an increase in marketing spend due largely to planned investment behind our mexican beer and branded wine and spirits portfolios. the increase in corporate operations and other is due to higher general and administrative expenses primarily attributable to (i)  an increase in compensation and benefits driven primarily by higher annual management incentive compensation expense and an increase in employer payroll taxes related to employee equity award exercise activity during fiscal 2016, and (ii)  higher consulting and information technology expenses supporting the growth of the business.
selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of net sales remained relatively flat at 18.0% for fiscal 2016 as compared to 17.9% for fiscal 2015.
wine and spirits                       727.0         674.3                           8       %
operating income increased $264.9 million primarily due to increases in beer and wine and spirits of $246.3 million and $52.7 million, respectively. the increases for both segments are primarily attributable to (i)  organic volume growth and lower cost of product sold and (ii)  benefits from the acquisitions of meiomi (wine and spirits) and ballast point (beer), partially offset by increased marketing spend supporting the growth of the businesses.
earnings from unconsolidated investments earnings from unconsolidated investments increased to $51.1 million for fiscal 2016 from $21.5 million for fiscal 2015, an increase of $29.6 million. this increase is primarily attributable to an increase in comparable adjustments for fiscal 2016.
interest expense interest expense decreased to $313.9 million for fiscal 2016 from $337.7 million for fiscal 2015, a decrease of $23.8 million, or (7%). this decrease was primarily due to lower average interest rates.
provision for income taxes our effective tax rate for fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015 was 29.3% and 29.1%, respectively. for fiscal 2016, our effective tax rate was lower than the federal statutory rate of 35% primarily due to a decrease in uncertain tax positions and lower effective tax rates applicable to our foreign businesses. for fiscal 2015, our effective tax rate was lower than the federal statutory rate primarily due to lower effective tax rates applicable to our foreign businesses.
for additional information, refer to note 12 of the notes to the financial statements.
we expect our effective tax rate for the next fiscal year to be in the range of 28% to 31%. we continue to assess whether certain earnings of foreign subsidiaries may be permanently reinvested.
net income attributable to cbi as a result of the above factors, net income attributable to cbi increased to $1,054.9 million for fiscal 2016 from $839.3 million for fiscal 2015, an increase of $215.6 million, or 26%.

net sales increased $1,160.3 million primarily due to $941.1 million of net sales of products acquired in the beer business acquisition, combined with organic volume growth within our mexican beer portfolio.
net sales for beer increased $353.0 million primarily due to volume growth within our mexican beer portfolio which benefited from continued consumer demand and increased advertising spend, combined with a favorable impact from pricing in select markets. in addition, fiscal 2015 net sales were favorably impacted by increased shipment volumes in connection with a return of wholesaler inventories in the u.s. to more historic levels.
in august 2014, we announced a voluntary product recall of select packages in the u.s. and guam containing 12-ounce clear glass bottles of our corona extra beer that may contain small particles of glass (the "product recall"). the product recall was a precautionary step after routine inspections in our quality control laboratory detected defects in certain bottles that could cause small particles of glass to break off and fall into the bottle. the potentially affected bottles came from a glass plant run by a third party manufacturer that supplied us with bottles. the third-party manufacturer contractually agreed to reimburse us for all costs associated with the product recall; accordingly, our results of operations for fiscal 2015 do not reflect any costs associated with the product recall.

nm = not meaningful gross profit increased $586.9 million primarily due to $443.5 million of gross profit from the beer business acquisition and organic beer growth (driven largely by the organic volume growth and the favorable impact from pricing in select markets).
beer increased $333.7 million primarily due to incremental gross profit from the brewery purchase, the volume growth and the favorable impact from pricing in select markets.
wine and spirits increased $55.2 million primarily due to (i)  the favorable product mix shift for the branded wine and spirits portfolio, (ii)  lower cost of product sold and (iii)  the distributor performance payments; partially offset by (i)  the higher promotional spend, (ii)  lower branded wine volume and (iii)  an unfavorable year-over-year foreign currency translation impact.
gross profit as a percent of net sales increased to 42.8% for fiscal 2015 compared with 40.9% for fiscal 2014 primarily due to the items discussed above, partially offset by the increase in comparable adjustments.

selling, general and administrative expenses increased $183.3 million primarily due to $134.2 million from the beer business acquisition and an increase in organic beer selling, general and administrative expenses.
beer increased $88.8 million primarily due to increases in general and administrative expenses of $44.5 million and advertising expenses of $44.1 million. the increase in general and administrative expenses is predominantly driven by higher compensation and benefit costs and higher information technology costs supporting the growth of the mexican beer portfolio, combined with an overlap of prior year foreign currency transaction gains with current year foreign currency transaction losses. the increase in advertising expenses is due largely to investment behind our mexican beer portfolio.
wine and spirits increased $18.7 million primarily due to increases in general and administrative expenses of $11.0 million and advertising expenses of $8.4 million. the increase in general and administrative expenses is predominantly attributable to higher compensation and benefit costs and higher consulting expenses supporting the wine and spirits' branded portfolio. the increase in advertising expenses is due largely to a planned investment behind our branded wine and spirits portfolio.
corporate operations and other increased $9.3 million due to higher general and administrative expenses primarily attributable to the growth of our business.
selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of net sales decreased to 17.9% for fiscal 2015 as compared with 18.4% for fiscal 2014 primarily due to the beer business acquisition and the associated lower fixed overhead and the decrease in comparable adjustments, partially offset by the increase in organic beer selling, general and administrative expenses.

operating income decreased $937.5 million primarily due to the significant decrease in comparable adjustments, partially offset by growth in our reportable segments as a result of the factors discussed above.
earnings from unconsolidated investments earnings from unconsolidated investments decreased to $21.5 million for fiscal 2015 from $87.8 million for fiscal 2014, a decrease of $66.3 million, or (76%). this decrease is primarily due to lower equity in earnings of crown imports as a result of the beer business acquisition and the consolidation of crown imports' results of operations from the date of acquisition.
interest expense interest expense increased to $337.7 million for fiscal 2015 from $323.2 million for fiscal 2014, an increase of $14.5 million, or 4%. the increase was driven largely by higher average borrowings, partially offset by a lower weighted average interest rate on outstanding borrowings, both primarily due to the issuance of the may 2013 senior notes and borrowings under our senior credit facility in connection with the financing for the beer business acquisition.
provision for income taxes our effective tax rate for fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2014 was 29.1% and 11.8%, respectively. our effective tax rate for fiscal 2015 benefited primarily from lower effective tax rates applicable to our foreign businesses. our effective tax rate for fiscal 2014 was favorably impacted by the beer business acquisition, primarily attributable to the recognition of the nontaxable gain on the remeasurement to fair value of our preexisting 50% equity interest in crown imports of $1,642.0 million, partially offset by the write-off of nondeductible goodwill of $278.7 million.
net income attributable to cbi as a result of the above factors, net income attributable to cbi decreased to $839.3 million for fiscal 2015 from $1,943.1 million for fiscal 2014, a decrease of $1,103.8 million, or (57%).
financial liquidity and capital resources general our ability to consistently generate cash flow from operating activities is one of our most significant financial strengths. our strong cash flows enable us to invest in our people and our brands, make appropriate capital investments, provide a quarterly cash dividend program, and from time-to-time, repurchase shares of our common stock and make strategic acquisitions that we believe will enhance stockholder value. our primary source of liquidity has been cash flow from operating activities. our principal use of cash in our operating activities is for purchasing and carrying inventories and carrying seasonal accounts receivable. historically, we have used cash flow from operating activities to repay our short-term borrowings and fund capital expenditures. we will continue to use our short-term borrowings, including our accounts receivable securitization facilities, to support our working capital requirements and capital expenditures.
we have maintained adequate liquidity to meet working capital requirements, fund capital expenditures and repay scheduled principal and interest payments on debt. absent deterioration of market conditions, we believe that cash flows from operating activities and financing activities, primarily short-term borrowings, will provide adequate resources to satisfy our working capital, scheduled principal and interest payments on debt, anticipated dividend payments and anticipated capital expenditure requirements for both our short-term and long-term capital needs, including (i)  our nava brewery and glass production plant expansions and (ii)  our mexicali brewery construction.

operating activities fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015
net cash provided by operating activities increased $332.7 million for fiscal 2016. this increase resulted primarily from (i)  higher cash provided by beer (largely due to strong volume growth in the mexican beer portfolio as well as a reduction in prepaid value-added taxes predominantly attributable to timing) and (ii)  lower income tax payments. the lower income tax payments within cash flows from operating activities are primarily due to an increase in tax benefits on employee equity award exercise and vesting activity, partially offset by an increase in income taxes payable largely attributable to higher taxable income driven by beer.
net cash provided by operating activities increased $254.8 million for fiscal 2015. this increase resulted primarily from an increase in cash provided by beer due largely to the timing of the prior year beer business acquisition combined with the strong growth in the mexican beer portfolio for fiscal 2015, partially offset by an increase in beer inventory levels to support the growth of the mexican beer portfolio.
investing activities fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015
net cash used in investing activities increased $1,191.5 million for fiscal 2016, primarily due to the august and december 2015 acquisitions of meiomi and ballast point, respectively.
net cash used in investing activities decreased $3,847.9 million for fiscal 2015. this decrease resulted primarily from the beer business acquisition for fiscal 2014, partially offset by increased purchases of property, plant and equipment for fiscal 2015 primarily in connection with the beer business acquisition and the associated nava brewery expansion projects.
financing activities fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015
net cash provided by financing activities increased $792.4 million for fiscal 2016, primarily from the following:
•   fiscal 2016 net proceeds from notes payable of $360.6 million compared with fiscal 2015 net proceeds from notes payable of $13.1 million;
•   fiscal 2016 excess tax benefits from stock-based payment awards of $203.4 million compared with $78.0 million for fiscal 2015 due to increased fiscal 2016 employee equity award exercise and vesting activity;
•   fiscal 2015 payment of delayed purchase price arrangement of $543.3 million in connection with the june 2013 beer business acquisition; and
•   fiscal 2015 principal payments of long-term debt for the repayment of our december 2007 senior notes of $500.0 million;
•   fiscal 2016 proceeds from issuance of long-term debt of $610.0 million primarily from the issuance of the december 2015 senior notes (used to fund a portion of the purchase price for the acquisition of ballast point) and from term loan borrowings under the 2015 credit agreement (used to fund a portion of the purchase price for the acquisition of meiomi) compared with fiscal 2015 proceeds from issuance of long-term debt of $905.0 million primarily from the issuance of the november 2014 senior notes (used primarily to redeem our december 2007 senior notes); and
net cash used in financing activities increased $3,793.4 million for fiscal 2015, primarily from the following:
•   fiscal 2015 proceeds from issuance of long-term debt of $905.0 million primarily from the issuance of the november 2014 senior notes (used primarily to redeem our december 2007 senior notes) compared with fiscal 2014 proceeds from issuance of long-term debt of $3,725.0 million from term loan borrowings under the 2013 credit agreement and the issuance of the may 2013 senior notes (used to fund a portion of the beer business acquisition);
•   fiscal 2015 principal payments of long-term debt for the repayment of the december 2007 senior notes of $500.0 million; and
•   fiscal 2015 payment of delayed purchase price arrangement of $543.3 million in connection with the june 2013 beer business acquisition;
•   fiscal 2015 proceeds from noncontrolling interests of $115.0 million in connection with the formation of a vie for which we are the primary beneficiary.
debt total debt outstanding as of february 29, 2016, amounted to $8,081.2 million, an increase of $784.7 million from february 28, 2015. this increase was due largely to the issuance of the $400.0 million december 2015 senior notes and an increase in borrowings under our revolving credit facilities of $355.9 million.
the majority of our outstanding borrowings as of february 29, 2016, consisted of fixed-rate senior unsecured notes, with maturities ranging from calendar 2016 to calendar 2025, and variable-rate senior secured term loan facilities under our 2015 credit agreement, with maturities ranging from calendar 2020 to calendar 2021.
in march 2016, we entered into the 2016 restatement agreement, which resulted in the creation of a new $700.0 million european term a-1 loan facility and an increase in the european revolving credit commitment under the revolving credit facility by $425.0 million to $1.0 billion. proceeds from borrowings under the 2016 credit agreement were used to refinance (i)  outstanding obligations under the 2015 credit agreement and (ii)  short-term borrowings under our accounts receivable securitization facilities, and for other general corporate purposes.
we had the following borrowing capacity available under our senior credit facilities and our accounts receivable securitization facilities:
remaining borrowing capacity february 29,                   april 19,
revolving credit facility      $1,042.1                    $1,133.0
cbi facility                     $145.0                      $275.0
crown facility                    $11.0                      $130.0
the financial institutions participating in our senior credit facilities and our accounts receivable securitization facilities have complied with prior funding requests and we believe such financial institutions will comply with any future funding requests. however, there can be no assurances that any particular financial institution will continue to do so.
as of february 29, 2016, we also have additional credit arrangements totaling $424.1 million, with $157.1 million outstanding under these arrangements. these arrangements primarily support the financing needs of our domestic and foreign subsidiary operations.
we have entered into various interest rate swap agreements to manage our exposure to the volatility of the interest rates associated with our variable-rate senior secured term loan facilities. as a result of these hedges, as of february 29, 2016, we have fixed our interest rates on (i)  $500.0 million of our floating libor rate debt at an average rate of 2.8% (exclusive of borrowing margins) through september 1, 2016, and (ii)  $100.0 million of our floating libor rate debt at an average rate of 1.2% (exclusive of borrowing margins) through july 1, 2020.
we and our subsidiaries are subject to covenants that are contained in our senior credit facility, including those restricting the incurrence of additional indebtedness (including guarantees of indebtedness), additional liens, mergers and consolidations, the payment of dividends, the making of certain investments, prepayments of certain debt, transactions with affiliates, agreements that restrict our non-guarantor subsidiaries from paying dividends, and dispositions of property, in each case subject to numerous conditions, exceptions and thresholds. as of february 29, 2016, the financial covenants are limited to a minimum interest coverage ratio and a maximum net debt coverage ratio, both as defined in the 2015 credit agreement. as of february 29, 2016, the minimum interest coverage ratio was 2.5x and the maximum net debt coverage ratio was 5.5x.
our indentures relating to our outstanding senior notes contain certain covenants, including, but not limited to:  (i)  a limitation on liens on certain assets, (ii)  a limitation on certain sale and leaseback transactions and (iii)  restrictions on mergers, consolidations and the transfer of all or substantially all of our assets to another person.
as of february 29, 2016, we were in compliance with all of our covenants under both our 2015 credit agreement and our indentures, and have met all debt payment obligations.
for a complete discussion and presentation of all borrowings and available sources of borrowing, refer to note 11 of the notes to the financial statements.
we currently expect to pay quarterly cash dividends on our common stock in the future, but such payments are subject to approval of our board of directors and are dependent upon our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements and other factors, including those set forth under item 1a "risk factors" of this annual report on form 10-k.

contractual obligations and commitments the following table sets forth information about our contractual obligations outstanding at february 29, 2016. it brings together data for easy reference from our balance sheet and notes to the financial statements. for a detailed discussion of the items noted in the following table, refer to notes 10, 11, 12 and 13 of the notes to the financial statements.
long-term debt (excluding unamortized debt issuance costs and unamortized discount)       7,724.6                   857.1                   1,001.1                 2,687.8                 3,178.6
other long-term liabilities (2)                                                             255.2                   111.4                      78.2                    23.3                    42.3
(1)   interest rates on long-term debt obligations range from 1.9% to 7.3% as of february 29, 2016. interest payments on long-term debt obligations include amounts associated with our outstanding interest rate swap agreements to fix libor interest rates on $600.0 million of our floating libor rate debt. interest payments on long-term debt do not include interest related to capital lease obligations or certain foreign credit arrangements, which represent approximately 0.6% of our total long-term debt, as amounts are not material.
(2)   other long-term liabilities include $17.8 million associated with expected payments for unrecognized tax benefit liabilities as of february 29, 2016, $0.6 million of which is expected to be paid in the less than one year period. the payments are reflected in the period in which we believe they will ultimately be settled based on our experience in these matters. other long-term liabilities do not include payments for unrecognized tax benefit liabilities of $12.6 million due to the uncertainty of the timing of future cash flows associated with these unrecognized tax benefit liabilities. in addition, other long-term liabilities do not include expected payments for interest and penalties associated with unrecognized tax benefit liabilities as amounts are not material. for a detailed discussion of these items, refer to note 12 of the notes to the financial statements.
(3)   total purchase obligations consist primarily of $5,412.7 million for contracts to purchase certain raw materials and supplies over the next twelve fiscal years, $784.8 million for contracts to purchase equipment and services over the next four fiscal years and $503.3 million for contracts to purchase beer finished goods over the next two fiscal years. for a detailed discussion of our purchase obligations, refer to note 13 of the notes to the financial statements.
off-balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that either have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors.
capital expenditures during fiscal 2016, we incurred $891.3 million for capital expenditures, including $800.3 million for the beer segment primarily for the mexico beer expansion projects. management reviews the capital expenditure program periodically and modifies it as required to meet current business needs. we plan to spend from $1.25 billion to $1.35 billion for capital expenditures for fiscal 2017, including from $1.15 billion to $1.25 billion for the beer segment associated primarily with the mexico beer expansion projects. the remaining amounts consist of improvements of existing operating facilities and replacements of existing equipment and/or buildings. in total, over the next five fiscal year periods, we expect to spend approximately $3 billion for capital expenditures associated with the mexico beer expansion projects. upon completion, the total spend from fiscal 2014 through fiscal 2021 for the mexico beer expansion projects is estimated to approximate $4.5 billion.
effects of inflation and changing prices our results of operations and financial condition have not been significantly affected by inflation and changing prices. we intend to pass along rising costs through increased selling prices, subject to normal
competitive conditions. there can be no assurances, however, that we will be able to pass along rising costs through increased selling prices. in addition, we continue to identify on-going cost savings initiatives.
critical accounting estimates our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note 1 of our notes to the financial statements. however, certain of our accounting policies are particularly important to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations and require the application of significant judgment by management; as a result, they are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. in applying those policies, management uses its judgment to determine the appropriate assumptions to be used in the determination of certain estimates. those estimates are based on our historical experience, our observance of trends in the industry, information provided by our customers and information available from other outside sources, as appropriate. on an ongoing basis, we review our estimates to ensure that they appropriately reflect changes in our business. our critical accounting estimates include:
•   goodwill and other intangible assets. we account for goodwill and other intangible assets by classifying intangible assets into three categories: (i) intangible assets with definite lives subject to amortization, (ii) intangible assets with indefinite lives not subject to amortization and (iii) goodwill. for intangible assets with definite lives, impairment testing is required if conditions exist that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. for intangible assets with indefinite lives and for goodwill, impairment testing is required at least annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that these assets might be impaired. we perform annual impairment tests and re-evaluate the useful lives of other intangible assets with indefinite lives at the annual impairment test measurement date of january 1 or when circumstances arise that indicate a possible impairment might exist. the guidance for goodwill impairment testing allows an entity to assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount or to proceed directly to performing the two-step impairment test. in the first step, the estimated fair value of each reporting unit is compared to the carrying value of the reporting unit, including goodwill. the estimate of fair value of the reporting unit is generally calculated based on an income approach using the discounted cash flow method supplemented by the market approach. if the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value of the reporting unit, a second step is performed to determine the amount of goodwill impairment we should record. in the second step, an implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill is determined by allocating the reporting unit's fair value to all of its assets and liabilities other than goodwill (including any unrecognized intangible assets). the resulting implied fair value of the goodwill is compared to the carrying value of the goodwill. the amount of impairment charge for goodwill is equal to the excess of the carrying value of the goodwill over the implied fair value of the goodwill. our reporting units include the beer segment and u.s., canada, new zealand and italy for the wine and spirits segment. in estimating the fair value of the reporting units, management must make assumptions and projections regarding such items as future cash flows, future revenues, future earnings and other factors. the assumptions used in the estimate of fair value are based on historical trends and the projections and assumptions that are used in current strategic operating plans. these assumptions reflect management's estimates of future economic and competitive conditions and are, therefore, subject to change as a result of changing market conditions. if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future, we may be required to record an impairment loss for these assets. the recording of any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our financial statements.
in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, we performed our annual goodwill impairment analysis. no indication of impairment was noted for any of our reporting units, as the estimated fair value of each of our reporting units with goodwill exceeded their carrying value. based on this analysis, of all of our reporting units, the reporting unit with the lowest amount of estimated fair value in excess of its carrying value was the wine and spirits' u.s. reporting unit by approximately 43%. in fiscal 2015, as a result of our annual goodwill impairment analysis, we concluded that there were no indications of
impairment for any of our reporting units. in the second quarter of fiscal 2014, we recorded an impairment loss of $278.7 million in connection with the wine and spirits' canadian reporting unit.
the most significant assumptions used in the discounted cash flows calculation to determine the estimated fair value of our reporting units in connection with impairment testing are: (i)  the discount rate, (ii)  the expected long-term growth rate and (iii)  the annual cash flow projections. as of january 1, 2016, if we used a discount rate that was 50 basis points higher or used an expected long-term growth rate that was 50 basis points lower or used annual cash flow projections that were 100 basis points lower in our impairment testing of goodwill, then the changes individually would not have resulted in the carrying value of the respective reporting unit's net assets, including its goodwill, exceeding its estimated fair value, which would indicate the potential for impairment and the requirement to measure the amount of impairment, if any.
our other intangible assets consist primarily of customer relationships and trademarks obtained through business acquisitions. customer relationships are amortized over their estimated useful lives. the trademarks that were determined to have indefinite useful lives are not amortized. the guidance for indefinite lived intangible asset impairment testing allows an entity to assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances indicates that it is more likely than not that the indefinite lived intangible asset is impaired or to proceed directly to performing the quantitative impairment test. our trademarks are evaluated for impairment by comparing the carrying value of the trademarks to their estimated fair value. the estimated fair value of trademarks is calculated based on an income approach using the relief from royalty method. the estimate of fair value is then compared to the carrying value of each trademark. if the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value of the trademark, then an impairment charge is recorded by us to reduce the carrying value of the trademark to its estimated fair value. in estimating the fair value of the trademarks, management must make assumptions and projections regarding future cash flows based upon future revenues and other factors. the assumptions used in the estimate of fair value are consistent with historical trends and the projections and assumptions that are used in current strategic operating plans. these assumptions reflect management's estimates of future economic and competitive conditions and are, therefore, subject to change as a result of changing market conditions. if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future, we may be required to record an impairment loss for these assets. the recording of any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our financial statements.
in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, we performed our annual review of indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment. no indication of impairment was noted for any of our indefinite lived intangible assets as a result of our review. no indication of impairment was noted for any of our indefinite lived intangible assets for fiscal 2015. in the second quarter of fiscal 2014, we recorded an impairment loss of $22.2 million in connection with certain trademarks associated with the wine and spirits' canadian business.
the most significant assumptions used in the relief from royalty method to determine the estimated fair value of intangible assets with indefinite lives in connection with impairment testing are:  (i)  the estimated royalty rate, (ii)  the discount rate, (iii)  the expected long-term growth rate and (iv)  the annual revenue projections. as of january 1, 2016, if we used a royalty rate that was 50 basis points lower or used a discount rate that was 50 basis points higher or used an expected long-term growth rate that was 50 basis points lower or used annual revenue projections that were 100 basis points lower in our impairment testing of intangible assets with indefinite lives, then each change individually would not have resulted in any unit of accounting's carrying value exceeding its estimated fair value.
•   accounting for promotional activities. sales reflect reductions attributable to consideration given to customers in various customer incentive programs, including pricing discounts on single transactions, volume discounts, promotional and advertising allowances, coupons and rebates. certain customer incentive programs require management to estimate the cost of those programs. the accrued liability for these programs is determined through analysis of programs offered, historical trends, expectations
regarding customer and consumer participation, sales and payment trends, and experience with payment patterns associated with similar programs that have been offered previously. if assumptions included in our estimates were to change or market conditions were to change, then material incremental reductions to revenue could be required, which could have a material adverse impact on our financial statements.
•   accounting for income taxes. we estimate our income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities and reserves for unrecognized tax benefits based upon various factors including, but not limited to, historical pretax operating income, future estimates of pretax operating income, differences between book and tax treatment of items of income and expense, and tax planning strategies. we are subject to income taxes in canada, luxembourg, mexico, new zealand, the u.s. and other jurisdictions. we recognize our deferred tax assets and liabilities based upon the expected future tax outcome of amounts recognized in our results of operations. if necessary, we record a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that they will not be realized. we believe that all tax positions are fully supported; however, we record tax liabilities in accordance with the fasb's guidance for income tax accounting. we recognize a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination. due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities. in addition, changes in existing tax laws or rates could significantly change our current estimate of our tax liabilities. these differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which they are determined. changes in current estimates, if significant, could have a material adverse impact on our financial statements.

item 1a: risk factors information in any item of this report as to which reference is made in this item 1a is incorporated by reference herein. the use of such terms as "see" or "refer to" shall be deemed to incorporate at the place such term is used the information to which such reference is made.
the companies' businesses are influenced by many factors that are difficult to predict, and that involve uncertainties that may materially affect actual operating results, cash flows and financial condition.
the companies have established an enterprise risk management program to identify, assess, manage and monitor its major business risks based on established criteria for the severity of an event, the likelihood of its occurrence, and the programs in place to control the event or reduce the impact. the companies' major risks include:
regulatory/compliance risks:
the companies are extensively regulated and are subject to penalties.    the companies' operations require numerous permits, approvals and certificates from various federal, state and local governmental agencies. state utility regulators may seek to impose substantial penalties on the utilities for violations of state utility laws, regulations or orders. in addition, the utilities' rate plans usually include penalties for failing to meet certain operating and customer satisfaction standards. see note b to the financial statements in item 8. ferc has the authority to impose penalties on the utilities and the competitive energy businesses, which could be substantial, for violations of the federal power act, the natural gas act or related rules, including reliability and cyber security rules. environmental agencies may seek penalties for failure to comply with laws, regulations or permits. the companies may also be subject to penalties from other regulatory agencies. the companies may be subject to new laws, regulations, or other requirements or the revision or reinterpretation of such requirements, which could adversely affect the companies. in april 2014, the nyspsc instituted its rev proceeding to improve system efficiency and reliability, encourage renewable energy resources, support distributed energy resources and empower customer choice. see "utility regulation" and "environmental matters - climate change and other federal, state and local environmental provisions" in item 1 and "application of critical accounting policies" in item 7.
the utilities' rate plans may not provide a reasonable return.    the utilities have rate plans approved by state utility regulators that limit the rates they can charge their customers. the rates are generally designed for, but do not guarantee, the recovery of the utilities' cost of service (including a return on equity). see "utility regulation - state utility regulation, rate plans" in item 1 and "rate plans" in note b to the financial statements in item 8. rates usually may not be changed during the specified terms of the rate plans other than to recover energy costs and limited other exceptions. the utilities' actual costs may exceed levels provided for such costs in the rate plans. state utility regulators can initiate proceedings to prohibit the utilities from recovering from their customers the cost of service (including energy costs) that the regulators determine to have been imprudently incurred (see "other regulatory matters" in note b to the financial statements in item 8). the utilities have from time to time entered into settlement agreements to resolve various prudence proceedings.
the companies may be adversely affected by changes to the utilities' rate plans.    the utilities' rate plans typically require action by regulators at their expiration dates, which may include approval of new plans with different provisions. the need to recover from customers increasing costs, taxes or state-mandated assessments or surcharges could adversely affect the utilities' opportunity to obtain new rate plans that provide a reasonable rate of return and continue important provisions of current rate plans. the utilities' current new york electric and gas rate plans include revenue decoupling mechanisms and their new york electric, gas and steam rate plans include provisions for the recovery of energy costs and reconciliation of the actual amount of pension and other postretirement, environmental and certain other costs to amounts reflected in rates. in january 2016, cecony submitted requests to the nyspsc for new rate plans for electric and gas delivery service to take effect in january 2017. see "rate plans" in note b to the financial statements in item 8.
the intentional misconduct of employees or contractors could adversely affect the companies.    the violation of laws or regulations by employees or contractors for personal gain may result from contract and procurement fraud, extortion, bribe acceptance, fraudulent related-party transactions and serious breaches of corporate policy or standards of business conduct. such intentional misconduct by employees or contractors could result in substantial liability, higher costs and increased regulatory requirements. see "employees" in item 1 and "other regulatory matters" in note b to the financial statements in item 8.
the failure of, or damage to, the companies' facilities could adversely affect the companies.    the utilities provide electricity, gas and steam service using energy facilities, many of which are located either in, or close to, densely populated public places. see the description of the utilities' facilities in item 1. a failure of, or damage to, these facilities, or an error in the operation or maintenance of these facilities, could result in bodily injury or death, property damage, the release of hazardous substances or extended service interruptions. a natural disaster such as a major storm, a heat wave or hurricane could damage facilities and the utilities may experience more severe consequences from attempting to operate during and after such events. the utilities' response to such events may be perceived to be below customer expectations. the utilities could be required to pay substantial amounts that may not be covered by the utilities' insurance policies to repair or replace their facilities, compensate others for injury or death or other damage, and settle any proceedings initiated by state utility regulators or other regulatory agencies. the occurrence of such events could also adversely affect the cost and availability of insurance. see "other regulatory matters" in note b and "manhattan steam main rupture" and "manhattan explosion and fire" in note h to the financial statements in item 8. changes to laws, regulations or judicial doctrines could further expand the utilities' liability for service interruptions. see "utility regulation - state utility regulation" in item 1.
a cyber attack could adversely affect the companies.    the utilities and other operators of critical energy infrastructure may face a heightened risk of cyber attack. in the event of a cyber attack that the companies were unable to defend against or mitigate, the companies could have their operations disrupted, financial and other information systems impaired, property damaged and customer and employee information stolen; experience substantial loss of revenues, response costs and other financial loss; and be subject to increased regulation, litigation and damage to their reputation. the companies have experienced cyber attacks, although none of the attacks had a material impact.
environmental risks:
the companies are exposed to risks from the environmental consequences of their operations.    the companies are exposed to risks relating to climate change and related matters. see "environmental matters - climate change" in item 1. cecony may also be impacted by regulations requiring reductions in air emissions. see "environmental matters - other federal, state and local environmental provisions, air quality" in item 1. in addition, the utilities are responsible for hazardous substances, such as asbestos, pcbs and coal tar, that have been used or produced in the course of the utilities' operations and are present on properties or in facilities and equipment currently or previously owned by them. see "environmental matters" in item 1 and note g to the financial statements in item 8. the companies could be adversely affected if a causal relationship between electric and magnetic fields and adverse health effects were to be established.
financial and market risks:
a disruption in the wholesale energy markets or failure by an energy supplier could adversely affect the companies.    almost all the electricity and gas the utilities sell to their full-service customers is purchased through the wholesale energy markets or pursuant to contracts with energy suppliers. see the description of the utilities' energy supply in item 1. con edison's competitive energy businesses also depend on wholesale energy markets to supply electricity to their customers. see "competitive energy businesses" in item 1. a disruption in the wholesale energy markets or a failure on the part of the companies' energy suppliers or operators of energy delivery systems that connect to the utilities' energy facilities could adversely affect the companies' ability to meet their customers' energy needs and adversely affect the companies. in addition, see "financial and commodity market risks" in item 7.
the companies have substantial unfunded pension and other postretirement benefit liabilities.    the utilities have substantial unfunded pension and other postretirement benefit liabilities. the utilities expect to make substantial contributions to their pension and other postretirement benefit plans. significant declines in the market values of the investments held to fund pension and other postretirement benefits could trigger substantial funding requirements under governmental regulations. see "application of critical accounting policies - accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits" and "financial and commodity market risks," in item 7 and notes e and f to the financial statements in item 8.
con edison's ability to pay dividends or interest depends on dividends from its subsidiaries.    con edison's ability to pay dividends on its common stock or interest on its external borrowings depends primarily on the dividends and other distributions it receives from its subsidiaries. the dividends that the utilities may pay to con edison are limited by the nyspsc to not more than 100 percent of their respective income available for dividends calculated on a two-year rolling average basis, with certain exceptions. see "dividends" in note c to the financial statements in item 8.
the companies require access to capital markets to satisfy funding requirements.    the utilities estimate that their construction expenditures will exceed $9 billion over the next three years. the utilities use internally-generated funds, equity contributions from con edison, if any, and external borrowings to fund the construction expenditures. the competitive energy businesses are investing in renewable generation and energy infrastructure projects that require funds in excess of those produced in the businesses. con edison expects to finance its capital requirements primarily through internally generated funds and the sale of its securities. changes in financial market conditions or in the companies' credit ratings could adversely affect their ability to raise new capital and the cost thereof. see "capital requirements and resources" in item 1.
the companies' strategies may not be effective to address changes in the external business environment.    the failure to identify, plan and execute strategies to address changes in the external business environment could have a material adverse impact on the companies. con edison seeks to provide shareholder value through continued dividend growth, supported by earnings growth in regulated utilities and contracted assets. changes to public policy, regulation, tax policy, customer behavior or technology could significantly impact the value of the utilities' energy delivery facilities, the competitive energy businesses' renewable and energy infrastructure projects and con edison transmission's investment in electric and gas transmission projects. such changes could
also affect the companies' opportunities to make additional investments in such assets and the potential return on the investments. see "utility regulation - state utility regulation - new york utility industry - reforming the energy vision," and "competition" in item 1.
the companies also face other risks that are beyond their control.    the companies' results of operations can be affected by circumstances or events that are beyond their control. weather directly influences the demand for electricity, gas and steam service, and can affect the price of energy commodities. terrorist or other physical attacks or acts of war could damage company facilities. economic conditions can affect customers' demand and ability to pay for service, which could adversely affect the companies.
item 7:    management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this combined management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations relates to the consolidated financial statements included in this report of two separate registrants: con edison and cecony and should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the notes thereto. as used in this report, the term the "companies" refers to con edison and cecony. cecony is a subsidiary of con edison and, as such, information in this management's discussion and analysis about cecony applies to con edison.
information in any item of this report referred to in this discussion and analysis is incorporated by reference herein. the use of terms such as "see" or "refer to" shall be deemed to incorporate by reference into this discussion and analysis the information to which reference is made.
corporate overview con edison's principal business operations are those of the utilities. con edison also owns competitive energy businesses and con edison transmission. see "the utilities," "competitive energy businesses" and "con edison transmission" in item 1, and segment financial information in note n to the financial statements in item 8 and "results of operations," below. certain financial data of con edison's businesses are presented below:

(b)   includes $(73) million or $(0.25) a share and $45 million or $0.14 a share of net after-tax mark-to-market (losses)/gains in 2014 and 2013, respectively. also includes an after-tax gain on sale of solar electric production projects of $26 million (see note q to the financial statements in item 8) in 2014. includes an after-tax charge of $1 million and $95 million or $0.32 a share relating to the lilo transactions (see "lease in/lease out transactions" in note j to the financial statements in item 8) in 2014 and 2013, respectively. also includes a tax benefit of $15 million or $0.05 a share resulting from the acceptance by the internal revenue service (irs) of the company's claim for manufacturing tax deductions in 2013.
(c)   includes $27 million or $0.09 a share, $(75) million or $(0.26) a share and $45 million or $0.14 a share of net income/(loss) in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, related to the retail electric supply business. see note u to the financial statements in item 8. these amounts reflect net after-tax mark-to-market gains/(losses) of $(1) million, $(76) million or $(0.26) a share and $45 million or $0.14 a share in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
the companies' results of operations for 2015, as compared with 2014, and for 2014, as compared with 2013, primarily reflect the performance of the rate plans of con edison's utility subsidiaries, growth in gas delivery service related to oil-to-gas conversions and the weather impact on its steam delivery service. the rate plans provide for revenues to cover expected increases in certain operating costs including depreciation and property taxes. in
addition, the results of operations reflect higher profits from the competitive energy businesses' retail electric supply business. the results of operations also include the impairment of pike assets held for sale, the gain on sale of solar electric production projects, the impact of lilo transactions and the net mark-to-market effects of the competitive energy businesses.
the following table presents the estimated effect on earnings per share and net income for 2015 as compared with 2014, and 2014 as compared with 2013, resulting from these and other major factors:
changes in rate plans                                            $0.51          $147                 $0.43            $125
changes in rate plans                                             0.04            13                  0.04              11
competitive energy businesses operating revenues less energy costs                              0.39           115                (0.34)           (100)
total competitive energy businesses (d)                           0.25            76                  0.03               6
(a)   under the revenue decoupling mechanisms in the utilities' new york electric and gas rate plans and the weather-normalization clause applicable to their gas businesses, revenues are generally not affected by changes in delivery volumes from levels assumed when rates were approved. in general, the utilities recover on a current basis the fuel, gas purchased for resale and purchased power costs they incur in supplying energy to their full-service customers (see "recoverable energy costs" in note a and "rate plans" in note b to the financial statements in item 8). accordingly, such costs do not generally affect the companies' results of operations.
(b)   these variations include a sales and use tax refund received and the gain on sale of non-utility properties of $9 million or $0.03 a share and $8 million or $0.03 a share, respectively, for the year ended december 31, 2014.
(c)   these variations include the impairment of pike assets held for sale in 2015 shown in note (a) in the results of operations table above.
(d)   these variations include the net mark-to-market effects, the gain on sale of solar electric production projects, the impact of the lilo transactions and the manufacturing tax deduction shown in note (b) in the results of operations table above.
(e)   these variations reflect certain income tax benefits for con edison (parent company) of $7 million or $0.02 a share and $16 million or $0.06 a share for the years ended december 31, 2015 and december 31, 2013, respectively.
the companies' other operations and maintenance expenses for the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 were as follows:
pensions and other postretirement benefits           364      467      485
health care and other benefits                       159      149      133

(a)   revenues from electric sales are subject to a revenue decoupling mechanism, as a result of which, delivery revenues generally are not affected by changes in delivery volumes from levels assumed when rates were approved.
(b)   "residential/religious" generally includes single-family dwellings, individual apartments in multi-family dwellings, religious organizations and certain other not-for-profit organizations.
(c)   other electric operating revenues generally reflect changes in regulatory assets and liabilities in accordance with the revenue decoupling mechanism and other provisions of the company's rate plans. see note b to the financial statements in item 8.
(d)   after adjusting for variations, principally weather and billing days, electric delivery volumes in cecony's service area decreased 0.9 percent in 2015 compared with 2014.
operating revenues decreased $265 million in 2015 compared with 2014 due primarily to lower purchased power expenses ($352 million) and lower fuel expenses ($62 million), offset in part by higher revenues from the electric rate plan ($156 million).
purchased power expenses decreased $352 million in 2015 compared with 2014 due to a decrease in unit costs ($381 million), offset by an increase in purchased volumes ($29 million).
fuel expenses decreased $62 million in 2015 compared with 2014 due to lower unit costs ($69 million), offset by higher sendout volumes from the company's electric generating facilities ($7 million).
other operations and maintenance expenses decreased $11 million in 2015 compared with 2014 due primarily to lower pension costs ($85 million), offset in part by an increase in the surcharges for assessments and fees that are collected in revenues from customers ($44 million) and higher electric operating costs ($23 million).
depreciation and amortization increased $39 million in 2015 compared with 2014 due primarily to higher electric utility plant balances.
taxes, other than income taxes increased $35 million in 2015 compared with 2014 due primarily to higher property taxes ($31 million) and a sales and use tax refund received in 2014 ($12 million), offset in part by the elimination of the new york city subsidiary capital tax ($6 million) and lower state and local revenue taxes ($3 million).

liquidity and capital resources the companies' liquidity reflects cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, as shown on their respective consolidated statement of cash flows and as discussed below.
the principal factors affecting con edison's liquidity are its investments in the utilities and the competitive energy businesses, the dividends it pays to its shareholders and the dividends it receives from the utilities and cash flows from financing activities discussed below.
the principal factors affecting cecony's liquidity are its cash flows from operating activities, cash used in investing activities (including construction expenditures), the dividends it pays to con edison and cash flows from financing activities discussed below.
the companies generally maintain minimal cash balances and use short-term borrowings to meet their working capital needs and other cash requirements. the companies repay their short-term borrowings using funds from long-term financings and operating activities. the utilities' cost of capital, including working capital, is reflected in the rates they charge to their customers.
each of the companies believes that it will be able to meet its reasonably likely short-term and long-term cash requirements. see "the companies require access to capital markets to satisfy funding requirements" and "the companies also face other risks that are beyond their control" in item 1a, and "capital requirements and resources" in item 1.
changes in the companies' cash and temporary cash investments resulting from operating, investing and financing activities for the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 are summarized as follows:

cash flows from operating activities the utilities' cash flows from operating activities reflect principally their energy sales and deliveries and cost of operations. the volume of energy sales and deliveries is affected primarily by factors external to the utilities, such as growth of customer demand, weather, market prices for energy, economic conditions and measures that promote distributed energy resources. under the revenue decoupling mechanisms in the utilities' new york electric and gas rate plans, changes in delivery volumes from levels assumed when rates were approved may affect the timing of cash flows but generally not net income. see note b to the financial statements in item 8. the prices at which the utilities provide energy to their customers are determined in accordance with their rate plans. in general, changes in the utilities' cost of purchased power, fuel and gas may affect the timing of cash flows but not net income because
the costs are recovered in accordance with rate plans. see "recoverable energy costs" in note a to the financial statements in item 8.
net income is the result of cash and non-cash (or accrual) transactions. only cash transactions affect the companies' cash flows from operating activities. principal non-cash charges or credits include depreciation, deferred income tax expense and amortizations of certain regulatory assets and liabilities. non-cash charges or credits may also be accrued under the revenue decoupling and cost reconciliation mechanisms in the utilities' new york electric and gas rate plans. see "rate plans - cecony- electric and gas and o&r - electric and gas" in note b to the financial statements in item 8.
net cash flows from operating activities in 2015 for con edison and cecony were $446 million and $389 million higher, respectively, than in 2014. the increase in net cash flows for con edison and cecony reflect primarily lower income taxes paid, net of refunds received in 2015 ($669 million and $585 million, respectively), offset in part by increased pension contributions ($172 million and $159 million, respectively) in 2015. the amount and timing of income tax payments and refunds received reflect, among other things, the extension of bonus depreciation tax provisions. see note l to the financial statements in item 8. for information about the companies' pension contributions, see note e to the financial statements in item 8.
net cash flows from operating activities in 2014 for con edison and cecony were $279 million higher and $213 million lower, respectively, than in 2013. the increase in net cash flows for con edison reflects primarily the decreased pension contributions ($303 million) in 2014. the decrease in net cash flows for cecony reflects higher income tax payments ($585 million) in 2014, offset in part by decreased pension contributions ($286 million) in 2014.
the change in net cash flows also reflects the timing of payments for and recovery of energy costs. this timing is reflected within changes to accounts receivable - customers, recoverable energy costs and accounts payable balances.
the changes in regulatory assets principally reflect changes in deferred pension costs in accordance with the accounting rules for retirement benefits. see notes a, b and e to the financial statements in item 8.
cash flows used in investing activities net cash flows used in investing activities for con edison and cecony were $898 million and $334 million higher, respectively, in 2015 than in 2014. the changes for con edison and cecony reflect increased utility construction expenditures in 2015 ($323 million and $316 million, respectively). in addition, the change for con edison reflects primarily increased non-utility construction expenditures related to renewable electric production projects ($312 million), the proceeds from sale relating to its solar electric production projects in 2014 ($108 million, see note q to the financial statements in item 8) and increased other investing activities ($82 million, representing primarily a note receivable related to panoche valley, see note q to the financial statements in item 8).
net cash flows used in investing activities for con edison and cecony were $100 million higher and $113 million lower, respectively, in 2014 than in 2013. for con edison, the change reflects primarily the proceeds from the termination of the lilo transactions in 2013 ($200 million) and increased investments in renewable electric production projects ($108 million), offset by proceeds from sale relating to its solar electric production projects in 2014 ($108 million, see note q to the financial statements in item 8). in addition, the changes for con edison and cecony reflect decreased utility construction expenditures in 2014.

non-utility property, less accumulated depreciation the increase in non-utility property, less accumulated depreciation, for con edison reflects the purchase of interests in, and construction expenditures for, renewable electric production projects. see "competitive energy businesses - con edison development" and "capital requirements and resources - capital requirements" in item 1.
assets held for sale and liabilities held for sale the increase in assets held for sale and liabilities held for sale reflects con edison's plan to sell the retail electric supply business of its competitive energy businesses and o&r's entry into an agreement to sell pike. see note u to the financial statements in item 8.
regulatory asset for unrecognized pension and other postretirement costs and liability for pension and retiree benefits the decrease in the regulatory asset for unrecognized pension and other postretirement costs and the liability for pension and retiree benefits reflects the amortization of accounting costs during the year. the change in the regulatory assets also reflects the final actuarial valuation of the pension and other retiree benefit plans as measured at december 31, 2015, in accordance with the accounting rules for retirement benefits. the change in the liability for pension and retiree benefits reflects in part contributions to the plans made by the utilities in 2015. see notes b, e and f to the financial statements in item 8.
deferred income taxes and investment tax credits the increase in the liability for deferred income taxes and investment tax credits reflects primarily accelerated tax deductions for plant, as well as investment tax credits primarily related to con edison's renewable electric production projects at its competitive energy businesses. see note l to the financial statements in item 8.
off-balance sheet arrangements none of the companies' interests in variable interest entities (vies) meet the sec definition of off-balance sheet arrangements. for information regarding the companies' vies, see note q to the financial statements in item 8.
regulatory matters for information about the utilities' rate plans and other regulatory matters affecting the companies, see "utility regulation" in item 1 and note b to the financial statements in item 8.
risk factors the companies' businesses are influenced by many factors that are difficult to predict, and that involve uncertainties that may materially affect actual operating results, cash flows and financial condition. see "risk factors" in item 1a.
application of critical accounting policies the companies' financial statements reflect the application of their accounting policies, which conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america. the companies' critical accounting policies include industry-specific accounting applicable to regulated public utilities and accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits, contingencies, long-lived assets, goodwill, derivative instruments and leases.
accounting for regulated public utilities the utilities are subject to the accounting rules for regulated operations and the accounting requirements of the ferc and the state public utility regulatory commissions having jurisdiction.
the accounting rules for regulated operations specify the economic effects that result from the causal relationship of costs and revenues in the rate-regulated environment and how these effects are to be accounted for by a regulated enterprise. revenues intended to cover some costs may be recorded either before or after the costs are incurred. if regulation provides assurance that incurred costs will be recovered in the future, these costs would be recorded as deferred charges or "regulatory assets" under the accounting rules for regulated operations. if revenues are recorded for costs that are expected to be incurred in the future, these revenues would be recorded as deferred credits or "regulatory liabilities" under the accounting rules for regulated operations.
the utilities' principal regulatory assets and liabilities are listed in note b to the financial statements in item 8. the utilities are each receiving or being credited with a return on all regulatory assets for which a cash outflow has been made. the utilities are each paying or being charged with a return on all regulatory liabilities for which a cash inflow has been received. the regulatory assets and liabilities will be recovered from customers, or applied for customer benefit, in accordance with rate provisions approved by the applicable public utility regulatory commission.
in the event that regulatory assets of the utilities were no longer probable of recovery, as required by the accounting rules for regulated operations, these regulatory assets would be charged to earnings. at december 31, 2015, the regulatory assets for con edison and cecony were $8,228 million and $7,603 million, respectively.
accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits the utilities provide pensions and other postretirement benefits to substantially all of their employees and retirees. con edison's competitive energy businesses also provide such benefits to certain of their employees. the companies account for these benefits in accordance with the accounting rules for retirement benefits. in addition, the utilities apply the accounting rules for regulated operations to account for the regulatory treatment of these obligations (which, as described in note b to the financial statements in item 8, reconciles the amounts reflected in rates for the costs of the benefit to the costs actually incurred). in applying these accounting policies, the companies have made critical estimates related to actuarial assumptions, including assumptions of expected returns on plan assets, discount rates, health care cost trends and future compensation. see notes a, e and f to the financial statements in item 8 for information about the companies' pension and other postretirement benefits, the actuarial assumptions, actual performance, amortization of investment and other actuarial gains and losses and calculated plan costs for 2015, 2014 and 2013.
the discount rate for determining the present value of future period benefit payments is determined using a model to match the durations of highly-rated (aa or higher by either moody's or s&p) corporate bonds with the projected stream of benefit payments.
in determining the health care cost trend rate, the companies review actual recent cost trends and projected future trends.
the cost of pension and other postretirement benefits in future periods will depend on actual returns on plan assets, assumptions for future periods, contributions and benefit experience. con edison's and cecony's current estimates for 2016 are decreases, compared with 2015, in their pension and other postretirement benefits costs of $266 million and $251 million, respectively.
the following table illustrates the effect on 2016 pension and other postretirement costs of changing the critical actuarial assumptions, while holding all other actuarial assumptions constant:
actuarial assumption                          change inassumption              pension   otherpostretirementbenefits   total
expected return on plan assets con edison                                      (0.25   )%                         $29   $2                            $31
increase in projected benefit obligation:
a 5.0 percentage point variation in the actual annual return in 2016, as compared with the expected annual asset return of 7.80 percent, would change pension and other postretirement benefit costs for con edison and cecony by approximately $38 million and $36 million, respectively, in 2017.
pension benefits are provided through a pension plan maintained by con edison to which cecony, o&r and the competitive energy businesses make contributions for their participating employees. pension accounting by the utilities includes an allocation of plan assets.
the companies' policy is to fund their pension and other postretirement benefit accounting costs to the extent tax deductible, and for the utilities, to the extent these costs are recovered under their rate plans. the companies were not required to make cash contributions to the pension plan in 2015 under funding regulations and tax laws. however, cecony and o&r made discretionary contributions to the pension plan in 2015 of $697 million and $53 million, respectively. in 2016, cecony and o&r expect to make contributions to the pension plan of $469 million and $38 million, respectively. see "expected contributions" in notes e and f to the financial statements in item 8.
accounting for contingencies the accounting rules for contingencies apply to an existing condition, situation or set of circumstances involving uncertainty as to possible loss that will ultimately be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur. known material contingencies, which are described in the notes to the financial statements, include certain regulatory matters (note b), the utilities' responsibility for hazardous substances, such as asbestos, pcbs and coal tar that have been used or generated in the course of operations (note g), and other contingencies (note h). in accordance with the accounting rules, the companies have accrued estimates of losses relating to the contingencies as to which loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated and no liability has been accrued for contingencies as to which loss is not probable or cannot be reasonably estimated.
the utilities generally recover costs for asbestos lawsuits, workers' compensation and environmental remediation pursuant to their current rate plans. changes during the terms of the rate plans to the amounts accrued for these contingencies would not impact earnings.
accounting for long-lived assets the accounting rules for property, plant and equipment require that certain long-lived assets must be tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. the carrying amount of a long-lived asset is deemed not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. under the accounting rules, an impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount is not recoverable from such cash flows, and exceeds its fair value, which approximates market value. in 2015, con edison recorded a $5 million impairment charge on pike assets held for sale. see note u to the financial statements in item 8. no impairment charges on long-lived assets were recognized in 2014 and 2013.
accounting for goodwill in accordance with the accounting rules for goodwill and intangible assets, con edison is required to test goodwill for impairment annually. see note k to the financial statements in item 8. goodwill is tested for impairment using a two-step approach. the first step of the goodwill impairment test compares the estimated fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying value, including goodwill. if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired. if the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the reporting unit, the second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any. the second step requires a calculation of the implied fair value of goodwill.
goodwill was $429 million at december 31, 2015, which consists of $406 million related to the o&r merger and $23 million related to two energy services companies acquired by con edison solutions and a gas storage company acquired by con edison development. the most recent tests, which were performed during 2015, did not require any second-step assessment and did not result in any impairment. con edison's most significant assumptions surrounding the goodwill impairment tests relate to the estimates of reporting unit fair values. the company estimated fair values based primarily on discounted cash flows and on market values for a proxy group of companies. estimates of future cash flows, projected growth rates and discount rates inherent in the cash flow estimates for the energy services companies and gas storage company may vary significantly from actual results, which could result in a future impairment of goodwill.
accounting for derivative instruments the companies apply the accounting rules for derivatives and hedging to their derivative financial instruments. the companies use derivative financial instruments to hedge market price fluctuations in related underlying transactions for the physical purchase and sale of electricity and gas and interest rate risk on certain debt securities. the utilities are permitted by their respective regulators to reflect in rates all reasonably incurred gains and losses on these instruments. see "financial and commodity market risks" below and note o to the financial statements in item 8.
where the companies are required to make mark-to-market estimates pursuant to the accounting rules, the estimates of gains and losses at a particular period end do not reflect the end results of particular transactions, and will most likely not reflect the actual gain or loss at the conclusion of a transaction. substantially all of the estimated gains or losses are based on prices supplied by external sources such as the fair value of exchange-traded futures and options and the fair value of positions for which price quotations are available through or derived from brokers or other market sources.
accounting for leases the companies apply the accounting rules for leases and other related pronouncements to their leasing transactions. in accordance with the accounting rules, con edison accounted for con edison development's two "lease in/lease out" or lilo transactions as leveraged leases. in 2013, a court disallowed tax losses claimed by con edison relating to con edison development's lilo transactions and the company subsequently terminated the transactions, resulting in charges to earnings of $95 million (after taxes of $63 million) and $1 million in 2013 and 2014, respectively. the transactions had an immaterial impact to earnings in 2015. see notes j and l to the financial statements in item 8.
financial and commodity market risks the companies are subject to various risks and uncertainties associated with financial and commodity markets. the most significant market risks include interest rate risk, commodity price risk, credit risk and investment risk.
interest rate risk the companies' interest rate risk relates primarily to variable rate debt and to new debt financing needed to fund capital requirements, including the construction expenditures of the utilities and maturing debt securities. con edison and its businesses manage interest rate risk through the issuance of mostly fixed-rate debt with varying maturities and through opportunistic refinancing of debt. con edison and cecony estimate that at december 31, 2015, a 10 percent increase in interest rates applicable to its variable rate debt would result in an increase in annual interest expense of $1 million. under cecony's current gas, steam and electric rate plans, variations in actual variable rate tax-exempt debt interest expense are reconciled to levels reflected in rates.
commodity price risk con edison's commodity price risk relates primarily to the purchase and sale of electricity, gas and related derivative instruments. the utilities and con edison's competitive energy businesses apply risk management strategies to mitigate their related exposures. see note o to the financial statements in item 8.
con edison estimates that, as of december 31, 2015, a 10 percent decline in market prices would result in a decline in fair value of $91 million for the derivative instruments used by the utilities to hedge purchases of electricity and gas, of which $82 million is for cecony and $9 million is for o&r. con edison expects that any such change in fair value would be largely offset by directionally opposite changes in the cost of the electricity and gas purchased. in accordance with provisions approved by state regulators, the utilities generally recover from customers the costs they incur for energy purchased for their customers, including gains and losses on certain derivative instruments used to hedge energy purchased and related costs. see "recoverable energy costs" in note a to the financial statements in item 8.
con edison's competitive energy businesses use a value-at-risk (var) model to assess the market price risk of their portfolio of electricity and gas commodity fixed-price purchase and sales commitments, physical forward contracts, generating assets and commodity derivative instruments. var represents the potential change in fair value of the portfolio due to changes in market prices, for a specified time period and confidence level. these businesses estimate var across their portfolio using a delta-normal variance/covariance model with a 95 percent confidence level. since the var calculation involves complex methodologies and estimates and assumptions that are based on past experience, it is not necessarily indicative of future results. var for the portfolio, assuming a one-day holding period, for the years ended december 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, was as follows:
average for the period                                    $1              $1
the competitive energy businesses compare the measured var results against performance due to actual prices and stress test the portfolio each quarter using an assumed 30 percent price change from forecast. the stress test includes an assessment of the impact of volume changes on the portfolio because the businesses generally commit to sell their customers their actual requirements, an amount which is estimated when the sales commitments are made. the businesses limit the volume of commodity derivative instruments entered into relative to their estimated sale commitments to maintain net market price exposures to their estimated sale commitments within a certain percentage of maximum and minimum exposures.
credit risk the companies are exposed to credit risk related to transactions entered into primarily for the various energy supply and hedging activities by the utilities and the competitive energy businesses. see "credit exposure" in note o to the financial statements in item 8.
investment risk the companies' investment risk relates to the investment of plan assets for their pension and other postretirement benefit plans. see "application of critical accounting policies - accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits," above and notes e and f to the financial statements in item 8. the companies' current investment policy for pension plan assets includes investment targets of 55 to 65 percent equities and 35 to 45 percent fixed income and other securities. at december 31, 2015, the pension plan investments consisted of 57 percent equity and 43 percent fixed income and other securities.
environmental matters for information concerning climate change, environmental sustainability, potential liabilities arising from laws and regulations protecting the environment and other environmental matters, see "environmental matters" in item 1 and note g to the financial statements in item 8.
impact of inflation the companies are affected by the decline in the purchasing power of the dollar caused by inflation. regulation permits the utilities to recover through depreciation only the historical cost of their plant assets even though in an inflationary economy the cost to replace the assets upon their retirement will substantially exceed historical costs. the impact is, however, partially offset by the repayment of the companies' long-term debt in dollars of lesser value than the dollars originally borrowed.
material contingencies for information concerning potential liabilities arising from the companies' material contingencies, see "application of critical accounting policies - accounting for contingencies," above, and notes b, g and h to the financial statements in item 8.

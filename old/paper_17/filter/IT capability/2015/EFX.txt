item 1a. risk factors all of the risks and uncertainties described below and the other information included in this form 10-k should be considered and read carefully.  the risks described below are not the only ones facing us.  the occurrence of any of the following risks or additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.  this form 10-k also contains forward-looking statements and estimates that involve risks and uncertainties.  our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of specific factors, including the risks and uncertainties described below.
uncertain general economic conditions could materially adversely affect us.
we and our customers continue to be sensitive to negative changes in general economic conditions, both inside and outside the u.s.  business customers use our credit information and related analytical services and data to process applications for new credit cards, automobile loans, home and equity loans and other consumer loans, and to manage their existing credit relationships. bank and other lenders' willingness to extend credit is adversely affected by elevated consumer delinquency and loan losses in a weak economy. consumer demand for credit (i.e., rates of spending and levels of indebtedness) also tends to grow more slowly or decline during periods of economic contraction or slow economic growth. high or rising rates of unemployment and interest, declines in income, home prices, or investment values, lower consumer confidence and reduced access to credit adversely affect demand for our products and services, and consequently our revenue, as consumers may continue to postpone or reduce their spending and use of credit, and lenders may reduce the amount of credit offered or available.
the loss of access to credit, employment, financial and other data from external sources could harm our ability to provide our products and services.
we rely extensively upon data from external sources to maintain our proprietary and non-proprietary databases, including data received from customers, strategic partners and various government and public record sources. this data includes the widespread and voluntary contribution of credit data from most lenders in the u.s and many other markets as well
as the contribution of data under proprietary contractual agreements, such as employers' contribution of employment and income data to the work number, financial institutions' contribution of individual financial data to ixi, telecommunications, cable and utility companies' contribution of payment and fraud data to the national cable, telecommunications and utility exchange, and financial institutions' contribution of small business borrowing information to the small business financial exchange. although historically we have not experienced material issues in this regard, our data sources could withdraw, delay receipt of or increase the cost of their data provided to us for a variety of reasons, including legislatively or judicially imposed restrictions on use, security breaches or competitive reasons. where we currently have exclusive use of data, the providers of the data sources could elect to make the information available to competitors. we also compete with several of our third-party data suppliers. if a substantial number of data sources or certain key data sources were to withdraw or be unable to provide their data, if we were to lose access to data due to government regulation, if we lose exclusive right to the use of data, or if the collection of data becomes uneconomical, our ability to provide products and services to our clients could be materially adversely impacted, which could result in decreased revenue, net income and earnings per share.  there can be no assurance that we would be able to obtain data from alternative sources if our current sources become unavailable.
our markets are highly competitive and new product introductions and pricing strategies being offered by our competitors could decrease our sales and market share or require us to enhance our products and services or reduce our prices in a manner that reduces our operating margins.
we operate in a number of geographic, product and service markets that are highly competitive. competitors may develop products and services that are superior to or that achieve greater market acceptance than our products and services. the size of our competitors varies across market segments, as do the resources we have allocated to the segments we target. therefore, some of our competitors may have significantly greater financial, technical, marketing or other resources than we do in one or more of our market segments, or overall. as a result, our competitors may be in a position to respond more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements, or may devote greater resources than we can to the development, enhancement, promotion, sale and support of products and services. moreover, new competitors or alliances among our competitors may emerge and potentially reduce our market share, revenue or margins.
we also sell our information to competing firms, and buy information from certain of our competitors, in order to sell "tri-bureau" and other products, most notably into the mortgage and direct to consumer markets. changes in prices between competitors for this information and/or changes in the design or sale of tri-bureau versus single bureau product offerings may affect our revenue or profitability.
some of our competitors may choose to sell products competitive to ours at lower prices by accepting lower margins and profitability, or may be able to sell products competitive to ours at lower prices given proprietary ownership of data, technological superiority or economies of scale. price reductions by our competitors could negatively impact our margins and results of operations and could also harm our ability to obtain new customers on favorable terms. historically, certain of our key products have experienced declines in per unit pricing due to competitive factors and customer demand. since a significant portion of our operating expenses is relatively fixed in nature due to sales, information technology and development and other costs, if we were unable to respond quickly enough to changes in competition or customer demand, we could experience further reductions in our operating margins.
if we do not introduce successful new products, services and analytical capabilities in a timely manner, our competitiveness and operating results will suffer.
we generally sell our products in industries that are characterized by rapid technological changes, frequent new product and service introductions and changing industry standards. in addition, certain of the markets in which we operate are seasonal and cyclical. without the timely introduction of new products, services and enhancements, our products and services will become technologically or commercially obsolete over time, in which case our revenue and operating results would suffer. the success of our new products and services will depend on several factors, including our ability to properly identify customer needs; innovate and develop new technologies, services and applications; successfully commercialize new technologies in a timely manner; produce and deliver our products in sufficient volumes on time; differentiate our offerings from competitor offerings; price our products competitively; anticipate our competitors' development of new products, services or technological innovations; and control product quality in our product development process.
if we experience system constraints or failures, or our customers do not modify and/or upgrade their systems to accept new releases of our products and services, our services to our customers could be delayed or interrupted, which could result in lost revenues or customers, lower margins, or other harm to our business and reputation.
we depend on reliable, stable, efficient and uninterrupted operation of our technology network, systems, and data centers to provide service to our customers. many of the services and systems upon which rely have been outsourced to third parties. in addition, many of our revenue streams are dependent on links to third party telecommunications providers. these systems and operations, and the personnel that support, service and operate these systems, could be exposed to interruption, damage or destruction from power loss, telecommunication failures, computer viruses, denial-of-service attacks, human error, fire, natural disasters, war, terrorist acts or civil unrest. we may not have sufficient disaster recovery or redundant operations in place to cover a loss or failure of systems or telecommunications links in a timely manner. any significant delay or interruption could result in lost revenues or customers, lower margins, or other significant harm to our business or reputation.
security breaches and other disruptions to our information technology infrastructure could interfere with our operations, and could compromise company, customer and consumer information, exposing us to liability which could cause our business and reputation to suffer.
in the ordinary course of business, we rely upon information technology networks and systems, some of which are managed by third parties, to process, transmit and store electronic information, and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities, including business-to-business and business-to-consumer electronic commerce and internal accounting and financial reporting systems. additionally, we collect and store sensitive data, including intellectual property, proprietary business information and personally identifiable information of our customers, employees, consumers and suppliers, in data centers and on information technology networks. the secure and uninterrupted operation of these networks and systems, and of the processing and maintenance of this information, is critical to our business operations and strategy.
despite our substantial investment in physical and technological security measures, employee training, contractual precautions and business continuity plans, our information technology networks and infrastructure or those of our third-party vendors and other service providers could be vulnerable to damage, disruptions, shutdowns, or breaches of confidential information due to criminal conduct, denial of service or other advanced persistent attacks by hackers, breaches due to employee error or malfeasance, or other disruptions during the process of upgrading or replacing computer software or hardware, power outages, computer viruses, telecommunication or utility failures or natural disasters or other catastrophic events. unauthorized access to data files or our information technology systems and applications could result in inappropriate use, change or disclosure of sensitive and/or personal data of our customers, employees, consumers and suppliers.
we are regularly the target of attempted cyber and other security threats and must continuously monitor and develop our information technology networks and infrastructure to prevent, detect, address and mitigate the risk of unauthorized access, misuse, computer viruses and other events that could have a security impact. insider or employee cyber and security threats are increasingly a concern for all large companies, including ours. although we are not aware of any material breach of our data, properties, networks or systems, if one or more of such events occur, this potentially could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. any such access, disclosure or other loss of information could subject us to litigation, regulatory fines, penalties or reputational damage, any of which could have a material effect on our cash flows, competitive position, financial condition or results of operations. our property and business interruption insurance may not be adequate to compensate us for all losses or failures that may occur. also, our third-party insurance coverage will vary from time to time in both type and amount depending on availability, cost and our decisions with respect to risk retention.
our customers and we are subject to various current governmental regulations, and could be affected by new laws or regulations, compliance with which may cause us to incur significant expenses and change our business practices, and if we fail to maintain satisfactory compliance with certain regulations, we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties.
we are subject to a number of u.s. and state and foreign laws and regulations relating to consumer privacy, data and financial protection. these regulations are complex, change frequently, have tended to become more stringent over time, and are subject to administrative interpretation and judicial construction in ways that could harm our business. foreign data protection, privacy, consumer protection and other laws and regulations are often more restrictive than those in the u.s.  there are also a number of legislative proposals pending before the u.s. congress, various state legislative bodies and foreign governments concerning data protection that could affect us.
under title x of the dodd-frank act, the cfpb has broad powers to promulgate, administer and enforce consumer financial regulations, including those applicable to us and to many of our customers.  the cfpb has oversight of the fcra, the federal regulation most directly impacting u.s. operations. the cfpb is also charged with defining "unfair, deceptive or abusive acts and practices", known as "udaap". also, where a company has violated title x of the dodd-frank act, or cfpb regulations under title x, the dodd-frank act empowers state attorneys general and state regulators to bring civil actions for the kind of cease and desist orders available to the cfpb (but not for civil penalties). during 2015, the cfpb
publicly announced 50 enforcement actions, imposing $212.8 million in civil money penalties, and ordering $1.9 billion in restitution and $636.3 million in balance reductions. we are currently the subject of investigations by state attorneys general and the cfpb as more fully described under item. 3 legal proceedings in this form 10-k.
in the u.k., we are subject to a regulatory framework which provides for primary regulation by the fca.  the fca focuses on consumer protection and market regulation as well as prudential supervision of regulated financial institutions.  the fca has significant powers, including the power to regulate conduct related to the marketing of financial products, specify minimum standards and to place requirements on products, impose unlimited fines, and to investigate organizations and individuals.  in addition, the fca is able to ban financial products for up to a year while considering an indefinite ban; it has the power to instruct firms to immediately retract or modify promotions which it finds to be misleading, and to publish such decisions.  our core credit reporting ("credit reference") and debt collections services businesses in the u.k. are subject to fca supervision and we will require certain corporate and "approved person" authorizations from the fca to carry on such businesses.  we submitted a license application for our debt collection services businesses (tdx) prior to the june 30, 2015 deadline, and expect to apply for authorization in our capacity as a credit reference agencies by the march 31, 2016 deadline. although we do not currently anticipate any issues in receiving authorization, to the extent applicable approvals are not obtained in a timely manner, or at all, we may not conduct these businesses in the u.k.
we are devoting substantial compliance, legal and operational business resources to facilitate compliance with applicable regulations and requirements. additionally, we cooperate with cfpb supervisory examinations and respond to other state and federal investigations of our business practices. any failure by us to comply with, or remedy any violations of, applicable laws and regulations could result in the curtailment of certain of our operations, the imposition of fines and penalties, and restrictions on our ability to carry on or expand our operations. in addition, because many of our products are regulated or sold to customers in various industries, we must comply with additional regulations in marketing our products.  we cannot predict the ultimate impact on our business of new or proposed cfpb, fca or other rules, supervisory examinations or government investigations or enforcement actions.
these laws and regulations (as well as actions that may be taken by legislatures and regulatory bodies in other countries) and the consequences of any violation could limit our ability to pursue business opportunities we might otherwise consider engaging in, impose additional costs on us, result in significant loss of revenue, result in significant restitution and fines, impact the value of assets we hold, or otherwise significantly adversely affect our business. see "item 1. business - government regulation" in this form 10-k.
we are regularly involved in claims, suits, government investigations, supervisory examinations and other proceedings that may result in adverse outcomes.
we are regularly involved in claims, suits, government investigations, supervisory examinations and regulatory proceedings arising from the ordinary course of our business, including actions with respect to consumer protection and data protection, including purported class action lawsuits.  such claims, suits, government investigations, and proceedings are inherently uncertain and their results cannot be predicted with certainty.  regardless of their outcome, such legal proceedings can have an adverse impact on us because of legal costs, diversion of management and other personnel, and other factors.  in addition, it is possible that a resolution of one or more such proceedings could result in reputational harm, liability, penalties, or sanctions, as well as judgments, consent decrees, or orders preventing us from offering certain features, functionalities, products, or services, or requiring a change in our business practices, products or technologies, which could in the future materially and adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.  the fcra contains an attorney fee shifting provision to provide an incentive for consumers to bring individual and class action lawsuits against a cra for violation of the fcra, and the number of consumer lawsuits (both individual and class action) against us alleging a violation of fcra and our resulting costs associated with resolving these lawsuits have increased substantially over the past several years.
we rely, in part, on acquisitions, joint ventures and other alliances to grow our business and expand our geographic reach. if we are unable to make acquisitions or successfully develop and maintain joint ventures and other alliances, our growth may be adversely impacted. in addition, the acquisition, integration or divestiture of businesses by us may not produce the expected financial or operating results.
in january 2014, we acquired the tdx, a debt placement service and debt management platform company in the united kingdom for approximately $323 million.  during 2013, we acquired trustedid, a direct-to-consumer identity protection business, and several smaller international businesses. in addition, as described in more detail in item 7, we have entered into an agreement to acquire veda, which if completed, will give us a significant presence in australia and new zealand, where we do not currently have significant operations. expected benefits, synergies and growth from these initiatives may not
materialize as planned. we may have difficulty assimilating new businesses and their products, services, technologies and personnel into our operations. we may also have difficulty integrating and operating businesses in countries and geographies where we do not currently have a significant presence. these difficulties could disrupt our ongoing business, distract our management and workforce, increase our expenses and materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. also, we may not be able to retain key management and other critical employees after an acquisition.
dependence on outsourcing certain portions of our operations may adversely affect our ability to bring products to market and damage our reputation. dependence on outsourced information technology and other administrative functions may impair our ability to operate effectively.
as part of our efforts to streamline operations and to reduce operating costs, we have outsourced various components of our application development, information technology, operational support and administrative functions and will continue to evaluate additional outsourcing. although we have implemented service level agreements and have established monitoring controls, if our outsourcing vendors fail to perform their obligations in a timely manner or at satisfactory quality levels, our ability to bring products to market and support our customers, and our reputation could suffer. any failure to perform on the part of these third-party providers could impair our ability to operate effectively and could result in lower future revenue, unexecuted efficiencies and adversely impact our results of operations and our financial condition. much of our outsourcing takes place in developing countries and, as a result, may be subject to geopolitical uncertainty.
the impact of consolidation in our customer end markets is difficult to predict and may harm our business.
the financial services, mortgage, retail and telecommunications industries to which we sell our products and services are intensely competitive and have been subject to increasing consolidation. continuation of the consolidation trends in these and other industries could result in lower average prices for the larger combined entities, lower combined purchases of our services than were purchased cumulatively by separate entities prior to consolidation or existing competitors increasing their market share in newly consolidated entities, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. we may not be able to compete successfully in an increasingly consolidated industry and cannot predict with certainty how industry consolidation will affect our competitors or us.
the demand for some of our products and services may be negatively impacted to the extent the availability of free or less expensive consumer information increases.
public or commercial, sources of free or relatively inexpensive consumer credit, credit score and other information have become increasingly available, particularly through the internet, and this trend is expected to continue.  governmental agencies in particular have increased the amount of information to which they provide free public access and these or other sources of free or relatively inexpensive consumer information from competitors or other commercial sources may reduce demand for our services, particularly in our usis and personal solutions business units.  in addition, recently there has been an increase in companies offering free or low-cost direct to consumer credit services (such as credit scores, reports and monitoring) as part of alternative business models that use such services as a means to introduce consumers to premium products and services. to the extent that our customers choose not to obtain services from us and instead rely on information obtained at no cost or relatively inexpensively from these other sources, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.
our retirement and post-retirement pension plans are subject to financial market risks that could adversely affect our future results of operations and cash flows.
we have significant retirement and post retirement pension plan assets and obligations. the performance of the financial markets and interest rates impact our plan expenses and funding obligations. significant decreases in market interest rates, decreases in the fair value of plan assets and investment losses on plan assets will increase our funding obligations, and adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows.
if our government contracts are terminated, if we are suspended from government work, or if our ability to compete for new contracts is adversely affected, our business could suffer.
we derive a portion of our revenue from direct and indirect sales to u.s., state, local and foreign governments and their respective agencies. such contracts are subject to various procurement laws and regulations, and contract provisions relating to their formation, administration and performance. failure to comply with these laws, regulations or provisions in our government contracts could result in the imposition of various civil and criminal penalties, termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, or suspension of future government contracting. if our government contracts are terminated,
if we are suspended from government work, or if our ability to compete for new contracts is adversely affected, our business could suffer.
third parties may claim that we are infringing their intellectual property and we could suffer significant litigation or licensing expenses or be prevented from selling products or services.
from time to time, third parties may claim that one or more of our products or services infringe their intellectual property rights. we analyze and take action in response to such claims on a case by case basis. any dispute or litigation regarding patents or other intellectual property could be costly and time-consuming due to the complexity of our technology and the uncertainty of intellectual property litigation and could divert our management and key personnel from our business operations. a claim of intellectual property infringement could force us to enter into a costly or restrictive license agreement, which might not be available under acceptable terms or at all, or could subject us to significant damages or to an injunction against development and sale of certain of our products or services. our intellectual property portfolio may not be useful in asserting a counterclaim, or negotiating a license, in response to a claim of intellectual property infringement. in certain of our businesses we rely on third-party intellectual property licenses and we cannot ensure that these licenses will be available to us in the future on favorable terms or at all.
third parties may infringe our intellectual property and we may suffer competitive injury or expend significant resources enforcing our rights.
our success increasingly depends on our proprietary technology. we rely on various intellectual property rights, including patents, copyrights, database rights, trademarks and trade secrets, as well as confidentiality provisions and licensing arrangements, to establish our proprietary rights. the extent to which such rights can be protected varies in different jurisdictions. if we do not enforce our intellectual property rights successfully our competitive position may suffer which could harm our operating results. our pending patent and trademark applications may not be allowed or competitors may challenge the validity or scope of our intellectual property rights. in addition, our patents, copyrights, trademarks and other intellectual property rights may not provide us a significant competitive advantage.
we may need to spend significant resources monitoring our intellectual property rights and we may or may not be able to detect infringement by third parties. our competitive position may be harmed if we cannot detect infringement and enforce our intellectual property rights quickly or at all. in some circumstances, enforcement may not be available to us because an infringer has a dominant intellectual property position or for other business reasons. in addition, competitors might avoid infringement by designing around our intellectual property rights or by developing non-infringing competing technologies. intellectual property rights and our ability to enforce them may be unavailable or limited in some countries which could make it easier for competitors to capture market share and could result in lost revenue.
economic, political and other risks associated with international sales and operations could adversely affect our results of operations.
sales outside the u.s. comprised 23% of our net operating revenue in 2015 and are expected to increase following the acquisition of veda. as, as a result, our business is subject to various risks associated with doing business internationally. we anticipate that revenue from international operations will continue to represent an increasing portion of our total revenue, particularly in anticipation of the veda acquisition. in addition, many of our employees, suppliers, job functions and facilities are located outside the u.s. accordingly, our future results could be harmed by a variety of factors including:
•   changes in specific country or region political, economic or other conditions;
•   data privacy and consumer protection regulations;
•   differing labor, intellectual property protection and technology standards and regulations;
•   business licensing requirements or other requirements relating to making foreign direct investments, which could increase our cost of doing business in certain jurisdictions, prevent us from entering certain markets, increase our operating costs or lead to penalties or restrictions;
•   difficulties associated with repatriating cash generated or held abroad in a tax-efficient manner;
•   implementation of exchange controls;
•   geopolitical instability, including terrorism and war; and
•   foreign currency changes.
we earn revenue, pay expenses, own assets and incur liabilities in countries using currencies other than the u.s. dollar, including among others the british pound, the canadian dollar, the brazilian real, the argentine peso, the chilean peso and the euro, and following the completion of the veda acquisition, the australian dollar. because our consolidated financial statements are presented in u.s. dollars, we must translate revenue, income and expenses, as well as assets and liabilities, into u.s. dollars at exchange rates in effect during or at the end of each reporting period. therefore, increases or decreases in the value of the u.s. dollar against other major currencies will affect our net operating revenues, operating income and the value of balance sheet items denominated in foreign currencies. in 2015, a general weakening of foreign currencies in countries where we have operations against the u.s. dollar had a negative impact on our results as reported in u.s. dollars.  see "segment financial results - international - latin america", "- europe", and "- canada" and "effects of inflation and changes in foreign currency exchange rates" in the management's discussion and analysis section of this form 10-k. because of the geographic diversity of our operations, weaknesses in some currencies might be offset by strengths in others over time. we generally do not mitigate the risks associated with fluctuating exchange rates, although we may from time to time through forward contracts or other derivative instruments hedge a portion of our translational foreign currency exposure or exchange rate risks associated with material transactions which are denominated in a foreign currency. the use of such hedging activities may not offset any or more than a portion of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place. accordingly, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly the strengthening of the u.s. dollar against major currencies, may materially affect our consolidated financial results.
we also have a cost method investment in a credit information company in brazil valued in brazilian reais.  economic and competition risks within brazil, and the company's ability to successfully implement its strategic and operating plans, have had an adverse financial impact on the value of our investment and could result in an additional impairment of the investment.
compliance with applicable u.s. and foreign laws and regulations, such as anti-corruption laws, tax laws, foreign exchange controls and restrictions on repatriation of earnings or other similar restraints, data privacy requirements, labor laws and anti-competition relations increases the cost of doing business in foreign jurisdictions.  although we have implemented policies and procedures to comply with these laws and regulations, a violation by our employees, contractors or agents could nevertheless occur.
a downgrade to our credit ratings would increase our cost of borrowing under our credit facility and adversely affect our ability to access the capital markets.
we have an unsecured 364-day revolving credit facility that matures november 20, 2016 and an unsecured credit facility consisting of a revolver that matures on november 21, 2020 and a term loan that matures on november 21, 2018 (the "credit facilities").  the cost of borrowing under credit facilities and our ability and the terms under which we may access the credit markets are affected by credit ratings assigned to our indebtedness by the major credit rating agencies. these ratings are premised on our performance under assorted financial metrics, such as leverage and interest coverage ratios and other measures of financial strength, business and financial risk, industry conditions, transparency with rating agencies and timeliness of financial reporting. our current ratings have served to lower our borrowing costs and facilitate access to a variety of lenders. however, there can be no assurance that our credit ratings or outlook will not be lowered in the future in response to adverse changes in these metrics caused by our operating results or by actions that we take, such as incurring additional indebtedness or by returning excess cash to shareholders through dividends or under our share repurchase program. a downgrade of our credit ratings would increase our cost of borrowing under the credit facilities, negatively affect our ability to access the capital markets on advantageous terms, or at all, negatively affect the trading price of our securities and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
changes in interest rates could adversely affect our cost of capital and net income.
rising interest rates, credit market dislocations and decisions and actions by credit rating agencies can affect the availability and cost of our funding and adversely affect our net income.
our business will suffer if we are not able to retain and hire key personnel.
our future success depends partly on the continued service of our key development, sales, marketing, executive and administrative personnel. additionally, increased retention risk exists in certain key areas of our operations that require specialized skills, such as maintenance of certain legacy computer systems, data security experts and analytical modelers. if we fail to retain and hire a sufficient number of these personnel, we will not be able to maintain or expand our business. we believe our pay levels are competitive within the regions in which we operate. however, there is also intense competition for certain
highly technical specialties in geographic areas where we continue to recruit, and it may become more difficult to retain our key employees.
changes in income tax laws can significantly impact our net income.
federal and state governments in the u.s. as well as a number of other governments around the world are currently facing significant fiscal pressures and have considered or may consider changes to their tax laws for revenue raising or economic competitiveness reasons. changes to tax laws can have immediate impacts, either favorable or unfavorable, on our results of operations and cash flows, and may impact our competitive position versus certain competitors who are domiciled in other jurisdictions and subject to different tax laws.
we are subject to a variety of other general risks and uncertainties inherent in doing business.
in addition to the specific factors discussed above, we are subject to risks that are inherent to doing business. these include growth rates, general economic and political conditions, customer satisfaction with the quality of our services, costs of obtaining insurance, changes in unemployment rates, and other events that can impact revenue and the cost of doing business.

proposed acquisition of veda group limited on november 21, 2015, we entered into a scheme implementation deed (the "agreement") to acquire veda group limited ("veda") for cash consideration of approximately $1.7 billion (2.4 billion australian dollars) and debt assumed of approximately $188.4 million (261.5 million australian dollars). we expect the transaction to close in the first quarter of 2016 and to finance the cash portion of the purchase price through a combination of cash on hand and new debt, including term loans, the 364-day revolver and commercial paper. the terms of the new debt instruments are included in note 6 to the consolidated financial statements. the agreement contains customary representations and warranties of the company and veda, as well as customary covenants and agreements, including, among others, covenants providing for veda and each of its subsidiaries to conduct its business from the date of the agreement to the closing of the transaction in the ordinary course. the implementation of this binding agreement is subject to customary closing conditions, as well as shareholder and regulatory approvals in australia and new zealand, which have been completed.
refer to item 1a "risk factors" and note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on the proposed acquisition of veda.
segment and geographic information segments. the usis segment, the largest of our four segments, consists of three product and service lines: online information solutions; mortgage solutions; and financial marketing services. online information solutions and mortgage solutions revenue is principally transaction-based and is derived from our sales of products such as consumer and commercial credit reporting and scoring, identity management, fraud detection and modeling services. usis also markets certain decisioning software services, which facilitate and automate a variety of consumer and commercial credit-oriented decisions. financial marketing services revenue is principally project and subscription based and is derived from our sales of batch credit and consumer wealth information such as those that assist clients in acquiring new customers, cross selling to existing customers and managing portfolio risk.
the international segment consists of canada, europe and latin america. canada's products and services are similar to our usis offerings, while europe and latin america are made up of varying mixes of product lines that are in our usis reportable segment. in europe and latin america, we also provide information and technology services to support lenders and other creditors in the collections and recovery management process.
in 2015, the personal solutions business in the united kingdom was consolidated into the north america personal solutions segment, which was reorganized into the personal solutions segment. additionally in 2015, the direct to consumer reseller businesses in the u.s., canada, and the united kingdom were also consolidated into the personal solutions segment. these changes were driven by an enterprise wide strategy to maximize the penetration of our products and services in our
targeted markets. we determined that market focus and operating efficiency could be further improved by reorganizing and consolidating the united states, canada and the united kingdom personal solutions and direct to consumer reseller operating activities into one segment, personal solutions.
the workforce solutions segment consists of the verification services and employer services business lines. verification services revenue is transaction-based and is derived primarily from employment and income verification. employer services revenues are derived from our provision of certain human resources business process outsourcing services that include both transaction and subscription based product offerings. these services include unemployment claims management, employment-based tax credit services and other complementary employment-based transaction services, as well as our workforce analytics business including compliance with affordable care act.
personal solutions revenue is both transaction and subscription based and is derived from the sale of credit monitoring and identity theft protection products, which we deliver electronically to consumers primarily via the internet in the u.s., canada, and the u.k. we reach consumers directly and indirectly through partners.
geographic information. we currently operate in the following countries: argentina, brazil, canada, chile, costa rica, ecuador, el salvador, honduras, mexico, paraguay, peru, portugal, the republic of ireland, spain, the u.k., uruguay, and the u.s. our operations in the republic of ireland focus on data handling, software development and customer support activities. we have an investment in the second largest consumer and commercial credit information company in brazil and offer consumer credit services in india and russia through joint ventures. of the countries we operate in, 77% of our revenue was generated in the u.s. during the twelve months ended december 31, 2015.
key performance indicators. management focuses on a variety of key indicators to monitor operating and financial performance. these performance indicators include measurements of operating revenue, change in operating revenue, operating income, operating margin, net income, diluted earnings per share, cash provided by operating activities and capital expenditures. key performance indicators for the twelve months ended december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, include the following:

business environment and company outlook demand for our services tends to be correlated to general levels of economic activity and to consumer credit activity, both enhanced by our own initiatives to expand our products and markets served, and to small commercial credit and marketing activity. in 2016, in the united states, we expect modest growth in overall economic activity and consumer credit. mortgage market originations are expected to be relatively flat to slightly down for the year. internationally, the environment continues to be challenging as various countries address their particular political, fiscal and economic issues. in addition, weaker foreign exchange rates, compared to the prior year, will negatively impact both growth in revenue and profit when reported in u.s. dollars.
over the long term, we expect that our ongoing investments in new product innovation, business execution, enterprise growth initiatives, technology infrastructure, and continuous process improvement will enable us to deliver long-term average organic revenue growth ranging between 6% and 8% with additional growth of 1% to 2% derived from strategic acquisitions
consistent with our long-term business strategy. we also expect to grow earnings per share at a somewhat faster rate than revenue over time as a result of both operating and financial leverage.

revenue for 2015 increased by 9% compared to 2014. this broad-based growth was organic, and was driven by revenue increases in mortgage, direct to consumer reseller, healthcare, government, and auto verticals. the effect of foreign exchange rates reduced revenue by $75.7 million or 3% in 2015 compared to 2014.
revenue for 2014 increased by 6% compared to 2013. the growth was driven by the acquisition of tdx in the first quarter of 2014 ("tdx acquisition") and the impact of strategic growth initiatives across our businesses. the growth was offset by the expected decline in mortgage market activity. the fourth quarter of 2014 benefited from the relative improvement in mortgage activity in the u.s., which declined in the second half of 2013 through 2014, but at a lesser rate in fourth quarter of 2014.  this expected decline reduced reported growth rates in our usis and workforce solutions business units for 2014 as compared to the same period for 2013.  the effect of foreign exchange rates reduced revenue by $34.9 million or 1% in the 2014 compared to 2013.

cost of services. cost of services increased $42.7 million in 2015 compared to the prior year. the increase in cost of services, when compared to 2014, was due to the increase in production costs driven by higher revenues, as well as increases in people costs, and to a lesser extent an increase in professional services. the effect of changes in foreign exchange rates reduced cost of services by $25.3 million.
cost of services increased $57.4 million in 2014 compared to the prior year. the increase in cost of services, when compared to 2013, was due primarily to the acquisition of tdx in the first quarter of 2014 and the 2013 acquisitions. the effect of changes in foreign exchange rates reduced cost of services by $7.7 million.
selling, general and administrative expenses. selling, general and administrative expenses increased $132.6 million in 2015 as compared to 2014.  the increase was principally due to increases in people costs, and to a lesser extent to increases in marketing expenses, professional fees, as well as litigation expenses. the increase was also due to the costs related to the realignment of internal resources of $20.7 million recorded in the first quarter of 2015. the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates decreased our selling, general and administrative expenses by $24.6 million.
selling, general and administrative expenses increased $35.9 million in 2014 as compared to 2013.  the increase was due to the impact of the tdx acquisition in the first quarter of 2014 and the 2013 acquisitions, an increase in litigation and regulatory compliance expenses, including a third quarter 2014 settlement of a legal dispute over certain software license agreements, and an increase in incentives. these increases were partially offset by decreases in marketing and professional services expenses, as well as smaller decreases in expense in various other categories. the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates decreased our selling, general and administrative expenses by $6.8 million.
depreciation and amortization. depreciation and amortization expense for 2015 were slightly lower compared to 2014, due to foreign currency fluctuations of $4.1 million.
the increase in depreciation and amortization expense in 2014, as compared to 2013, was driven by $18.5 million of incremental expense resulting from the tdx acquisition primarily related to amortization of purchased intangibles.  the tdx acquisition amortization is partially offset by certain purchased intangible assets related to the talx acquisition in 2007 that became fully amortized during the second quarter of 2013.

total company margin decreased slightly in 2014 due to a third quarter 2014 settlement of a legal dispute over certain software license agreements and increased cost of services and acquisition-related amortization expense related to the acquisition of tdx. the decrease was partially offset by a reduction in amortization of certain purchased intangible assets related to our talx corporation acquisition in 2007 that became fully amortized during the second quarter of 2013.
interest expense and other income (expense), net twelve months ended december 31,       change
interest expense decreased slightly in 2014, when compared to 2013, due to the pay-off of our 7.34% notes and 4.45% senior notes during 2014.  our consolidated debt balance increased, as compared to the prior year, as a result of commercial paper issued to fund the majority of the acquisition price of tdx.  the decrease in the average cost of debt for 2014 is due to the pay-off of our 7.34% notes and 4.45% senior notes and additional low rate commercial paper outstanding on average, which caused the average cost of debt to decrease as compared to the prior year.
the increase in other income (expense), net, in 2015 is due to the settlement of escrow amounts related to an acquisition from january 2014, and the gain on foreign currency options put in place as an economic hedge of veda's purchase price, partially offset by impairment of our cost method investment in brazil in the second quarter of 2015.
the increase in other income (expense), net, in 2014 is due to the impairment of our cost method investment in brazil recorded in 2013, which did not recur in 2014. other income (expense), net in 2014 also includes $7.0 million in foreign exchange losses related to dividends declared by our subsidiary in argentina and losses incurred in repatriating these funds.  these losses were partially offset by an increase in our equity in the earnings of our russian joint venture.

consolidated net income from continuing operations increased by $32.5 million, or 10%, in 2014 compared to 2013 due to increased operating income in our usis, workforce solutions and personal solutions operating segments, and a lower effective income tax rate, partially offset by declines in the international operating segment. the increase in net income attributable to equifax for 2014, as compared to the prior year, was partially offset by the absence of earnings from the discontinued operations, including a gain on the disposition of those operations, which benefited the prior year period.

sources and uses of cash funds generated by operating activities and our credit facilities continue to be our most significant sources of liquidity. we expect that funds generated from results of operations will be sufficient to finance our anticipated working capital and other cash requirements (such as capital expenditures, interest payments, debt payments, potential pension funding contributions and dividend payments) for the foreseeable future. in the event that credit market conditions were to deteriorate, we would rely more heavily on borrowings from the senior credit facility, as described below. on november 21, 2015, the company refinanced the existing unsecured revolving credit facility of $750.0 million set to expire on december 19, 2017, and entered into a new credit agreement (the "senior credit facility"). the senior credit facility includes a revolving credit facility of $900.0 million ("revolver") and a delayed draw term loan of $800.0 million ("term loan facility"), with maturity dates of november 21, 2020 and november 21, 2018, respectively, with an option to extend the maturity of the revolving credit facility by an additional two years. the senior credit facility allows the company to request incremental loans of up to $300.0 million.  borrowings may be used for general corporate purposes, including working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and share repurchase programs. availability of the senior credit facility for borrowings is reduced by the outstanding face amount of any letters of credit issued under the facility and, pursuant to our existing board of directors authorization, by the outstanding principal amount of our commercial paper notes. additionally, the company entered into an $800.0 million 364-day revolving credit facility on november 21, 2015 (the "364-day revolver" and together with the revolver and the term loan facility, the "senior credit facilities"). the 364-day revolver has a maturity date of november 19, 2016. the commitments under the term loan facility and the 364-day revolver will be funded following the shareholder and court approval. refer to note 16 for further discussion. the term loan facility and the 364-day revolver provide that the company may, upon notice to the administrative agent, terminate or permanently reduce any class of commitments. commitments with respect to the 364-day revolver will also be reduced on a dollar-for-dollar basis to the extent the company issues other senior indebtedness. the company plans to replace some of the senior credit facilities with senior notes in the future.
at december 31, 2015, $852.3 million was available to borrow under our senior credit facility. our senior credit facility does not include a provision under which lenders could refuse to allow us to borrow under this facility in the event of a material adverse change in our financial condition, as long as we are in compliance with the covenants contained in the lending agreement.
information about our cash flows, by category, is presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows. the following table summarizes our cash flows for the twelve months ended december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013:
twelve months ended december 31,                                change net cash provided by (used in):   2015                 2014                  2013                     2015 vs. 2014           2014 vs. 2013
operating activities                  $742.1                $616.2                $569.0              $125.9                  $47.2

operating activities cash provided by operating activities for 2015 increased by $125.9 million over the prior year, due to $75.6 million growth in net income, adjusted for the brazil impairment, and improvements in working capital, notably an increase in current liabilities related to current payables, incentives and unearned income.
cash provided by operating activities for 2014 increased by $47.2 million over the prior year.  cash provided from net income, excluding the impact of the 2013 divestitures, the impairment of our cost method investment in 2013, the impact of depreciation and amortization and stock based compensation expense, increased $35.9 million. the remaining increase in cash from operations was driven by changes in net working capital in 2014 as compared to 2013.
fund transfer limitations. the ability of certain of our subsidiaries and associated companies to transfer funds to us is limited, in some cases, by certain restrictions imposed by foreign governments, such as argentina; these restrictions do not, individually or in the aggregate, materially limit our ability to service our indebtedness, meet our current obligations or pay dividends. we currently hold $86.8 million of cash in our foreign subsidiaries.
investing activities twelve months ended december 31,                                change net cash used in:      2015                 2014                  2013                     2015 vs. 2014           2014 vs. 2013

our capital expenditures are used for developing, enhancing and deploying new and existing software in support of our expanding product set, replacing or adding equipment, updating systems for regulatory compliance, licensing of standard software applications, investing in system reliability, security and disaster recovery enhancements, and updating or expanding our office facilities.
capital expenditures in 2015 increased from 2014, as we are continuing to invest in new products and technology infrastructure. capital expenditures in 2014 were comparable to 2013.
acquisitions, divestitures and investments twelve months ended december 31,                                                                  change net cash provided by (used in):                2015               2014                  2013                          2015 vs. 2014      2014 vs. 2013

2015 acquisitions and investments. during the first quarter of 2015, we acquired a 75% equity interest investment in a debt collections and recovery management venture in the u.k., as more fully described in note 1. during the third quarter of 2015, we received $2.9 million proceeds from the escrow related to a past disposition. we did not make significant investments in unconsolidated affiliates during 2015.
2014 acquisitions and investments. during the first quarter of 2014, we acquired tdx, included as part of our international operating segment, and forseva, included as part of our usis operating segment. during the first quarter of 2013, we divested two non-strategic business lines, equifax settlement services which was part of our mortgage business within the usis operating segment and talent management services which was part of our employer services business within our workforce solutions operating segment, for a total of $47.5 million. $3.5 million of the proceeds of the sale of talent management services was placed into an escrow account to be released to us at a later date. during 2014, we received $0.6 million of the proceeds from the escrow.
we invested $2.5 million in our joint venture in india during 2014. this investment was more than offset by dividends received from our joint venture in russia.
2013 acquisitions and investments. during the third quarter of 2013, we acquired trustedid, a direct-to-consumer identity protection business that is included as part of our personal solutions business unit. during the fourth quarter of 2013, we completed two acquisitions in paraguay and mexico in the latin america region of our international segment.
in the first quarter of 2013, we divested of two non-strategic business lines, as discussed above, for a total of $47.5 million. $3.5 million of the proceeds of the sale of talent management services was placed into an escrow account and was released to us in 2015 and 2014.  we also divested of three other small non-strategic operations.
we invested $8.0 million in our joint ventures in 2013 to increase our percentage ownership interest in russia, and as a general capital call in india, as well as $1.1 million in another international entity.
for additional information about our acquisitions, see note 4 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this report.
financing activities twelve months ended december 31,                                change net cash provided by (used in):          2015                 2014                  2013                     2015 vs. 2014           2014 vs. 2013

credit facility availability. our principal unsecured revolving credit facility with a group of banks, which we refer to as the revolver, permits us to borrow up to $900.0 million through november 2020. the revolver may be used for general corporate purposes. availability of the revolver for borrowings is reduced by the outstanding face amount of any letters of credit issued under the facility and, pursuant to our existing board of directors authorization, by the outstanding principal amount of our commercial paper (cp) notes.
our $900.0 million cp program has been established to allow for borrowing through the private placement of cp with maturities ranging from overnight to 397 days. we may use the proceeds of cp for general corporate purposes. the cp program is supported by our revolver and, pursuant to our existing board of directors authorization, the total amount of cp which may be issued is reduced by the amount of any outstanding borrowings under our revolver.
at december 31, 2015, the company had $47.2 million of cp and $0.5 million of letters of credit outstanding, and there were no borrowings outstanding under the revolver. at december 31, 2015, a total of $852.3 million was available under the revolver.
at december 31, 2015, approximately 96% of our debt was fixed rate and 4% was effectively variable rate. our variable-rate debt consists of our issued commercial paper, which bears short-term interest rates based on the cp market for investment grade issuers. the interest rates reset periodically, depending on the terms of the respective financing arrangements. at december 31, 2015, interest rates on our variable-rate debt ranged from 0.65% to 0.75%.
the obligations of the lenders to fund the term loan facility and the 364-day revolver are subject to certain conditions, including the approval by veda shareholders of the acquisition and the nonoccurence of a material adverse change related to veda. refer to note 16 for further discussion.
borrowing and repayment activity. net short-term borrowings (repayments) primarily represent borrowings or repayments of outstanding amounts under our cp program. we primarily borrow under our cp program, as needed and availability allows.
the decrease in net short-term (repayments) borrowings primarily relates the net activity of cp notes in 2015, and reflects the increase in cash flow from operations as well as no material acquisitions entered into during the year. the increase in net short-term borrowings (repayments) in 2014 primarily reflects the borrowing of cp notes in the first quarter of 2014 to fund the acquisition of tdx, as well as the 2014 pay-off of our $15.0 million 7.34% notes and $275.0 million 4.45% senior notes, outstanding at december 31, 2013, with borrowings under our cp program.
the increase in payments on long-term debt in 2014 reflects the pay-off of our $15.0 million 7.34% notes and $275.0 million 4.45% senior notes, outstanding at december 31, 2013, with borrowings under our cp program.
the increase in debt issuance costs in 2015 reflects the debt issuance costs paid in connection with the new senior credit facilities entered into in november 2015.
debt covenants. the outstanding indentures and comparable instruments contain customary covenants including, for example, limits on secured debt and sale/leaseback transactions. in addition, the senior credit facilities requires us to maintain a maximum leverage ratio of not more than 3.5 to 1.0, and limits the amount of subsidiary debt. the company's leverage ratio was 1.26 at december 31, 2015. none of these covenants are considered restrictive to our operations and, as of december 31, 2015, the company was in compliance with all of our debt covenants.
the company does not have any credit rating triggers that would accelerate the maturity of a material amount of the outstanding debt; however, the 6.3% senior notes due 2017, 3.3% senior notes due 2022 and 7.0% senior notes due 2037 (together, the "senior notes") contain change in control provisions. if the company experiences a change of control or publicly announce the company's intention to effect a change of control and the rating on the senior notes is lowered by standard & poor's, or s&p, and moody's investors service, or moody's, below an investment grade rating within 60 days of such change of control or notice thereof, then the company will be required to offer to repurchase the senior notes at a price equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of the senior notes plus accrued and unpaid interest.
credit ratings. credit ratings reflect an independent agency's judgment on the likelihood that a borrower will repay a debt obligation at maturity. the ratings reflect many considerations, such as the nature of the borrower's industry and its competitive position, the size of the company, its liquidity and access to capital and the sensitivity of a company's cash flows to changes in the economy. the two largest rating agencies, s&p and moody's, use alphanumeric codes to designate their ratings. the highest quality rating for long-term credit obligations is aaa and aaa for s&p and moody's, respectively. a security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency.
long-term ratings of bbb- and baa3 or better by s&p and moody's, respectively, reflect ratings on debt obligations that fall within a band of credit quality considered to be "investment grade". at december 31, 2015, the long-term ratings for our obligations were bbb+ and baa1, which are consistent with the ratings and outlooks which existed at december 31, 2014. a downgrade in our credit rating would increase the cost of borrowings under our cp program and credit facilities, and could limit, or in the case of a significant downgrade, preclude our ability to issue cp. if our credit ratings were to decline to lower levels, we could experience increases in the interest cost for any new debt. in addition, the market's demand for, and thus our ability to readily issue, new debt could become further affected by the economic and credit market environment.
for additional information about our debt, including the terms of our financing arrangements, basis for variable interest rates and debt covenants, see note 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this report.

sources and uses of cash related to equity during the twelve months ended december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 were as follows:
•   under share repurchase programs authorized by our board of directors, we repurchased 2.1 million, 3.9 million, and 0.2 million common shares during the twelve months ended december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, for $196.3 million, $301.6 million and $11.9 million, respectively, at an average price per common share of $94.97, $76.55 and $59.74, respectively. as of december 31, 2015, under the existing board authorization, the company is approved for additional stock repurchases valued at $667.2 million.
•   during the twelve months ended december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, we paid cash dividends to equifax shareholders of $137.8 million, $121.2 million and $106.7 million, respectively, at $1.16 per share for 2015, $1.00 per share for 2014 and $0.88 per share for 2013.
contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations and commitments as of december 31, 2015. the table excludes commitments that are contingent based on events or factors uncertain at this time. some of the excluded commitments are discussed below the footnotes to the table.
data processing, outsourcing agreements and other purchase obligations (3)          74.2                    52.6                      18.0                      3.2                      0.4
other long-term liabilities (4) (6)                                                110.5                     7.1                      15.1                     12.8                     75.5
(1)   the amounts are gross of unamortized discounts totaling $(1.6) million at december 31, 2015. total debt on our consolidated balance sheets is net of the unamortized discounts and fair value adjustments. there were no fair value adjustments to our debt at december 31, 2015.
(2)   our operating lease obligations principally involve office space and equipment, which include the ground lease associated with our headquarters building that expires in 2048.
(3)   these agreements primarily represent our minimum contractual obligations for services that we outsource associated with our computer data processing operations and related functions, and certain administrative functions. these agreements expire between 2016 and 2023.
(4)   these long-term liabilities primarily relate to obligations associated with certain pension, postretirement and other compensation-related plans, some of which are discounted in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles, or gaap. we made certain assumptions about the timing of such future payments. in the table above, we have not included amounts related to future pension plan obligations, as such required funding amounts beyond 2016 have not been deemed necessary due to our current expectations regarding future plan asset performance.
(5)   for future interest payments on variable-rate debt, which are generally based on a specified margin plus a base rate (libor) or on cp rates for investment grade issuers, we used the variable rate in effect at december 31, 2015 to calculate these payments. our variable rate debt at december 31, 2015, consisted of cp. future interest payments related to our senior credit facility and our cp program are based on the borrowings outstanding at december 31, 2015 through their respective maturity dates, assuming such borrowings are outstanding until that time. the variable portion of the rate at december 31, 2015 ranged from 0.65% to 0.75% for all of our variable-rate debt. future interest payments may be different depending on future borrowing activity and interest rates.
(6)   this table excludes $24.6 million of unrecognized tax benefits, including interest and penalties, as we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities.
off-balance sheet transactions on november 21, 2015, we entered into the agreement to acquire veda for a cash consideration of approximately $1.7 billion (2.4 billion australian dollars) and debt assumed of approximately $188.4 million (261.5 million australian dollars). we expect the transaction to close in the first quarter of 2016. the transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, as disclosed above.
refer to item 1a "risk factors" and note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on the proposed acquisition of veda.
we do not engage in off-balance sheet financing activities.
pursuant to the terms of certain industrial revenue bonds, we have transferred title to certain of our fixed assets with total costs of $108.5 million and $92.3 million, as of december 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, to a local governmental authority in the u.s. to receive a property tax abatement related to economic development. the title to these assets will revert back to us upon retirement or cancellation of the applicable bonds. these fixed assets are still recognized on the company's consolidated balance sheets as all risks and rewards remain with the company.
letters of credit and guarantees we will from time to time issue standby letters of credit, performance bonds or other guarantees in the normal course of business. the aggregate notional amount of all performance bonds and standby letters of credit was not material at december 31, 2015, and all have a remaining maturity of one year or less. guarantees are issued from time to time to support the needs of our operating units. the maximum potential future payments we could be required to make under the guarantees is not material at december 31, 2015.
benefit plans we sponsor a qualified defined benefit retirement plan (the u.s. retirement income plan, or usrip) that covers approximately 20% of current u.s. salaried employees who were hired on or before june 30, 2007, the last date on which an individual could be hired and enter the plan before the usrip was frozen to new participation at december 31, 2008. this plan also covers many retirees as well as certain terminated but vested individuals not yet in retirement status. we also sponsor a defined benefit plan that covers most salaried and hourly employees in canada (the canadian retirement income plan, or crip). the crip was frozen to new participants entering the plan on or after october 1, 2011.
at december 31, 2015, the usrip met or exceeded erisa's minimum funding requirements. during the twelve months ended december 31, 2015 and 2014, we did not make any contributions to the usrip.  we contributed $0.2 million and $1.2 million to the crip during the twelve months ended december 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. in the future, we will make minimum funding contributions as required and may make discretionary contributions, depending on certain circumstances, including market conditions and liquidity needs. we believe additional funding contributions, if any, would not prevent us from continuing to meet our liquidity needs, which are primarily funded from cash flows generated by operating activities, available cash and cash equivalents, and our credit facilities.
for our non-u.s., tax-qualified retirement plans, we fund an amount sufficient to meet minimum funding requirements but no more than allowed as a tax deduction pursuant to applicable tax regulations. for the non-qualified supplementary retirement plans, we fund the benefits as they are paid to retired participants, but accrue the associated expense and liabilities in accordance with gaap.
for additional information about our benefit plans, see note 11 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this report.
seasonality we experience seasonality in certain of our revenue streams. revenue generated from the employer services business unit within the workforce solutions operating segment is generally higher in the first quarter due primarily to the provision of form w-2 preparation services, which occur in the first quarter each year. revenue from our online information solutions and mortgage solutions business units tends to increase in periods of the year in which our customers have higher volumes of credit granting decisions, most commonly the second and third calendar quarters. revenues in our financial marketing services business line within usis are typically highest in the fourth quarter each year due to the timing of certain significant annual renewals of project-based agreements. on a consolidated basis, combining all of these businesses, and assuming normal economic conditions, first quarter revenue is normally the lowest quarterly revenue of the year, and the fourth quarter is the highest.
effects of inflation and changes in foreign currency exchange rates equifax's operating results are not materially affected by inflation, although inflation may result in increases in the company's expenses, which may not be readily recoverable in the price of services offered. to the extent inflation results in rising interest rates and has other adverse effects upon the securities markets and upon the value of financial instruments, it may adversely affect the company's financial position and profitability.
a portion of the company's business is conducted in currencies other than the u.s. dollar, and changes in foreign exchange rates relative to the u.s. dollar can therefore affect the value of non-u.s. dollar net assets, revenues and expenses. potential exposures as a result of these fluctuations in currencies are closely monitored. we generally do not mitigate the risks associated with fluctuating exchange rates, although we may from time to time through forward contracts or other derivative instruments hedge a portion of our translational foreign currency exposure or exchange rate risks associated with material transactions which are denominated in a foreign currency.
recent accounting pronouncements for information about new accounting pronouncements and the potential impact on our consolidated financial statements, see note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this report.
application of critical accounting policies and estimates the company's consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles, or gaap. this requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in our consolidated financial statements and the notes to consolidated financial statements. the following accounting policies involve critical accounting estimates because they are particularly dependent on estimates and assumptions made by management about matters that are uncertain at the time the accounting estimates are made. in addition, while we have used our best estimates based on facts and circumstances available to us at the time, different estimates reasonably could have been used in the current period, or changes in the accounting estimates that we used are reasonably likely to occur from period to period, either of which may have a material impact on the presentation of our consolidated balance sheets and statements of income. we also have other significant accounting policies which involve the use of estimates, judgments and assumptions that are relevant to understanding our results. for additional information about these policies, see note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this report. although we believe that our estimates, assumptions and judgments are reasonable, they are based upon information available at the time. actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions, judgments or conditions.
revenue recognition revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, collectibility of arrangement consideration is reasonably assured, the arrangement fees are fixed or determinable and delivery of the product or service has been completed. a significant portion of our revenue is derived from the provision of information services to our customers on a transaction basis, in which case revenue is recognized, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met, when the services are provided. a smaller portion of our revenues relate to subscription-based contracts under which a customer pays a preset fee for a predetermined or unlimited number of transactions or services provided during the subscription period, generally one year. revenue related to subscription-based contracts having a preset number of transactions is recognized as the services are provided, using an effective transaction rate as the actual transactions are completed. any remaining revenue related to unfulfilled units is not recognized until the end of the related contract's subscription period. revenue related to subscription-based contracts having an unlimited volume is recognized ratably during the contract term. revenue is recorded net of sales taxes.
if at the outset of an arrangement, we determine that collectibility is not reasonably assured, revenue is deferred until the earlier of when collectibility becomes probable or the receipt of payment. if there is uncertainty as to the customer's acceptance of our deliverables, revenue is not recognized until the earlier of receipt of customer acceptance or expiration of the acceptance period. if at the outset of an arrangement, we determine that the arrangement fee is not fixed or determinable, revenue is deferred until the arrangement fee becomes fixed or determinable, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria have been met.
the determination of certain of our tax management services revenue requires the use of estimates, principally related to transaction volumes in instances where these volumes are reported to us by our clients on a monthly basis in arrears. in these instances, we estimate transaction volumes based on average actual volumes reported in the past. differences between our estimates and actual final volumes reported are recorded in the period in which actual volumes are reported. we have not experienced significant variances between our estimates and actual reported volumes in the past. we monitor actual volumes to ensure that we will continue to make reasonable estimates in the future. if we determine that we are unable to make reasonable future estimates, revenue may be deferred until actual customer data is obtained. also within our workforce solutions operating segment, the fees for certain of our tax credits and incentives revenue are based on a percentage of the credit delivered to our
clients. revenue for these arrangements is recognized based on the achievement of milestones, upon calculation of the credit, or when the credit is utilized by our client, depending on the provisions of the client contract.
we have certain offerings that are sold as multiple element arrangements. the multiple elements may include consumer or commercial information, file updates for certain solutions, services provided by our decisioning technologies personnel, training services, statistical models and other services. to account for each of these elements separately, the delivered elements must have stand-alone value to our customer. if we are unable to unbundle the arrangement into separate units of accounting, we apply one of the accounting policies described above. this may lead to the arrangement consideration being recognized as the final contract element is delivered to our customer or ratably over the contract.
many of our multiple element arrangements involve the delivery of services generated by a combination of services provided by one or more of our operating segments. no individual information service impacts the value or usage of other information services included in an arrangement and each service can be sold alone or, in most cases, purchased from another vendor without affecting the quality of use or value to the customer of the other information services included in the arrangement. some of our products require the development of interfaces or platforms by our decisioning technologies personnel that allow our customers to interact with our proprietary information databases. these development services do not meet the requirement for having stand-alone value, thus any related development fees are deferred when billed and are recognized over the expected period that the customer will benefit from the related decisioning technologies service. revenue from the provision of statistical models is recognized as the service is provided and accepted, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met. the direct costs of set up of a customer are capitalized and amortized as a cost of service during the term of the related customer contract.
we have some multiple element arrangements that include software.  we recognize the elements for which we have established vendor specific objective evidence at fair value upon delivery, in accordance with the applicable guidance.
we record revenue on a net basis for those sales in which we have in substance acted as an agent or broker in the transaction.
the debt collections and recovery management revenue is calculated as a percentage of debt collected on behalf of the customer and, as such, is primarily recognized when the cash is collected assuming all  other revenue recognition criteria are met.
deferred revenue consists of amounts billed and collected in excess of revenue recognized on sales relating generally to the deferral of subscription fees and arrangement consideration from elements not meeting the criteria for having stand-alone value discussed above. deferred revenues are subsequently recognized as revenue in accordance with our revenue recognition policies.
judgments and uncertainties - each element of a multiple element arrangement must be considered separately to ensure that appropriate accounting is performed for these deliverables. these considerations include assessing the price at which the element is sold compared to its relative fair value; concluding when the element will be delivered; evaluating collectibility; and determining whether any contingencies exist in the related customer contract that impact the prices paid to us for the services.
in addition, as stated above, the determination of certain of our marketing information services and tax management services revenue requires the use of estimates, principally related to transaction volumes in instances where these volumes are reported to us by our clients on a monthly basis in arrears. in these instances, we estimate transaction volumes based on average actual volumes reported in the past. differences between our estimates and actual final volumes reported are recorded in the period in which actual volumes are reported.
effects if actual results differ from assumptions - we have not experienced significant variances between our estimates of marketing information services and tax management services revenues reported to us by our customers and actual reported volumes in the past. we monitor actual volumes to ensure that we will continue to make reasonable estimates in the future. if we determine that we are unable to make reasonable future estimates, revenue may be deferred until actual customer data is obtained. however, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions, or if our customer arrangements become more complex or include more bundled offerings in the future, we may be required to recognize revenue differently in the future to account for these changes. we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to recognize revenue.
goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets we review goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment annually (as of september 30) and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. these events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate, legal factors, operating performance or trends, competition, or sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit. we have seven reporting units comprised of u.s. information solutions (which includes part of online information solutions, mortgage solutions and financial marketing services), europe, latin america, canada, personal solutions, verification services, and employer services. based on the company's enterprise-wide strategy, we've consolidated the identity management reporting unit with the u.s. information solutions reporting unit in 2015. we performed goodwill impairment tests prior to and following the consolidation for usis and identity management reporting units, which resulted in no impairment.
the goodwill balance at december 31, 2015, for our seven reporting units was as follows:
u.s. information solutions      $1,071.3
qualitative assessments we performed a qualitative assessment to determine whether further impairment testing was necessary for all of our reporting units. in this qualitative assessment, we considered the following items for each of the reporting units: macroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions, overall financial performance and other entity specific events. in addition, for each of these reporting units, the most recent fair value determination resulted in an amount that exceeded the carrying amount of the reporting units. based on these assessments, we determined the likelihood that a current fair value determination would be less than the current carrying amount of the reporting unit is not more likely than not. as a result of our conclusions, no further testing was required for all of our reporting units.
loss contingencies we are subject to various proceedings, lawsuits and claims arising in the normal course of our business. we determine whether to disclose and/or accrue for loss contingencies based on our assessment of whether the potential loss is estimable, probable, reasonably possible or remote.
judgments and uncertainties - we periodically review claims and legal proceedings and assess whether we have potential financial exposure based on consultation with internal and outside legal counsel and other advisors. if the likelihood of an adverse outcome from any claim or legal proceeding is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated, we record a liability on our consolidated balance sheets for the estimated amount. if the likelihood of an adverse outcome is reasonably possible, but not probable, we provide disclosures related to the potential loss contingency. our assumptions related to loss contingencies are inherently subjective.
effect if actual results differ from assumptions - we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to determine loss contingencies. however, if facts and circumstances change in the future that change our belief regarding assumptions used to determine our estimates, we may be exposed to a loss that could be material.
income taxes we record deferred income taxes using enacted tax laws and rates for the years in which the taxes are expected to be paid. we assess the likelihood that our net deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income or other tax planning strategies. to the extent that we believe that recovery is not likely, we must establish a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax asset to the amount we estimate will be recoverable.
our income tax provisions are based on assumptions and calculations which will be subject to examination by various tax authorities. we record tax benefits for positions in which we believe are more likely than not of being sustained under such examinations. we assess the potential outcome of such examinations to determine the adequacy of our income tax accruals.
judgments and uncertainties - we consider accounting for income taxes critical because management is required to make significant judgments in determining our provision for income taxes, our deferred tax assets and liabilities, and our future taxable income for purposes of assessing our ability to realize any future benefit from our deferred tax assets. these judgments and estimates are affected by our expectations of future taxable income, mix of earnings among different taxing jurisdictions, and timing of the reversal of deferred tax assets and liabilities.
we also use our judgment to determine whether it is more likely than not that we will sustain positions that we have taken on tax returns and, if so, the amount of benefit to initially recognize within our financial statements. we review our uncertain tax positions and adjust our unrecognized tax benefits in light of changes in facts and circumstances, such as changes in tax law, interactions with taxing authorities and developments in case law. these adjustments to our unrecognized tax benefits may affect our income tax expense. settlement of uncertain tax positions may require use of our cash. at december 31, 2015, $24.6 million was recorded for uncertain tax benefits, including interest and penalties, of which it is reasonably possible that up to $9.4 million of our unrecognized tax benefit may change within the next twelve months.
effect if actual results differ from assumptions - although management believes that the judgments and estimates discussed herein are reasonable, actual results could differ, and we may be exposed to increases or decreases in income tax expense that could be material.
pension and other postretirement plans we consider accounting for our u.s. and canadian pension and other postretirement plans critical because management is required to make significant subjective judgments about a number of actuarial assumptions, which include discount rates, expected return on plan assets, interest cost and mortality and retirement rates. actuarial valuations are used in determining our benefit obligation and net periodic benefit cost.
during 2015 we adopted the new generational projection scale with mp-2015 in determining the liability for the u.s. pensions plan. this updated scale, along with the change in the discount rate, contributed to the decrease in the projected benefit obligation as of december 31, 2015.
during 2014, the we adopted the new rp-2014 mortality tables and generational projection scale with mp-2014 in determining the liability for the u.s. pensions plan. this new table, along with the change in the discount rate, contributed to the increase in the projected benefit obligation as of december 31, 2014.
judgments and uncertainties - we believe that the most significant assumptions related to our net periodic benefit cost are (1) the discount rate and (2) the expected return on plan assets, in each case as it relates to our u.s. pension plan. our canadian plan is not significant, and the impact of changes in assumptions for that plan is not material.
we determine our discount rates primarily based on high-quality, fixed-income investments and yield-to-maturity analysis specific to our estimated future benefit payments available as of the measurement date. discount rates are updated annually on the measurement date to reflect current market conditions. we use a third-party yield curve to develop our discount rates. the yield curve provides discount rates related to a dedicated high-quality bond portfolio whose cash flows extend beyond the current period, from which we choose a rate matched to the expected benefit payments required for each plan.
the expected rate of return on plan assets is based on both our historical returns and forecasted future investment returns by asset class, as provided by our external investment advisor. in 2015, the u.s. pension plan investment losses of 1.1% were below the expected return of 7.5% for the second time in seven years. the expected return for the usrip for 2016 is at 7.25%, which is a reduction from the rate used for 2015. the crip earned 2.9% in 2015 which was below its expected return of 6.75% for the second time in seven years. the expected return for the crip for 2016 is at 6.0%, which is a reduction from
the rate used for 2015. the crip has a lower expected return due to a higher asset allocation to fixed income securities. our weighted-average expected rate of return for both plans for 2016 is 7.12% which is slightly lower than the 2015 expected rate.
annual differences, if any, between the expected and actual returns on plan assets are included in unrecognized net actuarial gain or loss, a component of other comprehensive income. in calculating the annual amortization of the unrecognized net actuarial gain or loss, we use a market-related value of assets that smooths actual investment gains and losses on plan assets over a period up to five years. the resulting unrecognized net actuarial gain or loss amount is recognized in net periodic pension expense over the average remaining life expectancy of the participant group since almost all participants are inactive.  the market-related value of our assets was $543.3 million at december 31, 2015. we do not expect our 2016 net periodic benefit cost, which includes the effect of the market-related value of assets, to be materially different than our 2015 cost. see note 11 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for details on changes in the pension benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets.
effect if actual results differ from assumptions - we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions that are used in our actuarial valuations. adjusting our weighted-average expected long-term rate of return (7.12% at december 31, 2015) by 50 basis points would change our estimated pension expense in 2016 by approximately $2.7 million. adjusting our weighted-average discount rate (4.86% at december 31, 2015) by 50 basis points would change our estimated pension expense in 2016 by approximately $0.4 million. however, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to changes in pension expense that could be material.
purchase accounting for acquisitions we account for acquisitions under accounting standards codification 805, business combinations, which changed the application of the acquisition method of accounting in a business combination and also modified the way assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recognized on a prospective basis. in general, the acquisition method of accounting requires companies to record assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their respective fair market values at the date of acquisition. we primarily estimate fair value of identified intangible assets using discounted cash flow analyses based on market participant based inputs. any amount of the purchase price paid that is in excess of the estimated fair values of net assets acquired is recorded in the line item goodwill in our consolidated balance sheets. transaction costs, as well as costs to reorganize acquired companies, are expensed as incurred in our consolidated statements of income.
judgments and uncertainties - we consider accounting for business combinations critical because management's judgment is used to determine the estimated fair values assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed and amortization periods for intangible assets, which can materially affect the our results of operations.
effect if actual results differ from assumptions - although management believes that the judgments and estimates discussed herein are reasonable, actual results could differ, and we may be exposed to an impairment charge if we are unable to recover the value of the recorded net assets.

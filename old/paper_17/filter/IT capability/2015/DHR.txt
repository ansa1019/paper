item 1a. risk factors you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, together with the information included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k and other documents we file with the sec. the risks and uncertainties described below are those that we have identified as material, but are not the only risks and uncertainties facing us. our business is also subject to general risks and uncertainties that affect many other companies, such as market conditions, economic conditions, geopolitical events, changes in laws or accounting rules, fluctuations in interest rates, terrorism, wars or conflicts, major health concerns, natural disasters or other disruptions of expected business conditions. additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial also may impair our business, including our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition.
we are pursuing a plan to separate into two independent publicly traded companies. the proposed separation may not be completed on the currently contemplated timeline or at all and may not achieve the intended benefits.
we have announced a plan to separate into two independent public companies in the third quarter of 2016 through a spin-off of certain of our businesses. unanticipated developments, including possible delays in obtaining various tax rulings, regulatory approvals or clearances and trade qualifications, uncertainty of the financial markets and challenges in establishing infrastructure or processes, could delay or prevent the proposed separation or cause the proposed separation to occur on terms or conditions that are less favorable and/or different than expected. even if the transaction is completed, we may not realize some or all of the anticipated benefits from the spin-off. expenses incurred to accomplish the proposed separation may be significantly higher than what we currently anticipate. executing the proposed separation also requires significant time and attention from management, which could distract them from other tasks in operating our business. following the proposed separation, the combined value of the common stock of the two publicly-traded companies may not be equal to or greater than what the value of our common stock would have been had the proposed separation not occurred.
conditions in the global economy, the markets we serve and the financial markets may adversely affect our business and financial statements.
our business is sensitive to general economic conditions. slower global economic growth, actual or anticipated default on sovereign debt, volatility in the currency and credit markets, high levels of unemployment or underemployment, reduced levels of capital expenditures, changes in government fiscal and monetary policies, changes in capital requirements for financial institutions, government deficit reduction and budget negotiation dynamics, sequestration, austerity measures and other challenges that affect the global economy adversely affect the company and its distributors, customers and suppliers, including having the effect of:
•   reducing demand for our products (in this item 1a, references to products also includes software) and services, limiting the financing available to our customers and suppliers, increasing order cancellations and resulting in longer sales cycles and slower adoption of new technologies;
•   increasing price competition in our served markets;
•   supply interruptions, which could disrupt our ability to produce our products;
•   increasing the risk of impairment of goodwill and other long-lived assets, and the risk that we may not be able to fully recover the value of other assets such as real estate and tax assets; and
•   increasing the risk that counterparties to our contractual arrangements will become insolvent or otherwise unable to fulfill their contractual obligations which, in addition to increasing the risks identified above, could result in preference actions against us.
although we have been able to continue accessing the commercial paper and other capital markets through the date of this report, there can be no assurances that such markets will remain available to us or that the lenders participating in our revolving credit facilities will be able to provide financing in accordance with their contractual obligations.
if growth in the global economy or in any of the markets we serve slows for a significant period, if there is significant deterioration in the global economy or such markets or if improvements in the global economy don't benefit the markets we serve, our business and financial statements could be adversely affected.
our restructuring actions could have long-term adverse effects on our business.
in recent years, we have implemented multiple, significant restructuring activities across our businesses to adjust our cost structure, and we may engage in similar restructuring activities in the future. these restructuring activities and our regular ongoing cost reduction activities (including in connection with the integration of acquired businesses) reduce our available talent, assets and other resources and could slow improvements in our products and services, adversely affect our ability to respond to customers and limit our ability to increase production quickly if demand for our products increases. in addition, delays in implementing planned restructuring activities or other productivity improvements, unexpected costs or failure to meet targeted improvements may diminish the operational or financial benefits we expect to realize from such actions. any of the circumstances described above could adversely impact our business and financial statements.
our growth could suffer if the markets into which we sell our products and services decline, do not grow as anticipated or experience cyclicality.
our growth depends in part on the growth of the markets which we serve, and visibility into our markets is limited (particularly for markets into which we sell through distribution). our quarterly sales and profits depend substantially on the volume and timing of orders received during the fiscal quarter, which are difficult to forecast. any decline or lower than expected growth in our served markets could diminish demand for our products and services, which would adversely affect our financial statements. certain of our businesses operate in industries that may experience periodic, cyclical downturns. in addition, in certain of our businesses demand depends on customers' capital spending budgets as well as government funding policies, and matters of public policy and government budget dynamics as well as product and economic cycles can affect the spending decisions of these entities. demand for our products and services is also sensitive to changes in customer order patterns, which may be affected by announced price changes, changes in incentive programs, new product introductions and customer inventory levels. any of these factors could adversely affect our growth and results of operations in any given period.
we face intense competition and if we are unable to compete effectively, we may experience decreased demand and decreased market share. even if we compete effectively, we may be required to reduce prices for our products and services.
our businesses operate in industries that are intensely competitive and have been subject to increasing consolidation. because of the range of the products and services we sell and the variety of markets we serve, we encounter a wide variety of competitors; please see "item 1. business - competition" for additional details. in order to compete effectively, we must retain longstanding relationships with major customers and continue to grow our business by establishing relationships with new customers, continually developing new products and services to maintain and expand our brand recognition and leadership position in various product and service categories and penetrating new markets, including high-growth markets. our failure to compete effectively and/or pricing pressures resulting from competition may adversely impact our financial statements, and our expansion into new markets may result in greater-than-expected risks, liabilities and expenses.
our growth depends in part on the timely development and commercialization, and customer acceptance, of new and enhanced products and services based on technological innovation.
we generally sell our products and services in industries that are characterized by rapid technological changes, frequent new product introductions and changing industry standards. if we do not develop innovative new and enhanced products and services on a timely basis, our offerings will become obsolete over time and our competitive position and financial statements will suffer. our success will depend on several factors, including our ability to:
•   correctly identify customer needs and preferences and predict future needs and preferences;
•   allocate our research and development funding to products and services with higher growth prospects;
•   anticipate and respond to our competitors' development of new products and services and technological innovations;
•   differentiate our offerings from our competitors' offerings and avoid commoditization;
•   innovate and develop new technologies and applications, and acquire or obtain rights to third-party technologies that may have valuable applications in our served markets;
•   obtain adequate intellectual property rights with respect to key technologies before our competitors do;
•   successfully commercialize new technologies in a timely manner, price them competitively and cost-effectively manufacture and deliver sufficient volumes of new products of appropriate quality on time;
•   obtain necessary regulatory approvals of appropriate scope, including with respect to medical device products by demonstrating satisfactory clinical results where applicable; and
•   stimulate customer demand for and convince customers to adopt new technologies.
in addition, if we fail to accurately predict future customer needs and preferences or fail to produce viable technologies, we may invest heavily in research and development of products and services that do not lead to significant revenue, which would adversely affect our profitability. even if we successfully innovate and develop new and enhanced products and services, we may incur substantial costs in doing so, and our profitability may suffer. in addition, promising new offerings may fail to reach the market or realize only limited commercial success because of real or perceived efficacy or safety concerns, failure to achieve positive clinical outcomes or uncertainty over third-party reimbursement.
our reputation, ability to do business and financial statements may be impaired by improper conduct by any of our employees, agents or business partners.
we cannot provide assurance that our internal controls and compliance systems will always protect us from acts committed by employees, agents or business partners of ours (or of businesses we acquire or partner with) that would violate u.s. and/or non-u.s. laws, including the laws governing payments to government officials, bribery, fraud, kickbacks and false claims, pricing, sales and marketing practices, conflicts of interest, competition, export and import compliance, money laundering and data privacy. in particular, the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act, the u.k. bribery act and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business, and we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree. any such improper actions or allegations of such acts could damage our reputation and subject us to civil or criminal investigations in the u.s. and in other jurisdictions and related shareholder lawsuits, could lead to substantial civil and criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties and could cause us to incur significant legal and investigatory fees. in addition, we rely on our suppliers to adhere to our supplier standards of conduct, and material violations of such standards of conduct could occur that could have a material effect on our financial statements.
any inability to consummate acquisitions at our historical rate and at appropriate prices could negatively impact our growth rate and stock price.
our ability to grow revenues, earnings and cash flow at or above our historic rates depends in part upon our ability to identify and successfully acquire and integrate businesses at appropriate prices and realize anticipated synergies. we may not be able to consummate acquisitions at rates similar to the past, which could adversely impact our growth rate and our stock price. promising acquisitions are difficult to identify and complete for a number of reasons, including high valuations, competition among prospective buyers, the availability of affordable funding in the capital markets and the need to satisfy applicable closing conditions and obtain antitrust and other regulatory approvals on acceptable terms. in addition, competition for
acquisitions may result in higher purchase prices. changes in accounting or regulatory requirements or instability in the credit markets could also adversely impact our ability to consummate acquisitions.
our acquisition of businesses (including our recent acquisition of pall), joint ventures and strategic relationships could negatively impact our financial statements.
as part of our business strategy we acquire businesses and enter into joint ventures and other strategic relationships in the ordinary course, some of which may be material; please see "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" ("md&a") for additional details. in particular, as of the date of this report the acquisition of pall in 2015 is danaher's largest acquisition and has expanded danaher's business into new markets. acquisitions, joint ventures and strategic relationships involve a number of financial, accounting, managerial, operational, legal, compliance and other risks and challenges, including the following, any of which could adversely affect our financial statements:
•   any acquired business, technology, service or product could under-perform relative to our expectations and the price that we paid for it, or not perform in accordance with our anticipated timetable.
•   we may incur or assume significant debt in connection with our acquisitions, joint ventures or strategic relationships.
•   acquisitions, joint ventures or strategic relationships could cause our financial results to differ from our own or the investment community's expectations in any given period, or over the long-term.
•   acquisitions, joint ventures or strategic relationships could create demands on our management, operational resources and financial and internal control systems that we are unable to effectively address.
•   we could experience difficulty in integrating personnel, operations and financial and other controls and systems and retaining key employees and customers.
•   we may be unable to achieve cost savings or other synergies anticipated in connection with an acquisition, joint venture or strategic relationship.
•   we may assume by acquisition, joint venture or strategic relationship unknown liabilities, known contingent liabilities that become realized, known liabilities that prove greater than anticipated, internal control deficiencies or exposure to regulatory sanctions resulting from the acquired company's activities. the realization of any of these liabilities or deficiencies may increase our expenses, adversely affect our financial position or cause us to fail to meet our public financial reporting obligations.
•   in connection with acquisitions and joint ventures, we often enter into post-closing financial arrangements such as purchase price adjustments, earn-out obligations and indemnification obligations, which may have unpredictable financial results.
•   as a result of our acquisitions, we have recorded significant goodwill and other intangible assets on our balance sheet. if we are not able to realize the value of these assets, we may be required to incur charges relating to the impairment of these assets.
•   we may have interests that diverge from those of our joint venture partners or other strategic partners and we may not be able to direct the management and operations of the joint venture or other strategic relationship in the manner we believe is most appropriate, exposing us to additional risk.
the indemnification provisions of acquisition agreements by which we have acquired companies may not fully protect us and as a result we may face unexpected liabilities.
certain of the acquisition agreements by which we have acquired companies require the former owners to indemnify us against certain liabilities related to the operation of the company before we acquired it. in most of these agreements, however, the liability of the former owners is limited and certain former owners may be unable to meet their indemnification responsibilities. we cannot assure you that these indemnification provisions will protect us fully or at all, and as a result we may face unexpected liabilities that adversely affect our financial statements.
divestitures or other dispositions could negatively impact our business, and contingent liabilities from businesses that we have sold could adversely affect our financial statements.
we continually assess the strategic fit of our existing businesses and may divest, spin-off, split-off or otherwise dispose of businesses that are deemed not to fit with our strategic plan or are not achieving the desired return on investment. these transactions pose risks and challenges that could negatively impact our business. for example, when we decide to sell or otherwise dispose of a business or assets, we may be unable to do so on satisfactory terms within our anticipated timeframe or at all, and even after reaching a definitive agreement to sell or dispose a business the sale is typically subject to satisfaction of pre-closing conditions which may not become satisfied. in addition, divestitures or other dispositions may dilute the company's earnings per share, have other adverse financial and accounting impacts and distract management, and disputes may arise with buyers. in addition, we have retained responsibility for and/or have agreed to indemnify buyers against some known and unknown contingent liabilities related to a number of businesses we have sold or disposed. the resolution of these contingencies has not had a material effect on our financial statements but we cannot be certain that this favorable pattern will continue.
certain of our businesses are subject to extensive regulation by the u.s. fda and by comparable agencies of other countries, as well as laws regulating fraud and abuse in the health care industry and the privacy and security of health information. failure to comply with those regulations could adversely affect our reputation and financial statements.
certain of our products are medical devices and other products that are subject to regulation by the u.s. fda, by comparable agencies of other countries and regions and by regulations governing radioactive or other hazardous materials (or the manufacture and sale of products containing such materials). we cannot guarantee that we will be able to obtain regulatory clearance or approvals (such as 510(k) clearance) for our new products or modifications to (or additional indications or uses of) existing products within our anticipated timeframe or at all, and if we do obtain such clearance or approval it may be time-consuming, costly and subject to restrictions. our ability to obtain such regulatory clearances or approvals will depend on many factors, for example our ability to obtain the necessary clinical trial results, and the process for obtaining such clearances or approvals could change over time and may require the withdrawal of products from the market until such clearances are obtained. failure to obtain such regulatory clearances or approvals before marketing our products (or before implementing modifications to or promoting additional indications or uses of our products), other violations of these regulations, real or perceived efficacy or safety concerns or trends of adverse events with respect to our products (even after obtaining clearance for distribution) and unfavorable or inconsistent clinical data from existing or future clinical trials can lead to fda form 483 inspectional observations, warning letters, notices to customers, declining sales, loss of customers, loss of market share, recalls, seizures of adulterated or misbranded products, injunctions, administrative detentions, refusals to permit importations, partial or total shutdown of production facilities or the implementation of operating restrictions, narrowing of permitted uses for a product, suspension or withdrawal of approvals and pre-market notification rescissions. we are also subject to various laws regulating fraud and abuse, pricing and sales and marketing practices in the health care industry and the privacy and security of health information, including the federal regulations described in "item 1. business - regulatory matters." many states and foreign countries have also adopted laws and regulations similar to, and in some cases more stringent than, such federal regulations. for more information regarding regulations we are subject to please see "item 1. business - regulatory matters."
failure to comply with the regulations described above could result in the adverse effects referenced below under "our businesses are subject to extensive regulation; failure to comply with those regulations could adversely affect our financial statements and reputation." compliance with these and other regulations may also require us to incur significant expenses.
the health care industry and related industries that we serve have undergone, and are in the process of undergoing, significant changes in an effort to reduce costs, which could adversely affect our financial statements.
the health care industry and related industries that we serve have undergone, and are in the process of undergoing, significant changes in an effort to reduce costs, including the following:
•   many of our customers, and the end-users to whom our customers supply products, rely on government funding of and reimbursement for health care products and services and research activities. the u.s. patient protection and affordable care act, as amended by the health care and education affordability reconciliation act (collectively, the "ppaca"), health care austerity measures in other countries and other potential health care reform changes and government austerity measures may reduce the amount of government funding or reimbursement available to customers or end-users of our products and services and/or the volume of medical procedures using our products and services. global economic uncertainty or deterioration can also adversely impact government funding and reimbursement.
•   governmental and private health care providers and payors around the world are increasingly utilizing managed care for the delivery of health care services, forming group purchasing organizations to improve their purchasing leverage and using competitive bid processes to procure health care products and services.
these changes as well as other impacts from market demand, government regulations, third party coverage and reimbursement policies and societal pressures have increased our tax liabilities and may cause participants in the health care industry and related industries that we serve to purchase fewer of our products and services, reduce the prices they are willing to pay for our products or services, reduce the amounts of reimbursement and funding available for our products and services from governmental agencies or third-party payors, reduce the volume of medical procedures that use our products and services and increase our compliance and other costs. in addition, we may be unable to enter into contracts with group purchasing organizations and integrated health networks on terms acceptable to us, and even if we do enter into such contracts they may be on terms that negatively affect our current or future profitability. all of the factors described above could adversely affect our financial statements.
our operations, products and services expose us to the risk of environmental, health and safety liabilities, costs and violations that could adversely affect our reputation and financial statements.
our operations, products and services are subject to environmental laws and regulations, which impose limitations on the discharge of pollutants into the environment and establish standards for the use, generation, treatment, storage and disposal of hazardous and non-hazardous wastes. we must also comply with various health and safety regulations in the united states and abroad in connection with our operations. we cannot assure you that our environmental, health and safety compliance program has been or will at all times be effective. failure to comply with any of these laws could result in civil and criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties and damage to our reputation. in addition, we cannot provide assurance that our costs of complying with current or future environmental protection and health and safety laws will not exceed our estimates or adversely affect our financial statements.
in addition, we may incur costs related to remedial efforts or alleged environmental damage associated with past or current waste disposal practices or other hazardous materials handling practices. we are also from time to time party to personal injury or other claims brought by private parties alleging injury due to the presence of or exposure to hazardous substances. we may also become subject to additional remedial, compliance or personal injury costs due to future events such as changes in existing laws or regulations, changes in agency direction or enforcement policies, developments in remediation technologies, changes in the conduct of our operations and changes in accounting rules. for additional information regarding these risks, please refer to note 16 to the consolidated financial statements. we cannot assure you that our liabilities arising from past or future releases of, or exposures to, hazardous substances will not exceed our estimates or adversely affect our reputation and financial statements or that we will not be subject to additional claims for personal injury or remediation in the future based on our past, present or future business activities. however, based on the information we currently have we do not believe that it is reasonably possible that any amounts we may be required to pay in connection with environmental matters in excess of our reserves as of december 31, 2015 will have a material effect on our financial statements.
our businesses are subject to extensive regulation; failure to comply with those regulations could adversely affect our financial statements and reputation.
in addition to the environmental, health, safety, health care, medical device, anticorruption and other regulations noted above, our businesses are subject to extensive regulation by u.s. and non-u.s. governmental and self-regulatory entities at the supranational, federal, state, local and other jurisdictional levels, including the following:
•   we are required to comply with various import laws and export control and economic sanctions laws, which may affect our transactions with certain customers, business partners and other persons and dealings between our employees and between our subsidiaries. in certain circumstances, export control and economic sanctions regulations may prohibit the export of certain products, services and technologies. in other circumstances, we may be required to obtain an export license before exporting the controlled item. compliance with the various import laws that apply to our businesses can restrict our access to, and increase the cost of obtaining, certain products and at times can interrupt our supply of imported inventory.
•   we also have agreements to sell products and services to government entities and are subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to companies doing business with government entities. the laws governing government contracts differ from the laws governing private contracts. for example, many government contracts contain pricing and other terms and conditions that are not applicable to private contracts. our agreements with government entities may be subject to termination, reduction or modification at the convenience of the government or in the event of changes in government requirements, reductions in federal spending and other factors, and we may underestimate our costs of performing under the contract. in certain cases, a governmental entity may require us to pay back amounts it
has paid to us. government contracts that have been awarded to us following a bid process could become the subject of a bid protest by a losing bidder, which could result in loss of the contract. we are also subject to investigation and audit for compliance with the requirements governing government contracts.
these are not the only regulations that our businesses must comply with. the regulations we are subject to have tended to become more stringent over time and may be inconsistent across jurisdictions. we, our representatives and the industries in which we operate may at times be under review and/or investigation by regulatory authorities. failure to comply (or any alleged or perceived failure to comply) with the regulations referenced above or any other regulations could result in civil and criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties, and any such failure or alleged failure (or becoming subject to a regulatory enforcement investigation) could also damage our reputation, disrupt our business, limit our ability to manufacture, import, export and sell products and services, result in loss of customers and disbarment from selling to certain federal agencies and cause us to incur significant legal and investigatory fees. compliance with these and other regulations may also affect our returns on investment, require us to incur significant expenses or modify our business model or impair our flexibility in modifying product, marketing, pricing or other strategies for growing our business. our products and operations are also often subject to the rules of industrial standards bodies such as the international standards organization, and failure to comply with these rules could result in withdrawal of certifications needed to sell our products and services and otherwise adversely impact our financial statements. for additional information regarding these risks, please refer to "item 1. business - regulatory matters."
we may be required to recognize impairment charges for our goodwill and other intangible assets.
as of december 31, 2015, the net carrying value of our goodwill and other intangible assets totaled approximately $36.3 billion. in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, we periodically assess these assets to determine if they are impaired. significant negative industry or economic trends, disruptions to our business, inability to effectively integrate acquired businesses, unexpected significant changes or planned changes in use of our assets, changes in the structure of our business, divestitures, market capitalization declines, or increases in associated discount rates may impair our goodwill and other intangible assets. any charges relating to such impairments would adversely affect our results of operations in the periods recognized.
foreign currency exchange rates may adversely affect our financial statements.
sales and purchases in currencies other than the u.s. dollar expose us to fluctuations in foreign currencies relative to the u.s. dollar and may adversely affect our financial statements. increased strength of the u.s. dollar increases the effective price of our products sold in u.s. dollars into other countries, which may require us to lower our prices or adversely affect sales to the extent we do not increase local currency prices. decreased strength of the u.s. dollar could adversely affect the cost of materials, products and services we purchase overseas. sales and expenses of our non-u.s. businesses are also translated into u.s. dollars for reporting purposes and the strengthening or weakening of the u.s. dollar could result in unfavorable translation effects. in addition, certain of our businesses may invoice customers in a currency other than the business' functional currency, and movements in the invoiced currency relative to the functional currency could also result in unfavorable translation effects. the company also faces exchange rate risk from its investments in subsidiaries owned and operated in foreign countries.
changes in our tax rates or exposure to additional income tax liabilities or assessments could affect our profitability. in addition, audits by tax authorities could result in additional tax payments for prior periods.
we are subject to income taxes in the u.s. and in various non-u.s. jurisdictions. please see the md&a for a discussion of the factors that may adversely affect our effective tax rate and decrease our profitability in any period. the impact of these factors may be substantially different from period to period. in addition, the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits by u.s. federal, state and local tax authorities and by non-u.s. tax authorities, such as the audits described in the md&a and the company's financial statements. due to the potential for changes to tax laws (or changes to the interpretation thereof) and the ambiguity of tax laws, the subjectivity of factual interpretations, the complexity of our intercompany arrangements and other factors, our estimates of income tax liabilities may differ from actual payments or assessments. if these audits result in payments or assessments different from our reserves, our future results may include unfavorable adjustments to our tax liabilities and our financial statements could be adversely affected. if we determine to repatriate earnings from foreign jurisdictions that have been considered permanently re-invested under existing accounting standards, it could also increase our effective tax rate. in addition, any significant change to the tax system in the u.s. or in other jurisdictions, including changes in the taxation of international income, could adversely affect our financial statements.
we are subject to a variety of litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings in the course of our business that could adversely affect our financial statements.
we are subject to a variety of litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings incidental to our business (or the business operations of previously owned entities), including claims for damages arising out of the use of products or services and claims relating to intellectual property matters, employment matters, tax matters, commercial disputes, competition and sales and trading practices, environmental matters, personal injury, insurance coverage and acquisition or divestiture-related matters, as well as regulatory investigations or enforcement. we may also become subject to lawsuits as a result of past or future acquisitions or as a result of liabilities retained from, or representations, warranties or indemnities provided in connection with, divested businesses. these lawsuits may include claims for compensatory damages, punitive and consequential damages and/or injunctive relief. the defense of these lawsuits may divert our management's attention, we may incur significant expenses in defending these lawsuits, and we may be required to pay damage awards or settlements or become subject to equitable remedies that could adversely affect our operations and financial statements. moreover, any insurance or indemnification rights that we may have may be insufficient or unavailable to protect us against such losses. in addition, developments in proceedings in any given period may require us to adjust the loss contingency estimates that we have recorded in our financial statements, record estimates for liabilities or assets previously not susceptible of reasonable estimates or pay cash settlements or judgments. any of these developments could adversely affect our financial statements in any particular period. we cannot assure you that our liabilities in connection with litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings will not exceed our estimates or adversely affect our financial statements and reputation. however, based on our experience, current information and applicable law, we do not believe that it is reasonably possible that any amounts we may be required to pay in connection with litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings in excess of our reserves as of december 31, 2015 will have a material effect on our financial statements.
if we do not or cannot adequately protect our intellectual property, or if third parties infringe our intellectual property rights, we may suffer competitive injury or expend significant resources enforcing our rights.
we own numerous patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets and other intellectual property and licenses to intellectual property owned by others, which in aggregate are important to our business. the intellectual property rights that we obtain, however, may not be sufficiently broad or otherwise may not provide us a significant competitive advantage, and patents may not be issued for pending or future patent applications owned by or licensed to us. in addition, the steps that we and our licensors have taken to maintain and protect our intellectual property may not prevent it from being challenged, invalidated, circumvented, designed-around or becoming subject to compulsory licensing, particularly in countries where intellectual property rights are not highly developed or protected. in some circumstances, enforcement may not be available to us because an infringer has a dominant intellectual property position or for other business reasons, or countries may require compulsory licensing of our intellectual property. we also rely on nondisclosure and noncompetition agreements with employees, consultants and other parties to protect, in part, trade secrets and other proprietary rights. there can be no assurance that these agreements will adequately protect our trade secrets and other proprietary rights and will not be breached, that we will have adequate remedies for any breach, that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information or that third parties will not otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or other proprietary rights. our failure to obtain or maintain intellectual property rights that convey competitive advantage, adequately protect our intellectual property or detect or prevent circumvention or unauthorized use of such property and the cost of enforcing our intellectual property rights could adversely impact our competitive position and financial statements.
third parties may claim that we are infringing or misappropriating their intellectual property rights and we could suffer significant litigation expenses, losses or licensing expenses or be prevented from selling products or services.
from time to time, we receive notices from third parties alleging intellectual property infringement or misappropriation. any dispute or litigation regarding intellectual property could be costly and time-consuming due to the complexity of many of our technologies and the uncertainty of intellectual property litigation. our intellectual property portfolio may not be useful in asserting a counterclaim, or negotiating a license, in response to a claim of infringement or misappropriation. in addition, as a result of such claims of infringement or misappropriation, we could lose our rights to critical technology, be unable to license critical technology or sell critical products and services, be required to pay substantial damages or license fees with respect to the infringed rights or be required to redesign our products at substantial cost, any of which could adversely impact our competitive position and financial statements. even if we successfully defend against claims of infringement or misappropriation, we may incur significant costs and diversion of management attention and resources, which could adversely affect our financial statements.
defects and unanticipated use or inadequate disclosure with respect to our products (including software) or services could adversely affect our business, reputation and financial statements.
manufacturing or design defects or "bugs" in, unanticipated use of, safety or quality issues (or the perception of such issues) with respect to, or inadequate disclosure of risks relating to the use of products and services that we make or sell (including items that we source from third parties) can lead to personal injury, death, property damage or other liability. these events could lead to recalls or safety alerts, result in the removal of a product or service from the market and result in product liability or similar claims being brought against us. recalls, removals and product liability and similar claims (regardless of their validity or ultimate outcome) can result in significant costs, as well as negative publicity and damage to our reputation that could reduce demand for our products and services.
the manufacture of many of our products is a highly exacting and complex process, and if we directly or indirectly encounter problems manufacturing products, our reputation, business and financial statements could suffer.
the manufacture of many of our products is a highly exacting and complex process, due in part to strict regulatory requirements. problems may arise during manufacturing for a variety of reasons, including equipment malfunction, failure to follow specific protocols and procedures, problems with raw materials, natural disasters and environmental factors, and if not discovered before the product is released to market could result in recalls and product liability exposure. because of the time required to approve and license certain regulated manufacturing facilities, an alternative manufacturer may not be available on a timely basis to replace such production capacity. any of these manufacturing problems could result in significant costs and liability, as well as negative publicity and damage to our reputation that could reduce demand for our products.
our indebtedness may limit our operations and our use of our cash flow, and any failure to comply with the covenants that apply to our indebtedness could adversely affect our liquidity and financial statements.
as of december 31, 2015, we had approximately $12.9 billion in outstanding indebtedness. in addition, we had the ability to incur approximately an additional $2.0 billion of indebtedness in direct borrowings or under our outstanding commercial paper facilities based on the amounts available under our $6.0 billion of credit facilities which were not being used to backstop outstanding commercial paper balances as of december 31, 2015. our debt level and related debt service obligations can have negative consequences, including (1) requiring us to dedicate significant cash flow from operations to the payment of principal and interest on our debt, which reduces the funds we have available for other purposes such as acquisitions and capital investment; (2) reducing our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and market conditions; and (3) exposing us to interest rate risk since a portion of our debt obligations are at variable rates. we may incur significantly more debt in the future, particularly to finance acquisitions, and there can be no assurance that our cost of funding will not substantially increase.
our current revolving credit facilities and long-term debt obligations also impose certain restrictions on us; for more information please refer to the md&a. if we breach any of these restrictions and do not obtain a waiver from the lenders, subject to applicable cure periods the outstanding indebtedness (and any other indebtedness with cross-default provisions) could be declared immediately due and payable, which would adversely affect our liquidity and financial statements. in addition, any failure to maintain the credit ratings assigned to us by independent rating agencies would adversely affect our cost of funds and could adversely affect our liquidity and access to the capital markets. if we add new debt, the risks described above could increase.
adverse changes in our relationships with, or the financial condition, performance, purchasing patterns or inventory levels of, key distributors and other channel partners could adversely affect our financial statements.
certain of our businesses sell a significant amount of their products to key distributors and other channel partners that have valuable relationships with customers and end-users. some of these distributors and other partners also sell our competitors' products or compete with us directly, and if they favor competing products for any reason they may fail to market our products effectively. adverse changes in our relationships with these distributors and other partners, or adverse developments in their financial condition, performance or purchasing patterns, could adversely affect our financial statements.  the levels of inventory maintained by our distributors and other channel partners, and changes in those levels, can also significantly impact our results of operations in any given period. in addition, the consolidation of distributors and customers in certain of our served industries could adversely impact our profitability.
our financial results are subject to fluctuations in the cost and availability of commodities that we use in our operations.
as discussed in "item 1. business - materials," our manufacturing and other operations employ a wide variety of components, raw materials and other commodities. prices for and availability of these components, raw materials and other commodities have fluctuated significantly in the past. any sustained interruption in the supply of these items could adversely affect our
business. in addition, due to the highly competitive nature of the industries that we serve, the cost-containment efforts of our customers and the terms of certain contracts we are party to, if commodity prices rise we may be unable to pass along cost increases through higher prices. if we are unable to fully recover higher commodity costs through price increases or offset these increases through cost reductions, or if there is a time delay between the increase in costs and our ability to recover or offset these costs, we could experience lower margins and profitability and our financial statements could be adversely affected.
if we cannot adjust our manufacturing capacity or the purchases required for our manufacturing activities to reflect changes in market conditions and customer demand, our profitability may suffer. in addition, our reliance upon sole or limited sources of supply for certain materials, components and services could cause production interruptions, delays and inefficiencies.
we purchase materials, components and equipment from third parties for use in our manufacturing operations. our income could be adversely impacted if we are unable to adjust our purchases to reflect changes in customer demand and market fluctuations, including those caused by seasonality or cyclicality. during a market upturn, suppliers may extend lead times, limit supplies or increase prices. if we cannot purchase sufficient products at competitive prices and quality and on a timely enough basis to meet increasing demand, we may not be able to satisfy market demand, product shipments may be delayed, our costs may increase or we may breach our contractual commitments and incur liabilities. conversely, in order to secure supplies for the production of products, we sometimes enter into noncancelable purchase commitments with vendors, which could impact our ability to adjust our inventory to reflect declining market demands. if demand for our products is less than we expect, we may experience additional excess and obsolete inventories and be forced to incur additional charges and our profitability may suffer.
in addition, some of our businesses purchase certain requirements from sole or limited source suppliers for reasons of quality assurance, cost effectiveness, availability or uniqueness of design. if these or other suppliers encounter financial, operating or other difficulties or if our relationship with them changes, we might not be able to quickly establish or qualify replacement sources of supply. the supply chains for our businesses could also be disrupted by supplier capacity constraints, bankruptcy or exiting of the business for other reasons, decreased availability of key raw materials or commodities and external events such as natural disasters, pandemic health issues, war, terrorist actions, governmental actions and legislative or regulatory changes. any of these factors could result in production interruptions, delays, extended lead times and inefficiencies.
because we cannot always immediately adapt our production capacity and related cost structures to changing market conditions, our manufacturing capacity may at times exceed or fall short of our production requirements. any or all of these problems could result in the loss of customers, provide an opportunity for competing products to gain market acceptance and otherwise adversely affect our profitability.
changes in governmental regulations may reduce demand for our products or services or increase our expenses.
we compete in markets in which we and our customers must comply with supranational, federal, state, local and other jurisdictional regulations, such as regulations governing health and safety, the environment, food and drugs, privacy and electronic communications. we develop, configure and market our products and services to meet customer needs created by these regulations. these regulations are complex, change frequently, have tended to become more stringent over time and may be inconsistent across jurisdictions. any significant change in any of these regulations (or in the interpretation or application thereof) could reduce demand for, increase our costs of producing or delay the introduction of new or modified products and services, or could restrict our existing activities, products and services. in addition, in certain of our markets our growth depends in part upon the introduction of new regulations. in these markets, the delay or failure of governmental and other entities to adopt or enforce new regulations, or the adoption of new regulations which our products and services are not positioned to address, could adversely affect demand. in addition, regulatory deadlines may result in substantially different levels of demand for our products and services from period to period.
work stoppages, union and works council campaigns and other labor disputes could adversely impact our productivity and results of operations.
we have a number of u.s. collective bargaining units and various non-u.s. collective labor arrangements. we are subject to potential work stoppages, union and works council campaigns and other labor disputes, any of which could adversely impact our productivity, results of operations and reputation.
international economic, political, legal, compliance and business factors could negatively affect our financial statements.
in 2015, approximately 56% of our sales were derived from customers outside the u.s. in addition, many of our manufacturing operations, suppliers and employees are located outside the u.s. since our growth strategy depends in part on our ability to further penetrate markets outside the u.s. and increase the localization of our products and services, we expect to continue to increase our sales and presence outside the u.s., particularly in the high-growth markets. our international business (and particularly our business in high-growth markets) is subject to risks that are customarily encountered in non-u.s. operations, including:
•   interruption in the transportation of materials to us and finished goods to our customers;
•   local product preferences and product requirements;
•   changes in a country's or region's political or economic conditions, such as the devaluation of particular currencies;
•   trade protection measures, embargoes and import or export restrictions and requirements;
•   unexpected changes in laws or regulatory requirements, including negative changes in tax laws;
•   limitations on ownership and on repatriation of earnings and cash;
•   the potential for nationalization of enterprises;
•   changes in medical reimbursement policies and programs;
•   limitations on legal rights and our ability to enforce such rights;
•   difficulties in implementing restructuring actions on a timely or comprehensive basis; and
any of these risks could negatively affect our financial statements and growth.
if we suffer loss to our facilities, supply chains, distribution systems or information technology systems due to catastrophe or other events, our operations could be seriously harmed.
our facilities, supply chains, distribution systems and information technology systems are subject to catastrophic loss due to fire, flood, earthquake, hurricane, public health crisis, war, terrorism or other natural or man-made disasters. if any of these facilities, supply chains or systems were to experience a catastrophic loss, it could disrupt our operations, delay production and shipments, result in defective products or services, damage customer relationships and our reputation and result in legal exposure and large repair or replacement expenses. the third-party insurance coverage that we maintain will vary from time to time in both type and amount depending on cost, availability and our decisions regarding risk retention, and may be unavailable or insufficient to protect us against losses.
a significant disruption in, or breach in security of, our information technology systems could adversely affect our business.
we rely on information technology systems, some of which are managed by third parties, to process, transmit and store electronic information (including sensitive data such as confidential business information and personally identifiable data relating to employees, customers and other business partners), and to manage or support a variety of critical business processes and activities. these systems may be damaged, disrupted or shut down due to attacks by computer hackers, computer viruses, employee error or malfeasance, power outages, hardware failures, telecommunication or utility failures, catastrophes or other unforeseen events, and in any such circumstances our system redundancy and other disaster recovery planning may be ineffective or inadequate. in addition, security breaches of our systems (or the systems of our customers, suppliers or other business partners) could result in the misappropriation, destruction or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information or personal data belonging to us or to our employees, partners, customers or suppliers. like many multinational corporations, our information technology systems have been subject to computer viruses, malicious codes, unauthorized access and other cyber-attacks and we expect to be subject to similar attacks in the future as such attacks become more sophisticated and frequent. any of the attacks, breaches or other disruptions or damage described above could interrupt our operations, delay production
and shipments, result in theft of our and our customers' intellectual property and trade secrets, damage customer and business partner relationships and our reputation or result in defective products or services, legal claims and proceedings, liability and penalties under privacy laws and increased costs for security and remediation, each of which could adversely affect our business and financial statements.
our defined benefit pension plans are subject to financial market risks that could adversely affect our financial statements.
the performance of the financial markets and interest rates impact our defined benefit pension plan expenses and funding obligations. significant changes in market interest rates, decreases in the fair value of plan assets, investment losses on plan assets and changes in discount rates may increase our funding obligations and adversely impact our financial statements. in addition, upward pressure on the cost of providing health care coverage to current employees and retirees may increase our future funding obligations and adversely affect our financial statements.
item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ("md&a") is designed to provide a reader of danaher's financial statements with a narrative from the perspective of company management. the company's md&a is divided into five sections:
•   overview
•   liquidity and capital resources
•   critical accounting estimates
•   new accounting standards overview general please see "item 1. business - general" for a discussion of danaher's objectives and methodologies for delivering shareholder value. danaher is a multinational corporation with global operations. during 2015, approximately 56% of danaher's sales were derived from customers outside the united states. as a diversified, global business, danaher's operations are affected by worldwide, regional and industry-specific economic and political factors. danaher's geographic and industry diversity, as well as the range of its products and services, typically help limit the impact of any one industry or the economy of any single country on the consolidated operating results. given the broad range of products manufactured, software and services provided and geographies served, management does not use any indices other than general economic trends to predict the overall outlook for the company. the company's individual businesses monitor key competitors and customers, including to the extent possible their sales, to gauge relative performance and the outlook for the future.
as a result of the company's geographic and industry diversity, the company faces a variety of opportunities and challenges, including rapid technological development (particularly with respect to computing, mobile connectivity, communications and digitization) in most of the company's served markets, the expansion and evolution of opportunities in high-growth markets, trends and costs associated with a global labor force, consolidation of the company's competitors and increasing regulation. the company operates in a highly competitive business environment in most markets, and the company's long-term growth and profitability will depend in particular on its ability to expand its business in high-growth geographies and high-growth market segments, identify, consummate and integrate appropriate acquisitions, develop innovative and differentiated new products, services and software with higher gross profit margins, expand and improve the effectiveness of the company's sales force, continue to reduce costs and improve operating efficiency and quality, and effectively address the demands of an increasingly regulated environment. the company is making significant investments, organically and through acquisitions, to address the rapid pace of technological change in its served markets and to globalize its manufacturing, research and development and customer-facing resources (particularly in high-growth markets) in order to be responsive to the company's customers throughout the world and improve the efficiency of the company's operations.
business performance and outlook while differences exist among the company's businesses, on an overall basis, demand for the company's products, software and services increased in 2015 as compared to 2014 resulting in aggregate year-over-year sales growth from existing businesses of 3.0%. the company's continued investments in sales growth initiatives and the other business-specific factors discussed below also contributed to year-over-year sales growth. geographically, both high-growth and developed markets contributed to year-over-year sales growth from existing businesses during 2015. sales growth rates from existing businesses in high-growth markets grew at a mid-single digit rate in 2015 as compared to 2014 led by strength in china and india, partially offset by weakness in russia and latin america. high-growth markets represented approximately 27% of the company's total sales in 2015. sales from existing businesses in developed markets grew at a low-single digit rate in 2015 as compared to 2014 and were driven by north america and western europe. while individual business results will vary, the company expects sales from existing businesses to continue to grow on a year-over-year basis during 2016 at a level in line with the growth levels experienced in 2015 but remains cautious about challenges due to macro-economic and geopolitical uncertainties, including global uncertainties related to monetary and fiscal policies.
the acquisition of pall, as further discussed below, provides additional sales and earnings growth opportunities for the company's life sciences and diagnostics segment by expanding the segment's geographic and product line diversity,
including new and complementary product and service offerings in the area of filtration, separation and purification technologies, and through the potential acquisition of complementary businesses. as pall is integrated into the company, the company also expects to realize significant cost synergies through the application of the danaher business system and the combined purchasing power of the company and pall.
danaher separation on may 13, 2015, the company announced its intention to separate into two independent, publicly traded companies (the "separation"). completion of the separation will create:
•   a multi-industry, science and technology growth company that will retain the danaher name and consist of danaher's existing life sciences &amp; diagnostics (including pall) and dental segments and water quality as well as the product identification businesses, which in aggregate generated approximately $16.5 billion of revenue in 2015 (adjusted to include the full annual revenues of pall for 2015); and
•   a diversified industrial growth company (fortive corporation ("fortive")) that will consist of danaher's existing test &amp; measurement segment, industrial technologies segment (excluding the product identification businesses) and retail/commercial petroleum business, which in aggregate generated approximately $6.0 billion of revenue in 2015.
the transaction is expected to occur through a tax-free separation. the company is targeting to complete the separation in the third quarter of 2016, subject to final approval by danaher's board of directors and other customary conditions. the separation will be in the form of a pro rata distribution to danaher shareholders of 100% of the outstanding shares of fortive.
acquisitions on august 31, 2015, pentagon merger sub, inc., a new york corporation and an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of the company, acquired all of the outstanding shares of common stock of pall, a new york corporation, for $127.20 per share in cash, for a total purchase price of approximately $13.6 billion, net of assumed debt of $417 million and acquired cash of approximately $1.2 billion (the "pall acquisition"). pall is a leading global provider of filtration, separation and purification solutions that remove contaminants or separate substances from a variety of solids, liquids and gases, and is now part of the company's life sciences & diagnostics segment. in its fiscal year ended july 31, 2015, pall generated consolidated revenues of approximately $2.8 billion. pall serves customers in the biopharmaceutical, food and beverage and medical markets as well as the process technologies, aerospace and microelectronics markets.
the company financed the approximately $13.6 billion acquisition price of pall with approximately $2.5 billion of available cash, approximately $8.1 billion of net proceeds from the issuance and sale of u.s. dollar and euro-denominated commercial paper and €2.7 billion (approximately $3.0 billion based on currency exchange rates as of the date of issuance) of net proceeds from the issuance and sale of euro-denominated senior unsecured notes. subsequent to the pall acquisition, the company used the approximately $2.0 billion of net proceeds from the issuance of u.s. dollar-denominated senior unsecured notes and the approximately chf 755 million ($732 million based on currency exchange rates as of date of issuance) of net proceeds, including the related premium, from the issuance and sale of swiss franc-denominated senior unsecured bonds to repay a portion of the commercial paper issued to finance the pall acquisition.
in addition to the pall acquisition, during 2015 the company acquired 11 businesses for total consideration of approximately $727 million in cash, net of cash acquired. the businesses acquired complement existing units of each of the company's five segments. the aggregate annual sales of these 11 businesses at the time of their respective acquisitions, in each case based on the company's revenues for its last completed fiscal year prior to the acquisition, were approximately $375 million.
disposition of communications business in july 2015, the company consummated the split-off of the majority of its test & measurement segment's communications business (other than the data communications cable installation business and the communication service provider business of fluke networks which are now part of the instruments business of the company's test & measurement segment) to danaher shareholders who elected to exchange danaher shares for ownership interests in the communications business, and the subsequent merger of the communications business with a subsidiary of netscout. danaher shareholders who participated in the exchange offer tendered 26 million shares of danaher common stock (valued at approximately $2.3 billion based on the closing price of danaher's common stock on the date of tender) and received 62.5 million shares of netscout common stock which represented approximately 60% of the shares of netscout common stock outstanding following the combination.
the accounting requirements for reporting the disposition of the communications business as a discontinued operation were met when the separation and merger were completed. accordingly, the accompanying consolidated financial statements for all periods presented reflect this business as discontinued operations. the company allocated a portion of the consolidated interest
expense to discontinued operations based on the ratio of the discontinued business' net assets to the company's consolidated net assets. the company recorded an aggregate after-tax gain on the disposition of this business of $767 million, or $1.08 per diluted share, in its 2015 results in connection with the closing of this transaction representing the value of the 26 million shares of company common stock tendered for the communications business in excess of the carrying value of the business' net assets. this gain was included in the results of discontinued operations for the year ended december 31, 2015 and included $47 million of charges recorded in the fourth quarter of 2015 resulting from the reconciliation of deferred income tax balances used in calculating the gain recorded in the third quarter of 2015. the communications business had revenues of $346 million in 2015 prior to the disposition and $760 million in 2014.
for a discussion of the company's 2014 and 2013 acquisition and divestiture activity, refer to "liquidity and capital resources - investing activities".
sale of investments during 2015, the company received cash proceeds of $43 million from the sale of certain marketable equity securities and recorded a pretax gain related to these sales of $12 million ($8 million after-tax or $0.01 per diluted share).
for a discussion of the company's 2014 and 2013 sale of investments activity, refer to "liquidity and capital resources - investing activities".
results of operations consolidated sales for the year ended december 31, 2015 increased 7.5% compared to 2014. sales from existing businesses contributed 3.0% growth and sales from acquired businesses contributed 10.5% growth on a year-over-year basis. the impact of currency translation reduced reported sales by 6.0% as the u.s. dollar was, on average, stronger against other major currencies during 2015 as compared to exchange rate levels during 2014.
consolidated sales for the year ended december 31, 2014 increased 5.0% compared to 2013. sales from existing businesses contributed 4.0% growth and sales from acquired businesses contributed 1.5% growth on a year-over-year basis. the impact of currency translation reduced reported sales by 0.5% as the u.s. dollar was, on average, stronger against other major currencies during 2014 as compared to exchange rate levels during 2013.
in this report, references to sales from existing businesses refers to sales from continuing operations calculated according to generally accepted accounting principles in the united states ("gaap") but excluding (1) sales from acquired businesses and (2) the impact of currency translation. references to sales or operating profit attributable to acquisitions or acquired businesses refer to gaap sales or operating profit, as applicable, from acquired businesses recorded prior to the first anniversary of the acquisition less the amount of sales and operating profit, as applicable, attributable to divested product lines not considered discontinued operations. the portion of revenue attributable to currency translation is calculated as the difference between (a) the period-to-period change in revenue (excluding sales from acquired businesses) and (b) the period-to-period change in revenue (excluding sales from acquired businesses) after applying current period foreign exchange rates to the prior year period. sales from existing businesses should be considered in addition to, and not as a replacement for or superior to, sales, and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. management believes that reporting the non-gaap financial measure of sales from existing businesses provides useful information to investors by helping identify underlying growth trends in our business and facilitating easier comparisons of our revenue performance with our performance in prior and future periods and to our peers. the company excludes the effect of currency translation from sales from existing businesses because currency translation is not under management's control, is subject to volatility and can obscure underlying business trends, and excludes the effect of acquisitions and divestiture related items because the nature, size and number of acquisitions and divestitures can vary dramatically from period to period and between the company and its peers and can also obscure underlying business trends and make comparisons of long-term performance difficult. references to sales volume refer to the impact of both price and unit sales.
operating profit margins were 16.9% for the year ended december 31, 2015 as compared to 17.5% in 2014. the following factors impacted year-over-year operating profit margin comparisons.
2015 vs. 2014 operating profit margin comparisons were favorably impacted by:
•   higher 2015 sales volumes from existing businesses and incremental year-over-year cost savings associated with the restructuring actions and continuing productivity improvement initiatives taken in 2014 and 2015, net of incremental year-over-year costs associated with various product development, sales and marketing growth investments and the effect of a stronger u.s. dollar in 2015 - 75 basis points
•   lower year-over-year costs associated with restructuring actions and continuing productivity improvement initiatives - 25 basis points
2015 vs. 2014 operating profit margin comparisons were unfavorably impacted by:
•   acquisition related charges associated with pall, including transaction costs deemed significant, change in control payments, and fair value adjustments to acquired inventory and deferred revenue, net of the positive impact of freezing pension benefits - 65 basis points
•   the incremental net dilutive effect in 2015 of acquired businesses, including pall, net of the positive effect of the product line disposition in the third quarter of 2014 - 85 basis points
•   charges associated with the anticipated 2016 separation - 10 basis points the company deems acquisition-related transaction costs incurred in a given period to be significant (generally relating to the company's larger acquisitions) if it determines that such costs exceed the range of acquisition-related transaction costs typical for the company in a given period.
operating profit margins were 17.5% for the year ended december 31, 2014 as compared to 17.1% in 2013. the following factors impacted year-over-year operating profit margin comparisons.
2014 vs. 2013 operating profit margin comparisons were favorably impacted by:
•   higher 2014 sales volumes from existing businesses and incremental year-over-year cost savings associated with the restructuring actions and continuing productivity improvement initiatives taken in 2013 and 2014, net of incremental year-over-year costs associated with various product development, sales and marketing growth investments - 95 basis points
2014 vs. 2013 operating profit margin comparisons were unfavorably impacted by:
•   incremental year-over-year costs associated with restructuring actions and continuing productivity improvement initiatives - 15 basis points
•   the incremental net dilutive effect in 2014 of acquired businesses and acquisition-related charges recorded in 2014 associated with the nobel biocare acquisition, including transaction costs deemed significant and fair value adjustments to acquired inventory, net of the positive effect of the product line disposition in the third quarter of 2014 - 40 basis points business segments sales by business segment for the years ended december 31 are as follows ($ in millions):

sales from existing businesses in the segment's water quality businesses grew at a mid-single digit rate during 2015 as compared with 2014. sales growth in the analytical instrumentation product line continued to be led by strong sales of instruments and related consumables and services in north america, primarily in the u.s. municipal end market, europe and china (although growth slowed sequentially in china during the fourth quarter of 2015, partly due to delays in government projects). year-over-year sales growth in the business' chemical treatment solutions product line was due to continued growth in the united states as well as continued business expansion in latin america. sales in the business' ultraviolet water disinfection product line grew on a year-over-year basis due to continued demand in industrial disinfection end markets in the united states and municipal end markets in the united states and western europe.
sales from existing businesses in the segment's retail petroleum business grew at a mid-single digit rate during 2015 as compared with 2014, as year-over-year demand for the business' dispenser systems, service and point-of-sale systems continued to be strong, primarily in north america. customers, predominantly in the united states, have begun to upgrade point-of-sale systems to comply with deadlines for enhanced security requirements based on the europay, mastercard and visa ("emv") global standard and the company expects this trend to continue to drive growth for the next several years. this growth was partially offset by lower year-over-year sales of retail petroleum products in the middle east, russia and western europe, largely due to softness in demand from integrated oil companies.
operating profit margins increased 160 basis points during 2015 as compared to 2014. the following factors impacted year-over-year operating profit margin comparisons.
2015 vs. 2014 operating profit margin comparisons were favorably impacted by:
•   higher 2015 sales volumes from existing businesses and incremental year-over-year cost savings associated with the restructuring actions and continuing productivity improvement initiatives taken in 2014 and 2015, net of incremental year-over-year costs associated with various product development, sales and marketing growth investments and the effect of a stronger u.s. dollar in 2015 - 135 basis points
•   lower year-over-year costs associated with restructuring actions and continuing productivity improvement initiatives - 70 basis points
2015 vs. 2014 operating profit margin comparisons were unfavorably impacted by:
•   the incremental net dilutive effect in 2015 of acquired businesses - 45 basis points

sales from existing businesses in the segment's diagnostics business grew at a mid-single digit rate during 2015 as compared to 2014. demand in the clinical business increased on a year-over-year basis led by growth in the urinalysis and immunoassay consumable products primarily from continuing strong demand in china and other high-growth markets. continued strong consumable sales in 2015 related to the installed base of blood gas instruments in developed markets as well as strong instrument placement particularly in china and the middle east drove the majority of the year-over-year sales growth in the critical care diagnostic business. increased demand for advanced staining systems and consumables as well as probes primarily in north america and china drove the majority of the year-over-year sales growth in the anatomical pathology diagnostics business.
sales from existing businesses in the segment's life sciences business grew at a low-single digit rate during 2015 as compared to 2014. geographically, sales grew on a year-over-year basis in north america and western europe partially offset by declines in the middle east and brazil. sales of the business' broad range of mass spectrometers continued to grow on a year-over-year basis led by strong sales growth in the clinical markets in north america, western europe and china. sales of confocal and stereo microscopy products decreased on a year-over-year basis led by declines in western europe and high-growth markets which were partially offset by growth in surgical microscopy products, primarily in north america. year-over-year demand for the business' flow cytometry and sample preparation product lines grew in 2015, led by increases in demand in north america, western europe and china.
the pall acquisition provides additional sales and earnings growth opportunities for the segment by expanding geographic and product line diversity, including new product and service offerings in the areas of filtration, separation and purification, and through the potential acquisition of complementary businesses. as pall is integrated into the company over the next several years, the company expects to realize approximately $300 million in annual cost savings as compared to pall's annual expense level prior to acquisition, through the application of the danaher business system and the combined purchasing power of the company and pall.
operating profit margins decreased 210 basis points during 2015 as compared to 2014. the following factors impacted year-over-year operating profit margin comparisons.
2015 vs. 2014 operating profit margin comparisons were favorably impacted by:

•   lower year-over-year costs associated with restructuring actions and continuing productivity improvement initiatives - 30 basis points
2015 vs. 2014 operating profit margin comparisons were unfavorably impacted by:
•   acquisition-related charges associated with pall, including transaction costs deemed significant, change in control payments, and fair value adjustments to acquired inventory and deferred revenue, net of the positive impact of freezing pension benefits - 155 basis points
•   the incremental net dilutive effect in 2015 of acquired businesses (including pall) - 120 basis points depreciation and amortization expense increased during 2015 as compared to 2014 due primarily to the impact of recently acquired businesses, particularly pall, and the resulting increase in depreciable and amortizable assets.
sales from existing businesses in the segment's diagnostics business grew at a mid-single digit rate during 2014 as compared to 2013. demand in the clinical business increased on a year-over-year basis led by continuing strong demand in china and other high-growth markets and a return to growth in north america. continued strong global consumable sales in 2014 related to the installed base of critical care instruments drove the majority of the year-over-year sales growth in the critical care diagnostic
business, which was led by china and other high-growth markets as well as modest increases in western europe. increased demand for advanced staining systems and consumables across all major geographies drove the majority of the year-over-year sales growth in the anatomical pathology diagnostics business. slight overall increases in demand for core histology instruments, led by north america, also contributed to this growth.
sales from existing businesses in the segment's life sciences business grew at a mid-single digit rate during 2014 as compared to 2013 due primarily to continued strong demand for the business' recently introduced products. geographically, sales grew on a year-over-year basis in north america and western europe but declined in china and japan. sales of the business' broad range of mass spectrometers continued to grow on a year-over-year basis led by strong sales growth in the applied markets in north america and western europe. sales of confocal, stereo and surgical microscopy products increased on a year-over-year basis led by strong demand in the developed markets. year-over-year demand for the business' cellular analysis and sample preparation product lines grew at a low single digit rate in 2014, led by increases in demand in north america and western europe that, were largely offset by sales declines in china and japan.
operating profit margins increased 70 basis points during 2014 as compared to 2013. the following factors impacted year-over-year operating profit margin comparisons.
2014 vs. 2013 operating profit margin comparisons were favorably impacted by:
•   higher 2014 sales volumes from existing businesses and incremental year-over-year cost savings associated with the restructuring actions and continuing productivity improvement initiatives taken in 2013 and 2014, net of incremental year-over-year costs associated with various product development, sales and marketing growth investments - 110 basis points

price increases in the segment contributed 0.5% to sales growth on a year-over-year basis during 2015 as compared with 2014 and are reflected as a component of the change in sales from existing businesses.
sales from existing businesses were flat on a year-over-year basis as increased demand for dental treatment units and consumable products, including orthodontic products, primarily in china and other high-growth markets, was offset by softness in demand for imaging products, largely due to destocking in the north american distribution channel, and weaker demand in western europe. management believes the destocking impact will be less significant in 2016 as compared to 2015. lower year-over-year demand for dental equipment in the middle east due to slower project activity during 2015 also adversely impacted year-over-year performance. the acquisition of nobel biocare in december 2014 has provided additional sales and earnings growth opportunities for the company's dental segment by expanding the businesses' geographic and product line diversity, including new and complementary product and service offerings in the area of implant based tooth replacements.
operating profit margins declined 40 basis points during 2015 as compared to 2014. the following factors impacted year-over-year operating profit margin comparisons.

price increases in the segment contributed 0.5% to sales growth on a year-over-year basis during 2014 as compared with 2013 and are reflected as a component of the change in sales from existing businesses.
sales from existing businesses grew on a year-over-year basis as a result of increased demand for all major product categories, with strong sales of imaging products, instruments and implant products, along with modest growth in dental consumables. geographically, year-over-year sales grew in europe and high-growth markets, specifically china and the middle east.
operating profit margins declined 70 basis points during 2014 as compared to 2013. the following factors impacted year-over-year operating profit margin comparisons.
2014 vs. 2013 operating profit margin comparisons were favorably impacted by:

price increases in the segment contributed 1.0% to sales growth on a year-over-year basis during 2015 as compared with 2014 and are reflected as a component of the change in sales from existing businesses.
sales from existing businesses in the segment's product identification businesses grew at a mid-single digit rate during 2015 as compared with 2014, due to continued increased demand for marking and coding equipment and related consumables as well as packaging and color solutions. geographically, year-over-year sales growth was led by north america and europe (although north america declined slightly in the fourth quarter of 2015), but was partly offset by softer demand for the business' packaging and color solutions in brazil and russia.
sales from existing businesses in the segment's automation business increased slightly during 2015 as compared to 2014. a strong increase in year-over-year demand in technology and defense related end-markets in north america and distribution-related end markets in europe, was largely offset by lower demand in north american distribution and industrial automation related end-markets as well as agricultural-related end markets in north america and europe. during the third quarter of 2014, the company sold its electric vehicle systems ("evs")/hybrid product line. the impact of this divestiture is reflected in "acquisitions (divestitures), net" in the components of sales growth table above as the disposition was not deemed a
discontinued operation for financial reporting purposes. see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information related to this transaction.
sales from existing businesses in the segment's other businesses collectively declined at a low-single digit rate during 2015 as compared with 2014. sales in the segment's energetic materials and sensors and controls businesses declined on a year-over-year basis, while sales in the segment's engine retarder business were essentially flat on a year-over-year basis.
operating profit margins increased 140 basis points during 2015 as compared to 2014. year-over-year operating profit margin comparisons were favorably impacted by:
•   higher 2015 sales volumes from existing businesses and incremental year-over-year cost savings associated with the restructuring actions and continuing productivity improvement initiatives taken in 2014 and 2015, net of incremental year-over-year costs associated with various product development, sales and marketing growth investments - 120 basis points
•   lower year-over-year costs associated with restructuring actions and continuing productivity improvement initiatives - 20 basis points
•   the incremental net dilutive effect in 2015 of acquired businesses was fully offset by the positive effect of the product line disposition in the third quarter of 2014
price increases in the segment contributed 1.0% to sales growth on a year-over-year basis during 2014 as compared with 2013 and are reflected as a component of the change in sales from existing businesses.
sales from existing businesses in the segment's product identification businesses grew at a mid-single digit rate during 2014 as compared to 2013. continued increased demand for marking and coding equipment and related consumables as well as packaging and color solutions was partially offset by continued lower year-over-year demand in consumer electronics-related equipment. geographically, year-over-year sales growth was led by north america and europe.
sales from existing businesses in the segment's automation business grew at a low-single digit rate during 2014 as compared to 2013. improved year-over-year demand in industrial automation, in north america distribution and in medical related end-markets was partially offset by lower year-over-year demand in technology, agricultural and defense-related end-markets and the effect of exiting certain low-margin original equipment manufacturer product lines which negatively impacted the first half of 2014. geographically, strong year-over-year demand in china and other high-growth markets as well as moderate sales growth in north america, more than offset year-over-year sales declines in europe.
sales from existing businesses in the segment's other businesses collectively grew at a mid-single digit rate during 2014 as compared to 2013, primarily due to strong demand in the segment's engine retarder business, and to a lesser extent, continued improving demand in the segment's sensors and controls businesses.
operating profit margins increased 160 basis points during 2014 as compared to 2013. year-over-year operating profit margin comparisons were favorably impacted by:
•   higher 2014 sales volumes from existing businesses and incremental year-over-year cost savings associated with the restructuring actions and continuing productivity improvement initiatives taken in 2013 and 2014, net of incremental year-over-year costs associated with various product development, sales and marketing growth investments - 115 basis points
•   lower year-over-year costs associated with restructuring actions and continuing productivity improvement initiatives - 45 basis points

the year-over-year increase in cost of sales during 2015 as compared with 2014, is due primarily to the impact of higher year-over-year sales volumes, including sales volumes from recently acquired businesses, and 2015 acquisition-related charges associated with fair value adjustments to acquired inventory and deferred revenue in connection with the acquisition of pall and nobel biocare during the third quarter of 2015 and the fourth quarter of 2014, respectively, which increased cost of sales by $111 million during 2015. these factors were partially offset by lower year-over-year costs associated with restructuring actions and continuing productivity improvement initiatives and incremental year-over-year cost savings associated with the restructuring actions and continuing productivity improvements taken in 2014 and 2015.
the year-over-year increase in cost of sales during 2014 as compared with 2013, is due primarily to the impact of higher year-over-year sales volumes, acquisition-related charges associated with fair value adjustments to acquired inventory in connection with the acquisition of nobel biocare during the fourth quarter of 2014 and incremental year-over-year costs associated with restructuring actions and continuing productivity improvement initiatives, partially offset by incremental year-over-year cost savings associated with the restructuring actions and continuing productivity improvements taken in 2013 and 2014.
gross profit margins increased 70 basis points on a year-over-year basis during 2015 as compared with 2014, due primarily to the favorable impact of higher year-over-year sales volumes, higher gross profit margins of recently acquired businesses and incremental year-over-year cost savings associated with the restructuring actions and continuing productivity improvements taken in 2014 and 2015. these positive factors more than offset the 2015 acquisition-related charges associated with fair value adjustments to acquired inventory and deferred revenue in connection with the acquisition of pall and nobel biocare during the third quarter of 2015 and the fourth quarter of 2014, respectively, which adversely impacted gross profit margins comparisons by 30 basis points during 2015 as compared with 2014.
gross profit margins increased 50 basis points on a year-over-year basis during 2014 as compared with 2013, due primarily to the favorable impact of higher year-over-year sales volumes and incremental year-over-year cost savings associated with the restructuring actions and continuing productivity improvements taken in 2013 and 2014, partially offset by acquisition-related charges associated with fair value adjustments to acquired inventory in connection with the acquisition of nobel biocare during the fourth quarter of 2014 and incremental year-over-year costs associated with restructuring actions and continuing productivity improvement initiatives.
operating expenses for the year ended december 31
research and development ("r&amp;d") expenses                   1,239.1                 1,157.0                 1,104.4
selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales increased 130 basis points on a year-over-year basis for 2015 compared with 2014. the increase in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales from 2014 to 2015 was driven by continued investments in sales and marketing growth initiatives and higher relative spending levels at recently acquired businesses. in addition, costs incurred in connection with the separation adversely impacted year-over-year comparisons by 10 basis points. change in control payments to pall employees in connection with the pall acquisition, as well as associated transaction costs and amortization charges associated with acquisition-related intangible assets, net of the positive impact of freezing pension benefits, adversely impacted selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales by 20 basis points during 2015. these increases were partially offset by the benefit of increased leverage of the company's
general and administrative cost base resulting from higher 2015 sales, lower year-over-year costs associated with restructuring actions and continuing productivity improvement initiatives and incremental year-over-year cost savings associated with the restructuring actions and continuing productivity improvements taken in 2014 and 2015.
selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales increased 10 basis points on a year-over-year basis for 2014 compared with 2013. the increase in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales from 2013 to 2014 reflects incremental year-over-year investments in the company's sales and marketing growth initiatives, higher corporate expenses and incremental year-over-year costs associated with restructuring actions and continuing productivity improvement initiatives. in addition, transaction costs incurred in connection with the closing of the nobel biocare acquisition during the fourth quarter of 2014 unfavorably impacted the year-over-year comparison by approximately five basis points. these increases were partially offset by the benefit of increased leverage of the company's general and administrative cost base resulting from higher 2014 sales and incremental year-over-year cost savings associated with 2013 and 2014 restructuring actions.
research and development expenses (consisting principally of internal and contract engineering personnel costs) as a percentage of sales remained flat in 2015 as compared with 2014 and 2013.
other income during 2015, the company received cash proceeds of $43 million from the sale of certain marketable equity securities and recorded a pretax gain related to these sales of $12 million ($8 million after-tax or $0.01 per diluted share).
during 2014, the company received cash proceeds of $167 million from the sale of certain marketable equity securities and recorded a pretax gain related to these sales of $123 million ($77 million after-tax or $0.11 per diluted share). in addition, the company completed the divestiture of its evs/hybrid product line for a sale price of $87 million in cash in august 2014. this product line, which was part of the industrial technologies segment, had revenues of approximately $60 million in 2014 prior to the divestiture and approximately $100 million in 2013. operating results of the product line were not significant to segment or overall company reported results. the company recorded a pretax gain on the sale of the product line of $34 million ($26 million after-tax or $0.04 per diluted share) in its third quarter 2014 results. subsequent to the sale, the company has no continuing involvement in the evs/hybrid product line.
during the fourth quarter of 2013, the company sold 5 million of the 8 million shares of align technology, inc. ("align") common stock that the company received in 2009 as a result of a settlement between align and ormco corporation, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the company. the company received cash proceeds of $251 million from the sale of these marketable equity securities and recorded a pretax gain of $202 million ($125 million after-tax or $0.18 per diluted share).
on july 4, 2010, the company entered into a joint venture with cooper industries, plc ("cooper"), combining certain of the company's hand tool businesses with cooper's tools business to form a new entity, apex tool group, llc ("apex"). each of cooper and the company had owned a 50% interest in apex, had an equal number of representatives on apex's board of directors and neither joint venture partner controlled the significant operating and financing activities of apex. the company had accounted for its investment in the joint venture based on the equity method of accounting.
in february 2013, the company and cooper sold apex to an unrelated third party for approximately $1.6 billion. the company received $797 million from the sale, consisting of cash of $759 million (including $67 million of dividends received prior to closing) and a note receivable of $38 million (which has been subsequently collected). the company recognized a pretax gain of $230 million ($144 million after-tax or $0.20 per diluted share) in its first quarter 2013 results in connection with this transaction. the company's share of the 2013 earnings generated by apex prior to the closing of the sale was insignificant. subsequent to the sale of its investment in apex, the company has no continuing involvement in apex's operations.
interest costs interest expense of $163 million for 2015 was $44 million higher than in 2014, due primarily to the higher interest costs associated with the debt issued in connection with the pall acquisition. for a further description of the company's debt as of december 31, 2015 see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements. interest expense of $119 million in 2014 was $22 million lower than the 2013 interest expense of $141 million due primarily to the repayment of the $400 million principal amount of 1.3% senior unsecured notes due 2014 upon maturity in june 2014 in addition to the repayment of the €500 million principal amount of eurobond notes due 2013 and the $300 million principal amount of floating rate senior notes due 2013 upon maturity in july and june 2013, respectively.
income taxes general income tax expense and deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect management's assessment of future taxes expected to be paid on items reflected in the company's financial statements. the company records the tax effect of discrete items and items that are reported net of their tax effects in the period in which they occur.
the company's effective tax rate can be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates (including as a result of business acquisitions and dispositions), changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, accruals related to contingent tax liabilities and period-to-period changes in such accruals, the results of audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns (as discussed below), the expiration of statutes of limitations, the implementation of tax planning strategies, tax rulings, court decisions, settlements with tax authorities and changes in tax laws, including legislative policy changes that may result from the organization for economic co-operation and development's initiative on base erosion and profit shifting. for a description of the tax treatment of earnings that are planned to be reinvested indefinitely outside the united states, refer to "-liquidity and capital resources - cash and cash requirements" below.
the amount of income taxes the company pays is subject to ongoing audits by federal, state and foreign tax authorities, which often result in proposed assessments. management performs a comprehensive review of its global tax positions on a quarterly basis. based on these reviews, the results of discussions and resolutions of matters with certain tax authorities, tax rulings and court decisions and the expiration of statutes of limitations, reserves for contingent tax liabilities are accrued or adjusted as necessary. for a discussion of risks related to these and other tax matters, please refer to "item 1a. risk factors".
year-over-year changes in the tax provision and effective tax rate the company's effective tax rate related to continuing operations for the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 was 21.8%, 25.2% and 24.2%, respectively.
the company's effective tax rate for each of 2015, 2014 and 2013 differs from the u.s. federal statutory rate of 35.0% due principally to the company's earnings outside the united states that are indefinitely reinvested and taxed at rates lower than the u.s. federal statutory rate. the effective tax rate of 21.8% in 2015 includes net tax benefits from foreign exchange losses, releases of valuation allowances related to foreign operating losses and the release of reserves upon the expiration of statutes of limitation, partially offset by changes in estimates associated with prior period uncertain tax positions and other matters. the effective tax rate of 25.2% in 2014 includes tax expense for audit settlements in various jurisdictions, partially offset by the release of valuation allowances and the release of reserves upon the expiration of statutes of limitation. the effective tax rate of 24.2% in 2013 includes recognition of tax benefits associated with favorable resolutions of certain international and domestic uncertain tax positions and the lapse of certain statutes of limitations, partially offset by adjustments of reserve estimates related to prior period uncertain tax positions. the matters referenced above have been treated as discrete items in the periods they occurred and in the aggregate reduced the provision for income taxes by approximately 140 and 20 basis points in 2015 and 2013, respectively, and increased the provision for income taxes by approximately 170 basis points in 2014.
the company conducts business globally, and files numerous consolidated and separate income tax returns in the united states federal, state and foreign jurisdictions. the countries in which the company has a significant presence that have significantly lower statutory tax rates than the united states include china, denmark, germany, singapore, switzerland and the united kingdom. the company's ability to obtain a tax benefit from lower statutory tax rates outside of the united states is dependent on its levels of taxable income in these foreign countries and the amount of foreign earnings which are indefinitely reinvested in those countries. the company believes that a change in the statutory tax rate of any individual foreign country would not have a material effect on the company's consolidated financial statements given the geographic dispersion of the company's taxable income.
the company and its subsidiaries are routinely examined by various domestic and international taxing authorities. the internal revenue service ("irs") has completed examinations of certain of the company's federal income tax returns through 2009 and is currently examining certain of the company's federal income tax returns for 2010 through 2013. in addition, the company has subsidiaries in belgium, brazil, canada, china, denmark, finland, france, germany, india, italy, japan, singapore, sweden, the united kingdom and various other countries, states and provinces that are currently under audit for years ranging from 2003 through 2014.
tax authorities in denmark have raised significant issues related to interest accrued by certain of the company's subsidiaries. on december 10, 2013, the company received assessments from the danish tax authority ("skat") totaling approximately dkk 1.2 billion (approximately $180 million based on exchange rates as of december 31, 2015) including interest through december 31, 2015, imposing withholding tax relating to interest accrued in denmark on borrowings from certain of the
company's subsidiaries for the years 2004-2009. if the skat claims are successful, it is likely that the company would be assessed additional amounts for years 2010-2012 totaling approximately dkk 700 million (approximately $102 million based on exchange rates as of december 31, 2015). management believes the positions the company has taken in denmark are in accordance with the relevant tax laws and intends to vigorously defend its positions. the company appealed these assessments with the national tax tribunal in 2014 and intends on pursuing this matter through the european court of justice should this appeal be unsuccessful. the ultimate resolution of this matter is uncertain, could take many years, and could result in a material adverse impact to the company's financial statements, including its effective tax rate.
as previously disclosed, german tax authorities had raised issues related to the deductibility and taxability of interest accrued by certain of the company's subsidiaries. in the fourth quarter of 2014, the company entered into a settlement agreement with the german tax authorities to resolve these open matters through 2014. the company recorded €49 million (approximately $60 million based on exchange rates as of december 31, 2014) of expense for taxes and interest related to this settlement during the fourth quarter of 2014.
the company's effective tax rate for 2016 is expected to be approximately 23% to 24%. this anticipated rate reflects the benefit from the research and experimentation credit in the united states which was permanently extended in 2015.
discontinued operations as further discussed in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, discontinued operations includes the results of the company's test & measurement segment's communications business (other than the data communications cable installation business and the communication service provider business of fluke networks which are now part of the instruments business of the company's test & measurement segment) which was disposed of during the third quarter of 2015. all periods presented have been restated to reflect the communications business within discontinued operations.
in 2015, earnings from operations of discontinued business, net of tax, were $759 million and reflected the operating results of the communications business as well as the gain on the sale of the communications business. in 2014 and 2013, earnings from operations of discontinued businesses, net of tax, were $55 million and $104 million, respectively and reflected the operations of the communications business.
comprehensive income comprehensive income increased by approximately $1.5 billion in 2015 as compared to 2014, primarily due to the impact of increases in net earnings, foreign currency translation adjustments resulting from the strengthening of the u.s. dollar compared to most major currencies during the year but at a lower rate than in the prior year, and pension and postretirement plan benefit adjustments.  the company recorded a foreign currency translation loss of approximately $1.0 billion for 2015 compared to a translation loss of approximately $1.2 billion for 2014. the company recorded a pension and postretirement plan benefit gain of $81 million for 2015 compared to a loss of $361 million for 2014.
comprehensive income decreased by approximately $2.0 billion in 2014 as compared to 2013, primarily due to the impact of foreign currency translation adjustments resulting from the strengthening of the u.s. dollar compared to most major currencies during the year, in addition to the impact from pension and postretirement plan benefit adjustments.  the company recorded a foreign currency translation loss of approximately $1.2 billion for 2014 compared to a translation loss of $62 million for 2013. pension and postretirement plan benefit adjustments resulted in a loss of $361 million in 2014 compared to a gain of $289 million in 2013.
financial instruments and risk management the company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, credit risk, equity prices and commodity prices, each of which could impact its financial statements. the company generally addresses its exposure to these risks through its normal operating and financing activities. in addition, the company's broad-based business activities help to reduce the impact that volatility in any particular area or related areas may have on its operating profit as a whole.
interest rate risk the company manages interest cost using a mixture of fixed-rate and variable-rate debt. a change in interest rates on long-term debt impacts the fair value of the company's fixed-rate long-term debt but not the company's earnings or cash flow because the interest on such debt is fixed. generally, the fair market value of fixed-rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. as of december 31, 2015, an increase of 100 basis points in interest rates would have decreased the fair value of the company's fixed-rate long-term debt (excluding the lyons, which have not been included in this calculation as the value of this convertible debt is primarily derived from the value of its underlying common stock) by approximately $445 million.
as of december 31, 2015, the company's variable-rate debt obligations consisted primarily of u.s. dollar and euro-based commercial paper borrowings (refer to note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding the company's outstanding commercial paper balances as of december 31, 2015). as a result, the company's primary interest rate exposure results from changes in short-term interest rates. as these shorter duration obligations mature, the company anticipates issuing additional short-term commercial paper obligations to refinance all or part of these borrowings. in 2015, the average annual interest rate associated with outstanding commercial paper borrowings was approximately 20 basis points. a hypothetical increase of this average to 40 basis points would have increased the company's interest expense by $7 million.
currency exchange rate risk the company faces transactional exchange rate risk from transactions with customers in countries outside the united states and from intercompany transactions between affiliates. transactional exchange rate risk arises from the purchase and sale of goods and services in currencies other than danaher's functional currency or the functional currency of its applicable subsidiary. the company also faces translational exchange rate risk related to the translation of financial statements of its foreign operations into u.s. dollars, danaher's functional currency. costs incurred and sales recorded by subsidiaries operating outside of the united states are translated into u.s. dollars using exchange rates effective during the respective period. as a result, the company is exposed to movements in the exchange rates of various currencies against the u.s. dollar. in particular, the company has more sales in european currencies than it has expenses in those currencies. therefore, when european currencies strengthen or weaken against the u.s. dollar, operating profits are increased or decreased, respectively. the effect of a change in currency exchange rates on the company's net investment in international subsidiaries is reflected in the accumulated other comprehensive income component of stockholders' equity. a 10% depreciation in major currencies relative to the u.s. dollar as of december 31, 2015 would have resulted in a reduction of stockholders' equity of approximately $1.4 billion.
currency exchange rates negatively impacted 2015 reported sales by 6.0% on a year-over-year basis as the u.s. dollar was, on average, stronger against most major currencies during 2015 as compared to exchange rate levels during 2014. if the exchange rates in effect as of december 31, 2015 were to prevail throughout 2016, currency exchange rates would adversely impact 2016 estimated sales by approximately 1.5% relative to the company's performance in 2015. additional strengthening of the u.s. dollar against other major currencies would further adversely impact the company's sales and results of operations on an overall basis. any weakening of the u.s. dollar against other major currencies would positively impact the company's sales and results of operations.
the company has generally accepted the exposure to exchange rate movements without using derivative financial instruments to manage this risk. both positive and negative movements in currency exchange rates against the u.s. dollar will therefore continue to affect the reported amount of sales, profit, and assets and liabilities in the company's consolidated financial statements.
on april 2, 2014, the company terminated the japanese yen/u.s. dollar currency swap agreement that had been acquired in connection with a prior business acquisition. the currency swap agreement initially required the company to purchase approximately 184 million japanese yen (jpy/¥) at a rate of $1/¥102.25 on a monthly basis through june 1, 2018. the currency swap did not qualify for hedge accounting, and as a result, changes in the fair value of the currency swap were reflected in selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of earnings each reporting period. the fair value of the currency swap as of the termination date was not significant and the fair value had not
changed significantly during 2014 prior to the swap being terminated. during the year ended december 31, 2013, the company recorded pretax income of $14 million related to changes in the fair value of this currency swap.
credit risk the company is exposed to potential credit losses in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to its financial instruments. financial instruments that potentially subject the company to credit risk consist of cash and temporary investments, receivables from customers and derivatives. the company places cash and temporary investments with various high-quality financial institutions throughout the world and exposure is limited at any one institution. although the company typically does not obtain collateral or other security to secure these obligations, it does regularly monitor the third party depository institutions that hold its cash and cash equivalents. the company's emphasis is primarily on safety and liquidity of principal and secondarily on maximizing yield on those funds.
in addition, concentrations of credit risk arising from receivables from customers are limited due to the diversity of the company's customers. the company's businesses perform credit evaluations of their customers' financial conditions as appropriate and also obtain collateral or other security when appropriate.
the company enters into derivative transactions infrequently and, with the exception of the yen swap noted above, such transactions are generally insignificant to the company's financial condition and results of operations. these transactions are entered into only with high-quality financial institutions and exposure at any one institution is limited.
equity price risk the company's available-for-sale investment portfolio includes publicly traded equity securities that are sensitive to fluctuations in market price. changes in equity prices would result in changes in the fair value of the company's available-for-sale investments due to the difference between the current market price and the market price at the date of purchase or issuance of the equity securities. a 10% decline in the value of these equity securities as of december 31, 2015 would have reduced the fair value of the company's available-for-sale investment portfolio by $34 million.
commodity price risk for a discussion of risks relating to commodity prices, refer "item 1a. risk factors."
liquidity and capital resources management assesses the company's liquidity in terms of its ability to generate cash to fund its operating, investing and financing activities. the company continues to generate substantial cash from operating activities and believes that its operating cash flow and other sources of liquidity will be sufficient to allow it to continue investing in existing businesses, consummating strategic acquisitions, paying interest and servicing debt and managing its capital structure on a short and long-term basis.
following is an overview of the company's cash flows and liquidity for the years ended december 31:
overview of cash flows and liquidity
cash paid for acquisitions                                                        $(14,305.0   )         $(3,128.4   )           $(882.5   )
payments for additions to property, plant and equipment                               (633.0   )            (580.6   )            (538.1   )
payments for purchases of investments                                                  (87.1   )                 -                     -
proceeds from sales of investments and a product line                                   43.0                 253.8                 958.6
all other investing activities                                                          69.9                  30.3                  (2.4   )
net cash used in investing activities                                             $(14,951.0   )         $(3,444.3   )           $(552.5   )
net proceeds from (repayments of) borrowings (maturities of 90 days or less)         3,511.2                 312.2                (763.3   )
proceeds from borrowings (maturities longer than 90 days)                            5,682.9                     -                     -
repayments of borrowings (maturities longer than 90 days)                              (35.5   )            (414.7   )            (967.8   )
all other financing activities                                                          (3.3   )             (20.9   )                 -
net cash provided by (used in) used in financing activities                         $9,050.2               $(218.2   )         $(1,605.8   )
•   operating cash flows from continuing operations increased $210 million, or approximately 6%, during 2015 as compared to 2014, due primarily to higher net earnings which also included higher noncash charges for depreciation, amortization, stock compensation and acquisition related costs. lower levels of investment in working capital during 2015 compared with 2014 also contributed to the increase in operating cash flows for the year.
•   cash paid for acquisitions constituted the most significant use of cash during 2015. the company acquired 12 businesses during 2015, including the acquisition of pall, for total consideration (including assumed debt and net of cash acquired) of approximately $14.3 billion.
•   the company financed the approximately $13.6 billion acquisition price of pall with approximately $2.5 billion of available cash, approximately $8.1 billion of net proceeds from the issuance and sale of u.s. dollar and euro-denominated commercial paper and €2.7 billion (approximately $3.0 billion based on currency exchange rates as of the date of issuance) of net proceeds from the issuance and sale of euro-denominated senior unsecured notes. subsequent to the pall acquisition, the company used the approximately $2.0 billion of net proceeds from the issuance of u.s. dollar-denominated senior unsecured notes and the approximately chf 755 million ($732 million based on currency exchange rates as of the date of issuance) of net proceeds, including the related premium from the issuance and sale of swiss franc-denominated senior unsecured bonds, to repay a portion of the commercial paper issued to finance a portion of the pall acquisition.
operating activities cash flows from operating activities can fluctuate significantly from period to period as working capital needs and the timing of payments for income taxes, restructuring activities, pension funding and other items impact reported cash flows.
operating cash flows from continuing operations were approximately $3.8 billion for 2015, an increase of $210 million, or approximately 6%, as compared to 2014. the year-over-year change in operating cash flows from 2014 to 2015 was primarily attributable to the following factors:
•   2015 operating cash flows benefited from higher net earnings as compared to 2014 excluding in both years the impact of gains included in other nonoperating income. these nonoperating gains, which include gains from sales of
investments, product lines and discontinued operations, are reflected in the investing activities section of the statement of cash flows and, therefore, do not contribute to operating cash flows.
•   the aggregate of trade accounts receivable, inventories and trade accounts payable provided $172 million in operating cash flows during 2015, compared to $45 million provided in 2014. the amount of cash flow generated from or used by the aggregate of trade accounts receivable, inventories and trade accounts payable depends upon how effectively the company manages the cash conversion cycle, which effectively represents the number of days that elapse from the day it pays for the purchase of raw materials and components to the collection of cash from its customers and can be significantly impacted by the timing of collections and payments in a period.
•   the aggregate of prepaid expenses and other assets and accrued expenses and other liabilities provided $31 million in operating cash flows during 2015, compared to $18 million used in 2014. the timing of cash payments for income taxes and various employee related liabilities, including with respect to recently acquired companies, drove the majority of this change.
•   net earnings from continuing operations for 2015 reflected an increase of $162 million of depreciation and amortization expense as compared to 2014. amortization expense primarily relates to the amortization of intangible assets acquired in connection with acquisitions. depreciation expense relates to both the company's manufacturing and operating facilities as well as instrumentation leased to customers under operating-type lease arrangements. depreciation and amortization are noncash expenses that decrease earnings without a corresponding impact to operating cash flows.
operating cash flows from continuing operations were approximately $3.6 billion for 2014, an increase of $151 million, or 4% as compared to 2013. this increase was primarily attributable to the increase in operating profit in 2014 as compared to 2013.
investing activities cash flows relating to investing activities consist primarily of cash used for acquisitions and capital expenditures, including instruments leased to customers, cash used for investments and cash proceeds from divestitures of businesses or assets.
net cash used in investing activities was approximately $15.0 billion during 2015 compared to approximately $3.4 billion and $553 million of net cash used in 2014 and 2013, respectively.
acquisitions, divestitures and sale of investments
2015 acquisitions, divestitures and sale of investments for a discussion of the company's 2015 acquisitions, divestitures and the sale of certain marketable equity securities, refer to "-overview."
2014 acquisitions, divestitures and sale of investments in december 2014, the company successfully completed its tender offer for the outstanding shares of common stock of nobel biocare and acquired substantially all of the nobel shares, with the remainder of the nobel shares acquired in 2015 pursuant to a squeeze-out transaction, for an aggregate cash purchase price of approximately chf 1.9 billion (approximately $1.9 billion based on exchange rates as of the date the shares of common stock were acquired) including debt assumed and net of cash acquired. headquartered in zurich, switzerland, nobel biocare is a world leader in the field of innovative implant-based dental restorations with a portfolio of solutions that include dental implant systems, high-precision individualized prosthetics, biomaterials and digital diagnostics, treatment planning and guided surgery. nobel biocare had revenues of €567 million in 2013 (approximately $780 million based on exchange rates as of december 31, 2013), and is now part of the company's dental segment. the company financed the acquisition of nobel biocare from available cash.
in addition to the acquisition of nobel biocare, during 2014 the company acquired 16 businesses for total consideration of approximately $1.3 billion in cash, net of cash acquired. the businesses acquired complement existing units of the test & measurement, environmental, life sciences & diagnostics and dental segments. the aggregate annual sales of these 16 businesses at the time of their respective acquisitions, in each case based on the company's revenues for its last completed fiscal year prior to the acquisition, were approximately $420 million.
in august 2014, the company completed the divestiture of its electric vehicle systems ("evs")/hybrid product line for a sale price of $87 million in cash. this product line, which was part of the industrial technologies segment, had revenues of approximately $60 million in 2014 prior to the divestiture and approximately $100 million in 2013. operating results of the product line were not significant to segment or overall company reported results in 2014. the company recorded a pretax gain
on the sale of the product line of $34 million ($26 million after-tax or $0.04 per diluted share) in its third quarter 2014 results. subsequent to the sale, the company has no continuing involvement in the evs/hybrid product line. in accordance with asu no. 2014-08, reporting discontinued operations and disclosures of disposals of components of an entity, which the company adopted at the beginning of the third quarter of 2014, the divestiture of the evs/hybrid product line was not classified as a discontinued operation in this form 10-k since the disposition does not represent a strategic shift that will have a major effect on the company's operations and financial statements.
during 2014, the company received cash proceeds of $167 million from the sale of certain marketable equity securities and recorded a pretax gain related to these sales of $123 million ($77 million after-tax or $0.11 per diluted share).
2013 acquisitions, divestitures and sale of investments during 2013, the company acquired 12 businesses for total consideration of $883 million in cash, net of cash acquired. the businesses acquired complement existing units of the industrial technologies, life sciences & diagnostics, environmental and test & measurement segments. the aggregate annual sales of these 12 businesses at the time of their respective acquisitions, in each case based on the company's revenues for its last completed fiscal year prior to the acquisition, were approximately $300 million.
during the fourth quarter of 2013, the company sold approximately 5 million of the approximately 8 million shares of align common stock that the company received in 2009 as a result of a settlement between align and ormco. the company received cash proceeds of $251 million from the sale of these securities and recorded a pretax gain of $202 million ($125 million after-tax or $0.18 per diluted share).
on july 4, 2010, the company entered into a joint venture with cooper, combining certain of the company's hand tool businesses with cooper's tools business to form a new entity, apex. in february 2013, the company and cooper sold apex to an unrelated third party for approximately $1.6 billion. the company received $797 million from the sale, consisting of cash of $759 million (including $67 million of dividends received prior to closing) and a note receivable of $38 million (which has been subsequently collected). the company recognized a pretax gain of $230 million ($144 million after-tax or $0.20 per diluted share) in its first quarter 2013 results in connection with this transaction.
capital expenditures capital expenditures are made primarily for increasing capacity, replacing equipment, supporting new product development, improving information technology systems and the manufacture of instruments that are used in operating-type lease arrangements that certain of the company's businesses enter into with customers. capital expenditures totaled $633 million in 2015, $581 million in 2014 and $538 million in 2013. the increase in capital spending in 2015 is due to continued investments in other operating assets, including operating assets at newly acquired businesses such as nobel biocare and pall, partially offset by year-over-year differences in the timing of investments in equipment leased to customers. the increase in capital spending in 2014 is due primarily to increases in equipment leased to customers. in 2016, the company expects capital spending (including with respect to the fortive businesses that the company anticipates spinning-off in 2016) to be approximately $750 million, though actual expenditures will ultimately depend on business conditions.
financing activities cash flows from financing activities consist primarily of cash flows associated with the issuance and repayments of commercial paper and other debt, issuances and repurchases of common stock, excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation, and payments of cash dividends to shareholders. financing activities provided cash of approximately $9.1 billion during 2015 compared to $218 million of cash used during 2014. cash provided by financing activities in 2015 primarily relates to the approximately $5.0 billion of proceeds from the sale of u.s. dollar and euro-denominated senior unsecured notes, $732 million of proceeds from the sale of swiss franc-denominated senior unsecured bonds and approximately $5.7 billion of proceeds from the sale of u.s. dollar and euro-denominated commercial paper, in each case related to the financing of the pall acquisition. u.s. and euro-denominated commercial paper outstanding at any one time during the year ended december 31, 2015 had balances ranging from $450 million to approximately $9.8 billion, carried interest at annual rates ranging between -0.03% and 0.5% and had original maturities between one and 182 days.
total debt was approximately $12.9 billion and $3.5 billion as of december 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. the company had the ability to incur approximately an additional $2.0 billion of indebtedness in direct borrowings or under our outstanding commercial paper facilities based on the amounts available under the company's $6.0 billion of credit facilities which were not being used to backstop outstanding commercial paper balances as of december 31, 2015. refer to note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding the company's financing activities and indebtedness, including the company's
outstanding debt as of december 31, 2015, the financing for the pall acquisition and the company's commercial paper program and related credit facilities.
shelf registration statement the company has filed a "well-known seasoned issuer" shelf registration statement on form s-3 with the sec that registers an indeterminate amount of debt securities, common stock, preferred stock, warrants, depositary shares, purchase contracts and units for future issuance. the company utilized this shelf registration statement for the offering and sale of the u.s. dollar and euro-denominated senior unsecured notes issued to finance the pall acquisition. the company expects to use net proceeds realized by the company from future securities sales off this shelf registration statement for general corporate purposes, including without limitation repayment or refinancing of debt or other corporate obligations, acquisitions, capital expenditures, share repurchases and dividends and working capital.
stock repurchase program on july 16, 2013, the company's board of directors approved a new repurchase program (the "repurchase program") authorizing the repurchase of up to 20 million shares of the company's common stock from time to time on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. there is no expiration date for the repurchase program, and the timing and amount of any shares repurchased under the program will be determined by the company's management based on its evaluation of market conditions and other factors. the repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time. any repurchased shares will be available for use in connection with the company's equity compensation plans (or any successor plan) and for other corporate purposes. as of december 31, 2015, 20 million shares remained available for repurchase pursuant to the repurchase program. the company expects to fund any future stock repurchases using the company's available cash balances or proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper.
except in connection with the disposition of the company's communications business to netscout, neither the company nor any "affiliated purchaser" repurchased any shares of company common stock during 2015, 2014 or 2013. refer to note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for discussion of the 26 million shares of danaher common stock tendered to and repurchased by the company in connection with the disposition of the company's communications business to netscout.
dividends the company declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.135 per share that was paid on january 29, 2016 to holders of record on december 21, 2015. aggregate cash payments for dividends during 2015 were $354 million. dividend payments were higher in 2015 as compared to 2014 as the company increased its quarterly dividend rate in the first quarter of 2015 to $0.135 per share.
cash and cash requirements as of december 31, 2015, the company held approximately $791 million of cash and cash equivalents that were invested in highly liquid investment-grade debt instruments with a maturity of 90 days or less with an approximate weighted average annual interest rate of 0.01%. of this amount, $36 million was held within the united states and $755 million was held outside of the united states. the company will continue to have cash requirements to support working capital needs, capital expenditures and acquisitions, pay interest and service debt, pay taxes and any related interest or penalties, fund its restructuring activities and pension plans as required, repurchase shares of the company's common stock, pay dividends to shareholders and support other business needs. with respect to the company's other cash requirements, the company generally intends to use available cash and internally generated funds to meet these cash requirements, but in the event that additional liquidity is required, particularly in connection with acquisitions, the company may also borrow under its commercial paper programs or credit facilities, enter into new credit facilities and either borrow directly thereunder or use such credit facilities to backstop additional borrowing capacity under its commercial paper programs and/or access the capital markets. the company also may from time to time access the capital markets, including to take advantage of favorable interest rate environments or other market conditions.
while repatriation of some cash held outside the united states may be restricted by local laws, most of the company's foreign cash balances could be repatriated to the united states but, under current law, would be subject to u.s. federal income taxes, less applicable foreign tax credits. for most of its foreign subsidiaries, the company makes an election regarding the amount of earnings intended for indefinite reinvestment, with the balance available to be repatriated to the united states. the company has recorded a deferred tax liability for the funds that are available to be repatriated to the united states. no provisions for u.s. income taxes have been made with respect to earnings that are planned to be reinvested indefinitely outside the united states, and the amount of u.s. income taxes that may be applicable to such earnings is not readily determinable given the various tax planning alternatives the company could employ if it repatriated these earnings. the cash that the
company's foreign subsidiaries hold for indefinite reinvestment is generally used to finance foreign operations and investments, including acquisitions. as of december 31, 2015, the total amount of earnings planned to be reinvested indefinitely and the basis difference in investments outside of the united states for which deferred taxes have not been provided was approximately $23.5 billion. as of december 31, 2015, management believes that it has sufficient liquidity to satisfy its cash needs, including its cash needs in the united states.
during 2015, the company contributed $49 million to its u.s. defined benefit pension plan and $53 million to its non-u.s. defined benefit pension plans. during 2016, the company's cash contribution requirements for its u.s. and its non-u.s. defined benefit pension plans (including any pension plans to be assumed by the fortive businesses that the company anticipates spinning-off in 2016) are expected to be approximately $40 million and $55 million, respectively. the ultimate amounts to be contributed depend upon, among other things, legal requirements, underlying asset returns, the plan's funded status, the anticipated tax deductibility of the contribution, local practices, market conditions, interest rates and other factors.
contractual obligations the following table sets forth, by period due or year of expected expiration, as applicable, a summary of the company's contractual obligations as of december 31, 2015 under (1) long-term debt obligations, (2) leases, (3) purchase obligations and (4) other long-term liabilities reflected on the company's balance sheet under gaap. the amounts presented in the table below include $971 million of noncurrent gross unrecognized tax benefits. however, the timing of these liabilities is uncertain, and therefore, they have been included in the "more than 5 years" column in the table below. refer to note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on unrecognized tax benefits. certain of the company's acquisitions also involve the potential payment of contingent consideration. the table below does not reflect any such obligations, as the timing and amounts of any such payments are uncertain. refer to "-off-balance sheet arrangements" for a discussion of other contractual obligations that are not reflected in the table below.
capital lease obligations (b)                                                                                                          26.7                                                                                                             3.6                                                                                                             7.6                                                                                                             1.4                                                                                                            14.1
interest payments on long-term debt and capital lease obligations (c)                                                               1,674.6                                                                                                           229.8                                                                                                           407.2                                                                                                           265.8                                                                                                           771.8
other long-term liabilities reflected on the company's balance sheet under gaap (f)                                                 6,262.6                                                                                                               -                                                                                                           915.6                                                                                                           726.4                                                                                                         4,620.6
(a) as described in note 9 to the consolidated financial statements.
(b) amounts do not include interest payments. interest on long-term debt and capital lease obligations is reflected in a separate line in the table.
(c) interest payments on long-term debt are projected for future periods using the interest rates in effect as of december 31, 2015. certain of these projected interest payments may differ in the future based on changes in market interest rates.
(d) as described in note 15 to the consolidated financial statements, certain leases require the company to pay real estate taxes, insurance, maintenance and other operating expenses associated with the leased premises. these future costs are not included in the schedule above.
(e) consist of agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on the company and that specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased, fixed, minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction.
(f) primarily consist of obligations under product service and warranty policies and allowances, performance and operating cost guarantees, estimated environmental remediation costs, self-insurance and litigation claims, postretirement benefits, pension obligations, deferred tax liabilities and deferred compensation obligations. the timing of cash flows associated with these obligations is based upon management's estimates over the terms of these arrangements and is largely based upon historical experience.
off-balance sheet arrangements the following table sets forth, by period due or year of expected expiration, as applicable, a summary of off-balance sheet commitments of the company as of december 31, 2015.
amount of commitment expiration per period
guarantees consist primarily of outstanding standby letters of credit, bank guarantees and performance and bid bonds. these guarantees have been provided in connection with certain arrangements with vendors, customers, financing counterparties and governmental entities to secure the company's obligations and/or performance requirements related to specific transactions.
other off-balance sheet arrangements the company has from time to time divested certain of its businesses and assets. in connection with these divestitures, the company often provides representations, warranties and/or indemnities to cover various risks and unknown liabilities, such as claims for damages arising out of the use of products or relating to intellectual property matters, commercial disputes, environmental matters or tax matters. the company has not included any such items in the contractual obligations table above because they relate to unknown conditions and the company cannot estimate the potential liabilities from such matters, but the company does not believe it is reasonably possible that any such liability will have a material effect on the company's financial statements. in addition, as a result of these divestitures, as well as restructuring activities, certain properties leased by the company have been sublet to third parties. in the event any of these third parties vacate any of these premises, the company would be legally obligated under master lease arrangements. the company believes that the financial risk of default by such sub-lessors is individually and in the aggregate not material to the company's financial statements.
in the normal course of business, the company periodically enters into agreements that require it to indemnify customers, suppliers or other business partners for specific risks, such as claims for injury or property damage arising out of the company's products or services or claims alleging that company products, services or software infringe third party intellectual property. the company has not included any such indemnification provisions in the contractual obligations table above. historically, the company has not experienced significant losses on these types of indemnification obligations.
the company's restated certificate of incorporation requires it to indemnify to the full extent authorized or permitted by law any person made, or threatened to be made a party to any action or proceeding by reason of his or her service as a director or officer of the company, or by reason of serving at the request of the company as a director or officer of any other entity, subject to limited exceptions. danaher's amended and restated by-laws provide for similar indemnification rights. in addition, danaher has executed with each director and executive officer of danaher corporation an indemnification agreement which provides for substantially similar indemnification rights and under which danaher has agreed to pay expenses in advance of the final disposition of any such indemnifiable proceeding. while the company maintains insurance for this type of liability, a significant deductible applies to this coverage and any such liability could exceed the amount of the insurance coverage.
legal proceedings please refer to note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding legal proceedings and contingencies, and for a discussion of risks related to legal proceedings and contingencies, please refer to "item 1a. risk factors."
critical accounting estimates management's discussion and analysis of the company's financial condition and results of operations is based upon the company's consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states. the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. the company bases these estimates and judgments on historical experience, the current economic environment and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. actual results may differ materially from these estimates and judgments.
the company believes the following accounting estimates are most critical to an understanding of its financial statements. estimates are considered to be critical if they meet both of the following criteria: (1) the estimate requires assumptions about material matters that are uncertain at the time the estimate is made, and (2) material changes in the estimate are reasonably likely from period to period. for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting estimates, refer to note 1 in the company's consolidated financial statements.
acquired intangibles-the company's business acquisitions typically result in the recognition of goodwill, in-process research and development and other intangible assets, which affect the amount of future period amortization expense and possible impairment charges that the company may incur. refer to notes 1, 2 and 6 in the company's consolidated financial statements for a description of the company's policies relating to goodwill, acquired intangibles and acquisitions.
in performing its goodwill impairment testing, the company estimates the fair value of its reporting units primarily using a market-based approach. the company estimates fair value based on multiples of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("ebitda") determined by current trading market multiples of earnings for companies operating in businesses similar to each of the company's reporting units, in addition to recent market available sale transactions of comparable businesses. in evaluating the estimates derived by the market-based approach, management makes judgments about the relevance and reliability of the multiples by considering factors unique to its reporting units, including operating results, business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows, and transactions and marketplace data as well as judgments about the comparability of the market proxies selected. in certain circumstances the company also estimates fair value utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis (i.e., an income approach) in order to validate the results of the market approach. the discounted cash flow model requires judgmental assumptions about projected revenue growth, future operating margins, discount rates and terminal values. there are inherent uncertainties related to these assumptions and management's judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill impairment.
as of december 31, 2015, the company had 23 reporting units for goodwill impairment testing. reporting units resulting from recent acquisitions generally present the highest risk of impairment. management believes the impairment risk associated with these reporting units decreases as these businesses are integrated into the company and better positioned for potential future earnings growth. the carrying value of the goodwill included in each individual reporting unit ranges from $7 million to approximately $9.4 billion. the company's annual goodwill impairment analysis in 2015 indicated that in all instances, the fair values of the company's reporting units exceeded their carrying values and consequently did not result in an impairment charge. the excess of the estimated fair value over carrying value (expressed as a percentage of carrying value for the respective reporting unit) for each of the company's reporting units as of the annual testing date ranged from approximately 0% to approximately 900%. in order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations used in the goodwill impairment test, the company applied a hypothetical 10% decrease to the fair values of each reporting unit and compared those hypothetical values to the reporting unit carrying values. based on this hypothetical 10% decrease, the excess of the estimated fair value over carrying value (expressed as a percentage of carrying value for the respective reporting unit) for each of the company's reporting units ranged from approximately -10% to approximately 800%. after applying the hypothetical 10% decrease, two reporting units' hypothetical fair values were lower than their respective carrying values. management evaluated other factors relating to the fair value of these reporting units, including as applicable results of the estimate of fair value using an income approach, the short period of time since the acquisition of these businesses, market positions of the businesses, comparability of market sales transactions and financial and operating performance, and concluded no impairment charge was required.
the company reviews identified intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable. the company also tests intangible assets with indefinite lives at least annually for impairment. determining whether an impairment loss occurred requires a comparison of the carrying amount to the sum of undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. these analyses require management to make judgments and estimates about future revenues, expenses, market conditions and discount rates related to these assets.
if actual results are not consistent with management's estimates and assumptions, goodwill and other intangible assets may be overstated and a charge would need to be taken against net earnings which would adversely affect the company's financial statements.
contingent liabilities-as discussed in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements, the company is, from time to time, subject to a variety of litigation and similar contingent liabilities incidental to its business (or the business operations of previously owned entities). the company recognizes a liability for any contingency that is known or probable of occurrence and reasonably estimable. these assessments require judgments concerning matters such as litigation developments and outcomes, the anticipated outcome of negotiations, the number of future claims and the cost of both pending and future claims. in addition, because most contingencies are resolved over long periods of time, liabilities may change in the future due to various factors, including those discussed in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements. if the reserves established by
the company with respect to these contingent liabilities are inadequate, the company would be required to incur an expense equal to the amount of the loss incurred in excess of the reserves, which would adversely affect the company's financial statements.
revenue recognition-the company derives revenues from the sale of products and services. refer to note 1 to the company's consolidated financial statements for a description of the company's revenue recognition policies.
although most of the company's sales agreements contain standard terms and conditions, certain agreements contain multiple elements or non-standard terms and conditions. as a result, judgment is sometimes required to determine the appropriate accounting, including whether the deliverables specified in these agreements should be treated as separate units of accounting for revenue recognition purposes, and, if so, how the consideration should be allocated among the elements and when to recognize revenue for each element. the company allocates revenue to each element in the contractual arrangement based on the selling price hierarchy that, in some instances, may require the company to estimate the selling price of certain deliverables that are not sold separately or where third party evidence of pricing is not observable. the company's estimate of selling price impacts the amount and timing of revenue recognized in multiple element arrangements. the company also enters into lease arrangements with customers, which requires the company to determine whether the arrangements are operating or sales-type leases. certain of the company's lease contracts are customized for larger customers and often result in complex terms and conditions that typically require significant judgment in applying the lease accounting criteria.
if the company's judgments regarding revenue recognition prove incorrect, the company's revenues in particular periods may be adversely affected.
pension and other postretirement benefits-for a description of the company's pension and other postretirement benefit accounting practices, refer to notes 10 and 11 in the company's consolidated financial statements. calculations of the amount of pension and other postretirement benefit costs and obligations depend on the assumptions used in the actuarial valuations, including assumptions regarding discount rates, expected return on plan assets, rates of salary increases, health care cost trend rates, mortality rates, and other factors. if the assumptions used in calculating pension and other postretirement benefits costs and obligations are incorrect or if the factors underlying the assumptions change (as a result of differences in actual experience, changes in key economic indicators or other factors) the company's financial statements could be materially affected. a 50 basis point reduction in the discount rates used for the plans would have increased the u.s. net obligation by $147 million ($92 million on an after-tax basis) and the non-u.s. net obligation by $157 million ($118 million on an after-tax basis) from the amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements as of december 31, 2015.
for 2015, the estimated long-term rate of return for the u.s. plan is 7.5%, and the company intends to use an assumption of 7.0% for 2016. due to this decrease in the estimated long term rate of return on assets, there will be an increase in the expense of approximately $9 million in 2016. this expected rate of return reflects the asset allocation of the plan and the expected long-term returns on equity and debt investments included in plan assets. the u.s. plan targets to invest between 60% and 70% of its assets in equity portfolios which are invested in funds that are expected to mirror broad market returns for equity securities or in assets with characteristics similar to equity investments. the balance of the asset portfolio is generally invested in bond funds. the company's non-u.s. plan assets consist of various insurance contracts, equity and debt securities as determined by the administrator of each plan. the estimated long-term rate of return for the non-u.s. plans was determined on a plan by plan basis based on the nature of the plan assets and ranged from 1.10% to 6.00%. if the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets for 2015 was reduced by 50 basis points, pension expense for the u.s. and non-u.s. plans for 2015 would have increased $9 million ($6 million on an after-tax basis) and $5 million ($4 million on an after-tax basis), respectively.
effective december 31, 2015, the company changed its estimate of the service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit cost for its u.s. and non-u.s. pension and other postretirement benefit plans. previously, the company estimated the service and interest cost components utilizing a single weighted-average discount rate derived from the yield curve used to measure the benefit obligation. the new estimate utilizes a full yield curve approach in the estimation of these components by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to their underlying projected cash flows. the new estimate provides a more precise measurement of service and interest costs by improving the correlation between projected benefit cash flows and their corresponding spot rates. the change does not affect the measurement of the company's u.s. and non-u.s. pension and other postretirement benefit obligations and it is accounted for as a change in accounting estimate that is inseparable from a change in accounting principle, which is applied prospectively. for fiscal 2016, the change in estimate is expected to reduce u.s. and non-u.s. pension and other postretirement net periodic benefit plan cost by $25 million when compared to the prior estimate.
for a discussion of the company's 2015 and anticipated 2016 defined benefit pension plan contributions, please see "-liquidity and capital resources - cash and cash requirements".
income taxes-for a description of the company's income tax accounting policies, refer to notes 1 and 12 to the company's consolidated financial statements. the company establishes valuation allowances for its deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized which requires management to make judgments and estimates regarding: (1) the timing and amount of the reversal of taxable temporary differences, (2) expected future taxable income, and (3) the impact of tax planning strategies. future changes to tax rates would also impact the amounts of deferred tax assets and liabilities and could have an adverse impact on the company's financial statements.
the company provides for unrecognized tax benefits when, based upon the technical merits, it is "more likely than not" that an uncertain tax position will not be sustained upon examination. judgment is required in evaluating tax positions and determining income tax provisions. the company re-evaluates the technical merits of its tax positions and may recognize an uncertain tax benefit in certain circumstances, including when: (1) a tax audit is completed; (2) applicable tax laws change, including a tax case ruling or legislative guidance; or (3) the applicable statute of limitations expires.
in addition, certain of the company's tax returns are currently under review by tax authorities including in denmark (see "-results of operations - income taxes" and note 12 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements). management believes the positions taken in these returns are in accordance with the relevant tax laws. however, the outcome of these audits is uncertain and could result in the company being required to record charges for prior year tax obligations which could have a material adverse impact to the company's financial statements, including its effective tax rate.
an increase in the company's nominal tax rate of 1.0% would have resulted in an additional income tax provision for continuing operations for the fiscal year ended december 31, 2015 of $33 million.
new accounting standards in december 2015, the financial accounting standards board ("fasb") issued accounting standards update ("asu") no. 2015-17, income taxes (topic 740): balance sheet classification of deferred taxes ("asu 2015-17"). asu 2015-17 simplifies the presentation of deferred income taxes by requiring that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position. the standard is effective for financial statements issued for annual periods beginning after december 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods and may be applied either prospectively to all deferred tax liabilities and assets or retrospectively to all periods presented. the company has chosen to early adopt this asu prospectively, and therefore, the 2015 consolidated balance sheet reflects the new disclosure requirements.
in september 2015, the fasb issued asu no. 2015-16, simplifying the accounting for measurement-period adjustments (topic 805), which eliminates the requirement for an acquirer in a business combination to account for measurement-period adjustments retrospectively. the new guidance requires that the cumulative impact of a measurement-period adjustment (including the impact on prior periods) be recognized in the reporting period in which the adjustment is identified which eliminates the requirement to restate prior period financial statements. the asu requires disclosure of the nature and amount of measurement-period adjustments as well as information with respect to the portion of the adjustments recorded in current-period earnings that would have been recorded in previous reporting periods if the adjustments to provisional amounts had been recognized as of the acquisition date. the company has chosen to early adopt this asu and therefore, disclosures included within these consolidated financial statements have been updated to reflect the new disclosure requirements.
in may 2015, the fasb issued asu no. 2015-07, disclosures for investments in certain entities that calculate net asset value per share (or its equivalent) ("asu 2015-07"). asu 2015-07 removes the requirement to categorize within the fair value hierarchy investments for which fair values are estimated using the net asset value practical expedient provided by accounting standards codification 820, fair value measurement. disclosures about investments in certain entities that calculate net asset value per share are limited under the new standard to those investments for which the plan has elected to estimate the fair value using the net asset value practical expedient. the asu is effective for entities (other than public business entities) for fiscal years beginning after december 15, 2016, with retrospective application to all periods presented, with early adoption permitted. the company has chosen to early adopt this asu and therefore, disclosures included within these consolidated financial statements have been updated to reflect the new disclosure requirements.
in april 2015, the fasb issued asu no. 2015-03, interest - imputation of interest (subtopic 835-30): simplifying the presentation of debt issuance costs. this asu requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. the asu is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after december 15, 2015 but the company has chosen to early adopt the standard and has applied the guidance to all 2015 debt issuances. the company did not retrospectively apply this guidance to debt offerings prior to 2015 as the impact to the consolidated financial statements was not material.
in may 2014, the fasb issued asu no. 2014-09, revenue from contracts with customers (topic 606), which impacts virtually all aspects of an entity's revenue recognition. the core principle of the new standard is that revenue should be recognized to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. on july 9, 2015, the fasb deferred the effective date of the standard by one year which results in the new standard being effective for the company at the beginning of its first quarter of fiscal year 2018. the company is currently assessing the impact that the adoption of the new standard will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures, including possible transition alternatives.

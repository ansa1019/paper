item 1a. risk factors set forth below and elsewhere in this report and in other documents we file with the sec are risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward-looking statements contained in this report and other public statements we make. based on the information currently known to us, we believe that the matters discussed below identify the material risk factors affecting our business. however, the risks and uncertainties we face are not limited to those described below. additional risks
and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial (but that later become material) may also adversely affect our business.
the success of our business is significantly related to general economic conditions and, accordingly, our business, operations and financial condition could be adversely affected by economic slowdowns, liquidity crises, fiscal uncertainty and possible subsequent downturns in commercial real estate asset values, property sales and leasing activities in one or more of the geographies or industry sectors that we or our clients serve.
periods of economic weakness or recession, significantly rising interest rates, fiscal uncertainty, declining employment levels, declining demand for commercial real estate, falling real estate values, disruption to the global capital or credit markets or the public perception that any of these events may occur, may negatively affect the performance of some or all of our business lines.
our business is significantly affected by generally prevailing economic conditions in the markets where we principally operate, which can result in a general decline in real estate acquisition, disposition and leasing activity, as well as a general decline in the value of commercial real estate and in rents, which in turn reduces revenue from asset services fees and commissions derived from property sales, leasing, valuation and financing, as well as revenues associated with development or investment management activities. our businesses could also suffer from any political or economic disruption that affects interest rates or liquidity.
adverse economic conditions could also lead to a decline in property sales prices as well as a decline in funds invested in existing commercial real estate assets and properties planned for development, which in turn could reduce the commissions and fees that we earn. in addition, our development and investment strategy often entails making co-investments alongside our investor clients. during an economic downturn, capital for our investment activities is usually constrained and it may take longer for us to dispose of real estate investments or selling prices may be lower than originally anticipated. as a result, the value of our commercial real estate investments may be reduced, and we could realize losses or diminished profitability. in addition, economic downturns may reduce the amount of loan originations and related servicing by our capital markets business.
the performance of our asset services line of business depends upon how well the properties we manage perform. this is because our fees are generally based on a percentage of rent collections from these properties. rent collections may be affected by many factors, including: (i) real estate and financial market conditions prevailing generally and locally; (ii) our ability to attract and retain creditworthy tenants, particularly during economic downturns; and (iii) the magnitude of defaults by tenants under their respective leases, which may increase during distressed economic conditions.
certain geographies within the americas, as well as certain industry sectors that we serve, have been negatively affected by the recent weakened performance of the oil and gas industry, which may in turn diminish the performance of our various businesses in those geographies as well as reduce the demand for our services by our clients in such areas or who are affected by that industry. in continental europe, the economic recovery is slow and fragile. if recovery in certain european economies stalls, our performance may be adversely affected. in addition, chinas deteriorating macro-economic environment could adversely affect our operations in our asia pacific segment, which may adversely affect our financial performance.
economic uncertainty as well as significant changes and volatility in the financial markets and business environment, and in the global landscape, make it increasingly difficult for us to predict our financial performance into the future. as a result, any guidance or outlook that we provide on our performance is based on then-current conditions, and there is a risk that such guidance may turn out to be inaccurate.
adverse developments in the credit markets may harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.
our global investment management, development services and capital markets (including investment property sales and debt and structured financing services) businesses are sensitive to credit cost and availability
as well as marketplace liquidity. additionally, the revenues in all of our businesses are dependent to some extent on the overall volume of activity (and pricing) in the commercial real estate market.
disruptions in the credit markets may adversely affect our business of providing advisory services to owners, investors and occupiers of real estate in connection with the leasing, disposition and acquisition of property. if our clients are unable to procure credit on favorable terms, there may be fewer completed leasing transactions, dispositions and acquisitions of property. in addition, if purchasers of commercial real estate are not able to procure favorable financing resulting in the lack of disposition opportunities for our funds and projects, our global investment management and development services businesses may be unable to generate incentive fees, and we may also experience losses of co-invested equity capital if the disruption causes a permanent decline in the value of investments made.
our operations are subject to social, political and economic risks in foreign countries as well as foreign currency volatility.
we conduct a significant portion of our business and employ a substantial number of people outside of the united states and as a result, we are subject to risks associated with doing business globally. during 2015, approximately 45% of our revenue was transacted in foreign currencies, the majority of which included the australian dollar, brazilian real, british pound sterling, canadian dollar, chinese yuan, euro, hong kong dollar, indian rupee, japanese yen, mexican peso, singapore dollar and swiss franc. fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may result in corresponding fluctuations in our assets under management for our global investment management business, revenue and earnings. over time, fluctuations in the value of the u.s. dollar relative to the other currencies in which we may generate earnings could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. due to the constantly changing currency exposures to which we are subject and the volatility of currency exchange rates, we cannot predict the effect of exchange rate fluctuations upon future operating results. in addition, fluctuations in currencies relative to the u.s. dollar may make it more difficult to perform period-to-period comparisons of our reported results of operations.
additional circumstances and developments related to international operations that could negatively affect our business, financial condition or results of operations include, but are not limited to, the following factors:
   difficulties and costs of staffing and managing international operations among diverse geographies, languages and cultures;
   currency restrictions, transfer pricing regulations and adverse tax consequences, which may affect our ability to transfer capital and profits to the united states;
   adverse changes in regulatory or tax requirements and regimes;
   the responsibility of complying with numerous, potentially conflicting and frequently complex and changing laws in multiple jurisdictions, e.g., with respect to corrupt practices, embargoes, trade sanctions, employment and licensing;
   the impact of regional or country-specific business cycles and economic instability;
   a tendency for clients to delay payments in some european and asian countries;
   political and economic instability in certain countries; and
   foreign ownership restrictions with respect to operations in certain countries, particularly in asia pacific, or the risk that such restrictions will be adopted in the future.
we maintain anti-corruption and anti-money-laundering compliance programs and programs designed to enable us to comply with applicable government economic sanctions, embargoes and other import/export controls throughout the company. but, coordinating our activities to deal with the broad range of complex legal and regulatory environments in which we operate presents significant challenges. we may not be successful in complying with regulations in all situations and violations may result in criminal or civil sanctions, including material monetary fines, penalties, equitable remedies (including disgorgement), and other costs against us or our employees, and may have a material adverse effect on our reputation and business.
we have committed additional resources to expand our worldwide sales and marketing activities, to globalize our service offerings and products in selected markets and to develop local sales and support channels. if we are unable to successfully implement these plans, maintain adequate long-term strategies that successfully manage the risks associated with our global business or adequately manage operational fluctuations, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be harmed. in addition, we have penetrated, and seek to continue to enter into, emerging markets to further expand our global platform. however, we may not be successful in effectively evaluating and monitoring the key business, operational, legal and compliance risks specific to those markets. the political and cultural risks present in emerging countries could also harm our ability to successfully execute our operations or manage our businesses there.
our growth has benefited significantly from acquisitions, which may not perform as expected and similar opportunities may not be available in the future.
a significant component of our growth has been generated by acquisitions. any future growth through acquisitions will depend in part upon the continued availability of suitable acquisition candidates at favorable prices and upon advantageous terms and conditions, which may not be available to us, as well as sufficient liquidity and credit to fund these acquisitions. we may incur significant additional debt from time to time to finance any such acquisitions, subject to the restrictions contained in the documents governing our then-existing indebtedness. if we incur additional debt, the risks associated with our leverage, including our ability to service our then-existing debt, would increase. acquisitions involve risks that business judgments concerning the value, strengths and weaknesses of businesses acquired may prove incorrect. future acquisitions and any necessary related financings also may involve significant transaction-related expenses, which include severance, lease termination, transaction and deferred financing costs, among others.
we have had, and may continue to experience, challenges in integrating operations and information technology systems acquired from other companies. this could result in the diversion of managements attention from other business concerns and the potential loss of our key employees or clients or those of the acquired operations. the integration process itself may be disruptive to our business and the acquired companys businesses as it requires coordination of geographically diverse organizations and implementation of new accounting and information technology systems. we believe that most acquisitions will initially have an adverse impact on operating and net income. acquisitions also frequently involve significant costs related to integrating information technology, accounting and management services and rationalizing personnel levels.
we complete acquisitions with the expectation that they will result in various benefits, including enhanced or more stable revenues, a strengthened market position, cross-selling opportunities, cost synergies, tax benefits and accretion to our adjusted income per share. achieving the anticipated benefits of these acquisitions is subject to a number of uncertainties, including the realization of accretive benefits in the timeframe anticipated and whether we can successfully integrate the acquired business. failure to achieve these anticipated benefits could result in increased costs, decreases in the amount of expected revenues and diversion of managements time and energy, which could in turn materially and adversely affect our overall business, financial condition and operating results.
our success depends upon the retention of our senior management, as well as our ability to attract and retain qualified and experienced employees.
our continued success is highly dependent upon the efforts of our executive officers and other key employees, including robert e. sulentic, our president and chief executive officer. mr. sulentic and certain other key employees are not parties to employment agreements with us. we also are highly dependent upon the retention of our property sales and leasing professionals, who generate a significant amount of our revenues, as well as other revenue producing professionals. the departure of any of our key employees, or the loss of a significant number of key revenue producers, if we are unable to quickly hire and integrate qualified replacements, could cause our business, financial condition and results of operations to suffer. competition for these personnel is significant and we may not be able to successfully recruit, integrate or retain sufficiently qualified personnel. in addition, the growth of our business is largely dependent upon our ability to attract and retain qualified support personnel in all areas of our business. we and our competitors use equity incentives and sign-on and retention bonuses to help attract, retain and incentivize key personnel. as competition is significant for the services of such personnel, the expense of such incentives and bonuses may increase and we may be unable to attract or retain such personnel to the same extent that we have in the past. any significant decline in, or failure to grow, our stock price may result in an increased risk of loss of these key personnel. if we are unable to attract and retain these qualified personnel, our growth may be limited and our business and operating results could suffer.
our joint venture activities and affiliate program involve unique risks that are often outside of our control and that, if realized, could harm our business.
we have utilized joint ventures for commercial investments, select local brokerage and other affiliations both in the united states and internationally, and we may acquire interests in other joint ventures in the future. under our affiliate program, we enter into contractual relationships with local brokerage, asset services or other operations pursuant to which we license to that operation our name and make available certain of our resources, in exchange for a royalty or economic participation in that operations revenue, profits or transactional activity. in many of these joint ventures and affiliations, we may not have the right or power to direct the management and policies of the joint ventures or affiliates, and other participants or operators of affiliates may take action contrary to our instructions or requests and against our policies and objectives. in addition, the other participants and operators may become bankrupt or have economic or other business interests or goals that are inconsistent with ours. if a joint venture participant or affiliate acts contrary to our interest, it could harm our brand, business, results of operations and financial condition.
our real estate investment and co-investment activities in our global investment management as well as development services businesses subject us to real estate investment risks which could cause fluctuations in earnings and cash flow.
an important part of the strategy for our global investment management business involves co-investing our capital in certain real estate investments with our clients, and there is an inherent risk of loss of our investments. as of december 31, 2015, we had committed $12.8 million to fund future co-investments in our global investment management business, $8.8 million of which is expected to be funded during 2016. in addition to required future capital contributions, some of the co-investment entities may request additional capital from us and our subsidiaries holding investments in those assets. the failure to provide these contributions could have adverse consequences to our interests in these investments, including damage to our reputation with our co-investment partners and clients, as well as the necessity of obtaining alternative funding from other sources that may be on disadvantageous terms for us and the other co-investors. participating as a co-investor is an important part of our global investment management business, which might suffer if we were unable to make these investments. although our debt instruments contain restrictions that limit our ability to provide capital to the entities holding direct or indirect interests in co-investments, we may provide this capital in many instances in further support of the co-investment.
selective investment in real estate projects is an important part of our development services business strategy, and there is an inherent risk of loss of our investments. as of december 31, 2015, we had 10 consolidated real estate projects with invested equity of $9.1 million. in addition, at december 31, 2015, we were
involved as a principal (in most cases, co-investing with our clients) in approximately 60 unconsolidated real estate subsidiaries with invested equity of $121.9 million and had committed additional capital to these unconsolidated subsidiaries of $29.6 million. as of december 31, 2015, we also guaranteed outstanding notes payable of these unconsolidated subsidiaries with outstanding balances of $12.4 million.
during the ordinary course of our development services business, we provide numerous completion and budget guarantees requiring us to complete the relevant project within a specified timeframe and/or within a specified budget, with us potentially being liable for costs to complete in excess of such timeframe or budget. while we generally have guaranteed maximum price contracts with reputable general contractors with respect to projects for which we provide these guarantees (which are intended to pass most of the risk to such contractors), there can be no assurance that we will not have to perform under any such guarantees. if we are required to perform under a significant number of such guarantees, it could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.
because the disposition of a single significant investment can affect our financial performance in any period, our real estate investment activities could cause fluctuations in our net earnings and cash flow. in many cases, we have limited control over the timing of the disposition of these investments and the recognition of any related gain or loss, or incentive participation fee.
poor performance of the investment programs that our global investment management business manages would cause a decline in our revenue, net income and cash flow and could adversely affect our ability to raise capital for future programs.
the revenue, net income and cash flow generated by our global investment management business can be volatile period over period, primarily due to the fact that management, transaction and incentive fees can vary as a result of market movements from one period to another. in the event that any of the investment programs that our global investment management business manages were to perform poorly, our revenue, net income and cash flow could decline because the value of the assets we manage would decrease, which would result in a reduction in some of our management fees, and our investment returns would decrease, resulting in a reduction in the incentive compensation we earn. moreover, we could experience losses on co-investments of our own capital in such programs as a result of poor performance. investors and potential investors in our programs continually assess our performance, and our ability to raise capital for existing and future programs and maintaining our current fee structure will depend on our continued satisfactory performance.
our debt instruments impose operating and financial restrictions on us, and in the event of a default, all of our borrowings would become immediately due and payable.
we have debt and related debt service obligations. as of december 31, 2015, our total debt, excluding notes payable on real estate (which are generally nonrecourse to us) and warehouse lines of credit (which are recourse only to our wholly-owned subsidiary, cbre capital markets, and are secured by our related warehouse receivables), was approximately $2.7 billion. for the year ended december 31, 2015, our interest expense was approximately $118.9 million.
our debt instruments, including our credit agreement, impose, and the terms of any future debt may impose, operating and other restrictions on us and many of our subsidiaries. these restrictions affect, and in many respects limit or prohibit, our ability to:
   plan for or react to market conditions;
   meet capital needs or otherwise restrict our activities or business plans; and
   finance ongoing operations, strategic acquisitions, investments or other capital needs or to engage in other business activities that would be in our interest, including:
   incurring or guaranteeing additional indebtedness;
   paying dividends or making distributions on or repurchases of capital stock;
   repurchasing equity interests or debt;
   making investments;
   transferring or selling assets, including the stock of subsidiaries;
   engaging in transactions with affiliates;
   issuing subsidiary equity or entering into consolidations and mergers;
   entering into sale/leaseback transactions.
our credit agreement currently requires us to maintain a minimum coverage ratio of ebitda (as defined in the credit agreement) to total interest expense of 2.00x and a maximum leverage ratio of total debt less available cash to ebitda (as defined in the credit agreement) of 4.25x as of the end of each fiscal quarter. our coverage ratio of ebitda to total interest expense was 11.81x for the year ended december 31, 2015, and our leverage ratio of total debt less available cash to ebitda was 1.45x as of december 31, 2015. our ability to meet these financial ratios can be affected by events beyond our control, and we cannot give assurance that we will be able to meet those ratios when required. we continue to monitor our projected compliance with these financial ratios and other terms of our credit agreement.
a breach of any of these restrictive covenants or the inability to comply with the required financial ratios could result in a default under our debt instruments. if any such default occurs, the lenders under our credit agreement may elect to declare all outstanding borrowings, together with accrued interest and other fees, to be immediately due and payable. the lenders under our credit agreement also have the right in these circumstances to terminate any commitments they have to provide further borrowings. in addition, a default under our credit agreement could trigger a cross default or cross acceleration under our other debt instruments.
our credit agreement is jointly and severally guaranteed by us and substantially all of our material domestic subsidiaries.
we have limited restrictions on the amount of additional recourse debt we are able to incur, which may intensify the risks associated with our leverage, including our ability to service our indebtedness. in addition, in the event of a credit-ratings downgrade, our ability to borrow and the costs of that borrowing could be adversely affected.
subject to the maximum amounts of indebtedness permitted by our credit agreement covenants, we are not restricted in the amount of additional recourse debt we are able to incur, and so we may in the future incur such indebtedness in order to finance our operations and investments. in addition, moodys investors service, inc. and standard & poors ratings services, a division of the mcgraw-hill companies, inc., rate our significant outstanding debt. these ratings, and any downgrades of them, may affect our ability to borrow as well as the costs of our current and future borrowings.
we are subject to various litigation risks and may face financial liabilities and/or damage to our reputation as a result of litigation.
our businesses are exposed to various litigation risks. in addition, although we maintain insurance coverage for most of this risk, insurance coverage is unavailable at commercially reasonable pricing for certain types of exposures. accordingly, an adverse result in a litigation against us, or a lawsuit that results in a substantial legal liability for us (and particularly a lawsuit that is not insured), could have a disproportionate and material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. in addition, we depend on our business relationships and our reputation for high-caliber professional services to attract and retain clients. as a result, allegations against us, irrespective of the ultimate outcome of that allegation, may harm our professional reputation and as such materially damage our business and its prospects.
failure to maintain and execute information technology strategies and ensure that our employees adapt to changes in technology could materially and adversely affect our ability to remain competitive in the market.
our business relies heavily on information technology to deliver services that meet the needs of our clients. if we are unable to effectively execute our information technology strategies or adopt new technologies and processes relevant to our service platform, our ability to deliver high-quality services may be materially impaired. in addition, we make significant investments in new systems and tools to achieve competitive advantages and efficiencies. implementation of such investments in information technology could exceed estimated budgets and we may experience challenges that prevent new strategies or technologies from being realized according to anticipated schedules. if we are unable to maintain current information technology and processes or encounter delays, or fail to exploit new technologies, then the execution of our business plans may be disrupted. similarly, our employees require effective tools and techniques to perform functions integral to our business. failure to successfully provide such tools and systems, or ensure that employees have properly adopted them, could materially and adversely impact our ability to achieve positive business outcomes.
failure to maintain the security of our information and technology networks, including personally identifiable and client information, intellectual property and proprietary business information could significantly adversely affect us.
security breaches and other disruptions of our information and technology networks could compromise our information and intellectual property and expose us to liability, reputational harm and significant remediation costs, which could cause material harm to our business and financial results. in the ordinary course of our business, we collect and store sensitive data, including our proprietary business information and intellectual property, and that of our clients and personally identifiable information of our employees and contractors, in our data centers and on our networks. the secure processing, maintenance and transmission of this information are critical to our operations. despite our security measures, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by third parties or breached due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions. a significant actual or potential theft, loss, corruption, exposure, fraudulent use or misuse of client, employee or other personally identifiable or proprietary business data, whether by third parties or as a result of employee malfeasance or otherwise, non-compliance with our contractual or other legal obligations regarding such data or intellectual property or a violation of our privacy and security policies with respect to such data could result in significant remediation and other costs, fines, litigation or regulatory actions against us. such an event could additionally disrupt our operations and the services we provide to clients, damage our reputation, result in the loss of a competitive advantage, impact our ability to provide timely and accurate financial data and cause a loss of confidence in our services and financial reporting, which could adversely affect our business, revenues, competitive position and investor confidence. additionally, we increasingly rely on third-party data storage providers, including cloud storage solution providers, resulting in less direct control over our data. such third parties are also vulnerable to security breaches and compromised security systems, for which we may not be indemnified and which could materially adversely affect us and our reputation.
interruption or failure of our information technology, communications systems or data services could impair our ability to provide our services effectively, which could damage our reputation and materially harm our operating results.
our business requires the continued operation of information technology and communication systems and network infrastructure. our ability to conduct our global business may be materially adversely affected by disruptions to these systems or infrastructure. our information technology and communications systems are vulnerable to damage or disruption from fire, power loss, telecommunications failure, system malfunctions, computer viruses, cyber-attacks, natural disasters such as hurricanes, earthquakes and floods, acts of war or terrorism, employee errors or malfeasance, or other events which are beyond our control. in addition, the operation and maintenance of these systems and networks is in some cases dependent on third-party technologies, systems and service providers for which there is no certainty of uninterrupted availability. any of these events could cause system interruption, delays and loss, corruption or exposure of critical data or intellectual property and may also disrupt our ability to provide services to or interact with our clients, and we may not be able to successfully implement contingency plans that depend on communication or travel. furthermore, any such event could result in substantial recovery and remediation costs and liability to customers, business partners and other third parties. we have disaster recovery plans and backup systems to reduce the potentially adverse effect of such events, but our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient and cannot account for all eventualities, and a catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our data centers or our critical business or information technology systems could severely affect our ability to conduct normal business operations, and as a result, our future operating results could be materially adversely affected.
the infrastructure disruptions we describe above may also disrupt our ability to manage real estate for clients or may adversely affect the value of real estate investments we make on behalf of clients. the buildings we manage for clients, which include some of the worlds largest office properties and retail centers, are used by numerous people daily. as a result, fires, earthquakes, floods, other natural disasters, defects and terrorist attacks can result in significant loss of life, and, to the extent we are held to have been negligent in connection with our management of the affected properties, we could incur significant financial liabilities and reputational harm.
our business relies heavily on the use of commercial real estate data. a portion of this data is purchased or licensed from third-party providers for which there is no certainty of uninterrupted availability. a disruption of our ability to provide data to our professionals and/or our clients or an inadvertent exposure of proprietary data could damage our reputation and competitive position, and our operating results could be adversely affected.
we have numerous local and global competitors across all of our business lines and the geographies that we serve, and further industry consolidation could lead to significant future competition.
we compete across a variety of business disciplines within the commercial real estate services and investment industry, including commercial property and corporate facilities management, occupier and property/agency leasing, property sales, valuation, real estate investment management, commercial mortgage origination and servicing, capital markets (structured finance and debt) solutions, development services and proprietary research. although we are the largest commercial real estate services firm in the world in terms of 2015 revenue, our relative competitive position varies significantly across geographies, property types and services and business lines. depending on the geography, property type or service or business line, we face competition from other commercial real estate service providers and investment firms, including outsourcing companies that traditionally competed in limited portions of our facilities management business and have expanded their offerings from time to time, in-house corporate real estate departments, developers, institutional lenders, insurance companies, investment banking firms, investment managers and accounting and consulting firms. some of these firms may have greater financial resources allocated to a particular geography, property type or service or business line than we have allocated that geography, property type, service or business line. in addition, future changes in laws could lead to the entry of other new competitors, such as financial institutions. although many of our existing competitors are local or regional firms that are smaller than we are, some of these competitors are larger on a
local or regional basis. we are further subject to competition from large national and multi-national firms that have similar service and investment competencies to ours, and it is possible that further industry consolidation could lead to much larger and more formidable competitors globally or in the particular geographies, property types, service or business lines that we serve. there is no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively, to maintain current fee levels or margins, or maintain or increase our market share.
our goodwill and other intangible assets could become impaired, which may require us to take significant non-cash charges against earnings.
under current accounting guidelines, we must assess, at least annually and potentially more frequently, whether the value of our goodwill and other intangible assets has been impaired. any impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets as a result of such analysis would result in a non-cash charge against earnings, and such charge could materially adversely affect our reported results of operations, stockholders equity and our stock price. for example, during the year ended december 31, 2013, we recorded a non-amortizable intangible asset impairment of $98.1 million in our global investment management segment. this non-cash write-off was related to a decrease in value of our open-end funds, primarily in europe. a significant and sustained decline in our future cash flows, a significant adverse change in the economic environment, slower growth rates or if our stock price falls below our net book value per share for a sustained period, could result in the need to perform additional impairment analysis in future periods. if we were to conclude that a future write-down of goodwill or other intangible assets is necessary, then we would record such additional charges, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations.
a failure to appropriately deal with actual or perceived conflicts of interest could adversely affect our businesses.
our company has a global platform with different business lines and a broad client base and is therefore subject to numerous potential, actual or perceived conflicts of interests in the provision of services to our existing and potential clients. for example, conflicts may arise from our position as broker to both owners and tenants in commercial real estate lease transactions. we have adopted various policies, controls and procedures to address or limit actual or perceived conflicts, but these policies and procedures may not be adequate and may not be adhered to by our employees. appropriately dealing with conflicts of interest is complex and difficult and our reputation could be damaged and cause us to lose existing clients or fail to gain new clients if we fail, or appear to fail, to identify, disclose and manage potential conflicts of interest, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. in addition, it is possible that in some jurisdictions regulations could be changed to limit our ability to act for parties where conflicts exist even with informed consent, which could limit our market share in those markets. there can be no assurance that conflicts of interest will not arise in the future that could cause material harm to us.
our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be adversely affected by new laws or regulations or by changes in existing laws or regulations or the application thereof. if we fail to comply with laws and regulations applicable to us, or make incorrect determinations in complex tax regimes, we may incur significant financial penalties.
we are subject to numerous federal, state, local and non-u.s. laws and regulations specific to the services we perform in our business. brokerage of real estate sales and leasing transactions and the provision of asset services and valuation services require us and our employees to maintain applicable licenses in each u.s. state and certain non-u.s. jurisdictions in which we perform these services. if we and our employees fail to maintain our licenses or conduct these activities without a license, or violate any of the regulations covering our licenses, we may be required to pay fines (including treble damages in certain states) or return commissions received or have our licenses suspended or revoked. a number of our services, including the services provided by our indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries, cbre capital markets and cbre global investors, are subject to regulation by the sec, finra or other self-regulatory organizations and state securities regulators and compliance failures
or regulatory action could adversely affect our business. we could be subject to disciplinary or other actions in the future due to claimed noncompliance with these regulations, which could have a material adverse effect on our operations and profitability.
we are also subject to laws of broader applicability, such as tax, securities, environmental and employment laws, including the fair labor standards act, occupational health and safety regulations and u.s. state wage-and-hour laws. failure to comply with these requirements could result in the imposition of significant fines by governmental authorities, awards of damages to private litigants and significant amounts paid in legal fees or settlements of these matters.
we operate in many jurisdictions with complex and varied tax regimes, and are subject to different forms of taxation resulting in a variable effective tax rate. in addition, from time to time we engage in transactions across different tax jurisdictions. due to the different tax laws in the many jurisdictions where we operate, we are often required to make subjective determinations. the tax authorities in the various jurisdictions where we carry on business may not agree with the determinations that are made by us with respect to the application of tax law. such disagreements could result in disputes and, ultimately, in the payment of additional funds to the government authorities in the jurisdictions where we carry on business, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. in addition, changes in tax rules or the outcome of tax assessments and audits could have an adverse effect on our results in any particular quarter.
as the size and scope of our business has increased significantly during the past several years, both the difficulty of ensuring compliance with numerous licensing and other regulatory requirements and the possible loss resulting from non-compliance have increased. the global economic crisis has resulted in increased government and legislative activities, including the introduction of new legislation and changes to rules and regulations, which we expect will continue into the future. new or revised legislation or regulations applicable to our business, both within and outside of the united states, as well as changes in administrations or enforcement priorities may have an adverse effect on our business, including increasing the costs of regulatory compliance or preventing us from providing certain types of services in certain jurisdictions or in connection with certain transactions or clients. we are unable to predict how any of these new laws, rules, regulations and proposals will be implemented or in what form, or whether any additional or similar changes to laws or regulations, including the interpretation or implementation thereof, will occur in the future. any such action could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways and could have an adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
we may be subject to environmental liability as a result of our role as a property or facility manager or developer of real estate.
various laws and regulations impose liability on real property owners or operators for the cost of investigating, cleaning up or removing contamination caused by hazardous or toxic substances at a property. in our role as a property or facility manager or developer, we could be held liable as an operator for such costs. this liability may be imposed without regard to the legality of the original actions and without regard to whether we knew of, or were responsible for, the presence of the hazardous or toxic substances. if we fail to disclose environmental issues, we could also be liable to a buyer or lessee of a property. if we incur any such liability, our business could suffer significantly as it could be difficult for us to develop or sell such properties, or borrow funds using such properties as collateral. in the event of a substantial liability, our insurance coverage might be insufficient to pay the full damages, or the scope of available coverage may not cover certain of these liabilities. additionally, liabilities incurred to comply with more stringent future environmental requirements could adversely affect any or all of our lines of business.

item 7. managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are the worlds largest commercial real estate services and investment firm, based on 2015 revenue, with leading full-service operations in major metropolitan areas throughout the world. we offer a full range of services to occupiers, owners, lenders and investors in office, retail, industrial, multifamily and other types of commercial real estate. as of december 31, 2015, excluding independent affiliates, we operated in more than 400 offices worldwide with more than 70,000 employees providing commercial real estate services under the cbre brand name, investment management services under the cbre global investors brand name and development services under the trammell crow company brand name. our business is focused on several competencies, including commercial property, corporate facilities, project and transaction management, tenant/occupier and property/agency leasing, capital markets solutions (property sales, commercial mortgage origination, sales and servicing, and structured finance) real estate investment management, valuation, development services and proprietary research. we generate revenue from both management fees (large multi-year portfolio and per-project contracts) and from commissions on transactions. we have been included in the fortune 500 since 2008 and among the fortune most admired companies in the real estate sector for four consecutive years. in 2015, we were ranked second among all companies on the barrons 500, which evaluates companies on growth and financial performance. additionally, the international association of outsourcing professionals (iaop) has ranked us among the top few outsourcing service providers across all industries for five consecutive years.
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states, which require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts. the estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and on other factors that management believes to be reasonable. actual results may differ from those estimates. we believe that the following critical accounting policies represent the areas where more significant judgments and estimates are used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.
revenue recognition in order for us to recognize revenue, four basic criteria must be met:
   collectability is reasonably assured.
our revenue recognition policies are consistent with these criteria. the judgments involved in revenue recognition include understanding the complex terms of agreements and determining the appropriate time to recognize revenue for each transaction based on such terms. each transaction is evaluated to determine: (i) at what point in time revenue is earned; (ii) whether contingencies exist that impact the timing of recognition of revenue; and (iii) how and when such contingencies will be resolved. the timing of revenue recognition could vary if different judgments were made. our revenues subject to the most judgment are brokerage commission revenue and incentive-based management and development fees. for a detailed discussion of our revenue recognition policies, see the revenue recognition section within note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements set forth in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k (this annual report).
in establishing the appropriate provisions for trade receivables, we make assumptions with respect to future collectability. our assumptions are based on an assessment of a customers credit quality as well as subjective factors and trends, including the aging of receivables balances. in addition to these assessments, in general,
outstanding trade accounts receivable amounts that are more than 180 days overdue are evaluated for collectability and fully provided for if deemed uncollectible. historically, our credit losses have generally been insignificant. however, estimating losses requires significant judgment, and conditions may change or new information may become known after any periodic evaluation. as a result, actual credit losses may differ from our estimates.
goodwill and other intangible assets our acquisitions require the application of purchase accounting, which results in tangible and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities of the acquired entity being recorded at fair value. the difference between the purchase price and the fair value of net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. in determining the fair values of assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination, we use a variety of valuation methods including present value, depreciated replacement cost, market values (where available) and selling prices less costs to dispose. we are responsible for determining the valuation of assets and liabilities and for the allocation of purchase price to assets acquired and liabilities assumed.
assumptions must often be made in determining fair values, particularly where observable market values do not exist. assumptions may include discount rates, growth rates, cost of capital, royalty rates, tax rates and remaining useful lives. these assumptions can have a significant impact on the value of identifiable assets and accordingly can impact the value of goodwill recorded. different assumptions could result in different values being attributed to assets and liabilities. since these values impact the amount of annual depreciation and amortization expense, different assumptions could also impact our statement of operations and could impact the results of future asset impairment reviews.
we are required to test goodwill and other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite useful lives for impairment at least annually or more often if circumstances or events indicate a change in the impairment status. the goodwill impairment analysis is a two-step process. the first step used to identify potential impairment involves comparing each reporting units estimated fair value to its carrying value, including goodwill. we use a discounted cash flow approach to estimate the fair value of our reporting units. management judgment is required in developing the assumptions for the discounted cash flow model. these assumptions include revenue growth rates, profit margin percentages, discount rates, etc. if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill is considered to not be impaired. if the carrying value exceeds estimated fair value, there is an indication of potential impairment and the second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment. the second step of the process involves the calculation of an implied fair value of goodwill for each reporting unit for which step one indicated impairment. the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by measuring the excess of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit as calculated in step one, over the estimated fair values of the individual assets, liabilities and identifiable intangibles as if the reporting unit was being acquired in a business combination. due to the many variables inherent in the estimation of a businesss fair value and the relative size of our goodwill, if different assumptions and estimates were used, it could have an adverse effect on our impairment analysis.
during the year ended december 31, 2013, we recorded a non-amortizable intangible asset impairment of $98.1 million in our global investment management segment. this non-cash write-off was related to a decrease in value of our open-end funds, primarily in europe.
for additional information on goodwill and intangible asset impairment testing, see notes 2, 5 and 8 of the notes to consolidated financial statements set forth in item 8 of this annual report.
income taxes income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method in accordance with the accounting for income taxes, topic of the financial accounting standards board, or fasb, accounting standards codification, or asc, (topic 740). deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary
differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards. deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured by applying enacted tax rates and laws and are released in the years in which the temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. valuation allowances are provided against deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized.
in november 2015, the fasb issued accounting standards update, or asu, 2015-17, income taxes (topic 740): balance sheet classification of deferred taxes (asu 2015-17). this asu requires the offset of all deferred tax assets and liabilities, including valuation allowances, for each tax-paying jurisdiction within each tax-paying component. the net deferred tax must be presented as a single noncurrent amount. asu 2015-17 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after december 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted. entities may elect to use either a prospective or retrospective transition method. we elected to early adopt the provisions of asu 2015-17 during the fourth quarter of 2015 and balance sheet amounts as of december 31, 2014 have been reclassified to conform with the current period presentation. as of december 31, 2014, $205.9 million of current deferred tax assets were reclassified to long term deferred tax assets.
accounting for tax positions requires judgments, including estimating reserves for potential uncertainties. we also assess our ability to utilize tax attributes, including those in the form of carryforwards, for which the benefits have already been reflected in the financial statements. we do not record valuation allowances for deferred tax assets that we believe will be realized in future periods. while we believe the resulting tax balances as of december 31, 2015 and 2014 are appropriately accounted for in accordance with topic 740, as applicable, the ultimate outcome of such matters could result in favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our consolidated financial statements and such adjustments could be material.
our foreign subsidiaries have accumulated $1.4 billion of undistributed earnings for which we have not recorded a deferred tax liability. although tax liabilities might result from dividends being paid out of these earnings, or as a result of a sale or liquidation of non-u.s. subsidiaries, these earnings are permanently reinvested outside of the united states and we do not have any plans to repatriate them or to sell or liquidate any of our non-u.s. subsidiaries. to the extent that we are able to repatriate earnings in a tax efficient manner, we would be required to accrue and pay u.s. taxes to repatriate these funds, net of foreign tax credits. determining our tax liability upon repatriation is not practicable. cash and cash equivalents owned by non-u.s. subsidiaries totaled $315.5 million at december 31, 2015. in 2013, we repatriated $196.2 million. tax benefits associated with the release of valuation allowances on foreign tax credits of $14.5 million and $4.9 million were recorded in 2013 and 2014, respectively.
see note 13 of the notes to consolidated financial statements set forth in item 8 of this annual report for further information regarding income taxes.
new accounting pronouncements see new accounting pronouncements section within note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements set forth in item 8 of this annual report.
items affecting comparability macroeconomic conditions economic trends and government policies affect global and regional commercial real estate markets as well as our operations directly. these include: overall economic activity and employment growth; interest rate levels and changes in interest rates; the cost and availability of credit; and the impact of tax and regulatory policies. periods of economic weakness or recession, significantly rising interest rates, fiscal uncertainty, declining
employment levels, decreasing demand for commercial real estate, falling real estate values, disruption to the global capital or credit markets, or the public perception that any of these events may occur, will negatively affect the performance of our business.
compensation is our largest expense and the sales and leasing professionals in our advisory services business generally are paid on a commission and/or bonus basis that correlates with their revenue production. as a result, the negative effect of difficult market conditions on our operating margins is partially mitigated by the inherent variability of our compensation cost structure. in addition, when negative economic conditions have been particularly severe, we have moved decisively to lower operating expenses to improve financial performance, and then have restored certain expenses as economic conditions improved. nevertheless, adverse global and regional economic trends could pose significant risks to the performance of our operations and our financial condition.
commercial real estate markets have recovered over the past several years, along with the steady improvement in global economic activity, most particularly in the united states. since 2010, increased u.s. property sales activity has been sustained by gradually improving market fundamentals, low-cost credit availability and increased global and domestic capital flows. during this time, u.s. leasing markets have been marked by increased demand for space, falling vacancies and higher rents.
european economies began to emerge from recession in 2013, with most countries returning to positive, albeit modest, economic growth. reflecting the macro environment, leasing markets in most of europe were slow to recover, but improved significantly in 2015. buoyed by low-cost credit and continued capital flows, europe saw increased property sales activity in 2015, with higher volumes occurring across more markets, particularly on the continent.
in asia pacific, the performance of real estate leasing and investment markets has varied from country to country amid slowing economic growth. strength in australia has generally compensated for slower activity elsewhere in the region. in addition, increasingly, local capital has been migrating to other parts of the world.
real estate investment management and property development markets have been generally favorable with abundant debt and equity capital flows into commercial real estate. however, real estate equity securities markets were adversely affected in 2015 by investor concerns about rising interest rates.
the performance of our global sales, leasing, investment management and development services operations depends on sustained economic growth and strong job creation; stable, healthy global credit markets; and continued positive business and investor sentiment.
effects of acquisitions the company historically has made significant use of strategic acquisitions to add new service competencies, to increase our scale within existing competencies and to expand our presence in various geographic regions around the world. on september 1, 2015, cbre, inc., our wholly-owned subsidiary, closed on a stock and asset purchase agreement (the purchase agreement) with johnson controls, inc. (jci) to acquire jcis global workplace solutions (gws) business (which we refer to as the gws acquisition). the acquired gws business is a market-leading provider of integrated facilities management solutions for major occupiers of commercial real estate and has significant operations around the world. the purchase price was $1.475 billion, paid in cash, with adjustments for working capital and other items. we completed the gws acquisition in order to advance our strategy of delivering globally integrated services to major occupiers in our americas, emea and asia pacific segments. we merged the acquired gws business with our existing occupier outsourcing business line, and the new combined business adopted the global workplace solutions name.
strategic in-fill acquisitions have also played a key role in expanding our geographic coverage and broadening and strengthening our service offerings. the companies we acquired have generally been regional or
specialty firms that complement our existing platform within a region, or independent affiliates in which, in some cases, we held a small equity interest. during 2015, we completed eight in-fill acquisitions, including a seattle-based leader in capital markets services for affordable housing, a texas-based commercial real estate firm specializing in retail services, an energy management specialist based in brookfield, wisconsin, a chicago-based location data analytics firm, one of the leading retail real estate services firms in the midwestern united states, an advisory, consulting and research firm specializing in the canadian hospitality and tourism industries and our former independent affiliate companies in columbia, south carolina, and memphis, tennessee. during 2014, we completed 11 in-fill acquisitions, including our former independent affiliate companies in thailand, greenville, south carolina, louisville, kentucky and oklahoma city and tulsa, oklahoma, a commercial real estate service provider in chicago, a new york-based valuation and advisory business, a technical real estate consulting firm based in germany, a consulting and advisory firm in the u.s. hotels sector, a shopping center management, leasing and consulting company in switzerland and project management companies in germany and australia.
although we believe that strategic acquisitions can significantly decrease the cost, time and commitment of management resources necessary to attain a meaningful competitive position within targeted markets or to expand our presence within our current markets, in general, most acquisitions will initially have an adverse impact on our operating and net income. the adverse impact is a result of transaction-related expenditures, which include severance, lease termination, transaction and deferred financing costs, among others, and the charges and costs of integrating the acquired business and its financial and accounting systems into our own. in addition, our acquisition structures often include deferred and/or contingent purchase price payments in future periods that are subject to the passage of time or achievement of certain performance metrics and other conditions. as of december 31, 2015, we have accrued deferred consideration totaling $79.7 million, which was included in accounts payable and accrued expenses and in other long-term liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets set forth in item 8 of this annual report.
international operations as we increase our international operations through either acquisitions or organic growth, fluctuations in the value of the u.s. dollar relative to the other currencies in which we may generate earnings could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. our global investment management business has a significant amount of euro-denominated assets under management, or aum, as well as associated revenue and earnings in europe, which has recently seen more pronounced (and adverse) movement in the value of the euro against the u.s. dollar. similarly, the gws business also has a significant amount of its revenue and earnings denominated in foreign currencies, such as the british pound sterling and euro. fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have resulted and may continue to result in corresponding fluctuations in our aum, revenue and earnings.
during the year ended december 31, 2015, approximately 45% of our business was transacted in non-u.s. dollar currencies, the majority of which included the australian dollar, brazilian real, british pound sterling, canadian dollar, chinese yuan, euro, hong kong dollar, indian rupee, japanese yen, mexican peso, singapore dollar and swiss franc. although we operate globally, we report our results in u.s. dollars. as a result, the strengthening or weakening of the u.s. dollar may positively or negatively impact our reported results. the following table sets forth our revenue derived from our most significant currencies (dollars in thousands):
united states dollar               $5,991,826              55.2   %              $5,027,479              55.6   %            $4,359,277              60.7   %
british pound sterling              1,861,199              17.1   %               1,632,127              18.0   %               634,375               8.8   %
for example, we estimate that had the british pound sterling-to-u.s. dollar exchange rates been 10% higher during the year ended december 31, 2015, the net impact would have been an increase in pre-tax income of $7.5 million. we estimate that had the euro-to-u.s. dollar exchange rates been 10% higher during the year ended december 31, 2015, the net impact would have been an increase in pre-tax income of $6.3 million. these hypothetical calculations estimate the impact of translating results into u.s. dollars, without giving effect to our hedging activities, and do not include an estimate of the impact that a 10% change in the u.s. dollar against other currencies would have had on our foreign operations.
we enter into derivative financial instruments to attempt to protect the value or fix the amount of certain obligations in terms of our reporting currency, the u.s. dollar. in march 2014, we began a foreign currency exchange forward hedging program by entering into foreign currency exchange forward contracts, including agreements to buy u.s. dollars and sell australian dollars, british pound sterling, canadian dollars, euros and japanese yen. the purpose of these forward contracts is to attempt to mitigate the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates that would adversely impact some of our foreign currency denominated ebitda. hedge accounting was not elected for any of these contracts. as such, changes in the fair values of these contracts are recorded directly in earnings. included in the consolidated statement of operations set forth in item 8 of this annual report were net gains of $24.2 million and $5.3 million from foreign currency exchange forward contracts for the years ended december 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
we also routinely monitor our exposure to currency exchange rate changes in connection with certain transactions and sometimes enter into foreign currency exchange option and forward contracts to limit our exposure to such transactions, as appropriate. in the ordinary course of business, we also sometimes utilize derivative financial instruments in the form of foreign currency exchange contracts to attempt to mitigate foreign currency exchange exposure resulting from intercompany loans. the net impact on our earnings resulting from gains and/or losses associated with these foreign currency exchange option and forward contracts has not been significant.
due to the constantly changing currency exposures to which we are subject and the volatility of currency exchange rates, we cannot predict the effect of exchange rate fluctuations upon future operating results. in addition, fluctuations in currencies relative to the u.s. dollar may make it more difficult to perform period-to-period comparisons of our reported results of operations. our international operations also are subject to, among other things, political instability and changing regulatory environments, which affects the currency markets and which as a result may adversely affect our future financial condition and results of operations. we routinely monitor these risks and related costs and evaluate the appropriate amount of oversight to allocate towards business activities in foreign countries where such risks and costs are particularly significant.
seasonality a significant portion of our revenue is seasonal, which an investor should keep in mind when comparing our financial condition and results of operations on a quarter-by-quarter basis. historically, our revenue, operating income, net income and cash flow from operating activities tend to be lowest in the first calendar quarter, and highest in the fourth calendar quarter of each year. earnings and cash flow have generally been concentrated in the fourth calendar quarter due to the focus on completing sales, financing and leasing transactions prior to calendar year-end.
inflation our commissions and other variable costs related to revenue are primarily affected by real estate market supply and demand, which may be affected by general economic conditions including inflation. however, to date, we do not believe that general inflation has had a material impact upon our operations.

ebitda represents earnings before net interest expense, write-off of financing costs on extinguished debt, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. amounts shown for ebitda, as adjusted (which we also refer to as normalized ebitda), further remove (from ebitda) the impact of certain cash and non-cash charges related to acquisitions, as well as certain carried interest incentive compensation expense. neither ebitda nor ebitda, as adjusted, is a recognized measurement under u.s. generally accepted accounting principles, or gaap, and when analyzing our operating performance, investors should use them in addition to, and not as an alternative for, net income as determined in accordance with gaap. because not all companies use identical calculations, our presentation of these measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.
we generally use these non-gaap financial measures to evaluate operating performance and for other discretionary purposes, and we believe that these measures provide a more complete understanding of ongoing operations, enhance comparability of current results to prior periods and may be useful for investors to analyze our financial performance because they eliminate the impact of selected charges that may obscure trends in the underlying performance of our business. we further believe that investors may find these measures useful in evaluating our operating performance compared to that of other companies in our industry because their calculations generally eliminate the effects of acquisitions, which would include impairment charges of goodwill and intangibles created from acquisitions, the effects of financings and income taxes and the accounting effects of capital spending. ebitda and ebitda, as adjusted, may vary for different companies for reasons unrelated to overall operating performance.
these measures are not intended to be measures of free cash flow for our discretionary use because they do not consider certain cash requirements such as tax and debt service payments. these measures may also differ from the amounts calculated under similarly titled definitions in our debt instruments, which amounts are further adjusted to reflect certain other cash and non-cash charges and are used by us to determine compliance with financial covenants therein and our ability to engage in certain activities, such as incurring additional debt and making certain restricted payments. we also use ebitda, as adjusted, as a significant component when measuring our operating performance under our employee incentive compensation programs.
ebitda and ebitda, as adjusted, are calculated as follows:

(1)   includes depreciation and amortization related to discontinued operations of $0.9 million for the year ended december 31, 2013.
(2)   includes interest expense related to discontinued operations of $3.3 million for the year ended december 31, 2013.
(3)   includes provision for income taxes related to discontinued operations of $1.3 million for the year ended december 31, 2013.

we reported consolidated net income of $547.1 million for the year ended december 31, 2015 on revenue of $10.9 billion as compared to consolidated net income of $484.5 million on revenue of $9.0 billion for the year ended december 31, 2014.
our revenue on a consolidated basis for the year ended december 31, 2015 increased by $1.8 billion, or 20.0%, as compared to the year ended december 31, 2014. this increase was in part due to contributions from the gws acquisition since september 1, 2015. additionally, the revenue increase also reflects strong organic growth, fueled by higher worldwide property, facilities and project management fees (excluding the impact of the gws acquisition, up 15.9%), as well as increased sales (up 17.9%) and leasing (up 11.5%) activity. an increase in global appraisal revenue (up 18.6%) and commercial mortgage brokerage activity in our americas segment (up 28.5%) also contributed to the positive variance. foreign currency translation had a $536.4 million negative impact on total revenue during the year ended december 31, 2015, primarily driven by weakness in the australian dollar, brazilian real, british pound sterling, canadian dollar, euro and japanese yen during the year ended december 31, 2015 versus the year ended december 31, 2014.
our cost of services on a consolidated basis increased by $1.5 billion, or 26.2%, during the year ended december 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2014. this increase was primarily due to higher costs associated with our global property and facilities management businesses, particularly due to the gws acquisition. in addition, our sales professionals generally are paid on a commission basis, which substantially correlates with our transaction revenue performance. accordingly, the increase in sales and lease transaction revenue led to a corresponding increase in commission expense. lastly, we incurred $18.3 million of costs in connection with a project to eliminate costs to enhance margins going forward. these increases were partially offset by foreign currency translation, which had a $318.4 million positive impact on cost of services during the year ended december 31, 2015. cost of services as a percentage of revenue increased from 62.0% for the year ended december 31, 2014 to 65.2% for the year ended december 31, 2015, largely due to the gws acquisition. excluding activity associated with the acquired gws business, cost of services as a percentage of revenue was 62.5% for the year ended december 31, 2015, compared to 62.0% for the year ended december 31, 2014.
our operating, administrative and other expenses on a consolidated basis increased by $194.6 million, or 8.0%, during the year ended december 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2014. the increase was partly driven by costs associated with the gws acquisition. also contributing to the variance were higher worldwide payroll-related costs (including bonuses) attributable to increased headcount and improved results as well as higher consulting, marketing and travel costs. lastly, we incurred $22.1 million of costs in connection with the project to eliminate costs to enhance margins going forward. these increases were partially mitigated by an $8.6 million asset impairment charge incurred in our americas segment in the prior year, which did not recur in the current year, and foreign currency movement. foreign currency translation had a $162.3 million positive impact on total operating expenses during the year ended december 31, 2015 and there was an improvement of $20.7 million in foreign currency transaction activity over the prior year, much of which related to hedging activities. operating expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased from 27.0% for the year ended december 31, 2014 to 24.3% for the year ended december 31, 2015, partially due to the gws acquisition. excluding activity associated with the acquired gws business, operating expenses as a percentage of revenue was 25.7% for the year ended december 31, 2015 as compared to 27.0% for the year ended december 31, 2014, reflecting the operating leverage inherent in our business.
our depreciation and amortization expense on a consolidated basis increased by $49.0 million, or 18.5%, during the year ended december 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2014. this increase was primarily attributable to higher amortization expense relative to intangibles acquired in the gws acquisition as well as increased amortization expense associated with mortgage servicing rights. a rise in depreciation expense during the year ended december 31, 2015 driven by technology-related capital expenditures also contributed to the increase.
our gain on disposition of real estate on a consolidated basis was $10.8 million for the year ended december 31, 2015 compared to $57.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2014. these gains resulted from activity within our global investment management and development services segments.
our equity income from unconsolidated subsidiaries on a consolidated basis increased by $61.1 million, or 60.1%, for the year ended december 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2014, primarily driven by higher equity earnings associated with gains on property sales reported in our development services segment.
our other loss on a consolidated basis was $3.8 million for the year ended december 31, 2015 compared to other income on a consolidated basis of $12.2 million for the year ended december 31, 2014. this activity primarily relates to net realized and unrealized gains and losses attributable to co-investments in our real estate securities business.
our consolidated interest income was $6.3 million for the year ended december 31, 2015 versus $6.2 million for the year ended december 31, 2014.
our consolidated interest expense increased by $6.8 million, or 6.1%, for the year ended december 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2014. this increase was primarily driven by higher interest expense in the current year associated with $600.0 million of 4.875% senior notes issued in august 2015 as well as the 5.25% senior notes issued in september 2014 and december 2014 of $300.0 million and $125.0 million, respectively. these increases were partially offset by lower interest expense associated with $350.0 million of 6.625% senior notes, which were redeemed in full in october 2014, as well as lower interest expense due to a decrease in notes payable on real estate in the current year.
our write-off of financing costs on extinguished debt on a consolidated basis was $2.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2015 compared to $23.1 million for the year ended december 31, 2014. the costs incurred during the current year included the write-off of $1.7 million of unamortized deferred financing costs associated with our credit agreement dated march 28, 2013, as amended (our 2013 credit agreement), and $1.0 million of fees incurred in connection with our amended and restated credit agreement dated january 9, 2015, as amended (our 2015 credit agreement). the costs incurred in the prior year primarily related to costs associated with the redemption in full of our 6.625% senior notes, including a $17.4 million early extinguishment premium and the write-off of $5.7 million of previously deferred financing costs. see note 10 of the notes to consolidated financial statements set forth in item 8 of this annual report for more information on such credit agreements.
our provision for income taxes on a consolidated basis was $320.9 million for the year ended december 31, 2015 compared to $263.8 million for the year ended december 31, 2014. this increase was driven by the significant growth in pre-tax income during the year ended december 31, 2015. our effective tax rate, after adjusting pre-tax income to remove the portion attributable to non-controlling interests, increased to 37.0% for the year ended december 31, 2015 compared to 35.3% for the year ended december 31, 2014. this increase was largely due to the reversal of accrued taxes, interest and penalties related to settled positions, which had a favorable impact on the 2014 effective tax rate and did not recur in 2015.
our net income attributable to non-controlling interests on a consolidated basis was $11.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2015 as compared to $29.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2014. this activity primarily reflects our non-controlling interests share of income within our global investment management and development services segments.
we reported consolidated net income of $484.5 million for the year ended december 31, 2014 on revenue of $9.0 billion as compared to consolidated net income of $316.5 million on revenue of $7.2 billion for the year ended december 31, 2013.
our revenue on a consolidated basis for the year ended december 31, 2014 increased by $1.9 billion, or 26.0%, as compared to the year ended december 31, 2013. this increase was in part due to contributions from our acquisition of norland managed services ltd in 2013 (the norland acquisition). however, the revenue increase also reflects strong organic growth, fueled by higher worldwide property, facilities and project management fees (excluding the impact of the norland acquisition, up 15.8%), increased sales (up 19.7%) and leasing (up 16.2%) activity. foreign currency translation had a $53.5 million negative impact on total revenue during the year ended december 31, 2014, primarily driven by weakness in the australian dollar, brazilian real, canadian dollar, indian rupee and japanese yen, partially offset by strength in the british pound sterling, during the year ended december 31, 2014 versus the year ended december 31, 2013.
our cost of services on a consolidated basis increased by $1.4 billion, or 33.9%, during the year ended december 31, 2014 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2013. this increase was primarily due to higher costs associated with our global property and facilities management businesses, particularly due to the norland acquisition. in addition, as previously mentioned, our sales professionals generally are paid on a commission basis, which substantially correlates with our transaction revenue performance. accordingly, the increase in sales and lease transaction revenue led to a corresponding increase in commission expense. foreign currency translation had a $35.3 million positive impact on cost of services during the year ended december 31, 2014. cost of services as a percentage of revenue increased from 58.3% for the year ended december 31, 2013 to 62.0% for the year ended december 31, 2014, largely due to the norland acquisition. excluding activity associated with norland, cost of services as a percentage of revenue was 59.4% for the year ended december 31, 2014, compared to 58.3% for the year ended december 31, 2013.
our operating, administrative and other expenses on a consolidated basis increased by $334.7 million, or 15.9%, during the year ended december 31, 2014 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2013. the increase was partly driven by costs associated with the norland acquisition. also contributing to the variance were higher worldwide payroll-related costs (including bonuses), increased consulting costs, and an asset impairment charge of $8.6 million incurred in our americas segment during the year ended december 31, 2014. foreign currency translation had a $14.2 million positive impact on total operating expenses during the year ended december 31, 2014. operating expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased from 29.3% for the year ended december 31, 2013 to 27.0% for the year ended december 31, 2014, as a result of the norland acquisition. excluding activity associated with norland, operating expenses as a percentage of revenue were relatively consistent at 29.0% for the year ended december 31, 2014, compared to 29.2% for the year ended december 31, 2013.
our depreciation and amortization expense on a consolidated basis increased by $74.7 million, or 39.2%, during the year ended december 31, 2014 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2013. this increase was primarily attributable to higher amortization expense relative to intangibles acquired in the norland acquisition and in-fill acquisitions completed in 2014. a rise in depreciation expense during the year ended december 31, 2014 driven by technology-related capital expenditures also contributed to the increase.
our non-amortizable intangible asset impairment on a consolidated basis was $98.1 million for the year ended december 31, 2013, which represented non-cash write-offs related to a decrease in value of our open-end funds in our global investment management segment, primarily in europe.
our gain on disposition of real estate on a consolidated basis was $57.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2014 as compared to $13.6 million for the year ended december 31, 2013. these gains resulted from activity within our global investment management and development services segments. the increase over the prior-year period is largely due to our adoption of asu 2014-08, presentation of financial statements (topic 205) and property, plant, and equipment (topic 360): reporting discontinued operations and disclosures of disposals of components of an entity effective january 1, 2014 and as a result, no longer reporting discontinued operations in the ordinary course of our business. prior to january 1, 2014, if in the ordinary course of business we disposed of real estate assets, or held real estate assets for sale, that were
considered components of an entity in accordance with topic 360, and if we did not have, or expect to have, significant continuing involvement with the operation of these real estate assets after disposition, we were required to recognize operating profits or losses and gains or losses on disposition of these assets as discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of operations in the periods in which they occurred.
our equity income from unconsolidated subsidiaries on a consolidated basis increased by $37.3 million, or 57.9%, for the year ended december 31, 2014 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2013. this increase was primarily driven by higher equity earnings associated with gains on property sales within our development services segment and a gain on the sale of an equity investment in canada within our americas segment during the year ended december 31, 2014.
our other income on a consolidated basis was relatively consistent at $12.2 million for the year ended december 31, 2014 as compared to $13.5 million for the year ended december 31, 2013.
our consolidated interest income was $6.2 million for the year ended december 31, 2014 versus $6.3 million for the year ended december 31, 2013.
our consolidated interest expense decreased by $23.0 million, or 17.1%, for the year ended december 31, 2014 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2013, due to the effects of our refinancing activities in the first half of 2013. during the latter part of 2014, we completed three financing transactions, including the issuance in september 2014 and december 2014 of $300.0 million and $125.0 million, respectively, in aggregate principal amount of 5.25% senior notes due march 15, 2025 and the redemption in october 2014 of all of the then outstanding 6.625% senior notes (aggregate principal amount of $350.0 million). additionally, in january 2015 we entered into an amended and restated credit agreement with more favorable interest rate spreads than under our prior credit agreement.
our write-off of financing costs on extinguished debt on a consolidated basis was $23.1 million for the year ended december 31, 2014 as compared to $56.3 million for the year ended december 31, 2013. the write-off in 2014 related to costs associated with the redemption in full of our 6.625% senior notes, including a $17.4 million early extinguishment premium and the write-off of $5.7 million of previously deferred financing costs. the write-off in 2013 primarily related to costs associated with the redemption in full of our 11.625% senior subordinated notes, including a $26.2 million early extinguishment premium and the write-off of $16.1 million of unamortized original issue discount and previously deferred financing costs. in addition, during the year ended december 31, 2013, we wrote-off $10.4 million of unamortized deferred financing costs associated with a previous credit agreement and incurred fees of $3.6 million in connection with its replacement credit agreement and 5.00% senior notes.
our provision for income taxes on a consolidated basis was $263.8 million for the year ended december 31, 2014 as compared to $187.2 million for the year ended december 31, 2013. this increase was driven by the significant growth in pre-tax income during the year ended december 31, 2014. our effective tax rate from continuing operations, after adjusting pre-tax income to remove the portion attributable to non-controlling interests, decreased to 35.3% for the year ended december 31, 2014 as compared to 37.3% for the year ended december 31, 2013. this decrease was largely due to a favorable change in our mix, with 71% of our earnings, after removing the portion attributable to non-controlling interests, from the united states in 2013 as compared to 68% in 2014, partially due to the norland acquisition. additionally, during the year ended december 31, 2014, we reversed accrued taxes, interest and penalties related to settled positions, which had a positive impact on the 2014 effective tax rate. these favorable items were partially offset by a reduction in foreign income tax credit benefits.
our consolidated income from discontinued operations, net of income taxes, was $27.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2013. this income was reported in our development services and global investment management segments and mostly related to gains from property sales, which were largely attributable to non-controlling interests. as previously mentioned, on january 1, 2014, we adopted asu 2014-08 and as a result, no longer anticipate reporting discontinued operations in the ordinary course of our business.
our net income attributable to non-controlling interests on a consolidated basis was $29.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2014 as compared to $32.3 million for the year ended december 31, 2013. this activity primarily reflects our non-controlling interests share of income within our global investment management and development services segments.
segment operations we report our operations through the following segments: (1) americas, (2) emea, (3) asia pacific, (4) global investment management and (5) development services. the americas consists of operations located in the united states, canada and key markets in latin america. emea mainly consists of operations in europe, while asia pacific includes operations in asia, australia and new zealand. the global investment management business consists of investment management operations in north america, europe and asia pacific. the development services business consists of real estate development and investment activities primarily in the united states.
the following table summarizes our revenue, costs and expenses and operating income (loss) by our americas, emea, asia pacific, global investment management and development services operating segments for the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013:

americas revenue increased by $986.1 million, or 19.0%, for the year ended december 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2014. this increase was in part due to contributions from the gws acquisition. additionally, the revenue increase also reflects strong organic growth, fueled by higher property, facilities and project management fees (excluding the impact of the gws acquisition, up 11.8%), as well as improved sales, leasing, commercial mortgage brokerage and appraisal activity. foreign currency translation had an $85.6 million negative impact on total revenue during the year ended december 31, 2015, primarily driven by weakness in the brazilian real and canadian dollar when converting to u.s. dollars during the year ended december 31, 2015 versus the year ended december 31, 2014.
cost of services increased by $717.8 million, or 21.1%, for the year ended december 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2014, primarily due to higher costs associated with our global property and facilities management businesses, particularly due to the gws acquisition. this increase was also due to higher commission expense resulting from improved sales and lease transaction revenue. additionally, higher salaries and related costs due to increased headcount (in part due to in-fill acquisitions) also contributed to the increase. foreign currency translation had a $52.8 million positive impact on cost of services during the year ended december 31, 2015. cost of services as a percentage of revenue increased to 66.5% for the year ended december 31, 2015 compared to 65.3% for the year ended december 31, 2014, largely due to the gws acquisition. excluding activity associated with the acquired gws business, cost of services as a percentage of revenue was 65.2% for the year ended december 31, 2015, compared to 65.3% for the year ended december 31, 2014.
operating, administrative and other expenses increased by $146.2 million, or 13.2%, for the year ended december 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2014. the increase was partly driven by costs associated with the gws acquisition. also contributing to the variance were higher payroll-related costs (including bonuses) attributable to increased headcount and improved results as well as higher consulting, marketing and travel costs. these increases were partially mitigated by an $8.6 million asset impairment charge incurred in our americas segment in the prior year, which did not recur in the current year, and foreign currency movement. foreign currency translation had a $24.5 million positive impact on total operating expenses during the year ended december 31, 2015 and there was an improvement of $19.1 million in foreign currency transaction activity over the prior year, some of which related to hedging activities.
emea revenue increased by $660.2 million, or 28.2%, for the year ended december 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2014. this increase was largely due to contributions from the gws acquisition. in addition, the revenue increase also reflects strong organic growth, fueled by higher property, facilities and project management fees (excluding the impact of the gws acquisition up 20.3%) as well as improved sales, leasing and appraisal activity. the increase in revenue was partially offset by foreign currency translation, which had a $291.6 million negative impact on total revenue during the year ended december 31, 2015, primarily driven by weakness in the british pound sterling and euro when converting to u.s. dollars during the year ended december 31, 2015 versus the year ended december 31, 2014.
cost of services increased by $599.7 million, or 37.3%, for the year ended december 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2014. this increase was primarily due to higher costs associated with our global property and facilities management businesses, particularly due to the gws acquisition. additionally, we incurred $9.7 million of costs in connection with the project to eliminate costs to enhance margins going forward. these increases were partially reduced by foreign currency translation, which had a $192.9 million positive impact on cost of services during the year ended december 31, 2015. cost of services as a percentage of revenue increased to 73.4% for the year ended december 31, 2015 from 68.5% for the year ended december 31, 2014, largely due to the gws acquisition. excluding activity associated with the acquired gws business, cost of services as a percentage of revenue was 69.0% for the year ended december 31, 2015, compared to 68.5% for the year ended december 31, 2014.
operating, administrative and other expenses increased by $42.7 million, or 7.3%, for the year ended december 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2014, primarily driven by higher payroll-related costs (including bonuses) in the current year as well as costs associated with the gws acquisition. additionally, we incurred $10.3 million of costs in connection with the project to eliminate costs to enhance margins going forward. these items were partially offset by foreign currency translation, which had a $78.6 million positive impact on total operating expenses during the year ended december 31, 2015.
asia pacific revenue increased by $167.3 million, or 17.3%, for the year ended december 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2014. contributions from the gws acquisition in the current year as well as our acquisition of our former affiliate in thailand in june 2014 drove the current year increase. the revenue increase also reflects strong organic growth, fueled by higher property, facilities and project management fees (excluding the impact of the gws acquisition, up 25.4%) as well as improved sales, leasing and appraisal activity. the overall increase was largely muted by foreign currency translation, which had a $120.7 million negative impact on total revenue during the year ended december 31, 2015, primarily driven by weakness in the australian dollar and japanese yen when converting to u.s. dollars during the year ended december 31, 2015 versus the year ended december 31, 2014.
cost of services increased by $154.2 million, or 25.4%, for the year ended december 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2014, driven by higher costs associated with our property and facilities management businesses, including the gws acquisition. also contributing to the variance was increased commission expense resulting from higher transaction revenue as well as $7.0 million of costs incurred in the current year in connection with the project to eliminate costs to enhance margins going forward. these increases were partially offset by foreign currency translation, which had a $72.7 million positive impact on cost of services during the year ended december 31, 2015. cost of services as a percentage of revenue increased to 67.1% for the year ended december 31, 2015 as compared to 62.7% for the year ended december 31, 2014, primarily due to the gws acquisition. excluding activity associated with the acquired gws business, cost of services as a percentage of revenue was 64.1% for the year ended december 31, 2015, compared to 62.7% for the year ended december 31, 2014, primarily driven by our revenue mix, with outsourcing revenue, which has a lower margin, being a higher percentage of revenue than in the prior year.
operating, administrative and other expenses increased by $13.8 million, or 5.0%, for the year ended december 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2014, primarily driven by higher payroll-related costs (including bonuses) as well as $4.4 million of costs incurred in the current year in connection with the project to eliminate costs to enhance margins going forward. the increase was also partly driven by costs associated with the gws acquisition. these increases were largely offset by foreign currency translation, which had a $32.9 million positive impact on total operating expenses during the year ended december 31, 2015.
global investment management revenue decreased by $8.2 million, or 1.8%, for the year ended december 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2014, primarily driven by foreign currency translation, which had a $38.5 million negative impact on total revenue during the year ended december 31, 2015, primarily driven by weakness in the british pound sterling and euro when converting to u.s. dollars during the year ended december 31, 2015 versus the year ended december 31, 2014. higher carried interest revenue was more than offset by lower asset management, disposition and acquisition fees in the current year.
operating, administrative and other expenses decreased by $24.7 million, or 6.6%, for the year ended december 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2014, primarily driven by foreign currency translation, which had a $26.3 million positive impact on total operating expenses during the year ended december 31, 2015.
a rollforward of our aum by product type for the year ended december 31, 2015 is as follows (dollars in billions):
funds          separate          securities          consolidated accounts balance at january 1, 2015               $28.8             $37.0               $24.8                 $90.6

aum generally refers to the properties and other assets with respect to which we provide (or participate in) oversight, investment management services and other advice, and which generally consist of real estate properties or loans, securities portfolios and investments in operating companies and joint ventures. our aum is intended principally to reflect the extent of our presence in the real estate market, not the basis for determining our management fees. our assets under management consist of:
a)                                       the total fair market value of the real estate properties and other assets either wholly-owned or held by joint ventures and other entities in which our sponsored funds or investment vehicles and client accounts have invested or to which they have provided financing. committed (but unfunded) capital from investors in our sponsored funds is not included in this component of our aum. the value of development properties is included at estimated completion cost. in the case of real estate operating companies, the total value of real properties controlled by the companies, generally through joint ventures, is included in aum; and
b)   the net asset value of our managed securities portfolios, including investments (which may be comprised of committed but uncalled capital) in private real estate funds under our fund of funds program.
development services revenue was relatively consistent at $65.6 million for the year ended december 31, 2015 as compared to $65.2 million for the year ended december 31, 2014.
operating, administrative and other expenses increased by $16.6 million, or 16.8%, for the year ended december 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2014. this increase was primarily driven by higher bonuses in the current year as a result of significantly improved operating performance due to property sales.
as of december 31, 2015, development projects in process totaled $6.7 billion, up $1.3 billion from the end of 2014, and the inventory of pipeline deals totaled $3.6 billion, down $0.4 billion from year-end 2014.
americas revenue increased by $699.2 million, or 15.5%, for the year ended december 31, 2014 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2013. this improvement was primarily driven by higher property, facilities and project management fees, as well as improved leasing, sales and commercial mortgage brokerage activity. foreign currency translation had a $33.4 million negative impact on total revenue during the year ended december 31, 2014, primarily driven by weakness in the brazilian real and canadian dollar when converting to u.s. dollars during the year ended december 31, 2014 versus the year ended december 31, 2013.
cost of services increased by $487.3 million, or 16.7%, for the year ended december 31, 2014 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2013, primarily due to increased commission expense resulting from higher sales and lease transaction revenue. higher salaries and related costs associated with our property, facilities and project management contracts also contributed to an increase in cost of services during the year ended december 31, 2014. foreign currency translation had a $20.9 million positive impact on cost of services during the year ended december 31, 2014. cost of services as a percentage of revenue increased to 65.3% for the year ended december 31, 2014 from 64.6% for the year ended december 31, 2013, primarily attributable to a concentration of commissions among higher producing professionals.
operating, administrative and other expenses increased by $102.6 million, or 10.2%, for the year ended december 31, 2014 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2013. the increase was primarily driven by higher payroll-related costs (including bonuses), which resulted from increased headcount, as well as higher consulting costs. also contributing to the variance was the previously mentioned asset impairment charge during the year ended december 31, 2014 of $8.6 million. this non-cash write-off resulted from the decision (due to a change in strategy) to abandon a property database platform that was being developed in the u.s. foreign currency translation had a $9.4 million positive impact on total operating expenses during the year ended december 31, 2014.
emea revenue increased by $1.1 billion, or 92.6%, for the year ended december 31, 2014 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2013. the increase was in part due to contributions from the norland acquisition. excluding norland, revenue was up 21.2% and growth was strong in all major business lines. foreign currency translation had a $19.1 million positive impact on total revenue during the year ended december 31, 2014, primarily driven by strength in the british pound sterling when converting to u.s. dollars during the year ended december 31, 2014 versus the year ended december 31, 2013.
cost of services increased by $884.4 million, or 122.6%, for the year ended december 31, 2014 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2013, primarily due to higher costs associated with our global property and facilities management businesses, particularly due to the norland acquisition. foreign currency translation had a $12.3 million negative impact on cost of services during the year ended december 31, 2014. cost of services as a percentage of revenue increased to 68.5% for the year ended december 31, 2014 from 59.3% for the year ended december 31, 2013, mainly due to the norland acquisition. excluding activity associated with norland, cost of services as a percentage of revenue was 57.6% for the year ended december 31, 2014, an improvement over the 59.3% of revenue recorded for the year ended december 31, 2013, primarily driven by higher transaction revenue during 2014 in certain countries that have a significant fixed cost compensation structure.
operating, administrative and other expenses increased by $157.0 million, or 36.9%, for the year ended december 31, 2014 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2013. the increase was primarily driven by costs associated with the norland acquisition. higher payroll-related costs (including bonuses), which resulted from improved operating performance, as well as increased consulting costs, also contributed to the increase for the year ended december, 31, 2014. foreign currency translation had a $3.7 million negative impact on total operating expenses during the year ended december 31, 2014.
asia pacific revenue increased by $95.0 million, or 10.9%, for the year ended december 31, 2014 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2013, reflecting improved overall performance in several countries, most notably in australia, india and japan, particularly in property, facilities and project management, sales and leasing activity. contributions from the acquisition of our former affiliate company in thailand in june 2014 also added to the increase during the year ended december 31, 2014. the increase was partially offset by foreign currency translation, which had a $43.7 million negative impact on total revenue during the year ended december 31, 2014, primarily driven by weakness in the australian dollar, japanese yen and indian rupee when converting to u.s. dollars during the year ended december 31, 2014 versus the year ended december 31, 2013.
cost of services increased by $50.2 million, or 9.0%, for the year ended december 31, 2014 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2013, driven by increased commission expense resulting from higher sales and lease transaction revenue as well as a concentration of commissions among higher producing professionals in australia and japan. higher salaries and related costs associated with our property and facilities management contracts also contributed to an increase in cost of services during the year ended december 31, 2014. foreign currency translation had a $26.7 million positive impact on cost of services during the year ended december 31, 2014. cost of services as a percentage of revenue decreased to 62.7% for the year ended december 31, 2014 from 63.8% for the year ended december 31, 2013, primarily driven by higher transaction revenue during 2014 in certain countries that have a significant fixed cost compensation structure.
operating, administrative and other expenses increased by $27.7 million, or 11.3%, for the year ended december 31, 2014 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2013. the increase was primarily driven by higher payroll-related (including bonuses), occupancy and consulting costs. foreign currency translation had an $11.2 million positive impact on total operating expenses during the year ended december 31, 2014.
global investment management revenue decreased by $68.2 million, or 12.7%, for the year ended december 31, 2014 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2013, primarily driven by reduced carried interest revenue. lower asset management fees, which reflect the sale of assets in 2013 to harvest gains for fund investors (which generated the carried interest in 2013), lower fees on some aum in emea, and our exiting the management of a private reit, also contributed to the decline during the year ended december 31, 2014. these reductions were partially offset by higher acquisition fees during the year ended december 31, 2014 as well as foreign currency translation, which had a $4.5 million positive impact on total revenue during the year ended december 31, 2014.
operating, administrative and other expenses increased by $21.6 million, or 6.1%, for the year ended december 31, 2014 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2013, primarily due to higher carried interest expense incurred in 2014. foreign currency translation also had a $2.7 million negative impact on total operating expenses during the year ended december 31, 2014. these increases were partially offset by lower costs due to the sale of assets and internalization of the management of the private reit discussed above.
this business transitioned from gain-harvesting in 2013 to capital-deployment in 2014. total aum as of december 31, 2014 rose to $90.6 billion. a rollforward of our aum by product type for the year ended december 31, 2014 is as follows (dollars in billions):
funds          separate          securities          consolidated accounts balance at january 1, 2014               $32.8             $33.5               $22.8                 $89.1
market (depreciation) appreciation        (0.9   )           0.4                 3.3                   2.8
development services revenue increased by $11.9 million, or 22.4%, for the year ended december 31, 2014 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2013, primarily due to higher development fees during the year ended december 31, 2014 due to an increase in new projects started.
operating, administrative and other expenses increased by $25.8 million, or 35.4%, for the year ended december 31, 2014 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2013. this increase was primarily driven by higher bonuses due to significantly improved operating performance.
as of december 31, 2014, development projects in process totaled $5.4 billion, up 10.2% from year-end 2013, and the inventory of pipeline deals totaled $4.0 billion, up 166.7% from year-end 2013.
liquidity and capital resources we believe that we can satisfy our working capital requirements and funding of investments with internally generated cash flow and, as necessary, borrowings under our revolving credit facility. our expected capital requirements for 2016 include up to approximately $195 million of anticipated capital expenditures, net of tenant concessions. as of december 31, 2015, we are committed to fund $29.6 million of additional capital to unconsolidated subsidiaries within our development services business, which we may be required to fund at any time. additionally, as of december 31, 2015, we had aggregate commitments of $12.8 million to fund future co-investments in our global investment management business, $8.8 million of which is expected to be funded in 2016.
on september 1, 2015, cbre, inc., our wholly-owned subsidiary, closed on a purchase agreement with jci to acquire the gws business of jci. the acquired gws business is a market-leading provider of integrated facilities management solutions for major occupiers of commercial real estate and has significant operations around the world. the purchase price was $1.475 billion, payable in cash, with adjustments for working capital and other items. we financed the transaction with (i) a new issuance in august 2015 of $600.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 4.875% senior notes due march 1, 2026; (ii) borrowings in september 2015 of $400.0 million in aggregate principal amount of new tranche b-1 and tranche b-2 term loan facilities under our 2015 credit agreement; (iii) borrowings under our existing revolving credit facility under our 2015 credit agreement; and (iv) cash on hand.
we also completed financing transactions in march 2013, september 2014 and december 2014. in each instance, we took advantage of market conditions to refinance our debt. in addition, in january 2015, we entered into an amended and restated credit agreement providing for a $500.0 million tranche a term loan facility and a $2.6 billion revolving credit facility. as noted above, in september 2015, we added new tranche b-1 and tranche b-2 term loan facilities under this same credit agreement and borrowed an additional $400.0 million. we historically have not sought external sources of financing and have relied on our internally generated cash flow and our revolving credit facility to fund our working capital, capital expenditure and investment requirements. in the absence of extraordinary events or a large strategic acquisition, we anticipate that our cash flow from operations and our revolving credit facility would be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements for the foreseeable future, and at a minimum for the next 12 months. we may again seek to take advantage of market opportunities to refinance existing debt instruments with new debt instruments at interest rates, maturities and terms we deem attractive.
as evidenced above, from time to time we consider potential strategic acquisitions. we believe that any future significant acquisitions that we may make could require us to obtain additional debt or equity financing. in the past, we have been able to obtain such financing for material transactions on terms that we believed to be reasonable. however, it is possible that we may not be able to find acquisition financing on favorable terms, or at all, in the future if we decide to make any further significant acquisitions.
our long-term liquidity needs, other than those related to ordinary course obligations and commitments such as operating leases, are generally comprised of two elements. the first is the repayment of the outstanding and anticipated principal amounts of our long-term indebtedness. we are unable to project with certainty whether our long-term cash flow from operations will be sufficient to repay our long-term debt when it comes due. if our cash flow is insufficient, then we expect that we would need to refinance such indebtedness or otherwise amend its terms to extend the maturity dates. we cannot make any assurances that such refinancing or amendments would be available on attractive terms, if at all.
the second long-term liquidity need is the payment of obligations related to acquisitions. our acquisition structures often include deferred and/or contingent purchase price payments in future periods that are subject to the passage of time or achievement of certain performance metrics and other conditions. as of december 31, 2015 and 2014, we had accrued $79.7 million and $125.2 million, respectively, of deferred purchase consideration, which was included in accounts payable and accrued expenses and in other long-term liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets set forth in item 8 of this annual report.
historical cash flows operating activities net cash provided by operating activities totaled $651.9 million for the year ended december 31, 2015, a decrease of $9.9 million as compared to the year ended december 31, 2014. the decrease in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to higher bonuses and commissions paid during the year ended december 31, 2015 as well as an increase in real estate held for development during the year ended december 31, 2015. these items were partially offset by lower net payments to vendors and lower income taxes paid during the year ended december 31, 2015 as well as improved collections of receivables and operating performance in the current year.
net cash provided by operating activities totaled $661.8 million for the year ended december 31, 2014, a decrease of $83.3 million as compared to the year ended december 31, 2013. this variance was primarily due to an increase in receivables during the year ended december 31, 2014 and greater sales of real estate held for sale and under development during the year ended december 31, 2013. in addition, higher bonuses, income taxes and commissions paid during the year ended december 31, 2014 also contributed to the decrease. these items were partially offset by an increase in bonus accruals and improved operating performance during the year ended december 31, 2014.
investing activities net cash used in investing activities totaled $1.6 billion for the year ended december 31, 2015, an increase of $1.5 billion as compared to the year ended december 31, 2014. this variance was primarily driven by amounts paid for the acquisition of the global workplace solutions business during the year ended december 31, 2015.
net cash used in investing activities totaled $151.6 million for the year ended december 31, 2014, a decrease of $313.4 million as compared to the year ended december 31, 2013. this decrease was primarily driven by greater amounts paid for acquisitions during the year ended december 31, 2013 (including the norland acquisition) and lower proceeds received from the sale of real estate held for investment during the year ended december 31, 2014.
financing activities net cash provided by financing activities totaled $789.5 million for the year ended december 31, 2015, as compared to net cash used in financing activities of $232.1 million for the year ended december 31, 2014. this variance was primarily due to proceeds received from the issuance of $600.0 million of 4.875% senior notes in august 2015 and lower net repayments under our revolving credit facility during the year ended december 31, 2015. also contributing to the increase was the establishment of $900.0 million of new senior term loan facilities under our 2015 credit agreement, partially offset by repayment of $645.6 million of senior term loans under our 2013 credit agreement, both of which occurred during the year ended december 31, 2015. the net proceeds from the issuance of 5.25% senior notes and the redemption of $350.0 million of 6.625% senior notes during the year ended december 31, 2014 partially reduced the overall cash used in financing activities during 2014.
net cash used in financing activities totaled $232.1 million for the year ended december 31, 2014, a decrease of $634.2 million as compared to the year ended december 31, 2013. this variance was primarily due
to our refinancing efforts during the year ended december 31, 2013, including the net repayment of $924.0 million of senior secured term loans and the redemption of $450.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 11.625% senior subordinated notes, partially offset by the issuance of $800.0 million of 5.00% senior notes. proceeds from the issuance of the 5.25% senior notes due in 2025 during the year ended december 31, 2014 and higher net repayments of notes payable on real estate within our development services segment and higher distributions to non-controlling interests during the year ended december 31, 2013 also contributed to the variance. these items were partially offset by the redemption of $350.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.625% senior notes in 2014.

(1)                                         reflects gross outstanding long-term debt balances expected to be paid at maturity, excluding unamortized discount, premium and deferred financing costs. see note 10 of our notes to the consolidated financial statements set forth in item 8 of this annual report. figures do not include scheduled interest payments. assuming each debt obligation is held until maturity, we estimate that we will make the following interest payments (dollars in thousands): 2016  $104,523; 2017 to 2018  $207,394; 2019 to 2020  $203,100 and thereafter  $335,641.
(2)   primarily represents our warehouse lines of credit, which are recourse only to our wholly-owned subsidiary cbre capital markets, inc. and are secured by our related warehouse receivables. see note 10 of our notes to the consolidated financial statements set forth in item 8 of this annual report.

(4)               see note 12 of our notes to the consolidated financial statements set forth in item 8 of this annual report. these obligations are related, either wholly or partially, to the future retirement of our employees and such retirement dates are not predictable. an undeterminable portion of this amount will be paid in years one through five.
(5)   figures do not include scheduled interest payments. the notes have either fixed or variable interest rates, ranging from 2.74% to 10.0% at december 31, 2015.

(9)                                               as of december 31, 2015, our current and non-current tax liabilities, including interest and penalties, totaled $89.3 million. of this amount, we can reasonably estimate that $0.6 million will require cash settlement in less than one year and $40.5 million will require cash settlement in one to three years. we are unable to reasonably estimate the timing of the effective settlement of tax positions for the remaining $48.2 million.
(10)                                        represents outstanding reserves for claims under certain insurance programs, which are included in other current and other long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets at december 31, 2015 set forth in item 8 of this annual report. due to the nature of this item, payments could be due at any time upon the occurrence of certain events. accordingly, the entire balance has been reflected as expiring in less than one year.
indebtedness our level of indebtedness increases the possibility that we may be unable to pay the principal amount of our indebtedness and other obligations when due. in addition, we may incur additional debt from time to time to finance strategic acquisitions, investments, joint ventures or for other purposes, subject to the restrictions contained in the documents governing our indebtedness. if we incur additional debt, the risks associated with our leverage, including our ability to service our debt, would increase.
we maintain credit facilities with third-party lenders, which we use for a variety of purposes. on march 28, 2013, we entered into our 2013 credit agreement with a syndicate of banks led by credit suisse ag, or cs, as administrative and collateral agent, to completely refinance a previous credit agreement. on january 9, 2015, we entered into our 2015 credit agreement with a syndicate of banks jointly led by merrill lynch, pierce, fenner & smith incorporated, j.p. morgan securities llc and cs. in january 2015, we used the proceeds from the tranche a term loan facility under the 2015 credit agreement and from the december 2014 issuance of $125.0 million of 5.25% senior notes due 2025, along with cash on hand, to pay off the prior tranche a and tranche b term loans and the balance on our revolving credit facility under the 2013 credit agreement. on september 3, 2015, we entered into an incremental assumption agreement with a syndicate of banks jointly led by wells fargo securities, llc and cs to establish new tranche b-1 and tranche b-2 term loan facilities under the 2015 credit agreement in an aggregate principal amount of $400.0 million.
the 2015 credit agreement is an unsecured credit facility that is jointly and severally guaranteed by us and substantially all of our material domestic subsidiaries. the 2015 credit agreement currently provides for the following: (1) a $2.6 billion revolving credit facility, which includes the capacity to obtain letters of credit and swingline loans and matures on january 9, 2020; (2) a $500.0 million tranche a term loan facility requiring quarterly principal payments, which began on june 30, 2015 and continue through maturity on january 9, 2020; (3) a $270.0 million tranche b-1 term loan facility requiring quarterly principal payments, which began on december 31, 2015 and continue through maturity on september 3, 2020; and (4) a $130.0 million tranche b-2 term loan facility requiring quarterly principal payments, which began on december 31, 2015 and continue through maturity on september 3, 2022. for additional information on our credit agreements, see note 10 of the notes to consolidated financial statements set forth in item 8 of this annual report.

of the fasb asc (topic 815). the purpose of these interest rate swap agreements is to attempt to hedge potential changes to our cash flows due to the variable interest nature of our senior term loan facilities. the total notional amount of these interest rate swap agreements is $400.0 million, with $200.0 million expiring in october 2017 and $200.0 million expiring in september 2019. as of december 31, 2015 and 2014, the fair values of such interest rate swap agreements were reflected as a $21.5 million liability and a $26.9 million liability, respectively, and were included in other long-term liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets set forth in item 8 of this annual report.

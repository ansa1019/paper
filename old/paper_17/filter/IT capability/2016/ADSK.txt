item 1a.   risk factors we operate in a rapidly changing environment that involves significant risks, a number of which are beyond our control. in addition to the other information contained in this form 10-k, the following discussion highlights some of these risks and the possible impact of these factors on our business, financial condition, and future results of operations. if any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, or results of operations may be adversely impacted, causing the trading price of our common stock to decline. in addition, these risks and uncertainties may impact the "forward-looking" statements described elsewhere in this form 10-k and in the documents incorporated herein by reference. they could affect our actual results of operations, causing them to differ materially from those expressed in "forward-looking" statements.
global economic and political conditions may further impact our business, financial results and financial condition.
as our business has expanded globally, we have increasingly become subject to risks arising from adverse changes in global economic and political conditions. the past several years were characterized by mixed global economic conditions, volatile credit markets, volatile exchange rates, relatively high unemployment, increased government deficit spending and debt levels, uncertainty about certain governments' abilities to repay such debt or to address certain fiscal issues, and volatility in many financial instrument markets. if economic growth in countries where we do business slows, such as in japan or in emerging economies, or if such countries experience further economic recessions, customers may delay or reduce technology purchases. this could result in reductions in sales of our products and services, longer sales cycles and slower adoption of our technologies.
over the past several years, many of our customers have experienced tighter credit, negative financial news and weaker financial performance of their businesses and have reduced their workforces, thereby reducing the number of licenses and the number of maintenance contracts they purchase from us. in addition, a number of our customers rely, directly and indirectly, on government spending. current debt balances of many countries without proportionate increases in revenues have caused many countries to reduce spending and in some cases have forced those countries to restructure their debt in an effort to avoid defaulting under those obligations. this has not only impacted those countries but others that are holders of such debt and those assisting in such restructuring.
these actions may impact, and over the past several years have negatively impacted, our business, financial results and financial condition. moreover, our financial performance may be negatively impacted by:
•   lack of credit available to, and the insolvency of, key channel partners, which may impair our distribution channels and cash flows;
•   inability of banks to honor our existing line of credit, which could increase our borrowing expenses or eliminate our ability to obtain short-term financing; and
in addition, in june 2016, voters in the united kingdom approved an advisory referendum to withdraw from the european union (commonly referred to as "brexit"). the brexit vote and the perceptions as to the impact of the withdrawal of the united kingdom from the european union may adversely affect business activity, political stability and economic conditions in the united kingdom, the european union and elsewhere.
it is uncertain at this time how the new u.s. president, administration and congress will affect our business, including potentially through increased import tariffs and other influences on u.s. trade relations with other countries, such as mexico and china. the imposition of tariffs or other trade barriers could increase our costs and reduce the competitiveness of our offerings in certain markets. in addition, other countries may change their own policies on business and foreign investment in companies in their respective countries.
geopolitical trends toward nationalism and protectionism and the weakening or dissolution of international trade pacts may increase the cost of, or otherwise interfere with, conducting business. uncertainty about current and future economic and political conditions on us, our customers and partners, makes it difficult for us to forecast operating results and to make decisions about future investments.
further macro-economic degradation, a slower economic recovery in industries important to our business or adverse exchange rate movements, may adversely affect our business, financial results and financial condition.
if we fail to successfully manage our business model transition to cloud-based products and more flexible product licenses, our results of operations could be negatively impacted.
to address the industry transition from personal computer to cloud, mobile, and social computing, we have accelerated our move to the cloud and are offering more flexible product licenses. to support our transition, we discontinued selling new perpetual licenses of most individual software products effective february 1, 2016, and discontinued selling new perpetual licenses of suites effective august 1, 2016. as a result, we expect to derive an increasing portion of our revenues in the future from subscriptions. this subscription model prices and delivers our products in a way that differs from the historical perpetual pricing and delivery methods. these changes reflect a significant shift from perpetual license sales and distribution of our software in favor of providing our customers the right to access certain of our software in a hosted environment or use downloaded software for a specified subscription period. during our transition, revenue, billings, gross margin, operating margin, net income (loss), earnings (loss) per share, deferred revenue, and cash flow from operations will be impacted as more revenue is recognized ratably rather than upfront and as new offerings bring a wider variety of price points.
our ability to achieve our financial objectives is subject to risks and uncertainties. the new offerings require a considerable investment of technical, financial, legal, and sales resources, and a scalable organization. market acceptance of such offerings is affected by a variety of factors, including but not limited to: security, reliability, performance, current license terms, customer preference, social/community engagement, customer concerns with entrusting a third party to store and manage their data, public concerns regarding privacy and the enactment of restrictive laws or regulations. whether our business model transition will prove successful and will accomplish our business and financial objectives is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to: customer demand, attach and renewal rates, channel acceptance, our ability to further develop and scale infrastructure, our ability to include functionality and usability in such offerings that address customer requirements, tax and accounting implications, pricing, and our costs. in addition, the metrics we use to gauge the status of our business model transition may evolve over the course of the transition as significant trends emerge. if we are unable to successfully establish these new offerings and navigate our business model transition in light of the foregoing risks and uncertainties, our results of operations could be negatively impacted.
our strategy to develop and introduce new products and services exposes us to risks such as limited customer acceptance, costs related to product defects, and large expenditures, each of which may not result in additional net revenue or could result in decreased net revenue.
rapid technological changes, as well as changes in customer requirements and preferences, characterize the software industry. just as the transition from mainframes to personal computers transformed the industry 30 years ago, we believe our industry is undergoing a similar transition from the personal computer to cloud, mobile, and social computing. customers are also reconsidering the manner in which they license software products, which requires us to constantly evaluate our business model and strategy. in response, we are focused on providing solutions to enable our customers to be more agile and collaborative on their projects. we are also developing consumer products for digital art, personal design and creativity, and home design. we devote significant resources to the development of new technologies. in addition, we frequently introduce new business models or methods that require a considerable investment of technical and financial resources such as our introduction of flexible license and service offerings. it is uncertain whether these strategies will prove successful or whether we will be able to develop the necessary infrastructure and business models more quickly than our competitors. we are making such investments through further development and enhancement of our existing products and services, as well as through acquisitions of new product lines. such investments may not result in sufficient revenue generation to justify their costs and could result in decreased net revenue. if we are not able to meet customer requirements, either with respect to our software or
hardware products or the manner in which we provide such products, or if we are not able to adapt our business model to meet our customers' requirements, our business, financial condition or results of operations may be adversely impacted.
in particular, a critical component of our growth strategy is to have customers of our autocad and autocad lt products expand their portfolios to include our other offerings and cloud-based services. we want customers using individual autodesk products to expand their portfolio with our other offerings and cloud-based services, and we are taking steps to accelerate this migration. at times, sales of licenses of our autocad and autocad lt or individual autodesk flagship products have decreased without a corresponding increase in industry collections or cloud-based services revenue or without purchases of customer seats to our industry collections. should this continue, our results of operations will be adversely affected. also, adoption of our cloud and mobile computing offerings and changes in the delivery of our software and services to our customers, such as desktop subscription (formerly referred to as rental) offerings, will change the way in which we recognize revenue relating to our software and services, with a potential negative impact on our financial performance. the accounting impact of these offerings and other business decisions are expected to result in an increase in the percentage of our ratable revenue, as well as recurring revenue, making for a more predictable business over time, while potentially reducing our upfront perpetual revenue stream.
our executive management team must act quickly, continuously, and with vision, given the rapidly changing customer expectations and technology advancements inherent in the software industry, the extensive and complex efforts required to create useful and widely accepted products and the rapid evolution of cloud computing, mobile devices, new computing platforms, and other technologies, such as consumer products. although we have articulated a strategy that we believe will fulfill these challenges, if we fail to execute properly on that strategy or adapt that strategy as market conditions evolve, we may fail to meet our customers' expectations, fail to compete with our competitors' products and technology, and lose the confidence of our channel partners and employees. this in turn could adversely affect our business and financial performance.
our entry into 3d printing presents many of the risks described above concerning developing and introducing new products as well as new risks for us. the manufacturing and 3d printing markets are highly competitive and some of our competitors have experience and resources superior to ours. we have limited experience designing, developing, and selling hardware products and no experience developing and selling printers. the market for 3d printing is nascent and may not develop as rapidly as we expect. our sale of 3d printers could subject us to product and other liability that we do not currently face. if any of these risks materialize, it could adversely affect our business and financial performance as well as our reputation and brand.
revenue from our offerings may be difficult to predict during our business model transition.
the discontinuance of our perpetual licenses for most individual software products on february 1, 2016 and for perpetual suites on august 1, 2016 has and will continue to result in the loss of future upfront licensing revenue. this also has frozen the growth of our maintenance subscription revenue because there will be no further opportunities to attach maintenance licensing. we expect our maintenance subscription revenue to decline over time, but it may decline more quickly than anticipated due to low maintenance renewals. at the same time, our new model subscription revenue may not grow as rapidly as anticipated. our new model subscription pricing allows customers to use our offerings at a lower initial cost when compared to the sale of a perpetual license. although our new model subscriptions are designed to increase the number of customers who purchase offerings and create a recurring revenue stream that is more predictable over time, it creates risks related to the timing of revenue recognition and expected reductions in cash flows in the near term.
our customers are not obligated to renew their subscriptions for our offerings, and they may elect not to renew. we cannot assure renewal rates, or the mix of subscriptions renewals. customer renewal rates may decline or fluctuate due to a number of factors, including offering pricing, competitive offerings, customer satisfaction, and reductions in customer spending levels or customer activity due to economic downturns or financial markets uncertainty. if our customers do not renew their subscriptions or if they renew on less favorable terms, our revenues may decline.
we are dependent on international revenue and operations, exposing us to significant regulatory, global economic, intellectual property, collections, currency exchange rate, taxation, political instability and other risks, which could adversely impact our financial results.
we are dependent on our international operations for a significant portion of our revenue. international net revenue represented 63% and 68% of our net revenue in fiscal 2017 and 2016, respectively. our international revenue, including that from emerging economies, is subject to general economic and political conditions in foreign markets, including conditions in foreign markets resulting from economic and political conditions in the u.s. our revenue is also impacted by the relative geographical and country mix of our revenue over time. at times, these factors adversely impact our international revenue, and consequently our business as a whole. our dependency on international revenue makes us much more exposed to global economic and political trends, which can negatively impact our financial results, even if our results in the u.s. are strong for a particular period. further, a significant portion of our earnings from our international operations may not be freely transferable to the u.s. due to remittance restrictions, adverse tax consequences or other factors.
•   economic volatility;
•   fluctuating currency exchange rates, including risks related to any hedging activities we undertake;
•   operating in locations with a higher incidence of corruption and fraudulent business practices, particularly in emerging economies;
•   increasing enforcement by the u.s. under the foreign corrupt practices act, and adoption of stricter anti-corruption laws in certain countries, including the united kingdom;
•   local competition;
•   tax arrangements with foreign governments, including our ability to meet and renew the terms of those tax arrangements;
•   possible future limitations upon foreign owned businesses;
•   increased financial accounting and reporting burdens and complexities;
the brexit vote has exacerbated and may further exacerbate many of the risks and uncertainties described above. the proposed withdrawal of the united kingdom from the european union could, among other potential outcomes, adversely affect the tax, tax treaty, currency, operational, legal and regulatory regimes to which our businesses in the region are subject. the withdrawal could also, among other potential outcomes, disrupt the free movement of goods, services and people between the united kingdom and the european union and significantly disrupt trade between the united kingdom and the european union and other parties. further, uncertainty around these and related issues could lead to adverse effects on the economy of the united kingdom and the other economies in which we operate.
actions that we are taking to restructure our business in alignment with our business model transition strategy may be costly and may not be as effective as anticipated.
during the first quarter of fiscal 2017, we commenced a company-wide restructuring plan to accelerate the company's move to the cloud and its transition to a subscription-based business model. through the restructuring, we sought to reduce expenses, streamline the organization, and reallocate resources to align more closely with the company's needs going forward. as a result of these actions, we have incurred and may incur additional costs in the short term that have the effect of reducing our operating margins. if we are unable to realize the expected outcomes from the restructuring efforts, our business and operating results may be harmed.
our software is highly complex and may contain undetected errors, defects or vulnerabilities, each of which could harm our business and financial performance.
the software products that we offer are complex, and despite extensive testing and quality control, may contain errors, defects or vulnerabilities. some errors, defects and vulnerabilities in our software products may only be discovered after the product or service has been released. any errors, defects or vulnerabilities could result in the need for corrective releases to our software products, damage to our reputation, loss of revenue, an increase in product returns or lack of market acceptance of our products, any of which would likely harm our business and financial performance.
existing and increased competition and rapidly evolving technological changes may reduce our revenue and profits.
the software industry has limited barriers to entry, and the availability of computing devices with continually expanding performance at progressively lower prices contributes to the ease of market entry. the industry is presently undergoing a platform shift from the personal computer to cloud and mobile computing. this shift further lowers barriers to entry and poses a disruptive challenge to established software companies. the markets in which we compete are characterized by vigorous competition, both by entry of competitors with innovative technologies and by consolidation of companies with complementary products and technologies. in addition, some of our competitors in certain markets have greater financial, technical, sales and marketing, and other resources. furthermore, a reduction in the number and availability of compatible third-party applications, or our inability to rapidly adapt to technological and customer preference changes, including those related to cloud computing, mobile devices, and new computing platforms, may adversely affect the sale of our products. because of these and other factors, competitive conditions in the industry are likely to intensify in the future. increased competition could result in price reductions, reduced net revenue and profit margins and loss of market share, any of which would likely harm our business.
because we conduct a substantial portion of our business outside the u.s. and we make certain business and resource decisions based on assumptions about foreign currency, we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates. these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and economic conditions change. for example, the june 23, 2016 announcement of brexit caused significant volatility in global stock markets and currency exchange rate
we use derivative instruments to manage a portion of our cash flow exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. as part of our risk management strategy, we use foreign currency contracts to manage a portion of our exposures of underlying assets, liabilities, and other obligations, which exist as part of our ongoing business operations. these foreign currency instruments have maturities that extend for one to twelve months in the future, and provide us with some protection against currency exposures. however, our attempts to hedge against these risks may not be completely successful, resulting in an adverse impact on our financial results.
the fluctuations of currencies in which we conduct business can both increase and decrease our overall revenue and expenses for any given fiscal period. although our foreign currency cash flow hedge program extends beyond the current quarter in order to reduce our exposure to foreign currency volatility, we do not attempt to completely mitigate this risk, and in any case, will incur transaction fees in adopting such hedging programs. such volatility, even when it increases our revenues or decreases our expenses, impacts our ability to accurately predict our future results and earnings.
a breach of security in our products, services or computer systems may compromise the integrity of our products or services, harm our reputation, create additional liability and adversely impact our financial results.
we make significant efforts to maintain the security and integrity of our source code and computer systems. the risk of a security breach or disruption, particularly through cyber attack or cyber intrusion, including by computer hackers, foreign governments and cyber terrorists, has increased as the number, intensity and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions from around the world have increased. these threats include but are not limited to identity theft, unauthorized access, dns attacks, wireless network attacks, viruses and worms, advanced persistent threat (apt), application centric attacks, peer-to-peer attacks, phishing, backdoor trojans and distributed denial of service (ddos) attacks. any of the foregoing could attack our products, services or computer systems. despite significant efforts to create security barriers to such programs, it is virtually impossible for us to entirely eliminate this risk. like all software, our software is vulnerable to cyber attacks. in the past, hackers have targeted our software, and they may do so in the future. the impact of cyber attacks could disrupt the proper functioning of our software products or services, cause errors in the output of our customers' work, allow unauthorized access to sensitive, proprietary or confidential information of ours or our customers, and other destructive outcomes. moreover, as we continue to invest in new lines of consumer products and services we are exposed to increased security risks and the potential for unauthorized access to, or improper use of, the information of our consumer users. for example, cyber attacks could make our customers hesitant to adopt our cloud-based hosted subscription services, which could negatively impact our business model transition. if any of the foregoing were to occur, our reputation may suffer, customers may stop buying our products or services, we could face lawsuits and potential liability, and our financial performance could be negatively impacted.
changes in laws or regulations related to the internet, local data storage or related to privacy and data security concerns may impact our business or expose us to increased liability.
the future success of our business depends upon the continued use of the internet as a primary medium for commerce, communication, and business applications. federal, state, or foreign government bodies or agencies have in the past adopted, and may in the future adopt, laws or regulations affecting data privacy and the transmission of certain types of content using the internet. for example, the state of california has adopted legislation requiring operators of commercial websites and mobile applications that collect personal information from california residents to conspicuously post and comply with privacy policies that satisfy certain requirements. several other u.s. states have adopted legislation requiring companies to protect the security of personal information that they collect from consumers over the internet, and more states may adopt similar legislation in the future. additionally, the federal trade commission has used its authority under section 5 of the federal trade commission act to bring actions against companies for failing to maintain adequate security for personal information collected from consumers over the internet and for failing to comply with privacy- related representations made to internet users. the u.s. congress has at various times proposed federal legislation intended to protect the privacy of internet users and the security of personal information collected from internet users that would impose additional compliance burdens upon companies collecting personal information from internet users, and the u.s. congress may adopt such legislation in the future. the european union also has adopted various directives regulating data privacy and security and the transmission of content using the internet involving residents of the european union, including those directives known as the data protection directive, the e-privacy directive, and the privacy and electronic communications directive, and may adopt similar directives in the future. other countries, including canada and several latin american and asian countries, have constitutional protections for, or have adopted legislation protecting, individuals' personal information. additionally, some federal, state, or foreign governmental bodies have
established laws that seek to censor the transmission of certain types of content over the internet or require that individuals be provided with the ability to permanently delete all electronic personal information, such as the german multimedia law of 1997 and the california "eraser law" for minors. additionally, some foreign governmental bodies (such as russia and china) have established laws or have proposed laws that seek to require local data storage.
in addition, new laws and industry self-regulatory codes have been enacted and more are being considered that may affect our ability to reach current and prospective customers, to understand how our products and services are being used, to respond to customer requests allowed under the laws, and to implement our new business models effectively. these new laws and regulations would similarly affect our competitors as well as our customers.
given the variety of global privacy and data protection regimes, it is possible we may find ourselves subject to inconsistent obligations. for instance, the usa patriot act is considered by some to be in conflict with certain directives of the european union. situations such as these require that we make prospective determinations regarding compliance with conflicting regulations. increased enforcement of existing laws and regulations, as well as any laws, regulations or changes that may be adopted or implemented in the future, could limit the growth of the use of public cloud applications or communications generally, result in a decline in the use of the internet and the viability of internet-based applications, and require us to implement additional technological safeguards.
in addition, in october 2015 the european court of justice issued a ruling immediately invalidating the u.s.-eu safe harbor framework, which facilitated personal data transfers to the u.s. in compliance with applicable eu data protection laws. in february 2016, the european commission and the united states agreed on a new framework for transatlantic data flows: the eu-u.s. privacy shield. we rely on other legal mechanisms for data transfer and continue to comply with the previous u.s.-eu safe harbor framework and u.s.-swiss safe harbor framework as set forth by the u.s. department of commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information from european union member countries and switzerland.
increasing regulatory focus on privacy issues could impact our new business models and expose us to increased liability.
governments, privacy advocates and class action attorneys are increasingly scrutinizing how companies collect, process, use, store, share or transmit personal data. any perception of our practices or products as an invasion of privacy, whether or not consistent with current regulations and industry practices, may subject us to public criticism, class action lawsuits, reputational harm or claims by regulators, industry groups or other third parties, all of which could disrupt our business and expose us to increased liability.
we rely on third-parties to provide us with a number of operational services, including hosting and delivery and certain of our customer services and other operations and processing of data; any interruption or delay in service from these third parties, breaches of security or privacy could expose us to liability, harm our reputation and adversely impact our financial performance.
we increasingly rely on hosted computer services from third parties for services that we provide our customers and computer operations for our internal use. as we gather customer data and host certain customer data in third-party facilities, a security breach could compromise the integrity or availability or result in the theft of customer data. in addition, our operations could be negatively affected in the event of a security breach, and we could be subject to the loss or theft of confidential or proprietary information, including source code.
unauthorized access to this data may be obtained through break-ins, breaches of our secure networks by unauthorized parties, employee theft or misuse, or other misconduct. we rely on a number of third party suppliers in the operation of our business for the provision of various services and materials that we use in the operation of our business and production of our products. we may from time to time rely on a single or limited number of suppliers, or upon suppliers in a single country, for these services or materials. the inability of such third parties to satisfy our requirements could disrupt our business operations or make it more difficult for us to implement our business strategy. if any of these situations were to occur, our reputation could be harmed, we could be subject to third party liability, including under data protection and privacy laws in certain jurisdictions, and our financial performance could be negatively impacted.
if we do not maintain good relationships with the members of our distribution channel, or achieve anticipated levels of sell-through, our ability to generate revenue will be adversely affected. if our distribution channel suffers financial losses, becomes financially unstable or insolvent, or is not provided the right mix of incentives to sell our products, our ability to generate revenue will be adversely affected.
we sell our software products both directly to end-users and through a network of distributors and resellers. for fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016, approximately 72% and 79%, respectively, of our revenue was derived from indirect channel sales through distributors and resellers and we expect that the majority of our revenue will continue to be derived from indirect channel sales in the future. our ability to effectively distribute our products depends in part upon the financial and business condition of our distributor and reseller network. computer software distributors and resellers typically are not highly capitalized, have previously experienced difficulties during times of economic contraction and experienced difficulties during the past several years. we have processes to ensure that we assess the creditworthiness of distributors and resellers prior to our sales to them. in the past we have taken steps to support them, and may take additional steps in the future, such as extending credit terms and providing temporary discounts. these steps, if taken, could harm our financial results. if our distributors and resellers were to become insolvent, they would not be able to maintain their business and sales, or provide customer support services, which would negatively impact our business and revenue.
we rely significantly upon major distributors and resellers in both the u.s. and international regions, including the distributor tech data corporation and its global affiliates ("tech data"). tech data accounted for 30% and 25% of our total net revenue for fiscal 2017 and 2016, respectively. although we believe that we are not substantially dependent on tech data, if tech data were to experience a significant disruption with its business or if our relationship with tech data were to significantly deteriorate, it is possible that our ability to sell to end users would be, at least temporarily, negatively impacted. this could in turn negatively impact our financial results.
over time, we have modified and will continue to modify aspects of our relationship with our distributors and resellers, such as their incentive programs, pricing to them and our distribution model to motivate and reward them for aligning their businesses with our strategy and business objectives. changes in these relationships and underlying programs could negatively impact their business and harm our business. in addition, the loss of or a significant reduction in business with those distributors or resellers or the failure to achieve anticipated levels of sell-through with any one of our major international distributors or large resellers could harm our business. in particular, if one or more of such distributors or resellers were unable to meet their obligations with respect to accounts payable to us, we could be forced to write off such accounts and may be required to delay the recognition of revenue on future sales to these customers. these events could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.
our maintenance customers have no obligation to renew their maintenance contracts after the expiration of their maintenance period, which is typically one year. the discontinuance of our perpetual licenses for most individual software products on february 1, 2016 and for perpetual suites on august 1, 2016 resulted in the loss of future maintenance attach opportunities. we expect customer renewal rates will decline or fluctuate over time as a result of a number of factors, including the overall global economy, the health of their businesses, the perceived value of the maintenance program and planned maintenance pricing increases. if our non-renewing maintenance customers do not transition to our new business model subscriptions, our future revenue and financial results will be negatively impacted.
our financial results fluctuate within each quarter and from quarter to quarter making our future revenue and financial results difficult to predict.
our quarterly financial results have fluctuated in the past and will continue to do so in the future. these fluctuations could cause our stock price to change significantly or experience declines. we also provide investors with quarterly and annual financial forward-looking guidance that could prove to be inaccurate as a result of these fluctuations. in addition to the other factors described in this part i, item 1a, some of the factors that could cause our financial results to fluctuate include:
•   general market, economic, business, and political conditions in particular geographies, including europe, apac, and emerging economies;
•   failure to produce sufficient revenue, billings or subscription growth, and profitability;
•   failure to achieve anticipated levels of customer acceptance of our business model transition, including the impact of the end of upgrades and perpetual licenses;
•   weak or negative growth in one or more of the industries we serve, including aec, manufacturing, and digital media and entertainment markets;
•   changes in revenue recognition or other accounting guidelines employed by us and/or established by the financial accounting standards board or other rule-making bodies;
•   fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and the effectiveness of our hedging activity;
•   failure to achieve and maintain cost reductions and productivity increases;
•   changes in billings linearity;
•   the ability of governments around the world to adopt fiscal policies, meet their financial and debt obligations, and to finance infrastructure projects;
•   our inability to rapidly adapt to technological and customer preference changes, including those related to cloud computing, mobile devices, new computing platforms, and 3d printing;
•   the timing of the introduction of new products by us or our competitors;
•   the success of new business or sales initiatives;
•   the financial and business condition of our reseller and distribution channels;
•   failure to accurately predict the impact of acquired businesses or to identify and realize the anticipated benefits of acquisitions, and successfully integrate such acquired businesses and technologies;
•   perceived or actual technical or other problems with a product or combination of products;
•   unexpected or negative outcomes of matters and expenses relating to litigation or regulatory inquiries;
•   security breaches and potential financial penalties to customers and government entities;
•   timing of additional investments in the development of our platform or deployment of our services;
•   changes in tax laws or regulations, tax arrangements with foreign governments or accounting rules, such as increased use of fair value measures;
•   the timing and degree of expected investments in growth and efficiency opportunities;
•   potential goodwill impairment charges related to prior acquisitions;
we have also experienced fluctuations in financial results in interim periods in certain geographic regions due to seasonality or regional economic or political conditions. in particular, our financial results in europe during our third quarter are usually affected by a slower summer period, and our apac operations typically experience seasonal slowing in our third and fourth quarters.
our operating expenses are based in part on our expectations for future revenue and are relatively fixed in the short term. accordingly, any revenue shortfall below expectations has had, and in the future could have, an immediate and significant adverse effect on our profitability. greater than anticipated expenses or a failure to maintain rigorous cost controls would also negatively affect profitability.
our business could suffer as a result of risks, costs, charges and integration risks associated with strategic acquisitions and investments.
we regularly acquire or invest in businesses, software products and technologies that are complementary to our business through acquisitions, strategic alliances or equity or debt investments. the risks associated with such acquisitions include, among others, the difficulty of assimilating products, operations and personnel, inheriting liabilities such as intellectual property infringement claims, the failure to realize anticipated revenue and cost projections, the requirement to test and assimilate the internal control processes of the acquired business in accordance with the requirements of section 404 of the sarbanes-oxley act of 2002, and the diversion of management's time and attention. for example, we face risks relating to our fiscal 2017 integration of our delcam subsidiaries, which previously operated autonomously.
in addition, such acquisitions and investments involve other risks such as:
•   the inability to retain customers, key employees, vendors, distributors, business partners, and other entities associated with the acquired business;
•   exposure to litigation or other claims in connection with, or inheritance of claims or litigation risk as a result of, an acquisition, including but not limited to, claims from terminated employees, customers, or other third parties;
•   potential additional exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates; and
•   the potential impact on relationships with existing customers, vendors, and distributors as business partners as a result of acquiring another business.
we may not be successful in overcoming such risks, and such acquisitions and investments may negatively impact our business. in addition, such acquisitions and investments have in the past and may in the future contribute to potential fluctuations in our quarterly financial results. these fluctuations could arise from transaction-related costs and charges associated with eliminating redundant expenses or write-offs of impaired assets recorded in connection with acquisitions and investments. these costs or charges could negatively impact our financial results for a given period, cause quarter to quarter variability in our financial results or negatively impact our financial results for several future periods.
we derive a substantial portion of our net revenue from sales of licenses of a limited number of our products, including autocad software, products based on autocad, which include our collections that serve specific markets and products that are interoperable with autocad. any factor adversely affecting sales of these products, including the product release cycle, market acceptance, product competition, performance and reliability, reputation, price competition, economic and market conditions and the availability of third-party applications, would likely harm our financial results. during fiscal 2017 and 2016, combined revenue from our autocad and autocad lt products, not including collections (formerly suites) having autocad or autocad lt as a component, represented 16% and 24% of our total net revenue, respectively.
we rely on a combination of patent, copyright and trademark laws, trade secret protections, confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary rights. despite such efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties from time to time have copied aspects of our software products or have obtained and used information that we regard as proprietary. policing unauthorized use of our software products is time-consuming and costly. we are unable to measure the extent to which piracy of our software products exists and we expect that software piracy will remain a persistent problem, particularly in emerging economies. furthermore, our means of protecting our proprietary rights may not be adequate.
additionally, we actively protect the secrecy of our confidential information and trade secrets, including our source code. if unauthorized disclosure of our source code occurs, we could potentially lose future trade secret protection for that source code. the loss of future trade secret protection could make it easier for third-parties to compete with our products by copying functionality, which could adversely affect our financial performance and our reputation. we also seek to protect our confidential information and trade secrets through the use of non-disclosure agreements with our customers, contractors, vendors and partners. however, it is possible that our confidential information and trade secrets may be disclosed or published without our authorization. if this were to occur, it may be difficult and/or costly for us to enforce our rights, and our financial performance and reputation could be negatively impacted.
as more software patents are granted worldwide, the number of products and competitors in our industry segments grows and the functionality of products in different industry segments overlaps, we expect that software product developers will be increasingly subject to infringement claims. infringement or misappropriation claims have in the past been, and may in the future be, asserted against us, and any such assertions could harm our business. additionally, certain patent holders without products have become more aggressive in threatening and pursuing litigation in attempts to obtain fees for licensing the right to use patents. any such claims or threats, whether with or without merit, have been and could in the future be time-consuming to defend, result in costly litigation and diversion of resources, cause product shipment delays or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements. in addition, such royalty or license agreements, if required, may not be available on acceptable terms, if at all, which would likely harm our business.
from time to time we realign or introduce new business and sales initiatives; if we fail to successfully execute and manage these initiatives, our results of operations could be negatively impacted.
as part of our effort to accommodate our customers' needs and demands and the rapid evolution of technology, we from time to time evolve our business and sales initiatives such as realigning our development and marketing organizations, offering software as a service, and realigning our internal resources in an effort to improve efficiency. we may take such actions without clear indications that they will prove successful, and at times, we have been met with short-term challenges in the execution of such initiatives. market acceptance of any new business or sales initiative is dependent on our ability to match our customers' needs at the right time and price. often we have limited prior experience and operating history in these new areas of emphasis. if any of our assumptions about expenses, revenue or revenue recognition principles from these initiatives proves incorrect, or our attempts to improve efficiency are not successful, our actual results may vary materially from those anticipated, and our financial results will be negatively impacted.
in connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended january 31, 2017, our management concluded that it has a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting related to the operating effectiveness of our controls over the calculation of income tax expense. a material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.
management first identified a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting in connection with the preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements for the fiscal quarter ended october 31, 2015. since that time, management's remediation activities have included the following:
•   enhanced the design of our income tax controls to include specific activities to ensure proper classification of deferred taxes and calculation of income tax expense;
•   supplemented our accounting and tax professionals with the engagement of an internationally recognized accounting firm to assist us in the technical review regarding the application of tax rules around deferred tax assets and liabilities; and
management has enhanced its controls to include refinements and improvements to controls over the accounting for income taxes. while significant progress has been made as of january 31, 2017, management does not believe these controls are operating effectively. as a result, management does not believe that the material weakness has been remediated and will continue to enhance its controls over the accounting for income tax expense.
there can be no assurance that our remedial measures will be sufficient to address the material weakness or that our internal control over financial reporting will not be subject to additional material weaknesses in the future. if the remedial measures that we take are insufficient to address our material weakness or if additional material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal control are discovered or occur in the future, our consolidated financial statements may contain material misstatements, and we could be required to restate our financial results. additionally, we may encounter problems or delays in implementing any changes necessary for management to make a favorable assessment of our internal control over financial reporting. if we cannot favorably assess the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, investors could lose confidence in our financial reports and the price of our common stock could decline.
net revenue, billings, earnings or subscriptions shortfalls or the volatility of the market generally may cause the market price of our stock to decline.
the market price for our common stock has experienced significant fluctuations and may continue to fluctuate significantly. the market price for our common stock may be affected by a number of factors, including the other factors described in this part i, item 1a and the following:
•   results and future projections related to our business model transition;
•   quarterly variations in our or our competitors' results of operations;
•   general socio-economic, political or market conditions;
•   changes in estimates of future results or recommendations or confusion on the part of analysts and investors about the short-term and long-term impact to our business resulting from our business model transition;
•   uncertainty about certain governments' abilities to repay debt or effect fiscal policy;
•   the announcement of new products or product enhancements by us or our competitors;
•   unusual events such as significant acquisitions, divestitures, regulatory actions, and litigation;
•   other factors, including factors unrelated to our operating performance, such as instability affecting the economy or the operating performance of our competitors.
significant changes in the price of our common stock could expose us to costly and time-consuming litigation. historically, after periods of volatility in the market price of a company's securities, a company becomes more susceptible to securities class action litigation. this type of litigation is often expensive and diverts management's attention and resources.
our ceo transition may cause uncertainty regarding the future of our business and impact employee hiring and retention.
carl bass resigned as our president and ceo effective february 8, 2017 after having held such positions for over ten years. in connection with mr. bass' resignation, the board has instituted a ceo search to consider candidates inside and outside autodesk and has formed an interim office of the chief executive to oversee the company's day-to-day operations. the ceo transition, and any related speculation and uncertainty regarding our future business strategy and direction in connection with the search and the appointment of a permanent ceo, may cause or result in:
•   disruption of our business and to our relationships with our customers and employees;
•   difficulty recruiting, hiring, motivating and retaining talented and skilled personnel, including a permanent ceo; and
•   increased stock price volatility.
our success and ability to invest and grow depend largely on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled technical, professional, managerial, sales, and marketing personnel. historically, competition for these key personnel has been intense. the loss of services of any of our key personnel (including key personnel joining our company through acquisitions), the inability to retain and attract qualified personnel in the future, or delays in hiring required personnel, particularly engineering and sales personnel, could make it difficult to meet key objectives, such as timely and effective product introductions and financial goals.
our investment portfolio consists of a variety of investment vehicles in a number of countries that are subject to interest rate trends, market volatility, and other economic factors. if general economic conditions decline, this could cause the credit ratings of our investments to deteriorate, illiquidity in the financial marketplace, and we may experience a decline in interest income and an inability to sell our investments, leading to impairment in the value of our investments.
it is our policy to invest our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities in highly liquid instruments with, and in the custody of, financial institutions with high credit ratings and to limit the amounts invested with any one institution, type of security and issuer. however, we are subject to general economic conditions, interest rate trends and volatility in the financial marketplace that can affect the income that we receive from our investments, the net realizable value of our investments (including our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities) and our ability to sell them. in the u.s., for example, the yields on our portfolio securities are very low due to general economic conditions. any one of these factors could reduce our investment income, or result in material charges, which in turn could impact our overall net income (loss) and earnings (loss) per share.
from time to time we make direct investments in privately held companies. privately held company investments are considered inherently risky. the technologies and products these companies have under development are typically in the early stages and may never materialize, which could result in a loss of all or a substantial part of our initial investment in these companies. the evaluation of privately held companies is based on information that we request from these companies, which is not subject to the same disclosure regulations as u.s. publicly traded companies, and as such, the basis for these evaluations is subject to the timing and accuracy of the data received from these companies.
a loss on any of our investments may cause us to record an other-than-temporary impairment charge. the effect of this charge could impact our overall net income (loss) and earnings (loss) per share. in any of these scenarios, our liquidity may be negatively impacted, which in turn may prohibit us from making investments in our business, taking advantage of opportunities and potentially meeting our financial obligations as they come due.
we are subject to legal proceedings and regulatory inquiries, and we may be named in additional legal proceedings or become involved in regulatory inquiries in the future, all of which are costly, distracting to our core business and could result in an unfavorable outcome, or a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or the trading prices for our securities.
we are involved in legal proceedings and receive inquiries from regulatory agencies. as the global economy has changed and our business has evolved, we have seen an increase in litigation activity and regulatory inquiries. like many other high technology companies, the number and frequency of inquiries from u.s. and foreign regulatory agencies we have received regarding our business and our business practices, and the business practices of others in our industry, have increased in recent years. in the event that we are involved in significant disputes or are the subject of a formal action by a regulatory agency, we could be exposed to costly and time consuming legal proceedings that could result in any number of outcomes. any claims or regulatory actions initiated by or against us, whether successful or not, could result in expensive costs of defense, costly damage awards, injunctive relief, increased costs of business, fines or orders to change certain business practices, significant dedication of management time, diversion of significant operational resources, or otherwise harm our business. in any of these cases, our financial results, results of operations, cash flows or the trading prices for our securities could be negatively impacted.
for example, the u.s.-based financial accounting standards board ("fasb") is currently working together with the international accounting standards board ("iasb") on several projects to further align accounting principles and facilitate more comparable financial reporting between companies who are required to follow u.s. generally accepted accounting principles ("gaap") under sec regulations and those who are required to follow international financial reporting standards ("ifrs") outside of the u.s. these efforts by the fasb and iasb may result in different accounting principles under gaap
that may result in materially different financial results for us in areas including, but not limited to principles for recognizing revenue and lease accounting.
furthermore, in may 2014, the fasb issued asu no. 2014-09, revenue from contracts with customers, which supersedes nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under u.s. gaap.  this standard establishes a principle for recognizing revenue upon the transfer of promised goods or services to customers, in an amount that reflects the expected consideration received in exchange for those goods or services.  the standard also provides guidance on the recognition of costs related to obtaining and fulfilling customer contracts.  in august 2015, the fasb subsequently issued asu 2015-14, which deferred the effectiveness of asu 2014-09, so that it will now be effective for annual reporting periods beginning after december 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period.  the revised effective date for the company under the new standard will be the beginning of fiscal 2019. we are assessing the impact on our consolidated financial statements, defining our operational requirements, and implementing changes to our policies, procedures and systems. this new standard is both technical and complex, and we expect to incur significant ongoing costs to implement and maintain compliance with this new standard. in addition, there may be greater uncertainty with respect to projecting revenue results from future operations as we work through the new revenue recognition standard.
it is not clear whether we have the proper systems and controls in place to accommodate such changes and the impact that any such changes may have on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. adoption of asu no. 2014-09 along with any other changes in accounting principles or interpretations could have a significant effect on our reported financial results and could affect the reporting of transactions completed before the announcement of a change.  any difficulties in the implementation of new or changed accounting standards including asu no. 2014-09 could cause us to fail to meet our financial reporting obligations. if our estimates relating to our critical accounting policies are based on assumptions or judgments that change or prove to be incorrect, our operating results could fall below expectations of securities analysts and investors, resulting in a decline in our stock price. in addition, as we evolve and change our business and sales models, we are currently unable to determine how these potential changes may impact our new models, particularly in the area of revenue recognition.
we are investing in resources to update and improve our information technology systems. should our investments not succeed, or if delays or other issues with new or existing internal technology systems disrupt our operations, our business model transition could be compromised and our business could be harmed.
we rely on our network and data center infrastructure, technology systems and our websites for our development, marketing, operational, support, sales, accounting and financial reporting activities. we continually invest resources to update and improve these systems and environments in order to meet the growing and evolving requirements of our business and customers. in particular, our transition to cloud-based products and a subscription only business model requires considerable investment in the development of technologies, and back office systems for technical, financial, compliance and sales resources to enable a scalable organization.
such improvements are often complex, costly and time consuming. in addition, such improvements can be challenging to integrate with our existing technology systems, or uncover problems with our existing technology systems. unsuccessful implementation of hardware or software updates and improvements could result in disruption in our business operations, loss of revenue, errors in our accounting and financial reporting or damage to our reputation and could compromise our business model transition.
we make assumptions, judgments and estimates for a number of items, including the fair value of financial instruments, goodwill, long-lived assets and other intangible assets, the realizability of deferred tax assets and the fair value of stock awards. we also make assumptions, judgments and estimates in determining the accruals for employee related liabilities including commissions, bonuses, and sabbaticals; and in determining the accruals for uncertain tax positions, partner incentive programs, product returns reserves, allowances for doubtful accounts, asset retirement obligations and legal contingencies. these assumptions, judgments and estimates are drawn from historical experience and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances as of the date of the consolidated financial statements. actual results could differ materially from our estimates, and such differences could significantly impact our financial results.
we are a u.s.-based multinational company subject to tax in multiple u.s. and foreign tax jurisdictions. our effective tax rate is primarily based on our expected geographic mix of earnings, statutory rates, intercompany arrangements, including the manner in which we develop, value and license our intellectual property, and enacted tax rules. significant judgment is required in determining our effective tax rate and in evaluating our tax positions on a worldwide basis. while we believe our tax positions, including intercompany transfer pricing policies, are consistent with the tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we conduct our business, it is possible that these positions may be overturned by jurisdictional tax authorities and may have a significant impact on our effective tax rate.
tax laws are dynamic and subject to change as new laws are passed and new interpretations of the law are issued or applied. increasingly, governmental tax authorities are scrutinizing corporate tax strategies. many countries in the european union, as well as a number of other countries and organizations such as the organization for economic cooperation and development, are actively considering changes to existing tax laws that, if enacted, could increase our tax obligations in many countries where we do business. if u.s. or other foreign tax authorities change applicable tax laws or successfully challenge the manner in which our profits are currently recognized, our overall taxes could increase, and our business, financial condition or results of operations may be adversely impacted.
we rely on certain software that we license from third parties, including software that is integrated with internally developed software and used in our products to perform key functions. these third-party software licenses may not continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms, and the software may not be appropriately supported, maintained or enhanced by the licensors. the loss of licenses to, or inability to support, maintain and enhance any such software could result in increased costs, or in delays or reductions in product shipments until equivalent software can be developed, identified, licensed and integrated, which would likely harm our business.
disruptions with licensing relationships and third party developers could adversely impact our business.
our business strategy has historically depended in part on our relationships with third-party developers who provide products that expand the functionality of our design software. some developers may elect to support other products or may experience disruption in product development and delivery cycles or financial pressure during periods of economic downturn. in particular markets, such disruptions have in the past, and would likely in the future, negatively impact these third-party developers and end users, which could harm our business.
additionally, technology created by outsourced product development, whether outsourced to third parties or developed externally and transferred to us through business or technology acquisitions, has certain additional risks such as effective integration into existing products, adequate transfer of technology know-how and ownership and protection of transferred intellectual property.
as a result of our strategy of partnering with other companies for product development, our product delivery schedules could be adversely affected if we experience difficulties with our product development partners.
we partner with certain independent firms and contractors to perform some of our product development activities. we believe our partnering strategy allows us to, among other things, achieve efficiencies in developing new products and maintaining and enhancing existing product offerings. our partnering strategy creates a dependency on such independent developers. independent developers, including those who currently develop products for us in the u.s. and throughout the world, may not be able or willing to provide development support to us in the future. in addition, use of development resources through consulting relationships, particularly in non-u.s. jurisdictions with developing legal systems, may be adversely impacted by, and expose us to risks relating to, evolving employment, export and intellectual property laws. these risks could, among other things, expose our intellectual property to misappropriation and result in disruptions to product delivery schedules.
our business is highly automated and relies extensively on the availability of our network and data center infrastructure, our internal technology systems and our websites. we also rely on hosted computer services from third parties for services that we provide to our customers and computer operations for our internal use. the failure of our systems or hosted computer services due to a catastrophic event, such as an earthquake, fire, flood, tsunami, weather event, telecommunications failure, power failure, cyber attack, terrorism, or war, could adversely impact our business, financial results and financial condition. we have developed disaster recovery plans and maintain backup systems in order to reduce the potential impact of a catastrophic event, however there can be no assurance that these plans and systems would enable us to return to normal business operations. in addition, any such event could negatively impact a country or region in which we sell our products. this could in turn decrease that country's or region's demand for our products, thereby negatively impacting our financial results.
if we were required to record an impairment charge related to the value of our long-lived assets, or an additional valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets, our results of operations would be adversely affected.
our long-lived assets are tested for impairment if indicators of impairment exist. if impairment testing shows that the carrying value of our long-lived assets exceeds their estimated fair values, we would be required to record a non-cash impairment charge, which would decrease the carrying value of our long-lived assets, as the case may be, and our results of operations would be adversely affected. our deferred tax assets include net operating loss, amortizable tax assets and tax credit carryforwards that can be used to offset taxable income and reduce income taxes payable in future periods. each quarter, we assess the need for a valuation allowance, considering both positive and negative evidence to determine whether all or a portion of the deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realized. in fiscal 2016 we determined that it was more likely than not that the company would not realize our u.s. deferred tax assets and established a valuation allowance against our u.s. deferred tax assets. we continued to have a full valuation allowance against our u.s. deferred tax assets in 2017 and increased the amount of the valuation allowance to include deferred tax assets generated in 2017, including deferred tax assets that were established as a result of the adoption of asu 2016-9 in the second quarter of fiscal 2017. changes in the amount of the valuation allowance could result in a material noncash expense or benefit in the period in which the valuation allowance is adjusted and our results of operations could be materially affected. we will continue to perform these tests and any future adjustments may have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
we issued $1.5 billion aggregate principal amount of unsecured notes in debt offerings and have an existing $400.0 million revolving credit facility, and expect to incur other debt in the future, which may adversely affect our financial condition and future financial results.
in june 2015, we issued 3.125% notes due june 15, 2020 in an aggregate principal amount of $450.0 million and 4.375% notes due june 15, 2025 in an aggregate principal amount of $300.0 million. in december 2012, we issued 1.95% notes due december 15, 2017 in an aggregate principal amount of $400.0 million and 3.6% notes due december 15, 2022 in an aggregate principal amount of $350.0 million. as the debt matures, we will have to expend significant resources to either repay or refinance these notes. if we decide to refinance the notes, we may be required to do so on different or less favorable terms or we may be unable to refinance the notes at all, both of which may adversely affect our financial condition.
we also have a $400.0 million revolving credit facility. as of january 31, 2017, we had no outstanding borrowings on the line of credit. although we have no current plans to borrow under this credit facility, we may use the proceeds of any future borrowing for general corporate purposes, or for future acquisitions or expansion of our business. our existing and future levels of indebtedness may adversely affect our financial condition and future financial results by, among other things:
•   increasing our vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic, industry and competitive conditions;
•   requiring the dedication of a greater than expected portion of our expected cash from operations to service our indebtedness, thereby reducing the amount of expected cash flow available for other purposes, including capital expenditures and acquisitions; and
•   limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and our industry.
this credit agreement contains customary covenants that could restrict the imposition of liens on autodesk's assets, and restrict the company's ability to incur additional indebtedness or make dispositions of assets if autodesk fails to maintain the financial covenants. the financial covenants consist of a leverage ratio, and an interest coverage ratio. we are required to comply with the covenants set forth in our unsecured notes and revolving credit facility. our ability to comply with these
covenants may be affected by events beyond our control. if we breach any of the covenants and do not obtain a waiver from the note holders or lenders, then, subject to applicable cure periods, any outstanding indebtedness may be declared immediately due and payable. as a result of the business model transition, the leverage ratio requirement of the credit agreement was waived during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017. autodesk is discussing amendments to the financial covenants in the credit agreement with the lenders and expects to conclude this process during the first quarter of fiscal 2018. if we are unable to obtain an agreement on modified covenants that the company can meet during our business model transition, we may cancel this credit agreement, which would decrease our liquidity by $400 million. in addition, changes by any rating agency to our credit rating may negatively impact the value and liquidity of our securities. under certain circumstances, if our credit ratings are downgraded or other negative action is taken, the interest rate payable by us under our revolving credit facility could increase. downgrades in our credit ratings could also restrict our ability to obtain additional financing in the future and could affect the terms of any such financing.
item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the discussion in our md&a and elsewhere in this form 10-k contains trend analyses and other forward-looking statements within the meaning of section 27a of the securities act of 1933 and section 21e of the securities exchange act of 1934. forward-looking statements are any statements that look to future events and consist of, among other things, our business strategies, future financial results (including by product type and geography) and subscriptions, the effectiveness of our efforts to successfully manage transitions to new business models and markets, our expectations regarding the continued transition of our business model, our ability to increase our subscription base, expected market trends, including the growth of cloud and mobile computing, the effect of unemployment, the availability of credit, our expectations for our restructuring, the effects of mixed global economic conditions, the effects of revenue recognition, expected trends in certain financial metrics, including expenses, the impact of acquisitions and investment activities, expectations regarding our cash needs, the effects of fluctuations in exchange rates and our hedging activities on our financial results, our ability to successfully expand adoption of our products, our ability to gain market acceptance of new businesses and sales initiatives, and the impact of economic volatility and geopolitical activities in certain countries, particularly emerging economy countries, the timing and amount of purchases under our newly announced stock buy-back plan, and the effects of potential non-cash charges on our financial results and the resulting effect on our financial results. in addition, forward-looking statements also consist of statements involving expectations regarding product capability and acceptance, remediation to our controls environment, statements regarding our liquidity and short-term and long-term cash requirements, as well as statements involving trend analyses and statements including such words as "may," "believe," "could," "anticipate," "would," "might," "plan," "expect," and similar expressions or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology. these forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this annual report on form 10-k and are subject to business and economic risks. as such, our actual results could differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements as a result of a number of factors, including those set forth above in item 1a, "risk factors," and in our other reports filed with the u.s. securities and exchange commission. we assume no obligation to update the forward-looking statements to reflect events that occur or circumstances that exist after the date on which they were made, except as required by law.
strategy autodesk makes software for people who make things. if you've ever driven a high-performance car, admired a towering skyscraper, used a smartphone, or watched a great film, chances are you've experienced what millions of autodesk customers are doing with our software. autodesk gives you the power to make anything.
autodesk was founded during the platform transition from mainframe computers and engineering workstations to personal computers. we developed and sustained a compelling value proposition based upon desktop software for the personal computer. just as the transition from mainframes to personal computers transformed the industry over 30 years ago, we believe our industry is undergoing a similar transition from the personal computer to cloud, mobile, and social computing. to address this transition we have accelerated our move to the cloud and mobile devices and are offering more flexible licensing. our product subscriptions presently represent a hybrid of desktop software and cloud-based functionality, which provides a device-independent, collaborative design workflow for designers and their stakeholders. our cloud service offerings, for example, bim 360, shotgun, fusion 360, and autocad 360 pro, provide tools, including mobile and social capabilities, to help streamline design, collaboration, and data management processes. we believe that customer adoption of these new offerings will continue to grow as customers across a range of industries begin to take advantage of the scalable computing power and flexibility provided through these new services.
our strategy is to lead the industries we serve to cloud-based technologies and business models. this entails both a technological shift and a business model shift. as part of the transition, we discontinued selling new perpetual licenses of most individual software products effective february 1, 2016, and discontinued selling new perpetual licenses of suites while introducing industry collections effective august 1, 2016. industry collections allow access to a broad set of products and services that exceeds those previously available in suites - simplifying the customer ability to get access to a complete set of tools for their industry. we now offer subscriptions for individual products and industry collections, cloud service offerings, and flexible enterprise business agreements ("new model subscription offerings"). these offerings are designed to give our customers more flexibility with how they use our products and service offerings and to attract a broader range of customers, such as project-based users and small businesses.
with the discontinuation of the sale of most perpetual licenses, we have accelerated our transition away from selling a mix of perpetual licenses and term-based product subscriptions toward a single subscription model. as a result of this shift and various other factors described in note 13, "segments" in the notes to our consolidated financial statements, we have
reassessed the way we allocate resources and evaluate financial performance and now operate as a single operating segment. during the transition, revenue, margins, eps, deferred revenue and cash flow from operations have been and will be impacted as more revenue is recognized ratably rather than upfront and as new product subscription offerings generally have a lower initial purchase price.
as we progress through the business model transition, reported revenue is less relevant to measure the success of the business as perpetual license sales have been discontinued in favor of subscription offerings, which have considerably lower upfront prices. annualized recurring revenue ("arr") and growth of subscriptions better reflect business momentum and provide additional transparency into the transition. to further analyze progress, we disaggregate our growth in these metrics between the original maintenance model ("maintenance") and the new model subscription offerings. maintenance subscriptions peaked in the fourth quarter of our fiscal 2016, and we expect them to decline slowly over time.
we anticipate that our channel mix will continue to change, particularly as we scale our digitally transacted online autodesk branded store business and our largest accounts shift towards direct-only business models. importantly, we expect our indirect channel will continue to transact and support the majority of our revenue as we move beyond the business model transition. we employ a variety of incentive programs and promotions to align our direct and indirect channels with our business strategies. in addition, we have a worldwide user group organization and we have created online user communities dedicated to the exchange of information related to the use of our products.
one of our key strategies is to maintain an open-architecture design of our software products to facilitate third-party development of complementary products and industry-specific software solutions. this approach enables customers and third parties to customize solutions for a wide variety of highly specific uses. we offer several programs that provide strategic investment funding, technological platforms, user communities, technical support, forums, and events to developers who develop add-on applications for our products. for example, we have established the autodesk spark program to support ideas that push the boundaries of 3d printing and nurture the companies that will advance innovations within 3d printing hardware and software. we have also created the autodesk forge program to support innovators that build solutions to facilitate the development of a single connected ecosystem for the future of how things are designed, made, and used.
in addition to the competitive advantages afforded by our technology, our large global network of distributors, resellers, third-party developers, customers, educational institutions, educators, and students is a key competitive advantage. this network of partners and relationships provides us with a broad and deep reach into volume markets around the world. our distributor and reseller network is extensive and provides our customers with the resources to purchase, deploy, learn, and support our products quickly and easily. we have a significant number of registered third-party developers who create products that work well with our products and extend them for a variety of specialized applications.
autodesk is committed to helping fuel a lifelong passion for design in students of all ages. we offer free educational subscriptions of autodesk software worldwide to students, educators, and educational institutions. through autodesk design academy, we provide secondary and postsecondary school markets hundreds of standards-aligned class projects to support design-based disciplines in science, technology, engineering, digital arts, and math (steam) while using autodesk's professional-grade 3d design, engineering and entertainment software used in industry. we also have made autodesk design academy curricula available on itunes u. our intention is to make autodesk software ubiquitous and the design software of choice for those poised to become the next generation of professional users.
our strategy includes improving our product functionality and expanding our product offerings through internal development as well as through the acquisition of products, technology, and businesses. acquisitions often increase the speed at which we can deliver product functionality to our customers; however, they entail cost and integration challenges and may, in certain instances, negatively impact our operating margins. we continually review these trade-offs in making decisions regarding acquisitions. we currently anticipate that we will continue to acquire products, technology, and businesses as compelling opportunities become available.
our strategy depends upon a number of assumptions to successfully make the transition toward new cloud and mobile platforms, including: the related technology and business model shifts; making our technology available to mainstream markets; leveraging our large global network of distributors, resellers, third-party developers, customers, educational institutions, and students; improving the performance and functionality of our products; and adequately protecting our intellectual property. if the outcome of any of these assumptions differs from our expectations, we may not be able to implement our strategy, which could potentially adversely affect our business. for further discussion regarding these and related risks, see part i, item 1a, "risk factors."
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles. in preparing our consolidated financial statements, we make assumptions, judgments, and estimates that can have a significant impact on amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements. we base our assumptions, judgments, and estimates on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. we regularly reevaluate our assumptions, judgments, and estimates. our significant accounting policies are described in note 1, "business and summary of significant accounting policies," in the notes to consolidated financial statements. we believe that of all our significant accounting policies, the following policies involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity. accordingly, these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our financial condition and results of operations.
revenue recognition.    we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, the price is fixed or determinable, and collection is probable. however, determining whether and when some of these criteria have been satisfied often involves assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on the timing and amount of revenue we report.
for multiple element arrangements containing only software and software-related elements, we allocate the sales price among each of the deliverables using the residual method, under which revenue is allocated to undelivered elements based on our vendor-specific objective evidence ("vsoe") of fair value. vsoe is the price charged when an element is sold separately or a price set by management with the relevant authority. if we do not have vsoe of an undelivered software license, we defer revenue recognition on the entire sales arrangement until all elements for which we do not have vsoe are delivered. if we do not have vsoe for undelivered product subscriptions, maintenance or services, the revenue for the arrangement is recognized over the longest contractual service period in the arrangement. we are required to exercise judgment in determining whether vsoe exists for each undelivered element based on whether our pricing for these elements is sufficiently consistent.
for multiple elements arrangements involving non-software elements, including cloud subscription services, our revenue recognition policy is based upon the accounting guidance contained in accounting standards codification ("asc") 605, revenue recognition. for these arrangements, we first allocate the total arrangement consideration based on the relative selling prices of the software group of elements as a whole and to the non-software elements. we then further allocate consideration within the software group to the respective elements within that group using the residual method as described above. we exercise judgment and use estimates in connection with the determination of the amount of revenue to be recognized in each accounting period.
we allocate the total arrangement consideration among the various elements based on a selling price hierarchy. the selling price for a deliverable is based on its vsoe if available, third-party evidence ("tpe") if vsoe is not available, or the best estimated selling price ("besp") if neither vsoe nor tpe is available. besp represents the price at which autodesk would transact for the deliverable if it were sold regularly on a standalone basis. to establish besp for those elements for which neither vsoe nor tpe are available, we perform a quantitative analysis of pricing data points for historical standalone transactions involving such elements for a twelve-month period. as part of this analysis, we monitor and evaluate the besp against actual pricing to ensure that it continues to represent a reasonable estimate of the standalone selling price, considering several other external and internal factors including, but not limited to, pricing and discounting practices, contractually stated prices, the geographies in which we offer our products and services, and the type of customer (i.e. distributor, value-added reseller, and direct end user, among others). we analyze besp at least annually or on a more frequent basis if a significant change in our business necessitates a more timely analysis or if we experience significant variances in our selling prices.
in situations when we have multiple contracts with a single counterparty, we use the guidance in asc 985-605 to evaluate both the form and the substance of the arrangements to determine if they should be combined and accounted for as one arrangement or as separate arrangements.
our assessment of the likelihood of collection is also a critical factor in determining the timing of revenue recognition. if we do not believe that collection is probable, the revenue will be deferred until payment is received.
our indirect channel model includes both a two-tiered distribution structure, where distributors sell to resellers, and a one-tiered structure where autodesk sells directly to resellers. our subscription revenue from distributors and resellers generally commences recognition at the time access is provided to their customers, provided all other criteria for revenue recognition are met. this policy is predicated on our ability to estimate sales returns, among other criteria. we are also required to evaluate whether our distributors and resellers have the ability to honor their commitment to make fixed or determinable payments, regardless of whether they collect payment from their customers. if we were to change any of these assumptions or judgments, it could cause a material increase or decrease in the amount of revenue that we report in a particular period.
as part of the indirect channel model, we have a partner incentive program that uses quarterly attainment of monetary rewards to motivate distributors and resellers to achieve mutually agreed upon business goals in a specified time period. a portion of these incentives reduce license and other revenue in the current period. the remainder, which relates to incentives on our subscription program, is recorded as a reduction to deferred revenue in the period the subscription transaction is billed and subsequently recognized as a reduction to subscription revenue over the contract period. these incentive balances do not require significant assumptions or judgments. depending on how the payments are made, the reserves associated with the partner incentive program are treated on the balance sheet as either contra account receivable or accounts payable.
marketable securities and privately held company investments. as described in note 2, "financial instruments," in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, our investments in marketable securities are measured at the end of each reporting period and reported at fair value. fair value is defined as the price that would be received from the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. in determining the fair value of our investments we are sometimes required to use various alternative valuation techniques. inputs to valuation techniques are either observable or unobservable. observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect our market assumptions. these two types of inputs have created the following fair value hierarchy:
this hierarchy requires us to minimize the use of unobservable inputs and to use observable market data, if available, when determining fair value. this is generally true for our cash and cash equivalents and the majority of our marketable securities, which we consider to be level 1 assets and level 2 assets. however, determining the fair value of marketable securities or convertible note investments in privately held companies when observable inputs are not available (level 3) requires significant judgment. for example, we use probability weighted discounted cash flow models, in which some of the inputs are unobservable in the market, to estimate the fair value of our convertible debt securities. these assumptions are inherently subjective and involve significant management judgment. whenever possible, we use observable market data and rely on unobservable inputs only when observable market data is not available, when determining fair value.
all of autodesk's marketable securities and privately held company investments are subject to a periodic impairment review. we recognize an impairment charge when a decline in the fair value of its investments below the cost basis is judged to be other-than-temporary. autodesk considers various factors in determining whether to recognize an impairment charge, including the length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than autodesk's cost basis, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the investee, and autodesk's intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in the market value.
business combinations.     we allocate the fair value of the consideration transferred to the assets and liabilities acquired, as well as to in-process research and development based on their estimated fair values at the acquisition date. any residual purchase price is recorded as goodwill. the purchase price allocation requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially at the acquisition date with respect to intangible assets and deferred revenue obligations.
although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made are reasonable, they are based in part on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain. examples of critical estimates used in valuing certain of the intangible assets we have acquired or may acquire in the future include but are not limited to:
these estimates are inherently uncertain and unpredictable, and if different estimates were used the purchase price for the acquisition could be allocated to the acquired assets and liabilities differently from the allocation that we have made. in addition, unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such estimates, and if such events occur we may be required to record a charge against the value ascribed to an acquired asset or an increase in the amounts recorded for assumed liabilities.
realizability of long-lived assets.     we assess the realizability of our long-lived assets and related intangible assets, other than goodwill, annually during the fourth fiscal quarter, or sooner should events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying values of such assets may not be recoverable. we consider the following factors important in determining when to perform an impairment review: significant under-performance of a business or product line relative to budget; shifts in business strategies which affect the continued uses of the assets; significant negative industry or economic trends; and the results of past impairment reviews. when such events or changes in circumstances occur, we assess recoverability of these assets.
we assess recoverability of these assets by comparing the carrying amounts to the future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate. if impairment indicators were present based on our undiscounted cash flow models, which include assumptions regarding projected cash flows, we would perform a discounted cash flow analysis to assess impairments on long-lived assets. variances in these assumptions could have a significant impact on our conclusion as to whether an asset is impaired or the amount of any impairment charge. impairment charges, if any, result in situations where any fair values of these assets are less than their carrying values.
in addition to our recoverability assessments, we routinely review the remaining estimated useful lives of our long-lived assets. any reduction in the useful life assumption will result in increased depreciation and amortization expense in the quarter when such determinations are made, as well as in subsequent quarters.
we will continue to evaluate the values of our long-lived assets in accordance with applicable accounting rules. as changes in business conditions and our assumptions occur, we may be required to record impairment charges.
income taxes.     we account for income taxes under the asset and liability approach. under this method, deferred tax assets, including those related to tax loss carryforwards and credits, and deferred tax liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. we recognize the tax benefit for an uncertain tax position when it meets a more likely than not threshold. we recognize potential accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense.
a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when management cannot conclude that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax asset will be recovered. the valuation allowance is determined by assessing both positive and negative evidence to determine whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets are recoverable; such assessment is required on a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction basis. significant judgment is required in determining whether the valuation allowance should be recorded against deferred tax assets. in assessing the need for valuation allowance, we consider all available evidence including past operating results and estimates of future taxable income. beginning in the second quarter of fiscal 2016, we considered cumulative losses in the u.s. arising from the company's business model transition as a significant source of negative evidence. considering this negative evidence and the absence of sufficient positive objective evidence that we would generate sufficient taxable income in the u.s. to realize the deferred tax assets, we determined that it was more likely than not
as we continually strive to optimize our overall business model, tax planning strategies may become feasible and prudent whereby management may determine that it is more likely than not that the federal and state deferred tax assets will be realized; therefore, we will continue to evaluate the evidence around our ability to utilize our net deferred tax assets each quarter, both in the us and in foreign jurisdictions, based on all available evidence, both positive and negative.
stock-based compensation. we measure stock-based compensation cost at the grant date fair value of the award, and recognize expense ratably over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period. we estimate the fair value of certain stock-based payment awards (including grants of employee stock purchases related to the employee stock purchase plan) using either the black-scholes-merton option-pricing model or a binomial-lattice model (e.g., monte carlo simulation model). to determine the grant-date fair value of our stock-based payment awards, we use a black-scholes model or the quoted stock price on the date of grant, unless the awards are subject to market conditions, in which case we use the monte carlo simulation model. the monte carlo simulation model utilizes multiple input variables to estimate the probability that market conditions will be achieved. these variables include our expected stock price volatility over the expected term of the award, actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors, the risk-free interest rate for the expected term of the award, and expected dividends. the variables used in these models are reviewed on a quarterly basis and adjusted, as needed. share-based compensation cost for restricted stock is measured on the closing fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant. the value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense in our consolidated statements of operations.
legal contingencies. as described in part i, item 3, "legal proceedings" and part ii, item 8, note 8, "commitments and contingencies," in the notes to consolidated financial statements, we are periodically involved in various legal claims and proceedings. we routinely review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financial exposure. if the potential loss from any matter is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated, we record a liability for the estimated loss. because of inherent uncertainties related to these legal matters, we base our loss accruals on the best information available at the time. as additional information becomes available, we reassess our potential liability and may revise our estimates. such revisions could have a material impact on future quarterly or annual results of operations.
restructuring charges and other facility exit costs, net and accruals. in february 2016, the board of directors approved a world-wide restructuring plan ("fiscal 2017 plan") in order to re-balance staffing levels and reduce operating expenses to better align them with the evolving needs of the company's business. the company's restructuring plans include one-time termination benefits as well as certain contractual termination benefits. we record costs associated with exit activities related to restructuring plans in accordance with the asc topic 420, exit or disposal obligations. liabilities for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity are recognized in the period in which the liability is incurred. the timing of associated cash payments is dependent upon the type of exit cost and may extend over a 12-month period. we record restructuring charge liabilities in "other accrued liabilities," or "other liabilities" in the consolidated balance sheet.
restructuring charges include employee termination costs, facility closure and relocation costs, and contract termination costs. one-time termination benefits are recognized as a liability at estimated fair value when the approved plan of termination has been communicated to employees, unless employees must provide future service, in which case the benefits are recognized ratably over the future service period. ongoing termination benefits arrangements are recognized as a liability at estimated fair value when the amount of such benefits becomes estimable and payment is probable. for the facility facility-related restructuring charges, we recognize upon exiting all or a portion of a leased facility and meeting cease-use and other requirements. the amount of restructuring charges is based on the fair value of the lease obligation for the abandoned space, which includes a sublease assumption that could be reasonably obtained.
restructuring charges require significant estimates and assumptions, including sub-lease income and expenses for severance and other employee separation costs. our estimates involve a number of risks and uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control, including future real estate market conditions and our ability to successfully enter into subleases or termination agreements with terms as favorable as those assumed when arriving at our estimates. we monitor these estimates and assumptions on at least a quarterly basis for changes in circumstances and any corresponding adjustments to the accrual are recorded in our statement of operations in the period when such changes are known.
see part ii, item 8, note 1, "business and summary of significant accounting policies," in the notes to consolidated financial statements for a full description of recent accounting pronouncements, including the expected dates of adoption and estimated effects on results of operations and financial condition.
gross profit                               1,689.1                             83   %                (444.3            )                    (21       )%                         2,133.4                             85   %
we are undergoing a business model transition in which we have discontinued selling new perpetual licenses for most of our products in favor of new model subscriptions. during the transition, revenue, margins, eps, deferred revenue and cash flow from operations have been and will be impacted as more revenue is recognized ratably rather than upfront and as new product subscription offerings generally have a lower initial purchase price.
revenue analysis during fiscal 2017, net revenue decreased 19%, as compared to the prior fiscal year, primarily due to a 40% decrease in license and other revenue resulting from the discontinuation of the sale of most individual perpetual products as of february 1, 2016, and of new perpetual licenses of suites effective august 1, 2016. the decrease in license and other revenue was partially offset by a 1% increase in subscription revenue, driven by a 39% increase in revenue from our new model subscription offerings, largely offset by a 3% decrease in maintenance revenue.
we rely significantly upon major distributors and resellers in both the u.s. and international regions, including tech data corporation and its global affiliates (collectively, "tech data"). tech data accounted for 30%, 25%, and 25% of our consolidated net revenue during fiscal 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. our customers through tech data are the resellers and end users who purchase our software licenses and services. should any of the agreements between tech data and us be terminated for any reason, we believe the resellers and end users who currently purchase our products through tech data would be able to continue to do so under substantially the same terms from one of our many other distributors without substantial disruption to our revenue. consequently, we believe our business is not substantially dependent on tech data.
operating margin analysis income from operations decreased in fiscal 2017 due to a $473.1 million decrease in revenue (as discussed above) and a $56.6 million increase in our operating expenses as compared to fiscal 2016. our operating margin decreased to (25)% for fiscal 2017 from 0% for fiscal 2016. the increase in operating expenses between fiscal 2017 and 2016 was driven by restructuring charges and other facility exit costs.
further discussion regarding the cost of revenue and operating expense activities are discussed below under the heading "results of operations."
business model transition metrics in order to help better understand our financial performance during and after the transition, we have introduced several new metrics including recurring revenue, total subscriptions, arr, and annualized revenue per subscription ("arps"). arr,
arps, and recurring revenue are performance metrics and should be viewed independently of revenue and deferred revenue as arr and arps are not intended to be combined with those items. please refer to the "glossary of terms" for further discussion regarding the new metric terminology.
recurring revenue represents the revenue for the period from our maintenance plans and revenue from our new model subscription offerings, including portions of revenue allocated to license and other revenue for those offerings. it excludes subscription revenue related to education offerings, consumer product offerings, select creative finishing product offerings, autodesk buzzsaw, autodesk constructware, and third party products. recurring revenue acquired with the acquisition of a business is reported when total subscriptions are captured in our systems and may cause variability in the comparison of this calculation.
(1)   includes the portion of revenue for new model subscription offerings allocated to license &amp; other revenue within our condensed consolidated statements of operations.
year-over-year maintenance subscriptions decreased 6% as of january 31, 2017 as compared to the prior fiscal year, primarily as a result of the discontinuation of new perpetual license sales for most individual products at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 and the end of perpetual suites at the end of second quarter of fiscal 2017, partially offset by the addition of approximately 14,000 maintenance subscriptions associated with an acquisition in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. year-over-year new model subscriptions increased 155% as of january 31, 2017 as compared to the prior fiscal year, primarily driven by growth in all new model subscription types, led by product subscription. new model subscriptions also benefited from a promotion aimed at converting legacy non-subscribers, which captured approximately 75,000 additional product subscriptions.
our arps is also declining because of various factors including mix, foreign currency, and the contra-revenue impact of mdf discussed above. going forward the arps calculation will continue to be extremely sensitive to short-term shifts in term-length, geography mix and promotions. we expect to see arps fluctuate up or down on a quarterly basis and we do not expect it will increase evenly throughout the year. as we complete our business model transition, we expect all of these impacts to start to stabilize.
foreign currency analysis we generate a significant amount of our revenue in the u.s., germany, japan, the united kingdom and canada. total net revenue for fiscal 2017 decreased 19% on an as reported basis compared to the prior fiscal year, and was negatively impacted by foreign exchange rate changes during fiscal 2017. had applicable exchange rates from fiscal 2016 been in effect during fiscal 2017 and had we excluded foreign exchange hedge gains and losses from both fiscal 2016 and 2017, net revenue would have decreased 16% on a constant currency basis compared to the prior fiscal year.
changes in the value of the u.s. dollar may have a significant effect on net revenue, total spend, and income from operations in future periods. we use foreign currency contracts to reduce the exchange rate effect on a portion of the net revenue and spend of certain anticipated transactions but do not attempt to completely mitigate the impact of fluctuations of such foreign currency against the u.s. dollar.
balance sheet and cash flow items at january 31, 2017, we had $2.2 billion in cash and marketable securities. we completed fiscal 2017 with higher deferred revenue and lower accounts receivable balances as compared to the prior fiscal year. our deferred revenue balance at january 31, 2017 was $1.8 billion, which will be recognized as revenue ratably over the life of the contracts. the term of our subscription contracts is typically between one and three years. our cash flow from operations decreased 59% to $169.7 million as of january 31, 2017 from $414.0 million at january 31, 2016. we repurchased 9.7 million shares of our common stock for $631.6 million during fiscal 2017. comparatively, we repurchased 8.5 million shares of our common stock for $458.0 million during fiscal 2016. further discussion regarding the balance sheet and cash flow activities are discussed below under the heading "liquidity and capital resources."
current period adjustments subsequent to furnishing preliminary financial statements on form 8-k on march 2, 2017 for fiscal year 2017, we identified certain adjustments resulting in changes to the condensed consolidated statements of operations, condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income, condensed consolidated balance sheet, condensed consolidated statements of cash flows, and consolidated statements of stockholder's equity as reflected in this annual report on form 10-k that adjusted the income statement and balance sheet line items as follows:

(1)   prior periods have been adjusted to conform with current period's presentation.
fiscal 2017 net revenue compared to fiscal 2016 net revenue subscription revenue our subscription revenue consists of three components: (1) maintenance plan revenue from our perpetual software products; (2) maintenance revenue from our term-based product subscriptions and flexible enterprise business agreements; and (3) revenue from our cloud service offerings. our maintenance plan provides our customers with a cost effective and predictable budgetary option to obtain the productivity benefits of our new releases and enhancements when and if released during the term of their contracts. under our maintenance plan, customers are eligible to receive unspecified upgrades when and if available, and online support. we recognize maintenance plan revenue over the term of the agreements, generally between one and three years. with the discontinuation of our perpetual license sales, we no longer offer new maintenance subscriptions and expect our maintenance subscription revenue to decline over time. our flexible enterprise business agreements are designed to give our customers increased flexibility with how they use our products and service offerings and to attract a broader range of customers such as project-based users and small businesses. we recognize maintenance revenue from these enterprise agreements ratably over their contract terms. revenue for our cloud service offerings is recognized ratably over the contract term commencing with the date our service is made available to customers and when all other revenue recognition criteria have been satisfied.
subscription revenue increased 1% during fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016 primarily due to a 39% increase in new model subscription revenue, partially offset by a 3% decrease in maintenance plan revenue. the 39% increase in new model subscription revenue was primarily attributable to a 186% increase in product subscription revenue and a 28% increase in revenue from flexible enterprise business agreements. the 3% decrease in maintenance plan revenue was attributable to the business model transition, as we expect maintenance plan revenue will slowly decline as perpetual license sales have ended, and customers adopt our new model subscription offerings.
license and other revenue decreased 40% during fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016. product license revenue, as a percentage of license and other revenue, was 82% and 88% for fiscal 2017 and 2016, respectively. the decrease in product license revenue was due to the business model transition, which led to a 63% decrease in revenue from perpetual licenses as we have discontinued selling perpetual seats of most of our product offerings. this decrease was partially offset by a 122% increase in license revenue from our new model subscription offerings.
there was no backlog at january 31, 2017 compared to $31.4 million at january 31, 2016. due to the business model transition, we do not expect material backlog in future periods.
net revenue by product family our product offerings are focused in four primary product families: aec, mfg, autocad and autocad lt ("acad"), and m&e. during the business model transition, revenue has been and will be negatively impacted as more revenue is recognized ratably rather than upfront and as new product offerings generally have a lower initial purchase price. as part of the transition, we discontinued selling new perpetual licenses of most individual software products effective february 1, 2016, and discontinued selling new perpetual licenses of suites effective august 1, 2016. these broad impacts are reflected in the drivers below.
net revenue for mfg product family decreased by 14% during fiscal 2017 as compared to the prior fiscal year, primarily due to a 14% decrease in individual product offerings and a 13% decrease in our mfg suites.
net revenue for acad product family decreased by 45% during fiscal 2017 as compared to the prior fiscal year. as part of the transition to term-based product subscriptions for our individual software products in february 2016, products like autocad and acad lt are negatively impacted when compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year as revenue is recognized ratably rather than upfront.
net revenue for m&e product family decreased by 13% during fiscal 2017 as compared to the prior fiscal year, primarily due to a 50% decrease in creative finishing, as we exited the creative finishing hardware business at the beginning of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016.
net revenue in the americas geography decreased by 10% on an as reported basis and on a constant currency basis during fiscal 2017, as compared to the prior fiscal year. net revenue in the americas attributable to the united states was approximately 85% and 83% for fiscal 2017 and 2016, respectively.
international net revenue represented 63% and 68% of our net revenue for fiscal 2017 and 2016, respectively. net revenue in the europe, middle east and africa ("emea") geography decreased by 14% on an as reported basis and 8% on a constant currency basis during fiscal 2017 as compared to the prior fiscal year. net revenue in the asia pacific ("apac") geography decreased 40% on an as reported basis and 39% on a constant currency basis, during fiscal 2017 as compared to the prior fiscal year, primarily as a result of the business model transition and continued weakness in japan.
we believe that international revenue will continue to comprise a majority of our net revenue. unfavorable economic conditions in the countries that contribute a significant portion of our net revenue, including in emerging economies such as brazil, russia, india, and china, may have an adverse effect on our business in those countries and our overall financial performance. changes in the value of the u.s. dollar relative to other currencies have significantly affected, and could continue to significantly affect, our financial results for a given period even though we hedge a portion of our current and projected revenue. weak global economic conditions that have been characterized by restructuring of sovereign debt, high unemployment, and volatility in the financial markets may impact our future financial results. additionally during the business model transition, revenue has been and will be negatively impacted as more revenue is recognized ratably rather than upfront and as new product offerings generally have a lower initial purchase price. this transition has a particular impact to emerging economies as sales of perpetual licenses have historically comprised a greater percentage of total emerging economy sales in comparison to mature markets.
fiscal 2016 net revenue compared to fiscal 2015 net revenue discussion has been update to provide comparability to the discussion between fiscal 2017 and 2016.
net revenue by geographic area net revenue in the americas geography increased by 8% as reported and 9% on a constant currency basis during fiscal 2016, as compared to the prior fiscal year. net revenue in the americas attributable to the united states was approximately 83% and 82% for fiscal 2016 and 2015, respectively.
net revenue by product family net revenue for the aec product family increased by 9% during fiscal 2016 as compared to the prior fiscal year primarily due to an 8% increase in revenue from our aec suites, which was primarily driven by autodesk building design suite and autodesk infrastructure design suite.
net revenue for m&e decreased by 4% during fiscal 2016 as compared to the prior fiscal year, primarily due to a 21% decrease in revenue from creative finishing, partially offset by a 1% increase in revenue from animation. the decline in creative finishing was marked by a decrease in revenue from creative finishing hardware products and by a general decrease in the m&e industry end-market demand. the slight increase in animation revenue was primarily due to a 168% increase in our shotgun product offering as a result of including a full year of shotgun operating results in fiscal 2016 as compared to six months during fiscal 2015, and a 7% increase in our maya flagship product offerings, partially offset by a 46% decrease in our middleware product offerings. m&e revenue is impacted by a general decrease in the m&e industry end-market demand, the planned inclusion of our m&e products in other autodesk industry suites, and the business model transition as customers are opting for desktop subscription and flexible enterprise offerings. at the beginning of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, we exited the creative finishing hardware business. this was an immaterial portion of our overall business and comes with substantially lower margins, so we expect that exiting this business will improve our margins within m&e over time.
cost of subscription revenue includes the labor costs of providing product support to our maintenance and new model subscription customers, including allocated it and facilities costs, shipping and handling costs, professional services fees related to operating our network and cloud infrastructure, depreciation expense and operating lease payments associated with computer equipment, data center costs, salaries, related expenses of network operations, amortization of developed technologies, and stock-based compensation expense.
cost of subscription revenue decreased 3% during fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016 primarily due to lower amortization expense of developed technologies as a result of fewer assets acquired, as well as a decrease in employee related costs from reduced headcount, and lower professional fees. cost of subscription revenue increased 17% during fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015 primarily due to an increase in cloud and hosting related costs in support of our business model transition, and an increase in employee related costs driven by increased employee headcount and product support costs.
cost of license and other revenue includes labor costs associated with product setup and fulfillment and costs of consulting and training services contracts and collaborative project management services contracts. cost of license and other revenue also includes stock-based compensation expense, direct material and overhead charges, amortization of developed technology, allocated it and facilities costs, professional services fees and royalties. direct material and overhead charges include the cost associated with electronic and physical fulfillment.
cost of license and other revenue decreased 11% during fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016, primarily due to lower professional fees and employee related costs as a result of reduced headcount. also contributing to lower costs is the elimination of our creative finishing hardware business, which we exited in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. cost of license and other revenue increased 3% during fiscal 2016, as compared to fiscal 2015, primarily due to an increase in hardware related costs from our consumer related products, an increase in allocated it costs, and employee related costs for product support and fulfillment driven by an increase in headcount, partially offset by a decrease in amortization of developed technology.
marketing and sales expenses include salaries, bonuses, benefits and stock-based compensation expense for our marketing and sales employees, the expense of travel, entertainment and training for such personnel, the costs of programs aimed at increasing revenue, such as advertising, trade shows and expositions, and various sales and promotional programs. marketing and sales expenses also include labor costs associated with sales and order management, sales and dealer commissions, payment processing fees, the cost of supplies and equipment, gains and losses on our operating expense cash flow hedges, and allocated it and facilities costs.
marketing and sales expenses increased 2% during fiscal 2016, as compared to fiscal 2015, primarily due to an increase in stock based compensation expense as a result of higher fair market value of awards granted, an increase in salaries predominantly driven by increased headcount, and an increase in it costs allocated to marketing and sales. partially offsetting the increase in expense was a decrease in sales commission expense.
research and development expenses, which are expensed as incurred, consist primarily of salaries, bonuses, benefits and stock-based compensation expense for research and development employees, and the expense of travel, entertainment and training for such personnel, professional services such as fees paid to software development firms and independent contractors, gains and losses on our operating expense cash flow hedges, and allocated it and facilities costs.
research and development expenses increased 9% during fiscal 2016, as compared to fiscal 2015, primarily due to an increase in employee-related costs from salaries and fringe benefits predominantly driven by increased headcount, an increase in it costs allocated to research and development, and an increase in stock based compensation expense due to higher fair market value of awards granted.
general and administrative expenses include salaries, bonuses, benefits and stock-based compensation expense for our finance, human resources and legal employees, as well as professional fees for legal and accounting services, certain foreign business taxes, gains and losses on our operating expense cash flow hedges, expense of travel, entertainment and training, it and facilities costs, and the cost of supplies and equipment.
amortization of purchased intangibles decreased 4% from fiscal 2016 to fiscal 2017, primarily as a result of the accumulated effects associated with amortization expense of intangible assets purchased over time, including lower amortization expense from intangible assets acquired during fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016. in fiscal 2017, we acquired $14.0 million in intangible assets as compared to $25.2 million acquired in fiscal 2016.
amortization of purchased intangibles decreased 17% from fiscal 2015 to fiscal 2016, primarily related to the accumulated effects associated with amortization expense of intangible assets purchased over time, including $25.2 million in assets purchased in fiscal 2016 as compared to $86.2 million purchased in fiscal 2015.

in february 2016, the board of directors approved a world-wide restructuring plan ("fiscal 2017 plan") in order to re-balance staffing levels and reduce operating expenses to better align them with the evolving needs of the company's business. under the fiscal 2017 plan, we recorded $70.9 million in employee termination benefits, lease termination costs and other exit costs during fiscal 2017. additionally, during fiscal 2017, we recorded $9.6 million in other facility exit costs not related to the fiscal 2017 plan. during fiscal 2016 autodesk recorded no restructuring charges. we have substantially completed the actions authorized under all of the restructuring plans. see note 15, "restructuring charges and other facility exit costs, net" in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information.
provision for income taxes we account for income taxes and the related accounts under the liability method. deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities, using enacted rates expected to be in effect during the year in which the basis differences reverse.
income tax expense was $58.3 million and $310.2 million for fiscal 2017 and 2016, respectively, relative to a pre-tax loss of $523.8 million and pre-tax income of $20.3 million, respectively, for the same periods.  tax expense for fiscal 2017 consists primarily of foreign tax expense including withholding tax, and tax amortization on indefinite-lived intangibles. tax expense for fiscal 2016 related to foreign tax expense and the establishment of a $230.8 million valuation allowance against the company's u.s. federal and remaining state deferred tax assets recorded in the second quarter of fiscal 2016. we regularly assess the need for a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets. in making that assessment, we consider both positive and negative evidence, whether it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. in evaluating the need for a valuation allowance, we considered recent cumulative losses in the u.s. arising from our business model transition as a significant piece of negative evidence and determined that it was more likely than not that the federal and state deferred tax assets would not be realized.
our future effective annual tax rate may be materially impacted by the amount of benefits and charges from tax amounts associated with our foreign earnings that are taxed at rates different from the federal statutory rate, changes in valuation allowances, level of profit before tax, accounting for uncertain tax positions, business combinations, closure of statute of limitations or settlement of tax audits, and changes in tax laws including possible u.s. tax law changes that, if enacted, could significantly impact how u.s. multinational companies are taxed. a significant amount of our earnings is generated by our europe and asia pacific subsidiaries. our future effective tax rates may be adversely affected to the extent earnings are lower
for additional information regarding our income tax provision and reconciliation of our effective rate to the federal statutory rate of 35%, see note 4, "income taxes," in the notes to consolidated financial statements.
other financial information in addition to our results determined under u.s. generally accepted accounting principles ("gaap") discussed above, we believe the following non-gaap measures are useful to investors in evaluating our operating performance. for the fiscal years ended january 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, our gross profit, gross margin, (loss) income from operations, operating margin, net (loss) income, diluted net (loss) income per share and diluted shares used in per share calculation on a gaap and non-gaap basis were as follows (in millions except for gross margin, operating margin, and per share data):
gross profit                                                                $1,689.1                $2,133.4                $2,170.1
non-gaap gross profit                                                       $1,743.2                $2,194.2                $2,232.2
for our internal budgeting and resource allocation process and as a means to provide consistency in period-to-period comparisons, we use non-gaap measures to supplement our consolidated financial statements presented on a gaap basis. these non-gaap measures do not include certain items that may have a material impact upon our reported financial results. we also use non-gaap measures in making operating decisions because we believe those measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our earning potential and performance for management by excluding certain benefits, credits, expenses and charges that may not be indicative of our core business operating results. for the reasons set forth below, we believe these non-gaap financial measures are useful to investors both because (1) they allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision-making and (2) they are used by our institutional investors and the analyst community to help them analyze the health of our business. this allows investors and others to better understand and evaluate our operating results and future prospects in the same manner as management, compare financial results across accounting periods and to those of peer companies and to better understand the long-term performance of our core business. we also use some of these measures for purposes of determining company-wide incentive compensation.
there are limitations in using non-gaap financial measures because non-gaap financial measures are not prepared in accordance with gaap and may be different from non-gaap financial measures used by other companies. the non-gaap financial measures included above are limited in value because they exclude certain items that may have a material impact upon our reported financial results. in addition, they are subject to inherent limitations as they reflect the exercise of judgments by
management about which charges are excluded from the non-gaap financial measures. we compensate for these limitations by analyzing current and future results on a gaap basis as well as a non-gaap basis and also by providing gaap measures in our public disclosures. the presentation of non-gaap financial information is meant to be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or in isolation from, the directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with gaap. we urge investors to review the reconciliation of our non-gaap financial measures to the comparable gaap financial measures included below, and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business.

stock-based compensation expenses.  we exclude stock-based compensation expenses from non-gaap measures primarily because they are non-cash expenses and management finds it useful to exclude certain non-cash charges to assess the appropriate level of various operating expenses to assist in budgeting, planning, and forecasting future periods. moreover, because of varying available valuation methodologies, subjective assumptions and the variety of award types that companies can use under fasb asc topic 718, we believe excluding stock-based compensation expenses allows investors to make meaningful comparisons between our recurring core business operating results and those of other companies.
amortization of developed technologies and purchased intangibles.  we incur amortization of acquisition-related developed technology and purchased intangibles in connection with acquisitions of certain businesses and technologies. amortization of developed technologies and purchased intangibles is inconsistent in amount and frequency and is significantly affected by the timing and size of our acquisitions. management finds it useful to exclude these variable charges from our cost of revenues to assist in budgeting, planning, and forecasting future periods. investors should note that the use of intangible assets contributed to our revenues earned during the periods presented and will contribute to our future period revenues as well. amortization of developed technologies and purchased intangible assets will recur in future periods.
goodwill impairment.  this is a non-cash charge to write-down goodwill to fair value when there was an indication that the asset was impaired. as explained above, management finds it useful to exclude certain non-cash charges to assess the appropriate level of various operating expenses to assist in budgeting, planning, and forecasting future periods.
restructuring charges and other facility exit costs, net.  these expenses are associated with realigning our business strategies based on current economic conditions. in connection with these restructuring actions or other exit actions, we recognize costs related to termination benefits for former employees whose positions were eliminated, the closure of facilities and cancellation of certain contracts. we exclude these charges because these expenses are not reflective of ongoing business and operating results. we believe it is useful for investors to understand the effects of these items on our total operating expenses.
loss (gain) on strategic investments. we exclude gains and losses related to our strategic investments from our non-gaap measures primarily because management finds it useful to exclude these variable gains and losses on these investments in assessing our financial results. included in these amounts are non-cash unrealized gains and losses on the derivative components and realized gains and losses on the sale or losses on the impairment of these investments. we believe excluding these items is useful to investors because these excluded items do not correlate to the underlying performance of our business and these losses or gains were incurred in connection with strategic investments which do not occur regularly.
establishment of a valuation allowance on certain net deferred tax assets.  this is a non-cash charge to record a valuation allowance on certain deferred tax assets. as explained above, management finds it useful to exclude certain non-cash charges to assess the appropriate level of various cash expenses to assist in budgeting, planning, and forecasting future periods.
discrete tax items. we exclude the gaap tax provision, including discrete items, from the non-gaap measure of income, and include a non-gaap tax provision based upon the projected annual non-gaap effective tax rate. discrete tax items include income tax expenses or benefits that do not relate to ordinary income from continuing operations in the current fiscal year, unusual or infrequently occurring items, or the tax impact of certain stock-based compensation. examples of discrete tax items include, but are not limited to, certain changes in judgment and changes in estimates of tax matters related to prior fiscal years, certain costs related to business combinations, certain changes in the ability to utilize deferred tax assets or changes in tax law. management believes this approach assists investors in understanding the tax provision and the effective tax rate related to ongoing operations. we believe the exclusion of these discrete tax items provides investors with useful supplemental information about our operational performance.
income tax effects on the difference between gaap and non-gaap costs and expenses. the income tax effects that are excluded from the non-gaap measures relate to the tax impact on the difference between gaap and non-gaap expenses, primarily due to stock-based compensation, amortization of purchased intangibles and restructuring charges and other facilities exit costs, net for gaap and non-gaap measures.
liquidity and capital resources
our primary source of cash is from the sale and maintenance of our products. our primary use of cash is payment of our operating costs, which consist primarily of employee-related expenses, such as compensation and benefits, as well as general operating expenses for marketing, facilities and overhead costs. in addition to operating expenses, we also use cash to fund our stock repurchase program and invest in our growth initiatives, which include acquisitions of products, technology and businesses. see further discussion of these items below.
at january 31, 2017, our principal sources of liquidity were cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities totaling $2.2 billion and net accounts receivable of $452.3 million. net of our senior notes, we have cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities totaling $0.7 billion at january 31, 2017.
in june 2015, we issued $450.0 million aggregate principal amount of 3.125% notes due june 15, 2020 and $300.0 million aggregate principal amount of 4.375% notes due june 15, 2025. in december 2012, we issued $400.0 million aggregate principal amount of 1.95% notes due december 15, 2017 and $350.0 million aggregate principal amount of 3.6% notes due december 15, 2022 (all four series of notes collectively, the "notes"). as of march 21, 2017, we have $1.5 billion aggregate principal amount of notes outstanding. in addition, we have a line of credit facility that permits unsecured short-term borrowings of up to $400.0 million with a may 2020 maturity date. as a result of the business model transition, the leverage ratio requirement of the credit agreement was waived during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017. autodesk is discussing amendments to the financial covenants in the credit agreement with the lenders and expects to conclude this process during the first quarter of fiscal 2018. as of march 21, 2017, we have no amounts outstanding under the credit facility. borrowings under the credit facility and the net proceeds from the offering of the notes are available for general corporate purposes.
our cash and cash equivalents are held by diversified financial institutions globally. our primary commercial banking relationship is with citigroup and its global affiliates. in addition, citibank n.a., an affiliate of citigroup, is one of the lead lenders and agent in the syndicate of our $400.0 million line of credit.
our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities decreased to $2.2 billion at january 31, 2017, from $2.8 billion at january 31, 2016, primarily as a result of cash used for repurchases of our common stock (net of stock issuance proceeds), acquisitions including business combinations and technology purchases, and capital expenditures. the decrease in our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities was partially offset by the cash generated through operations. the cash proceeds from issuance of common stock vary based on our stock price, stock option exercise activity and the volume of employee purchases under the employee stock purchase plan.
the primary source of net cash provided by operating activities of $169.7 million in fiscal 2017 was $356.8 million of cash flow provided by the change in operating assets and liabilities and $322.2 million of non-cash expenses, including stock-based compensation expense, and depreciation, amortization and accretion expense, offsetting our net loss of $582.1 million. the primary working capital sources of cash was an increase in deferred revenue and a decrease in accounts receivable for fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016. the primary working capital use of cash was a decrease in other accrued liabilities for fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016. our days sales outstanding in trade receivables was 86 at january 31, 2017, compared to 92 at january 31, 2016. the decrease in days sales outstanding primarily relates to changes in billings linearity within each comparative period.
at january 31, 2017, our short-term investment portfolio had an estimated fair value of $686.8 million and a cost basis of $684.5 million. the portfolio fair value consisted of $234.5 million invested in corporate debt securities, $157.3 million invested in certificates of deposit, $109.2 million invested in commercial paper, $43.4 million invested in municipal securities,$32.3 million invested in u.s. treasury bills, $30.0 million invested in sovereign debt, $19.6 million invested in asset backed securities, and $13.2 million invested in u.s. government agency securities.
at january 31, 2017, $47.3 million of trading securities were invested in a defined set of mutual funds as directed by the participants in our deferred compensation plan (see note 6, "deferred compensation," in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion).
long-term cash requirements for items other than normal operating expenses are anticipated for the following: repayment of debt; common stock repurchases; the acquisition of businesses, software products, or technologies complementary to our business; and capital expenditures, including the purchase and implementation of internal-use software applications.
our strategy includes improving our product functionality and expanding our product offerings through internal development as well as through the acquisition of products, technology, and businesses. acquisitions often increase the speed at which we can deliver product functionality to our customers; however, they entail cost and integration challenges and, in certain
instances, negatively impact our operating margins. we continually review these trade-offs in making decisions regarding acquisitions. we currently anticipate that we will continue to acquire products, technology, and businesses as compelling opportunities become available. our decision to acquire businesses or technology is dependent on our business needs, the availability of suitable sellers and technology, and our own financial condition.
our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances are concentrated in a few locations around the world, with substantial amounts held outside of the united states. as of january 31, 2017, approximately 91% of our total cash or cash equivalents, and marketable securities are located in foreign jurisdictions and that percentage will fluctuate subject to business needs. there are several factors that can impact our ability to utilize foreign cash balances, such as foreign exchange restrictions, foreign regulatory restrictions or adverse tax costs. our intent is that amounts related to foreign earnings permanently reinvested outside the u.s. will remain outside the united states. we expect to meet our u.s. liquidity needs through ongoing cash flows, foreign cash for which u.s. federal income taxes have been provided, external borrowings, or a combination. we regularly review our capital structure and consider a variety of potential financing alternatives and planning strategies to ensure we have the proper liquidity available in the locations in which it is needed.
cash from operations could also be affected by various risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to the risks detailed in part i, item 1a titled "risk factors." however, based on our current business plan and revenue prospects, we believe that our existing balances, our anticipated cash flows from operations and our available credit facility will be sufficient to meet our working capital and operating resource expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months.
our revenue, earnings, cash flows, receivables, and payables are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, for which we have put in place foreign currency contracts as part of our risk management strategy. see part ii, item 7a, "quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk" for further discussion.
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our significant financial contractual obligations at january 31, 2017 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods.
(1)   this table generally excludes amounts already recorded on the balance sheet as current liabilities, certain purchase obligations as discussed below, long term deferred revenue, and amounts related to income tax liabilities for uncertain tax positions, since we cannot predict with reasonable reliability the timing of cash settlements to the respective taxing authorities (see note 4, "income taxes" to the notes to consolidated financial statements).
operating lease obligations consist primarily of obligations for facilities, net of sublease income, computer equipment and other equipment leases.
purchase obligations are contractual obligations for purchase of goods or services and are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding on autodesk and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum, or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. purchase obligations relate primarily to enterprise subscription agreements, it infrastructure costs, and marketing costs.
pension obligations relate to our obligations for pension plans outside of the u.s. see note 14, "retirement benefit plans," in our notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding these obligations.
asset retirement obligations represent the estimated costs to bring certain office buildings that we lease back to their original condition after the termination of the lease.
purchase orders or contracts for the purchase of supplies and other goods and services are not included in the table above. we are not able to determine the aggregate amount of such purchase orders that represent contractual obligations, as purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements. our purchase orders are based on our current procurement or development needs and are fulfilled by our vendors within short time horizons. we do not have significant agreements for the purchase of supplies or other goods specifying minimum quantities or set prices that exceed our expected requirements for three months. in addition, we have certain software royalty commitments associated with the shipment and licensing of certain products.
we provide indemnifications of varying scopes and certain guarantees, including limited product warranties. historically, costs related to these warranties and indemnifications have not been significant, but because potential future costs are highly variable, we are unable to estimate the maximum potential impact of these guarantees on our future results of operations.
issuer purchases of equity securities autodesk's stock repurchase program provides autodesk with the ability to offset the dilution from the issuance of stock under our employee stock plans and reduce shares outstanding over time, and has the effect of returning excess cash generated from our business to stockholders. under the share repurchase program, autodesk may repurchase shares from time to time in open market transactions, privately-negotiated transactions, accelerated share repurchase programs, tender offers, or by other means. the share repurchase program does not have an expiration date and the pace and timing of repurchases will depend on factors such as cash generation from operations, available surplus, the volume of employee stock plan activity, remaining shares available in the authorized pool, cash requirements for acquisitions, economic and market conditions, stock price and legal and regulatory requirements.
in september 2016, the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to 30.0 million shares of the company's common stock. during the three and twelve months ended january 31, 2017, we repurchased 2.9 million and 9.7 million shares of our common stock, respectively. at january 31, 2017, 26.6 million shares remained available for repurchase under the repurchase programs approved by the board of directors. these programs do not have a fixed expiration date. see note 9, "stockholders' equity," in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion.
off-balance sheet arrangements as of january 31, 2017, we did not have any significant off-balance sheet arrangements other than operating leases, as defined in item 303(a)(4)(ii) of regulation s-k.

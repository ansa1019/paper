item 1a: risk factors.
an investment in our securities involves a degree of risk. the risks described below are not the only ones facing us. additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also have a material adverse effect on us. if any of the following risks actually occur, our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or business could be harmed. in that case, the market price of our securities could decline and you could lose part or all of your investment.
global economic conditions may materially and adversely affect our business.
our business and results of operations are affected by international, national and regional economic conditions. a recurrence of recessionary conditions in the united states and elsewhere may lead to reduced industrial production which, in turn, may lead to lower demand and lower prices for oil and gas, which may adversely affect our results of operations.
the trust's oil and gas royalty revenue is dependent upon the market prices of oil and gas which fluctuate.
the oil and gas royalties which the trust receives are dependent upon the market prices for oil and gas. the market prices for oil and gas are subject to national and international economic and political conditions and, in the past, have been subject to significant price fluctuations. price fluctuations for oil and gas have been particularly volatile in recent years. although the trust's oil and gas royalties benefited from the substantial increases in the market prices for oil and gas in past years, when lower market prices for oil and gas occur they will have an adverse effect on our oil and gas royalty revenues.
the trust is not an oil and gas producer. its revenues from oil and gas royalties are subject to the actions of others.
the trust is not an oil and gas producer. its oil and gas income is derived from perpetual non-participating oil and gas royalty interests which it has retained. as wells age the costs of production may increase and their capacity may decline absent additional investment. however, the owners and operators of the oil and gas wells make all decisions as to investments in, and production from, those wells and the trust's royalties will be dependent upon decisions made by those operators, among other factors. the railroad commission of the state of texas sets authorized production levels for pro rated wells by regulation. the monthly percentage of allowable production has averaged 100% in recent years. however, in the past the trust's income from oil and gas royalties has been limited by the production levels authorized by the railroad commission and we cannot assure you that they may not be so limited in the future.
our revenues from the sale of land are subject to substantial fluctuation. we are a passive seller of land and land sales are subject to many factors that are beyond our control.
land sales vary widely from year to year and quarter to quarter. the total dollar amount, the average price per acre, and the number of acres sold in any one year or quarter should not be assumed to be indicative of land sales in the future. the trust is a passive seller of land and does not actively solicit sales of land. the demand for, and the sale price of, any particular tract of the trust's land is influenced by many factors, including the national and local economies, rate of oil and gas well development by operators, the rate of residential and commercial development in nearby areas, livestock carrying capacity and the condition of the local agricultural industry, which itself is influenced by range conditions and prices for livestock and agricultural products. approximately 99% of the trust's land is classified as ranch land and intermingled with parcels owned by third parties to form ranching units. the trust's ability to sell ranch land is, therefore, largely dependent on the actions of adjoining landowners.
the trust's remaining holdings of land in metropolitan areas are limited.
the sale price of land suitable for development in metropolitan areas is generally substantially higher than the price of land in rural or ranching areas. the trust's remaining holdings of land suitable for development in metropolitan areas are limited.
if the liability of holders of certificates of proprietary interest and sub-shares were to be found to be governed by the laws of texas, holders of certificates of proprietary interest and sub-shares might be held to have personal liability for claims against the trust, to the extent such claims exceeded the assets of the trust.
the declaration of trust which established the trust was executed and delivered in new york. under the laws of the state of new york, the holders of certificates of proprietary interest and sub-shares are not subject to any personal liability for the acts or obligations of the trust. the assets of the trust are located in texas. under the laws of the state of texas the holders of certificates of proprietary interest and sub-shares may be held personally liable with respect to claims against the trust, but only after the assets of the trust first have been exhausted. thus, if a court were to hold that the liability of holders of certificates of proprietary interest and sub-shares for obligations is governed by the laws of texas, rather than new york, it is possible that holders of certificates of proprietary interest and sub-shares might be held to have personal liability for claims against the trust to the extent such claims exceeded all of the trust's assets.
the trustees are not subject to annual election and, as a result, the ability of the holders of certificates of proprietary interest and sub-shares to influence the policies of the trust may be limited.
directors of a corporation are generally subject to election at each annual meeting of stockholders or, in the case of staggered boards, at regular intervals. under the declaration of trust, however, the trust is not required to hold annual meetings of holders of certificates of proprietary interest and sub-shares to elect trustees and trustees generally hold office until their death, resignation or disqualification. as a result, the ability of holders of certificates of proprietary interest and sub-shares to effect changes in the board of trustees, and the policies of the trust, is significantly more limited than that of the stockholders of a corporation.
our results of operations for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of our results of operations for a full year.
sales of land fluctuate from quarter to quarter. revenues from oil and gas royalties may also fluctuate from quarter to quarter based upon market prices for oil and gas and production decisions made by the operators. as a result, the results of our operations for any particular quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations for a full year.
item 7: management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.
the following discussion and analysis should be read together with the factors discussed in item 1a "risk factors" and with the financial statements, including the notes thereto, and the other financial information appearing elsewhere in this report. period-to-period comparisons of financial data are not necessarily indicative, and therefore should not be relied upon as indicators, of the trust's future performance. words or phrases such as "does not believe" and "believes," or similar expressions, when used in this form 10-k or other filings with the sec, are intended to identify "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995.
overview the trust was organized in 1888 and holds title to extensive tracts of land in numerous west texas counties which were previously the property of the texas and pacific railway company. we continue to manage those lands for the benefit of the holders of certificates of proprietary interest in the trust (and/or sub-shares in the certificates of proprietary interest). our revenues are derived primarily from oil and gas royalties, easements and sundry income, sales of land, grazing leases of the land and interest. due to the nature of our operations, our revenue is subject to substantial fluctuations from quarter to quarter and year to year. we are a passive seller of land and do not actively solicit sales of land. in addition, the demand for, and sale price of, particular tracts of land is influenced by many factors beyond our control, including general economic conditions, the rate of development in nearby areas and the suitability of the particular tract for the ranching uses prevalent in western texas. the trust is not an oil and gas producer. rather, its oil and gas revenue is derived from retained perpetual non-participating oil and gas royalty interests. thus, in addition to being subject to fluctuations in response to the market prices for oil and gas, our oil and gas royalty revenues are also subject to decisions made by the owners and operators of the oil wells to which our royalty interests relate as to investments in and production from those wells. we monitor production reports by the oil and gas companies to assure that we are being paid the appropriate royalties. we review conditions in the agricultural industry in the areas in which our lands are located and seek to keep as much of our lands as possible under lease to local ranchers. in recent years, we have been successful at keeping over 99% of our land subject to grazing leases.
results of operations the trust's primary sources of income are revenue derived from sales of land, either for cash or a combination of cash and mortgage notes, and revenue derived from the trust's land and royalty interests.
total operating and investing revenues in 2016 aggregated $59,940,467, a decrease of $19,501,826, or 24.5%, from the $79,442,293 of total operating and investing revenues recorded in 2015. this decrease resulted primarily from decreases in land sales and, to a lesser extent, easements and sundry income. these decreases were partially offset by an increase in oil and gas royalties. earnings per sub-share certificate were $4.66 for 2016 compared to $6.10 in 2015. the trust purchased and retired 190,750 sub-shares during 2016, leaving 7,927,314 sub-shares outstanding at december 31, 2016.
rentals, royalties and other income (including interest on investments) were $56,994,962 in 2016 compared to $56,825,658 in 2015.
grazing lease income in 2016 was $489,982 compared to $483,989 in 2015, an increase of 1.2%. this increase is primarily caused by an increase in rates for renewing grazing leases partially offset by the reduction in acres available to lease due to land sale activity.
interest revenue (including interest on investments) was $37,349 in 2016 compared to $68,306 in 2015, a decrease of 45.3%. interest income from notes receivable amounted to $8,279 in 2016 compared to $40,866 in 2015. this decrease is primarily due to principal prepayments received on notes due to the trust. at year-end 2016, notes receivable from land sales were $94,971 compared to $139,114 at year end 2015. interest income earned from investments amounted to $29,070 in 2016 and $27,440 in 2015, respectively. total principal cash payments on notes receivable were $44,143 in 2016 including $15,803 of prepaid principal.
easements and sundry income in 2016 was $26,470,669 compared to $31,413,158 in 2015, a decrease of 15.7%. this decrease resulted primarily from a decrease in the amount of pipeline easement income to $9,738,342 for 2016 compared to $18,182,259 in 2015. the trust is currently moving toward the use of term easements (in lieu of perpetual easements) which will require us to gradually recognize the income for easements over the life of the agreement (the bulk of which are 10-year agreements), in lieu of recognizing it all at the beginning of the term of the easement. as a result, $7,809,669 of easement income received in 2016 was deferred and therefore not reflected in the statements of income and total comprehensive income in the current year. this was also the primary reason for the 356.5% increase in unearned revenue. the decrease in pipeline easement income was partially offset by an increase in sundry lease rental income and sundry income. easements and sundry income is unpredictable and may vary significantly from period to period.
all other expenses were $3,074,270 in 2016 compared to $2,682,695 in 2015. this increase resulted primarily from the data conversion portion of a project that began in the third quarter of 2015 to enhance the information systems of the trust and, to a lesser extent, increases in legal and professional fees and salaries and related employee benefits expense.
total operating and investing revenues in 2015 aggregated $79,442,293, an increase of $24,225,540, or 43.9%, from the $55,216,753 of total operating and investing revenues recorded in 2014. this increase resulted primarily from increases in land sales and easements and sundry income. these increases were partially offset by decreases in oil and gas royalties and interest income from notes receivable. earnings per sub-share certificate were $6.10 for 2015 compared to $4.14 in 2014. the trust purchased and retired 204,335 sub-shares during 2015, leaving 8,118,064 sub-shares outstanding at december 31, 2015.
rentals, royalties and other income (including interest on investments) were $56,825,658 in 2015 compared to $51,518,441 in 2014, an increase of 10.3%.
grazing lease income in 2015 was $483,989 compared to $500,292 in 2014, a decrease of 3.3%. this decrease is caused by the reduction in acres available to lease due to land sale activity.
interest revenue (including interest on investments) was $68,306 in 2015 compared to $154,814 in 2014, a decrease of 55.9%. interest on notes receivable amounted to $40,866 in 2015 compared to $140,291 in 2014. this decrease is primarily due to principal prepayments received on notes due to the trust. at year end 2015, notes receivable from land sales were $139,114 compared to $923,115 at year end 2014. interest on investments amounted to $27,440 in 2015 and $14,523 in 2014, respectively. total principal cash payments on notes receivable were $784,001 in 2015 including $713,062 of prepaid principal.
easements and sundry income in 2015 was $31,413,158 compared to $21,517,232 in 2014 due to a continued increase in drilling and exploration activity on land owned by the trust. this increase resulted primarily from an increase in the amount of pipeline easement income to $18,182,259 for 2015, an increase of $8,997,209, or 98.0%, from the $9,185,050 received in 2014. this increase was partially offset by decreases in sundry lease rental income and seismic easement income. easements and sundry income is unpredictable and may vary significantly from period to period.
taxes, other than income taxes, were $1,476,576 in 2015 compared to $1,692,256 in 2014. oil and gas production taxes were $1,324,909 in 2015 compared to $1,540,735 in 2014. ad valorem taxes were $94,219 in 2015 compared to $97,054 in 2014. all other expenses were $2,682,695 in 2015 compared to $2,092,943 in 2014. this increase resulted primarily from increases in salaries and related employee benefits expense, legal and professional fees expense and a project that began in the third quarter of 2015 to enhance the information systems of the trust.
liquidity the trust's principal sources of liquidity are its revenues from oil and gas royalties, easements and sundry income, and land sales. in the past, these sources have generated more than adequate amounts of cash to meet the trust's needs and, in the opinion of management, should continue to do so in the foreseeable future.
tabular disclosure of contractual obligations the trust executed a ten year extension to its office lease in 2015. the new expiration date of the lease is march 31, 2025. as of december 31, 2016, the trust's known contractual obligations were as follows:
capital lease obligations                                                              -                        -                       -                        -                        -
other long-term liabilities reflected on the trust's balance sheet under gaap          -                        -                       -                        -                        -
effects of inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our operating results. we cannot assure you, however, that future increases in our costs will not occur or that any such increases that may occur will not adversely affect our results of operations.
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america (gaap) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. it is our opinion that we fully disclose our significant accounting policies in the notes to the financial statements. consistent with our disclosure policies, we include the following discussion related to what we believe to be our most critical accounting policies that require our most difficult, subjective or complex judgment.
valuation of notes receivable - management of the trust monitors delinquencies to assess the propriety of the carrying value of its notes receivable. at the point in time that notes receivable become delinquent, management reviews the operations information of the debtor and the estimated fair value of the collateral held as security to determine whether an allowance for losses is required. any required allowance for losses is recorded in the period of determination. at december 31, 2016 and 2015, there were no significant delinquencies and, as such, no allowances for losses have been recorded.
valuation of real estate acquired through foreclosure - the value of real estate acquired through foreclosure is established at the lower of cost or fair value less disposition costs at the date of foreclosure. cost is considered to be the aggregate of the outstanding principal and interest, past due ad valorem taxes and other fees associated with the foreclosure. subsequent to the foreclosure date, valuations are periodically performed or obtained by management when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the full carrying amount may not be recoverable. at such time, a valuation allowance is established to reduce the carrying value to the estimated fair value. valuation of the real estate is based on the estimates of management and is subject to judgment. at december 31, 2016 and 2015, no valuation allowances were recorded.
gain recognition on land sales - accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america dictate the manner in which the gain or loss on the sale of land is recorded. the trust has established policies for the sale of land which result in the full accrual method of gain recognition. this policy generally requires that the trust receive a minimum cash down payment of 25% of the sales price on each sale and that any related notes receivable require regular principal and interest payments, payable over terms from 5 to 15 years.

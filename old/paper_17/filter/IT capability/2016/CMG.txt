overview steve ells, our founder, chairman and ceo, started chipotle with the idea that food served fast did not have to be a typical fast food experience. today, chipotle continues to offer a focused menu of burritos, tacos, burrito bowls, and salads made from fresh, high-quality raw ingredients, prepared using classic cooking methods and served in an interactive style allowing people to get what they want. chipotle seeks out extraordinary ingredients that are not only fresh, but that are raised responsibly, with respect for the animals, land, and people who produce them. chipotle prepares its food using whole, unprocessed ingredients and without the use of added colors, flavors or other additives typically found in fast food. chipotle opened with a single restaurant in denver in 1993 and as of december 31, 2016, operated 2,250 restaurants.
our focus during 2017 is to return to sales and profitability growth and restore our restaurant economic model.  to do so, we have a renewed focus on ensuring that every guest in every one of our restaurants is provided with an excellent customer experience.
2016 highlights and trends operating results. our sales and profitability were adversely impacted throughout 2016 as a result of a number of food-borne illness incidents associated with chipotle restaurants in as many as 15 states, which were widely reported during the fourth quarter of 2015 and the first quarter of 2016.  our comparable restaurant sales trends have improved sequentially for each quarter during 2016 as shown below:
during the full year 2016, our restaurant operating costs (food, beverage and packaging; labor; occupancy; and other operating costs) as a percent of revenue increased 13.3% as compared to the full year 2015. about 6.2% of the increase was attributable to sales deleveraging, while incremental marketing and promotional spend aimed at regaining our customers, combined with additional labor to support the sales promotions, contributed about 3.1% to the increase. additionally, as part of our response to the food-borne illness incidents, we have implemented enhanced food safety procedures in our supply chain and restaurants that have increased our food costs as a percentage of revenue.  we anticipate that the ongoing impact of the enhanced food safety procedures on our food costs as a percentage of revenue will be approximately 1% compared to pre-crisis levels.
restaurant development. as of december 31, 2016, we had 2,250 restaurants in operation, including 2,198 chipotle restaurants throughout the united states, with an additional 29 international chipotle restaurants and 23 non-chipotle restaurants that were consolidated into our financial results.  we opened 240 restaurants in 2016, net of relocations and closures, which contributed $156.2 million to revenue.  in the fourth quarter of 2016, we announced that we were exploring strategic alternatives for our 15 shophouse southeast asian kitchen restaurants, and as a result, we recognized a non-cash impairment charge of $14.5 million.
stock repurchases. in accordance with stock repurchases authorized by our board of directors, we purchased shares of our common stock during 2016 with an aggregate total repurchase price of $813.9 million. as of december 31, 2016, $102.6 million was available for stock repurchases under the authorizations announced on may 11, 2016 and october 25, 2016. on january 10, 2017, we also announced authorizations by our board of directors of up to an additional $100 million in common stock repurchases. we have entered into an agreement with a broker under sec rule 10b5-1(c), authorizing the broker to make open market purchases of common stock from time to time, subject to market conditions. the existing repurchase agreement and the board's authorizations of the repurchases may be modified, suspended, or discontinued at any time.
management and governance enhancements. in the fourth quarter of 2016, we announced that our board of directors named steve ells as our sole chief executive officer, and that monty moran, formerly our co-chief executive officer, had stepped down from his officer and board positions and will retire effective june 9, 2017.  on december 19, 2016, we also announced the appointment of four new members to our board of directors, two of whom were nominated by pershing square capital management, l.p., which, together with its affiliates, we believe to be our largest shareholder.
2017 outlook sales. we are targeting comparable restaurant sales increases in the high single digits for the full year 2017 as comparisons become easier in the first half of 2017, and based on our plans to attract more customers with a variety of marketing activities and improvements to our digital ordering platforms, and by improving the quality of the customer experience we provide in our restaurants.
restaurant operating costs.  we expect to reduce restaurant level operating costs as a percent of revenue for the full year 2017. our expectation is based in part on the increased sales we are anticipating and the resulting leverage in fixed operating costs, but we are forecasting additional improvements as well.  we expect food, beverage and packaging costs to decrease as a percent of revenue due to relief in avocado prices and more efficient food management. we also believe that other operating expenses will decline compared to 2016 as we reduce marketing and promotional spend as a percent of revenue from the elevated levels of 2016, although we still plan for these expenses in 2017 to be above historical levels.
other expense items and restaurant development plans.  we expect that general and administrative expenses will increase in 2017 due to higher non-cash stock-based compensation expense and higher bonuses, although underlying general and administrative expenses for the year should remain relatively consistent with 2016.  the expected increase in stock based compensation is primarily a result of lower expense in 2016 due to an expense reversal for performance-based stock awards that did not vest, as well as higher expense in 2017 due to a planned retention award for non-executive employees and broadening the group of non-executive employees eligible for awards.  we expect to realize cost efficiencies in the development of our restaurants in 2017 by simplifying our restaurant design, and choosing real estate sites, such as end-caps, that can more easily and cost-efficiently be converted into chipotle restaurants.  we intend to open between 195 and 210 restaurants for the full year 2017. most of our 2017 restaurant openings are planned in markets that are proven or already have a chipotle presence established.
tax rates. we expect the 2017 full year effective tax rate to be between 39.0% and 39.5%. however, as discussed in note 1. "description of business and summary of significant accounting policies," included in item 8. "financial statements and supplementary data" the adoption of asu no. 2016-09, "compensation-stock compensation (topic 718)" will subject our tax rate to quarterly volatility from the effect of stock award exercise and vesting activities.     restaurant openings, relocations and closures the following table details restaurant unit data for the years indicated.
food, beverage and packaging costs decreased as a percentage of revenue in 2015 primarily due to the benefit of the nation-wide menu price increases taken in the second quarter of 2014 and relief in dairy and avocado costs. the decrease was partially offset by inflation on beef costs.
labor costs as a percentage of revenue increased in 2016 due primarily to sales deleveraging and wage inflation, partially offset by labor efficiencies resulting from fewer managers and crew in each of our restaurants.  although we incurred additional costs to staff our restaurants for sales promotions during 2016, those incremental costs were offset by the improvement from 2015 when we incurred scheduling inefficiencies as a result of reporting challenges from a system change in early 2015. labor costs increased in dollar terms for the year ended december 31, 2016 due to staffing needs for new restaurants.
occupancy costs as a percentage of revenue increased in 2016 primarily due to lower average restaurant sales on a partially fixed-cost base. occupancy costs increased in dollar terms for the year ended december 31, 2016, primarily due to costs associated with new restaurants.
other operating costs include, among other items, marketing and promotional costs, bank and credit card fees, and restaurant utilities and maintenance costs. other operating costs increased as a percentage of revenue in 2016 due primarily to higher marketing and promotional expense as well as sales deleveraging. we increased our marketing and promotional spend in an effort to regain customers, which contributed $98.2 million to the increase.
other operating costs increased as a percentage of revenue in 2015 due primarily to a change in the classification of kitchen gloves out of food, beverage, and packaging costs beginning in 2015, and higher marketing and promotional costs.
the increase in general and administrative expenses in dollar terms for 2016 primarily resulted from increased legal expense, higher payroll costs as we grew, and expenses associated with our biennial all managers' conference held during 2016, partially offset by lower bonus expense and travel costs.
the decrease in general and administrative expenses in dollar terms in 2015 primarily resulted from decreased non-cash stock-based compensation expense, lower bonus expense, and decreased expense associated with our biennial all managers' conference held during 2014, partially offset by higher payroll costs as we grew.  stock-based compensation expense decreased $39.4 million primarily due to a change in the structure of our executive compensation, as well as a decrease in our estimate of non-vested performance stock awards that we expect to vest.
depreciation and amortization increased as a percentage of revenue in 2016 due to sales deleveraging. the increase in dollar terms was due primarily to depreciation and amortization costs associated with new restaurants.
loss on disposal and impairment of assets increased in 2016 primarily due to a non-cash impairment charge of $14.5 million to write-down substantially all of the value of the long-lived assets of our shophouse restaurants.
loss on disposal of assets increased in 2015 due to impairment charges resulting from an internally developed software program that we chose not to implement and related hardware, the discontinued use of certain kitchen equipment, as well as restaurant relocations.
the 2016 effective tax rate was higher due to a higher state tax rate, not qualifying for the federal research and development tax credit in 2016, and non-deductible items on overall lower pre-tax operating income. the 2015 effective tax rate was higher than 2014 due primarily to 2014 benefiting from filing the 2013 tax returns, which included a non-recurring change in the estimate of usable employer credits.
quarterly financial data/seasonality the following table presents data from the consolidated statement of income and comprehensive income for each of the eight quarters in the period ended december 31, 2016. the operating results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results for any subsequent quarter. results from the quarter ended december 31, 2015 and for each quarter in 2016 include the impact of the food-borne illness incidents described elsewhere in this report.
seasonal factors cause our profitability to fluctuate from quarter to quarter. historically, our average daily restaurant sales and net income are lower in the first and fourth quarters due, in part, to the holiday season and because fewer people eat out during periods of inclement weather (the winter months) than during periods of mild or warm weather (the spring, summer and fall months). other factors also have a seasonal effect on our results. for example, restaurants located near colleges and universities generally do more business during the academic year. seasonal factors, however, might be moderated or outweighed by other factors that may influence our quarterly results, such as the adverse publicity that we saw beginning in the fourth quarter of 2015 around food-borne illness incidents associated with our restaurants, as well as fluctuations in food or packaging costs or the timing of menu price increases. the number of trading days in a quarter can also affect our results, although, on an overall annual basis, changes in trading days do not have a significant impact.     our quarterly results are also affected by other factors such as the amount and timing of non-cash stock-based compensation expense, the number of new restaurants opened in a quarter, anticipated and unanticipated events. new restaurants typically have lower margins following opening as a result of the expenses associated with opening new restaurants and their operating inefficiencies in the months immediately following opening. in addition, unanticipated events also impact our results. accordingly, results for a particular quarter are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for any other quarter or for any year.
liquidity and capital resources our primary liquidity and capital requirements are for new restaurant construction, working capital and general corporate needs. as of december 31, 2016, we had a cash and short-term investment balance of $417.7 million that we expect to utilize, along with cash flow from operations, to provide capital to support the growth of our business (primarily through opening restaurants), to repurchase additional shares of our common stock subject to market conditions, to maintain our existing restaurants and for general corporate purposes. as of december 31, 2016, there was $102.6 million remaining available under repurchase authorizations previously approved by our board of directors.  on january 10, 2017 we announced authorizations by our board of directors of up to an additional $100 million in common stock repurchases.  we also have a long term investments balance of $125.1 million, which consists of u.s. treasury notes with maturities of up to 15 months. we believe that cash from operations, together with our cash and investment balances, will be enough to meet ongoing capital expenditures, working capital requirements and other cash needs for the foreseeable future.
we haven't required significant working capital because customers generally pay using cash or credit and debit cards and because our operations do not require significant receivables, nor do they require significant inventories due, in part, to our use of various fresh ingredients. in addition, we generally have the right to pay for the purchase of food, beverage and supplies some time after the receipt of those items, generally within ten days, thereby reducing the need for incremental working capital to support our growth.
one of our primary uses of cash is in new restaurant development. our total capital expenditures for 2016 were $258.8 million, and we expect to incur capital expenditures of about $224 million in 2017, of which about $170 million relates to our construction of new restaurants before any reductions for landlord reimbursements, and the remainder primarily relates to restaurant reinvestments, information technology and infrastructure initiatives, and other corporate expenses. our expected reduction in capital expenditures is due to fewer planned restaurant openings and lower average investment costs per restaurant in 2017.  in 2016, we spent on average about $880,000 in development and construction costs per restaurant, or about $790,000 net of landlord reimbursements of $90,000.  for new restaurants to be opened in 2017, we anticipate average development costs will decrease due to cost savings initiatives.
(1)we enter into various purchase obligations in the ordinary course of business. those that are binding primarily relate to amounts owed for orders related to produce and other ingredients and supplies, construction contractor and subcontractor agreements, orders submitted for equipment for restaurants under construction, and marketing initiatives and corporate sponsorships.
the majority of our restaurants and administrative office leases are non-cancelable obligations. our leases generally have initial terms of either five to ten years with two or more five-year extensions, for end-cap and in-line restaurants, or 10 to 15 years with several five-year extensions, for free-standing restaurants. our leases generally require us to pay a proportionate share of real estate taxes, insurance, common charges and other operating costs. some restaurant leases provide for contingent rental payments based on sales thresholds, although we generally do not expect to pay significant contingent rent on these properties based on the thresholds in those leases.
inflation the primary areas of our operations affected by inflation are food, labor, healthcare costs, fuel, utility costs, materials used in the construction of our restaurants, and insurance. although a significant majority of our crew members make more than the federal and applicable state and local minimum wage, increases in the applicable federal or state minimum wage may have an impact on our labor costs by causing wage inflation above the minimum wage level. additionally, many of our leases require us to pay property taxes, maintenance, utilities and insurance, all of which are generally subject to inflationary increases. in the past we have largely been able to offset inflationary increases with menu price increases. there have been, and there may be in the future, delays in implementing such menu price increases. if we do raise menu prices in the future, general competitive pressures may limit our ability to completely recover cost increases attributable to inflation.
critical accounting estimates we describe our significant accounting policies in note 1. "description of business and summary of significant accounting policies" and note 6. "stock based compensation" of our consolidated financial statements included in item 8. "financial statements and supplementary data." critical accounting estimates are those that we believe are both significant and that require us to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often because we need to estimate the effect of inherently uncertain matters. we base our estimates and judgments on historical experiences and various other factors that we believe to be appropriate under the circumstances. actual results may differ from these estimates, and we might obtain different estimates if we used different assumptions or factors. we believe that of our critical accounting estimates, the following involve a higher degree of judgement and subjectivity:
leases we lease nearly all of our restaurant locations. our leases typically contain escalating rentals over the lease term as well as optional renewal periods. we have estimated that our lease term, including reasonably assured renewal periods, is the lesser of the lease term or 20 years.  we account for our leases by recognizing rent expense on a straight-line basis over the reasonably assured lease term. the majority of our leasehold improvements are also depreciated over the reasonably assured lease term.  if the estimate of our reasonably assured lease term was changed, our depreciation and rent expense could differ materially.
stock-based compensation we recognize compensation expense for equity awards over the vesting period based on the award's fair value. we use the black-scholes valuation model to determine the fair value of our stock-only stock appreciation rights, or sosars, and we use the monte carlo simulation model to determine the fair value of stock awards that contain market conditions. both of these models require assumptions to be made regarding our stock price volatility, the expected life of the award and expected dividend rates. the volatility assumption was based on our historical data and implied volatility, and the expected life assumptions were based on our historical data. similarly, the compensation expense of performance share awards, and sosars with performance-based vesting conditions is based in part on the estimated probability of our achieving levels of performance associated with particular levels of payout for performance shares and with vesting for performance sosars. we determine the probability of achievement of future levels of performance by comparing the relevant performance level with our internal estimates of future performance. those estimates are based on a number of assumptions, and different assumptions may have resulted in different conclusions regarding the probability of our achieving future levels of performance relevant to the payout levels for the awards. had we arrived at different assumptions of stock price volatility or expected lives of our sosars, or different assumptions regarding the probability of our achieving future levels of performance with respect to performance share awards and performance sosars, our stock-based compensation expense and results of operations could have been different. awards that contain service, performance and market conditions ultimately vest based on chipotle's relative performance versus a restaurant industry peer group in the annual averages of revenue growth, net income growth, and total shareholder return. our estimates of chipotle's future performance and the future performance of the restaurant industry peer group are assumptions that involve a high degree of subjectivity. if we had arrived at different assumptions for revenue growth or net income for chipotle or the peer group, our stock-based compensation expense and results of operations could have been different.     insurance liability we maintain various insurance policies for workers' compensation, general liability and auto damage with varying deductibles as high as $1 million per incident, and for property which generally has a $1.5 million per incident deductible. we are self-insured for employee health but have third party insurance coverage to limit exposure to these claims. we record a liability that represents our estimated cost of claims incurred and unpaid as of the balance sheet date. our estimated liability is not discounted and is based on a number of assumptions and factors, including historical trends, actuarial assumptions and economic conditions, and is closely monitored and adjusted when warranted by changing circumstances. our history of claims experience is relatively short and our significant growth during most of our operating history could affect the accuracy of estimates based on historical experience. if a greater amount of claims occurs compared to what we have estimated, or if medical costs increase beyond what we expected, our accrued liabilities might not be sufficient and we may be required to record additional expense. actual claims experience could also be more favorable than estimated, which would result in expense reductions. unanticipated changes may produce materially different amounts of expense than that reported under these programs. the total estimated insurance liabilities as of december 31, 2016 were $49.4 million.
reserves/contingencies for litigation and other matters we are involved in various claims and legal actions that arise in the ordinary course of business. these actions are subject to many uncertainties, and we cannot predict the outcomes with any degree of certainty. consequently, we were unable to estimate the ultimate aggregate amount of monetary liability or financial impact with respect to these matters as of december 31, 2016. although we have recorded liabilities related to a number of legal actions, our estimates used to determine the amount of these liabilities may not be accurate, and there are other legal actions for which we have not recorded a liability.  as a result, in the event legal actions for which we have not accrued a liability or for which our accrued liabilities are not accurate are resolved, such resolution may affect our operating results and cash flows.
item  7a.quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk commodity price risks we are exposed to commodity price risks. many of the ingredients we use to prepare our food, our packaging materials, as well as utilities to run our restaurants are commodities or ingredients that are affected by the price of other commodities, exchange rates, foreign demand, weather, seasonality, production, availability and other factors outside our control. we work closely with our suppliers and use a mix of forward pricing protocols under which we agree with our supplier on fixed prices for deliveries at some time in the future, fixed pricing protocols under which we agree on a fixed price with our supplier for the duration of that protocol, and formula pricing protocols under which the prices we pay are based on a specified formula related to the prices of the goods, such as spot prices. however, a majority of the dollar value of goods purchased by us is effectively at spot prices. generally our pricing protocols with suppliers can remain in effect for periods ranging from one to 24 months, depending on the outlook for prices of the particular ingredient. in several cases, we have minimum purchase obligations. we've tried to increase, where necessary, the number of suppliers for our ingredients, which we believe can help mitigate pricing volatility, and we follow industry news, trade issues, exchange rates, foreign demand, weather, crises and other world events that may affect our ingredient prices. increases in ingredient prices could adversely affect our results if we choose for competitive or other reasons not to increase menu prices at the same rate at which ingredient costs increase, or if menu price increases result in customer resistance.
changing interest rates we are also exposed to interest rate risk through fluctuations of interest rates on our investments. changes in interest rates affect the interest income we earn, and therefore impact our cash flows and results of operations. as of december 31, 2016, we had $500.5 million in investments and interest-bearing cash accounts, including insurance-related restricted trust accounts classified in other assets, and $37.6 million in accounts with an earnings credit we classify as interest income, which combined earned a weighted average interest rate of 0.71%.
foreign currency exchange risk a portion of our operations consist of activities outside of the u.s. and we have currency risk on the transactions in other currencies and translation adjustments resulting from the conversion of our international financial results into the u.s. dollar. however, a substantial majority of our operations and investment activities are transacted in the u.s. and therefore our foreign currency risk is not material at this date.
item 8. financial statements and supplementary data index to consolidated financial statements
consolidated statement of shareholders' equity for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014              42
we have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of chipotle mexican grill, inc. (the "company") as of december 31, 2016 and 2015, and the related consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income, shareholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended december 31, 2016. these financial statements are the responsibility of the company's management. our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
we conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board (united states). those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. an audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. an audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. we believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
in our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of chipotle mexican grill, inc. at december 31, 2016 and 2015, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended december 31, 2016, in conformity with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles.
we also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board (united states), chipotle mexican grill, inc.'s internal control over financial reporting as of december 31, 2016, based on criteria established in internal control-integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission (2013 framework) and our report dated february 6, 2017 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

1. description of business and summary of significant accounting policies chipotle mexican grill, inc., a delaware corporation, together with its subsidiaries (collectively the "company") develops and operates restaurants that serve a focused menu of burritos, tacos, burrito bowls and salads, made using fresh, high-quality ingredients. as of december 31, 2016, the company operated 2,198 chipotle restaurants throughout the united states as well as 29 international chipotle restaurants and 23 non-chipotle restaurants. the company transitioned the management of its operations from nine to eleven regions during 2016 and aggregates its operations to one reportable segment.
principles of consolidation and basis of presentation the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the company, including wholly and majority owned subsidiaries. all intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.
management estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. actual results could differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue, net of discounts and incentives, when payment is tendered at the point of sale.  the company recognizes a liability for offers of free food by estimating the cost to satisfy the offer based on company-specific historical redemption patterns for similar promotions.   these costs are recognized in other operating costs in the consolidated statement of income and comprehensive income and in accrued liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet.  the company reports revenue net of sales-related taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental taxing authorities.
during the year ended december 31, 2016, the company introduced a limited-time frequency program that awarded free food or merchandise to customers based on frequency of monthly visits. the company deferred revenue reflecting the portion of original sales allocated to the rewards that were earned by program participants and not redeemed at the end of the year, and recorded a corresponding liability in accrued liabilities on its consolidated balance sheet. the portion of revenue allocated to the rewards was based on the estimated value of the award earned and takes into consideration company-specific historical redemption patterns for similar promotions. rewards expire according to the loyalty awards terms and conditions. the company recognizes revenue when awards are redeemed or expire.
the company sells gift cards which do not have an expiration date and it does not deduct non-usage fees from outstanding gift card balances. the company recognizes revenue from gift cards when: (i) the gift card is redeemed by the customer; or (ii) the company determines the likelihood of the gift card being redeemed by the customer is remote (gift card breakage) and there is not a legal obligation to remit the unredeemed gift cards to the relevant jurisdiction. the determination of the gift card breakage rate is based upon company-specific historical redemption patterns. gift card breakage is recognized in revenue as the gift cards are used on a pro rata basis over a six-month period beginning at the date of the gift card sale and is included in revenue in the consolidated statement of income and comprehensive income. the company has determined that 4% of gift card sales will not be redeemed and will be retained by the company. breakage recognized during the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 was $3,624, $4,226 and $3,146, respectively.
cash and cash equivalents the company considers all highly liquid investment instruments purchased with an initial maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. the company maintains cash and cash equivalent balances with financial institutions that exceed federally-insured limits.  the company has not experienced any losses related to these balances and believes the risk to be minimal.
accounts receivable accounts receivable primarily consists of receivables from third party gift card distributors, tenant improvement receivables, vendor rebates, receivables arising from the normal course of business, and payroll-related tax receivables. the allowance for doubtful accounts is the company's best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in the company's existing accounts receivable based on a specific review of account balances. account balances are charged against the allowance after all means of collection have been exhausted and the potential for recoverability is considered remote.     inventory inventory, consisting principally of food, beverages, and supplies, is valued at the lower of first-in, first-out cost or net realizable value. certain key ingredients (beef, pork, chicken, beans, rice, sour cream, cheese, and tortillas) are purchased from a small number of suppliers.
investments investments classified as "trading" securities are carried at fair value with any unrealized gain or loss being recorded in the consolidated statement of income and comprehensive income. investments classified as "available-for-sale" are carried at fair market value with unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, included as a component of other comprehensive income (loss). held-to-maturity securities are carried at amortized cost. the company recognizes impairment charges on its investments in the consolidated statement of income and comprehensive income when management believes the decline in the fair value of the investment is other-than-temporary.
leasehold improvements, property and equipment leasehold improvements, property and equipment are recorded at cost. internal costs directly associated with the acquisition, development and construction of a restaurant are capitalized and were $8,076, $9,554 and $7,756 for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. expenditures for major renewals and improvements are capitalized while expenditures for minor replacements, maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the lease term, which generally includes reasonably assured option periods, or the estimated useful lives of the assets. upon retirement or disposal of assets, the accounts are relieved of cost and accumulated depreciation and any related gain or loss is reflected in loss on disposal and impairment of assets in the consolidated statement of income and comprehensive income.
leasehold improvements and buildings   3-20 years furniture and fixtures                  4-7 years equipment                              3-10 years goodwill goodwill represents the excess of cost over fair value of net assets of the business acquired. goodwill is not subject to amortization, but instead is tested for impairment at least annually, and the company is required to record any necessary impairment adjustments. impairment is measured as the excess of the carrying value over the fair value of the goodwill. based on the company's analysis, no impairment charges were recognized on goodwill for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014.
other assets other assets consist primarily of restricted cash assets of $28,490 and $22,572 as of december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, a rabbi trust as described further in note 7. "employee benefit plans," transferable liquor licenses which are carried at the lower of fair value or cost, and rental deposits related to leased properties. restricted cash assets are primarily insurance-related restricted trust assets.
impairment of long-lived assets long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. for the purpose of reviewing restaurant assets to be held and used for potential impairment, assets are grouped together at the market level, or in the case of a potential relocation or closure, at the restaurant level. the company manages its restaurants as a group with significant common costs and promotional activities; as such, an individual restaurant's cash flows are not generally independent of the cash flows of others in a market. recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset. during the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, an aggregate impairment charge of $17,394, $6,675 and $0, respectively, was recognized in loss on disposal and impairment of assets in the consolidated statement of income and comprehensive income.
impairment charges recognized during the year ended december 31, 2016 resulted primarily from the company's determination that its shophouse southeast asian kitchen restaurants were impaired and the recognition of a non-cash impairment charge of $14,505 ($8,014 net of tax), representing substantially all of the value of long-lived assets of shophouse. the decision to impair the assets was based on an analysis of each restaurant's past and present operating performance, including a significant change from comparable restaurant sales increases to decreases, and projected future cash flows expected to be generated by the restaurant assets. the company has decided not to invest further in developing and growing the shophouse brand and is pursuing strategic alternatives. during the year ended december 31, 2015, the impairment charges resulted from an internally developed software program that the company chose not to implement and the related hardware, the discontinued use of certain kitchen equipment from the company's restaurants, as well as restaurant relocations. the fair value of restaurants, including shophouse, was determined using level 3 inputs (unobservable inputs) based on a discounted cash flows method.
income taxes the company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities at enacted income tax rates for the temporary differences between the financial reporting bases and the tax bases of its assets and liabilities. any effects of changes in income tax rates or tax laws are included in the provision for income taxes in the period of enactment. the deferred income tax impacts of investment tax credits are recognized as an immediate adjustment to income tax expense. when it is more likely than not that a portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized in the future, the company provides a corresponding valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset. when it is more likely than not that a position will be sustained upon examination by a tax authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information, the company measures the amount of tax benefit from the position and records the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized after settlement with a tax authority. the company's policy is to recognize interest to be paid on an underpayment of income taxes in interest expense and any related statutory penalties in the provision for income taxes in the consolidated statement of income and comprehensive income.
restaurant pre-opening costs pre-opening costs, including rent, wages, benefits and travel for training and opening teams, food and other restaurant operating costs, are expensed as incurred prior to a restaurant opening for business.
insurance liability the company maintains various insurance policies including workers' compensation, employee health, general liability, automobile, and property damage. pursuant to these policies, the company is responsible for losses up to certain limits and is required to estimate a liability that represents the ultimate exposure for aggregate losses below those limits. this liability is based on management's estimates of the ultimate costs to be incurred to settle known claims and, where applicable, claims not reported as of the balance sheet date. the estimated liability is not discounted and is based on a number of assumptions and factors, including historical trends, actuarial assumptions, and economic conditions. if actual trends differ from the estimates, the financial results could be impacted. as of december 31, 2016 and 2015, $35,550 and $28,391, respectively, of the estimated liability was included in accrued payroll and benefits and $13,881 and $11,898, respectively, was included in accrued liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet.
additionally, certain of the company's operating leases contain clauses that provide additional contingent rent based on a percentage of sales greater than certain specified target amounts. the company recognizes contingent rent expense provided the achievement of that target is considered probable.
fair value measurements fair value is the price the company would receive to sell an asset or pay to transfer a liability (exit price) in an orderly transaction between market participants. for assets and liabilities recorded or disclosed at fair value on a recurring basis, the company determines fair value based on the following:
level 1: quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the entity has the ability to access.
level 2: observable inputs other than prices included in level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated with observable market data.
level 3: unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets and liabilities. this includes certain pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies and similar techniques that use significant unobservable inputs.
foreign currency translation the company's international operations generally use the local currency as the functional currency. assets and liabilities are translated at exchange rates in effect as of the balance sheet date. income and expense accounts are translated at the average monthly exchange rates during the year. resulting translation adjustments are recorded as a separate component of other comprehensive income (loss) in the consolidated statement of income and comprehensive income.
recently issued accounting standards and adoption of accounting pronouncements in november 2016, the financial accounting standards board ("fasb") issued accounting standards update ("asu") 2016-18, "statement of cash flows (topic 230)", which provides guidance on the classification of restricted cash to be included with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning of period and end of period total amounts on the statement of cash flows. this pronouncement is effective for reporting periods beginning after december 15, 2017 using a retrospective adoption method and early adoption is permitted. for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, $28,490, $22,572 and $19,889, respectively, of restricted cash would have been included in cash and cash equivalents and changes in the balance excluded from net cash provided by operating activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows if this new guidance had been adopted as of the respective dates.
in march 2016, the fasb issued asu no. 2016-09, "compensation - stock compensation (topic 718)." the pronouncement was issued to simplify the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including income tax consequences, the classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and the classification on the statement of cash flows. this pronouncement is effective for reporting periods beginning after december 15, 2016.  the guidance will be applied either prospectively, retrospectively or using a modified retrospective transition method, depending on the area covered in this update. upon adoption, any future excess tax benefits or deficiencies will be recorded to the provision for income taxes in the consolidated statement of income, instead of additional paid-in capital in the consolidated balance sheet. for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, $1,320, $74,442 and $21,667, respectively, of excess tax benefits were recorded to additional paid-in capital that would have been recorded as a reduction to the provision for income taxes if this new guidance had been adopted as of the respective dates.  additionally, excess tax benefits will be classified as operating activities in the consolidated statement of cash flow instead of in financing activities as required under the current guidance. the company has not selected a transition method, and except as described above, does not expect the provisions of asu 2016-09 to have an impact on the company's consolidated financial position or results of operations.
in february 2016, the fasb issued asu no. 2016-02, "leases (topic 842)." the pronouncement requires the recognition of a liability for lease obligations and a corresponding right-of-use asset on the balance sheet and disclosure of key information about leasing arrangements. this pronouncement is effective for reporting periods beginning after december 15, 2018 using a modified retrospective adoption method.  the company's adoption of asu no. 2016-02 will have a significant impact on its consolidated balance sheet as it will record material assets and obligations for current operating leases. the company is evaluating the impact that adoption will have on its consolidated statement of income.

3.  investments as of december 31, 2016 and 2015, the company's investments consisted of u.s. treasury notes with maturities up to approximately two years and were classified as available-for-sale.  fair market value of u.s. treasury notes is measured on a recurring basis based on level 1 inputs (level inputs are described in note 1 under "fair value measurements").
the company designates the appropriate classification of its investments at the time of purchase based upon the intended holding period. during the year ended december 31, 2015, the company transferred the classification of its investments from held-to-maturity to available-for-sale due to anticipated liquidity needs related to increased repurchases of shares of the company's common stock. the carrying value of held-to-maturity securities transferred to available-for-sale during the year ended december 31, 2015 was $1,040,850 and the fair market value of those securities was determined to be $1,038,138, resulting in an unrealized holding loss of $2,712.  as a result, the company recorded $2,468 ($1,522, net of tax) of unrealized holding losses in other comprehensive income (loss), and an other-than-temporary impairment charge of $244 in interest and other income (expense), in the consolidated statement of income and comprehensive income.

actual taxes paid for each tax period were less than the current tax expense due to the excess tax benefit on stock-based compensation of $1,320, $74,442, and $21,667 during the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively.

the 2016 effective tax rate was higher due to a higher state tax rate, not qualifying for the federal research and development tax credit in 2016, and non-deductible items on overall lower pre-tax operating income. additionally, 2014 included a benefit from filing the 2013 tax returns, which included a non-recurring change in the estimate of usable employer credits resulting in a lower effective tax rate than 2015.
deferred income tax liabilities are taxes the company expects to pay in future periods. similarly, deferred income tax assets are recorded for expected reductions in taxes payable in future periods. deferred income taxes arise because of the differences in the book and tax bases of certain assets and liabilities. deferred income tax liabilities and assets consist of the following:

increase resulting from current year tax position         435             2,032             1,342
during the year ending december 31, 2016, $430 of interest was accrued for uncertain tax positions. the company is open to federal and state tax audits until the applicable statutes of limitations expire. tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. the company is no longer subject to u.s. federal tax examinations by tax authorities for tax years before 2013. for the majority of states where the company has a significant presence, it is no longer subject to tax examinations by tax authorities for tax years before 2013.  as of december 31, 2016, the company had cumulative gross foreign net operating losses of $36,464, which have no expiration date.
5. shareholders' equity through december 31, 2016, the company announced authorizations by its board of directors of the expenditure of an aggregate of up to $2,100,000 to repurchase shares of the company's common stock. on january 10, 2017, the company announced that its board of directors authorized the expenditure of up to an additional $100,000 to repurchase shares of its common stock. under the remaining repurchase authorization, shares may be purchased from time to time in open market transactions, subject to market conditions.
during 2016, 2015, and 2014, shares of common stock were netted and surrendered as payment for minimum statutory tax withholding obligations in connection with the exercise and vesting of outstanding stock awards. shares surrendered by the participants in accordance with the applicable award agreements and plan are deemed repurchased by the company but are not part of publicly announced share repurchase programs.
6. stock based compensation the company issues shares pursuant to the amended and restated chipotle mexican grill, inc. 2011 stock incentive plan (the "2011 incentive plan"), approved at the annual shareholders' meeting on may 13, 2015. shares issued pursuant to awards granted prior to the 2011 incentive plan were issued subject to previous stock plans that were also approved by shareholders. for purposes of counting the shares remaining available under the 2011 incentive plan, each share issuable pursuant to outstanding full value awards, such as restricted stock units and performance shares, count as two shares used, whereas each share underlying a stock appreciation right or stock option count as one share used. under the 2011 incentive plan, 5,560 shares of common stock have been authorized and reserved for issuance to eligible participants, of which 2,165 represent shares that were authorized for issuance but not issued or subject to outstanding awards at december 31, 2016. the 2011 incentive plan is administered by the compensation committee of the board of directors, which has the authority to select the individuals to whom awards will be granted or to delegate its authority under the plan to make grants (subject to certain legal and regulatory restrictions), to determine the type of awards and when the awards are to be granted, the number of shares to be covered by each award, the vesting schedule and all other terms and conditions of the awards. the exercise price for stock awards granted under the 2011 incentive plan cannot be less than fair market value at the date of grant.
stock only stock appreciation rights ("sosars") generally vest equally over two and three years and expire after seven years. stock-based compensation expense is generally recognized on a straight-line basis for each separate vesting portion. compensation expense related to employees eligible to retire and retain full rights to the awards is recognized over six months which coincides with the notice period. the company has also granted sosars and stock awards with performance vesting conditions and/or market vesting conditions. compensation expense on sosars subject to performance conditions is recognized over the longer of the estimated performance goal attainment period or time vesting period. compensation expense on stock awards subject to performance conditions, which is based on the quantity of awards the company has determined are probable of vesting, is recognized over the longer of the estimated performance goal attainment period or time vesting period. compensation expense is recognized ratably for awards subject to market conditions regardless of whether the market condition is satisfied, provided that the requisite service has been provided. some stock-based compensation awards are made to employees involved in the company's new restaurant development activities, and expense for these awards is recognized as capitalized development and included in leasehold improvements, property and equipment in the consolidated balance sheet.
stock-based compensation expense recognized as capitalized development            946               1,554               1,178

during the year ended december 31, 2014 the company granted 220 sosars that include performance conditions. no sosars that include performance conditions were granted during 2015 or 2016. as of december 31, 2016, 388 sosars that include performance conditions were outstanding, of which 278 awards had met the performance conditions. in addition to time vesting described above, the shares vest upon achieving a targeted cumulative cash flow from operations. the total intrinsic value of options and sosars exercised during the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 was $15,946, $260,466 and $88,245. unearned compensation as of december 31, 2016 was $34,862 for sosar awards, and is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.5 years.
volatility                                                                      32.2   %            30.8   %            33.3   %
the risk-free interest rate is based upon u.s. treasury rates for instruments with similar terms and the expected life assumptions were based on the company's historical data. the company has not paid dividends to date and does not plan to pay dividends in the near future. the volatility assumption was based on the company's historical data and implied volatility.
a summary of non-vested stock award activity under the stock incentive plans is as follows (in thousands, except per share data):
forfeited or cancelled             (74)                       $529.54            -                      $534.55          (1)                      $410.55
at december 31, 2016, 116 of the outstanding non-vested stock awards were subject to performance and/or market conditions, in addition to service vesting conditions. during the first quarter of 2016, the company awarded 73 shares, net of cancellations, that are subject to both service and market vesting conditions. the quantity of shares that will vest may range from 0% to 400% of a targeted number of shares, and will be determined based on the price of the company's common stock reaching certain targets for a consecutive number of days during the three year period starting on the grant date.  if the minimum defined stock price target is not met, then no shares will vest.
during the year ended december 31, 2015, the company awarded 40 performance shares that were subject to service, performance, and market vesting conditions ("the 2015 stock awards"). the quantity of shares that will ultimately vest is determined based on the company's relative performance versus a restaurant industry peer group in the annual average of: revenue growth, net income growth, and total shareholder return. the quantity of shares awarded ranges from 0% to 200% based on the level of achievement of the performance and market conditions. if minimum targets are not met, then no shares will vest. each performance and market measure will be weighted equally, and performance is calculated over a three year period beginning january 1, 2015 through december 31, 2017.
during the year ended december 31, 2013, the company granted 66 stock awards that were subject to both service and performance vesting conditions ("the 2013 stock awards"). the performance conditions for the grant required achievement of specific targets for cumulative cash flow from operations during a three year period. targets were not met and none of the stock awards vested.
during the year ended december 31, 2016, the company adjusted its estimate of 2015 stock awards expected to vest as well as reduced its expense for the 2013 stock awards that did not vest. the impact of these changes resulted in a cumulative reduction to expense of $6,031 ($3,332 net of tax as well as $0.11 to basic and diluted earnings per share) in the year ended december 31, 2016.
the company's measurement of the grant date fair value of the 2015 and 2016 stock awards included using a monte carlo simulation model, which incorporates into the fair-value determination the possibility that the market condition may not be satisfied, using the following assumptions:
volatility                       31.4   %          33.7   %
7. employee benefit plans the company maintains the chipotle mexican grill 401(k) plan (the "401(k) plan"). the company matches 100% of the first 3% of pay contributed by each eligible employee and 50% on the next 2% of pay contributed. employees become eligible to receive matching contributions after one year of service with the company. for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, company matching contributions totaled approximately $5,939, $4,995 and $3,881, respectively. in addition to the traditional pre-tax deferral options, during 2016 the 401(k) plan began offering a roth after-tax deferral option.
the company also maintains the chipotle mexican grill, inc. supplemental deferred investment plan (the "deferred plan") which covers eligible employees of the company. the deferred plan is a non-qualified plan that allows participants to make tax-deferred contributions that cannot be made under the 401(k) plan because of internal revenue service limitations. participants' earnings on contributions made to the deferred plan fluctuate with the actual earnings and losses of a variety of available investment choices selected by the participant. total liabilities under the deferred plan as of december 31, 2016 and 2015 were $17,843 and $18,331, respectively, and are included in other long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet. the company matches 100% of the first 3% of pay contributed by each eligible employee and 50% on the next 2% of pay contributed once the 401(k) contribution limits are reached. for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, the company made deferred compensation matches of $225, $617, and $536 respectively, to the deferred plan.
the company has elected to fund its deferred compensation obligations through a rabbi trust. the rabbi trust is subject to creditor claims in the event of insolvency, but the assets held in the rabbi trust are not available for general corporate purposes. amounts in the rabbi trust are invested in mutual funds, consistent with the investment choices selected by participants in their deferred plan accounts, which are designated as trading securities and carried at fair value, and are included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheet. fair value of mutual funds is measured using level 1 inputs (quoted prices for identical assets in active markets), and the fair values of the investments in the rabbi trust were $17,843 and $18,331 as of december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. the company records trading gains and losses in general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of
income and comprehensive income, along with the offsetting amount related to the increase or decrease in deferred compensation to reflect its exposure of the deferred plan liability.
the company offers an employee stock purchase plan ("espp"). employees become eligible to participate after one year of service with the company and may contribute up to 15% of their base earnings, subject to an annual maximum dollar amount, toward the monthly purchase of the company's common stock. under the espp, 250 shares of common stock have been authorized and reserved for issuances to eligible employees, of which 247 represent shares that were authorized for issuance but not issued at december 31, 2016.  for each of the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, the number of shares issued under the espp were less than 1.
8. leases the company generally operates its restaurants in leased premises. lease terms for traditional shopping center or building leases generally include combined initial and option terms of 20-25 years. ground leases generally include combined initial and option terms of 30-40 years. the option terms in each of these leases are typically in five-year increments. typically, the lease includes rent escalation terms every five years including fixed rent escalations, escalations based on inflation indexes, and fair market value adjustments. certain leases contain contingent rental provisions that include a fixed base rent plus an additional percentage of the restaurant's sales in excess of stipulated amounts. the leases generally provide for the payment of common area maintenance, property taxes, insurance and various other use and occupancy costs by the company. in addition, the company is the lessee under non-cancelable leases covering certain offices.
the company has six sales and leaseback transactions. these transactions do not qualify for sale leaseback accounting because of the company's deemed continuing involvement with the buyer-lessor due to fixed price renewal options, which results in the transaction being recorded under the financing method. under the financing method, the assets remain on the consolidated balance sheet and the proceeds from the transactions are recorded as a financing liability.  a portion of lease payments are applied as payments of deemed principal and imputed interest. the deemed landlord financing liability was $2,854 and $3,060 as of december 31, 2016, and 2015, respectively, with the current portion of the liability included in accrued liabilities, and the remaining portion included in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet.
9. earnings per share basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during each period. diluted earnings per share ("diluted eps") is calculated using income available to common shareholders divided by diluted weighted-average shares of common stock outstanding during each period. potentially dilutive securities include shares of common stock underlying sosars and non-vested stock awards (collectively "stock awards"). diluted eps considers the impact of potentially dilutive securities except in periods in which there is a loss because the inclusion of the potential common shares would have an anti-dilutive effect. stock awards are excluded from the calculation of diluted eps in the event they are subject to performance conditions or antidilutive. the following stock awards were excluded from the calculation of diluted eps:
stock awards subject to performance conditions                       263            266            385
10. commitments and contingencies purchase obligations the company enters into various purchase obligations in the ordinary course of business, generally of a short term nature. those that are binding primarily relate to commitments for food purchases and supplies, amounts owed under contractor and subcontractor agreements, orders submitted for equipment for restaurants under construction, and marketing initiatives and corporate sponsorships.

miscellaneous    the company is involved in various other claims and legal actions that arise in the ordinary course of business. the company does not believe that the ultimate resolution of these actions will have a material adverse effect on the company's financial position, results of operations, liquidity or capital resources. however, a significant increase in the number of these claims, or one or more successful claims under which the company incurs greater liabilities than the company currently anticipates, could materially and adversely affect the company's business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion together with item 6. "selected financial data" and our consolidated financial statements and related notes included in item 8. "financial statements and supplementary data." the discussion contains forward-looking statements involving risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could cause our results to differ materially from expectations. factors that might cause such differences include those described in item 1a. "risk factors" and elsewhere in this report.  overview steve ells, our founder, chairman and ceo, started chipotle with the idea that food served fast did not have to be a typical fast food experience. today, chipotle continues to offer a focused menu of burritos, tacos, burrito bowls, and salads made from fresh, high-quality raw ingredients, prepared using classic cooking methods and served in an interactive style allowing people to get what they want. chipotle seeks out extraordinary ingredients that are not only fresh, but that are raised responsibly, with respect for the animals, land, and people who produce them. chipotle prepares its food using whole, unprocessed ingredients and without the use of added colors, flavors or other additives typically found in fast food. chipotle opened with a single restaurant in denver in 1993 and as of december 31, 2016, operated 2,250 restaurants.
our focus during 2017 is to return to sales and profitability growth and restore our restaurant economic model.  to do so, we have a renewed focus on ensuring that every guest in every one of our restaurants is provided with an excellent customer experience.
2016 highlights and trends operating results. our sales and profitability were adversely impacted throughout 2016 as a result of a number of food-borne illness incidents associated with chipotle restaurants in as many as 15 states, which were widely reported during the fourth quarter of 2015 and the first quarter of 2016.  our comparable restaurant sales trends have improved sequentially for each quarter during 2016 as shown below:
during the full year 2016, our restaurant operating costs (food, beverage and packaging; labor; occupancy; and other operating costs) as a percent of revenue increased 13.3% as compared to the full year 2015. about 6.2% of the increase was attributable to sales deleveraging, while incremental marketing and promotional spend aimed at regaining our customers, combined with additional labor to support the sales promotions, contributed about 3.1% to the increase. additionally, as part of our response to the food-borne illness incidents, we have implemented enhanced food safety procedures in our supply chain and restaurants that have increased our food costs as a percentage of revenue.  we anticipate that the ongoing impact of the enhanced food safety procedures on our food costs as a percentage of revenue will be approximately 1% compared to pre-crisis levels.
restaurant development. as of december 31, 2016, we had 2,250 restaurants in operation, including 2,198 chipotle restaurants throughout the united states, with an additional 29 international chipotle restaurants and 23 non-chipotle restaurants that were consolidated into our financial results.  we opened 240 restaurants in 2016, net of relocations and closures, which contributed $156.2 million to revenue.  in the fourth quarter of 2016, we announced that we were exploring strategic alternatives for our 15 shophouse southeast asian kitchen restaurants, and as a result, we recognized a non-cash impairment charge of $14.5 million.
stock repurchases. in accordance with stock repurchases authorized by our board of directors, we purchased shares of our common stock during 2016 with an aggregate total repurchase price of $813.9 million. as of december 31, 2016, $102.6 million was available for stock repurchases under the authorizations announced on may 11, 2016 and october 25, 2016. on january 10, 2017, we also announced authorizations by our board of directors of up to an additional $100 million in common stock repurchases. we have entered into an agreement with a broker under sec rule 10b5-1(c), authorizing the broker to make open market purchases of common stock from time to time, subject to market conditions. the existing repurchase agreement and the board's authorizations of the repurchases may be modified, suspended, or discontinued at any time.
management and governance enhancements. in the fourth quarter of 2016, we announced that our board of directors named steve ells as our sole chief executive officer, and that monty moran, formerly our co-chief executive officer, had stepped down from his officer and board positions and will retire effective june 9, 2017.  on december 19, 2016, we also announced the appointment of four new members to our board of directors, two of whom were nominated by pershing square capital management, l.p., which, together with its affiliates, we believe to be our largest shareholder.
2017 outlook sales. we are targeting comparable restaurant sales increases in the high single digits for the full year 2017 as comparisons become easier in the first half of 2017, and based on our plans to attract more customers with a variety of marketing activities and improvements to our digital ordering platforms, and by improving the quality of the customer experience we provide in our restaurants.
restaurant operating costs.  we expect to reduce restaurant level operating costs as a percent of revenue for the full year 2017. our expectation is based in part on the increased sales we are anticipating and the resulting leverage in fixed operating costs, but we are forecasting additional improvements as well.  we expect food, beverage and packaging costs to decrease as a percent of revenue due to relief in avocado prices and more efficient food management. we also believe that other operating expenses will decline compared to 2016 as we reduce marketing and promotional spend as a percent of revenue from the elevated levels of 2016, although we still plan for these expenses in 2017 to be above historical levels.
other expense items and restaurant development plans.  we expect that general and administrative expenses will increase in 2017 due to higher non-cash stock-based compensation expense and higher bonuses, although underlying general and administrative expenses for the year should remain relatively consistent with 2016.  the expected increase in stock based compensation is primarily a result of lower expense in 2016 due to an expense reversal for performance-based stock awards that did not vest, as well as higher expense in 2017 due to a planned retention award for non-executive employees and broadening the group of non-executive employees eligible for awards.  we expect to realize cost efficiencies in the development of our restaurants in 2017 by simplifying our restaurant design, and choosing real estate sites, such as end-caps, that can more easily and cost-efficiently be converted into chipotle restaurants.  we intend to open between 195 and 210 restaurants for the full year 2017. most of our 2017 restaurant openings are planned in markets that are proven or already have a chipotle presence established.
tax rates. we expect the 2017 full year effective tax rate to be between 39.0% and 39.5%. however, as discussed in note 1. "description of business and summary of significant accounting policies," included in item 8. "financial statements and supplementary data" the adoption of asu no. 2016-09, "compensation-stock compensation (topic 718)" will subject our tax rate to quarterly volatility from the effect of stock award exercise and vesting activities.     restaurant openings, relocations and closures the following table details restaurant unit data for the years indicated.
food, beverage and packaging costs decreased as a percentage of revenue in 2015 primarily due to the benefit of the nation-wide menu price increases taken in the second quarter of 2014 and relief in dairy and avocado costs. the decrease was partially offset by inflation on beef costs.
labor costs as a percentage of revenue increased in 2016 due primarily to sales deleveraging and wage inflation, partially offset by labor efficiencies resulting from fewer managers and crew in each of our restaurants.  although we incurred additional costs to staff our restaurants for sales promotions during 2016, those incremental costs were offset by the improvement from 2015 when we incurred scheduling inefficiencies as a result of reporting challenges from a system change in early 2015. labor costs increased in dollar terms for the year ended december 31, 2016 due to staffing needs for new restaurants.
occupancy costs as a percentage of revenue increased in 2016 primarily due to lower average restaurant sales on a partially fixed-cost base. occupancy costs increased in dollar terms for the year ended december 31, 2016, primarily due to costs associated with new restaurants.
other operating costs include, among other items, marketing and promotional costs, bank and credit card fees, and restaurant utilities and maintenance costs. other operating costs increased as a percentage of revenue in 2016 due primarily to higher marketing and promotional expense as well as sales deleveraging. we increased our marketing and promotional spend in an effort to regain customers, which contributed $98.2 million to the increase.
other operating costs increased as a percentage of revenue in 2015 due primarily to a change in the classification of kitchen gloves out of food, beverage, and packaging costs beginning in 2015, and higher marketing and promotional costs.
the increase in general and administrative expenses in dollar terms for 2016 primarily resulted from increased legal expense, higher payroll costs as we grew, and expenses associated with our biennial all managers' conference held during 2016, partially offset by lower bonus expense and travel costs.
the decrease in general and administrative expenses in dollar terms in 2015 primarily resulted from decreased non-cash stock-based compensation expense, lower bonus expense, and decreased expense associated with our biennial all managers' conference held during 2014, partially offset by higher payroll costs as we grew.  stock-based compensation expense decreased $39.4 million primarily due to a change in the structure of our executive compensation, as well as a decrease in our estimate of non-vested performance stock awards that we expect to vest.
depreciation and amortization increased as a percentage of revenue in 2016 due to sales deleveraging. the increase in dollar terms was due primarily to depreciation and amortization costs associated with new restaurants.
loss on disposal and impairment of assets increased in 2016 primarily due to a non-cash impairment charge of $14.5 million to write-down substantially all of the value of the long-lived assets of our shophouse restaurants.
loss on disposal of assets increased in 2015 due to impairment charges resulting from an internally developed software program that we chose not to implement and related hardware, the discontinued use of certain kitchen equipment, as well as restaurant relocations.
the 2016 effective tax rate was higher due to a higher state tax rate, not qualifying for the federal research and development tax credit in 2016, and non-deductible items on overall lower pre-tax operating income. the 2015 effective tax rate was higher than 2014 due primarily to 2014 benefiting from filing the 2013 tax returns, which included a non-recurring change in the estimate of usable employer credits.
quarterly financial data/seasonality the following table presents data from the consolidated statement of income and comprehensive income for each of the eight quarters in the period ended december 31, 2016. the operating results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results for any subsequent quarter. results from the quarter ended december 31, 2015 and for each quarter in 2016 include the impact of the food-borne illness incidents described elsewhere in this report.
seasonal factors cause our profitability to fluctuate from quarter to quarter. historically, our average daily restaurant sales and net income are lower in the first and fourth quarters due, in part, to the holiday season and because fewer people eat out during periods of inclement weather (the winter months) than during periods of mild or warm weather (the spring, summer and fall months). other factors also have a seasonal effect on our results. for example, restaurants located near colleges and universities generally do more business during the academic year. seasonal factors, however, might be moderated or outweighed by other factors that may influence our quarterly results, such as the adverse publicity that we saw beginning in the fourth quarter of 2015 around food-borne illness incidents associated with our restaurants, as well as fluctuations in food or packaging costs or the timing of menu price increases. the number of trading days in a quarter can also affect our results, although, on an overall annual basis, changes in trading days do not have a significant impact.     our quarterly results are also affected by other factors such as the amount and timing of non-cash stock-based compensation expense, the number of new restaurants opened in a quarter, anticipated and unanticipated events. new restaurants typically have lower margins following opening as a result of the expenses associated with opening new restaurants and their operating inefficiencies in the months immediately following opening. in addition, unanticipated events also impact our results. accordingly, results for a particular quarter are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for any other quarter or for any year.
liquidity and capital resources our primary liquidity and capital requirements are for new restaurant construction, working capital and general corporate needs. as of december 31, 2016, we had a cash and short-term investment balance of $417.7 million that we expect to utilize, along with cash flow from operations, to provide capital to support the growth of our business (primarily through opening restaurants), to repurchase additional shares of our common stock subject to market conditions, to maintain our existing restaurants and for general corporate purposes. as of december 31, 2016, there was $102.6 million remaining available under repurchase authorizations previously approved by our board of directors.  on january 10, 2017 we announced authorizations by our board of directors of up to an additional $100 million in common stock repurchases.  we also have a long term investments balance of $125.1 million, which consists of u.s. treasury notes with maturities of up to 15 months. we believe that cash from operations, together with our cash and investment balances, will be enough to meet ongoing capital expenditures, working capital requirements and other cash needs for the foreseeable future.
we haven't required significant working capital because customers generally pay using cash or credit and debit cards and because our operations do not require significant receivables, nor do they require significant inventories due, in part, to our use of various fresh ingredients. in addition, we generally have the right to pay for the purchase of food, beverage and supplies some time after the receipt of those items, generally within ten days, thereby reducing the need for incremental working capital to support our growth.
one of our primary uses of cash is in new restaurant development. our total capital expenditures for 2016 were $258.8 million, and we expect to incur capital expenditures of about $224 million in 2017, of which about $170 million relates to our construction of new restaurants before any reductions for landlord reimbursements, and the remainder primarily relates to restaurant reinvestments, information technology and infrastructure initiatives, and other corporate expenses. our expected reduction in capital expenditures is due to fewer planned restaurant openings and lower average investment costs per restaurant in 2017.  in 2016, we spent on average about $880,000 in development and construction costs per restaurant, or about $790,000 net of landlord reimbursements of $90,000.  for new restaurants to be opened in 2017, we anticipate average development costs will decrease due to cost savings initiatives.
(1)we enter into various purchase obligations in the ordinary course of business. those that are binding primarily relate to amounts owed for orders related to produce and other ingredients and supplies, construction contractor and subcontractor agreements, orders submitted for equipment for restaurants under construction, and marketing initiatives and corporate sponsorships.
the majority of our restaurants and administrative office leases are non-cancelable obligations. our leases generally have initial terms of either five to ten years with two or more five-year extensions, for end-cap and in-line restaurants, or 10 to 15 years with several five-year extensions, for free-standing restaurants. our leases generally require us to pay a proportionate share of real estate taxes, insurance, common charges and other operating costs. some restaurant leases provide for contingent rental payments based on sales thresholds, although we generally do not expect to pay significant contingent rent on these properties based on the thresholds in those leases.
inflation the primary areas of our operations affected by inflation are food, labor, healthcare costs, fuel, utility costs, materials used in the construction of our restaurants, and insurance. although a significant majority of our crew members make more than the federal and applicable state and local minimum wage, increases in the applicable federal or state minimum wage may have an impact on our labor costs by causing wage inflation above the minimum wage level. additionally, many of our leases require us to pay property taxes, maintenance, utilities and insurance, all of which are generally subject to inflationary increases. in the past we have largely been able to offset inflationary increases with menu price increases. there have been, and there may be in the future, delays in implementing such menu price increases. if we do raise menu prices in the future, general competitive pressures may limit our ability to completely recover cost increases attributable to inflation.  critical accounting estimates we describe our significant accounting policies in note 1. "description of business and summary of significant accounting policies" and note 6. "stock based compensation" of our consolidated financial statements included in item 8. "financial statements and supplementary data." critical accounting estimates are those that we believe are both significant and that require us to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often because we need to estimate the effect of inherently uncertain matters. we base our estimates and judgments on historical experiences and various other factors that we believe to be appropriate under the circumstances. actual results may differ from these estimates, and we might obtain different estimates if we used different assumptions or factors. we believe that of our critical accounting estimates, the following involve a higher degree of judgement and subjectivity:
leases we lease nearly all of our restaurant locations. our leases typically contain escalating rentals over the lease term as well as optional renewal periods. we have estimated that our lease term, including reasonably assured renewal periods, is the lesser of the lease term or 20 years.  we account for our leases by recognizing rent expense on a straight-line basis over the reasonably assured lease term. the majority of our leasehold improvements are also depreciated over the reasonably assured lease term.  if the estimate of our reasonably assured lease term was changed, our depreciation and rent expense could differ materially. stock-based compensation we recognize compensation expense for equity awards over the vesting period based on the award's fair value. we use the black-scholes valuation model to determine the fair value of our stock-only stock appreciation rights, or sosars, and we use the monte carlo simulation model to determine the fair value of stock awards that contain market conditions. both of these models require assumptions to be made regarding our stock price volatility, the expected life of the award and expected dividend rates. the volatility assumption was based on our historical data and implied volatility, and the expected life assumptions were based on our historical data. similarly, the compensation expense of performance share awards, and sosars with performance-based vesting conditions is based in part on the estimated probability of our achieving levels of performance associated with particular levels of payout for performance shares and with vesting for performance sosars. we determine the probability of achievement of future levels of performance by comparing the relevant performance level with our internal estimates of future performance. those estimates are based on a number of assumptions, and different assumptions may have resulted in different conclusions regarding the probability of our achieving future levels of performance relevant to the payout levels for the awards. had we arrived at different assumptions of stock price volatility or expected lives of our sosars, or different assumptions regarding the probability of our achieving future levels of performance with respect to performance share awards and performance sosars, our stock-based compensation expense and results of operations could have been different. awards that contain service, performance and market conditions ultimately vest based on chipotle's relative performance versus a restaurant industry peer group in the annual averages of revenue growth, net income growth, and total shareholder return. our estimates of chipotle's future performance and the future performance of the restaurant industry peer group are assumptions that involve a high degree of subjectivity. if we had arrived at different assumptions for revenue growth or net income for chipotle or the peer group, our stock-based compensation expense and results of operations could have been different.     insurance liability we maintain various insurance policies for workers' compensation, general liability and auto damage with varying deductibles as high as $1 million per incident, and for property which generally has a $1.5 million per incident deductible. we are self-insured for employee health but have third party insurance coverage to limit exposure to these claims. we record a liability that represents our estimated cost of claims incurred and unpaid as of the balance sheet date. our estimated liability is not discounted and is based on a number of assumptions and factors, including historical trends, actuarial assumptions and economic conditions, and is closely monitored and adjusted when warranted by changing circumstances. our history of claims experience is relatively short and our significant growth during most of our operating history could affect the accuracy of estimates based on historical experience. if a greater amount of claims occurs compared to what we have estimated, or if medical costs increase beyond what we expected, our accrued liabilities might not be sufficient and we may be required to record additional expense. actual claims experience could also be more favorable than estimated, which would result in expense reductions. unanticipated changes may produce materially different amounts of expense than that reported under these programs. the total estimated insurance liabilities as of december 31, 2016 were $49.4 million.
reserves/contingencies for litigation and other matters we are involved in various claims and legal actions that arise in the ordinary course of business. these actions are subject to many uncertainties, and we cannot predict the outcomes with any degree of certainty. consequently, we were unable to estimate the ultimate aggregate amount of monetary liability or financial impact with respect to these matters as of december 31, 2016. although we have recorded liabilities related to a number of legal actions, our estimates used to determine the amount of these liabilities may not be accurate, and there are other legal actions for which we have not recorded a liability.  as a result, in the event legal actions for which we have not accrued a liability or for which our accrued liabilities are not accurate are resolved, such resolution may affect our operating results and cash flows.
item  7a.quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk  commodity price risks we are exposed to commodity price risks. many of the ingredients we use to prepare our food, our packaging materials, as well as utilities to run our restaurants are commodities or ingredients that are affected by the price of other commodities, exchange rates, foreign demand, weather, seasonality, production, availability and other factors outside our control. we work closely with our suppliers and use a mix of forward pricing protocols under which we agree with our supplier on fixed prices for deliveries at some time in the future, fixed pricing protocols under which we agree on a fixed price with our supplier for the duration of that protocol, and formula pricing protocols under which the prices we pay are based on a specified formula related to the prices of the goods, such as spot prices. however, a majority of the dollar value of goods purchased by us is effectively at spot prices. generally our pricing protocols with suppliers can remain in effect for periods ranging from one to 24 months, depending on the outlook for prices of the particular ingredient. in several cases, we have minimum purchase obligations. we've tried to increase, where necessary, the number of suppliers for our ingredients, which we believe can help mitigate pricing volatility, and we follow industry news, trade issues, exchange rates, foreign demand, weather, crises and other world events that may affect our ingredient prices. increases in ingredient prices could adversely affect our results if we choose for competitive or other reasons not to increase menu prices at the same rate at which ingredient costs increase, or if menu price increases result in customer resistance. changing interest rates we are also exposed to interest rate risk through fluctuations of interest rates on our investments. changes in interest rates affect the interest income we earn, and therefore impact our cash flows and results of operations. as of december 31, 2016, we had $500.5 million in investments and interest-bearing cash accounts, including insurance-related restricted trust accounts classified in other assets, and $37.6 million in accounts with an earnings credit we classify as interest income, which combined earned a weighted average interest rate of 0.71%.  foreign currency exchange risk a portion of our operations consist of activities outside of the u.s. and we have currency risk on the transactions in other currencies and translation adjustments resulting from the conversion of our international financial results into the u.s. dollar. however, a substantial majority of our operations and investment activities are transacted in the u.s. and therefore our foreign currency risk is not material at this date.

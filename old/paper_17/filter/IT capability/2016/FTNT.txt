item 1a. risk factors investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. investors should carefully consider the following risks and all other information contained in this annual report on form 10-k, including our consolidated financial statements and the related notes, before investing in our common stock. the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of, or that we currently believe are not material, also may become important factors that affect us. if any of the following risks materialize, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially harmed. in that case, the trading price of our common stock could decline substantially, and investors may lose some or all of their investment.
•   the timing of shipments, which may depend on many factors such as inventory levels, logistics, shipping delays, our ability to ship new products on schedule and to accurately forecast inventory requirements, and potential delays in the manufacturing process;
•   the effectiveness of our sales organization, generally or in a particular geographic region, and the time it takes for our sales personnel to reach productivity;
•   the timing and level of our investments in sales and marketing, and the impact of such investments on our operating expenses and operating margin, and on the productivity and effectiveness of execution of our sales and marketing teams;
•   the timing of revenue recognition for our sales, which may be affected by both the mix of sales by our "sell-in" versus our "sell-through" channel partners, and the accuracy and timing of point-of-sale reporting by our "sell-through" channel partners, which impacts our ability to recognize revenue;
•   the level of perceived threats to network security, which may fluctuate from period to period;
•   changes in the growth rate of the network security markets;
•   the timing and success of new product and service introductions by us or our competitors, or any other change in the competitive landscape of our industry, including consolidation among our competitors, partners, or end-customers;
•   the deferral of orders from distributors, resellers or end-customers in anticipation of new products or product enhancements announced by us or our competitors;
•   compliance with existing laws and regulations that are applicable to our ability to conduct business with the public sector;
•   the impact of cloud-based platforms on the timing of our revenue recognition, billings and free cash flow;
•   decisions by potential end-customers to purchase network security solutions from newer technology providers, from larger, more established security vendors or from their primary network equipment vendors;
•   price competition and increased competitiveness in our market;
•   changes in circumstances and challenges in business conditions, including decreased demand, which may negatively impact our channel partners' ability to sell the current inventory they hold and negatively impact their future purchases of products from us;
•   increased demand for cloud-based services and the uncertainty associated with transitioning to providing such services;
•   increased expenses, unforeseen liabilities or write-downs and any impact on results of operations from any acquisition consummated;
•   our channel partners having insufficient financial resources to withstand changes and challenges in business conditions;
•   disruptions in our channel or termination of our relationship with important channel partners;
•   insolvency, credit or other difficulties confronting our key suppliers and channel partners, which could affect their ability to purchase or pay for products and services and which could disrupt our supply or distribution chain;
•   policy changes enacted and uncertainty with respect to immigration laws, trade policy, foreign imports and tax laws related to international commerce;
•   political, economic and social instability;
•   general economic conditions, both in domestic and foreign markets;
•   future accounting pronouncements or changes in our accounting policies, such as changes in the revenue recognition standards or accounting for leases, as well as the significant costs that may be incurred to adopt and comply with these new pronouncements;
•   legislative or regulatory changes, such as with respect to privacy, information and cybersecurity, exports, the environment and applicable accounting standards.
any one of the factors above or the cumulative effect of some of the factors referred to above may result in significant fluctuations in our quarterly financial and other operating results. this variability and unpredictability could result in our failing to meet our internal operating plan or the expectations of securities analysts or investors for any period. if we fail to meet or exceed such expectations for these or any other reasons, the market price of our shares could fall substantially and we could face costly lawsuits, including securities class action suits. in addition, a significant percentage of our operating expenses are fixed in nature over the near term. accordingly, in the event of revenue shortfalls, we are generally unable to mitigate the negative impact on margins in the short term.
adverse economic conditions or reduced information technology spending may adversely impact our business.
our business depends on the overall demand for information technology and on the economic health of our current and prospective customers. in addition, the purchase of our products is often discretionary and may involve a significant commitment of capital and other resources. weak global economic conditions and spending environments, weak economic conditions in certain geographies, or a reduction in information technology spending regardless of macro-economic conditions, could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations in a number of ways, including longer sales cycles, lower prices for our products and services, higher default rates among our channel partners, reduced unit sales and slower or declining growth.
billings, revenue and free cash flow growth may slow, or we may experience a decrease in billings, revenue and free cash flow for a number of reasons, including a slowdown in demand for our products or services, a shift in demand from products to services, increased competition, a decrease in the growth of our overall market or softness in demand in certain geographies or industry verticals, such as the service provider industry, and our failure for any reason to continue to capitalize on growth opportunities and due to other risks identified in the risk factors described in this periodic report. our expenses as a percentage of total revenue may be higher than expected if our revenue is lower than expected and, if our investments in sales and marketing and other functional areas do not result in expected billings and revenue growth, we may experience margin declines and may not be able to sustain profitability in future periods if we fail to increase billings, revenue or deferred revenue, do not appropriately manage our cost structure and free cash flow or encounter unanticipated liabilities. any failure by us to maintain profitability, maintain our margins and continue our billings, revenue and free cash flow growth could cause the price of our common stock to materially decline.
we rely significantly on revenue from fortiguard security subscription and forticare technical support services which may decline, and because we recognize revenue from fortiguard security subscription and forticare technical support services over the term of the relevant service period, downturns or upturns in sales of fortiguard security subscription and forticare technical support services are not immediately reflected in full in our operating results.
our fortiguard security subscription and forticare technical support services revenue has historically accounted for a significant percentage of our total revenue. revenue from the sale of new, or from the renewal of existing, fortiguard security subscription and forticare technical support services contracts may decline and fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including fluctuations in purchases of fortigate appliances, changes in the sales mix between products and services, end-customers' level of satisfaction with our products and services, the prices of our products and services, the prices of products and services offered by our competitors, reductions in our customers' spending levels and the timing of revenue recognition with respect to these arrangements. if our sales of new, or renewals of existing fortiguard security subscription and forticare technical support services contracts decline, our revenue and revenue growth may decline and our business could suffer. in addition, in the event significant customers require payment terms for fortiguard security subscription or forticare technical support services in arrears or for shorter periods of time than annually, such as monthly or quarterly, this may negatively impact our billings and revenue. furthermore, we recognize fortiguard security subscription and forticare technical support services revenue monthly over the term of the relevant service period, which is typically from one to three years, and in some instances has been as long as five years. as a result, much of the fortiguard security subscription and forticare technical support services revenue we report each quarter is the recognition of deferred revenue from fortiguard security subscription and forticare technical support services contracts entered into during previous quarters or years. consequently, a decline in new or renewed fortiguard security subscription or forticare technical support services contracts in any one quarter will not be fully reflected in revenue in that quarter but will negatively affect our revenue in future quarters. accordingly, the effect of significant downturns in sales of new, or renewals of existing, fortiguard security subscription or forticare technical support services is not reflected in full in our statements of operations until future periods. our fortiguard security subscription and forticare technical support services revenue also makes it difficult for us to rapidly increase our revenue through additional service sales in any period, as revenue from new and renewal support services contracts must be recognized over the applicable service period.
we generate a majority of revenue from sales to distributors, resellers and end-customers outside of the u.s., and we are therefore subject to a number of risks associated with international sales and operations.
we market and sell our products throughout the world and have established sales offices in many parts of the world. our international sales have represented a majority of our total revenue in recent periods. therefore, we are subject to risks associated with having worldwide operations. we are also subject to a number of risks typically associated with international sales and operations, including:
•   economic or political instability in foreign markets;
•   costs of compliance with foreign policies, laws and regulations and the risks and costs of non-compliance with such policies, laws and regulations;
•   costs of complying with u.s. or other foreign laws and regulations for foreign operations, including the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act, the united kingdom ("uk") bribery act 2010, import and export control laws, tariffs, trade barriers and economic sanctions;
•   other regulatory or contractual limitations on our ability to sell our products in certain foreign markets, and the risks and costs of non-compliance;
•   heightened risks of unfair or corrupt business practices in certain geographies and of improper or fraudulent sales or sales-related arrangements that could disrupt the sales team through terminations of employment or otherwise, and may adversely impact financial results as compared to those already reported or forecasted and result in restatements of financial statements and irregularities in financial statements;
•   our ability to effectively implement and maintain adequate internal controls to properly manage our international sales and operations;
•   the potential for political unrest, changes and uncertainty, and for terrorism, hostilities, war or natural disasters;
product and service sales and employee and contractor matters may be subject to foreign governmental regulations, which vary substantially from country to country. further, we may be unable to keep up-to-date with changes in government requirements as they change over time. failure to comply with these regulations could result in adverse effects to our business. in many foreign countries, it is common for others to engage in business practices that are prohibited by our internal policies and procedures or u.s. regulations applicable to us. although we implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws and policies, there can be no assurance that all of our employees, contractors, channel partners and agents will comply with these laws and policies. violations of laws or key control policies by our employees, contractors, channel partners or agents could result in litigation, regulatory action, costs of investigation, delays in revenue recognition, delays in financial reporting, financial reporting misstatements, fines, penalties, or the prohibition of the importation or
an important part of our growth strategy is to increase sales of our products to large enterprises and medium-sized businesses, service providers and government organizations. while we have increased sales in recent periods to large and medium-sized enterprises and service providers, our sales volume varies by quarter. we also have experienced less traction selling to certain government organizations and there can be no assurance that we will be successful selling to these customers. sales to these organizations involve risks that may not be present, or that are present to a lesser extent, with sales to smaller entities. these risks include:
•   increased competition from competitors that traditionally target large enterprises and medium-sized businesses, service providers and government organizations and that may already have purchase commitments from those end-customers;
•   unanticipated changes in the capital resources or purchasing behavior of large end-customers, including changes in the volume and frequency of their purchases and changes in the mix of products and services and related payment terms;
large enterprises and medium-sized businesses, service providers and government organizations often undertake a significant evaluation process that results in a lengthy sales cycle, in some cases longer than 12 months. although we have a channel sales model, our sales representatives typically engage in direct interaction with end-customers, along with our distributors and resellers, in connection with sales to large and medium-sized end-customers. we may spend substantial time, effort and money in our sales efforts without being successful in producing any sales. in addition, product purchases by large enterprises and medium-sized businesses, service providers and government organizations are frequently subject to budget constraints, multiple approvals and unplanned administrative, processing and other delays. furthermore, service providers represent our largest industry vertical and consolidation or changes in buying behavior by larger customers within this industry could negatively impact our business. large enterprises and medium-sized businesses, service providers and government organizations typically have longer implementation cycles, require greater product functionality and scalability, expect a broader range of services, including design services, demand that vendors take on a larger share of risks, require acceptance provisions that can lead to a delay in revenue recognition, and expect greater payment flexibility from vendors. in addition, large enterprises and medium-sized businesses, service providers and government organizations may require that our products and services be sold differently from how we offer our products and services, which could negatively impact our operating results. our large enterprise and service provider customers may also become more deliberate in their purchases as they plan their next-generation network security architecture, leading them to take more time in making purchasing decisions or to purchase based only on their immediate needs. all these factors can add further risk to business conducted with these customers. in addition, if sales expected from a large and medium-sized end-customer for a particular quarter are not realized in that quarter or at all, our business, operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.
managing inventory of our products and product components is complex. insufficient inventory may result in lost sales opportunities or delayed revenue, while excess inventory may harm our gross margins.
managing our inventory is complex. our channel partners may increase orders during periods of product shortages, cancel orders or not place orders commensurate with our expectations if their inventory is too high, return products or take advantage of price protection (if any is available to the particular partner) or delay orders in anticipation of new products, and accurately forecasting inventory requirements and demand can be challenging. our channel partners also may adjust their
orders in response to the supply of our products and the products of our competitors that are available to them and in response to seasonal fluctuations in end-customer demand. furthermore, if the time required to manufacture or ship certain products increases for any reason, inventory shortfalls could result. management of our inventory is further complicated by the significant number of different products and models that we sell.
in addition, for those channel partners that have rights of return, inventory held by such channel partners affects our results of operations. our inventory management systems and related supply chain visibility tools may be inadequate to enable us to effectively manage inventory. inventory management remains an area of focus as we balance the need to maintain inventory levels that are sufficient to ensure competitive lead times against the risk of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements, or excess inventory levels. if we ultimately determine that we have excess inventory, we may have to reduce our prices and write-down inventory, which in turn could result in lower gross margins. alternatively, insufficient inventory levels may lead to shortages that result in delayed revenue or loss of sales opportunities altogether as potential end-customers turn to competitors' products that are readily available. for example, we have in the past experienced inventory shortages and excesses due to the variance in demand for certain products from forecasted amounts. if we are unable to effectively manage our inventory and that of our channel partners, our results of operations could be adversely affected.
we are dependent on the continued services and performance of our senior management, the loss of any of whom could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.
our future performance depends on the continued services and continuing contributions of our senior management to execute on our business plan, and to identify and pursue new opportunities and product innovations. the loss of services of members of senior management, particularly ken xie, our co-founder, chairman and chief executive officer, and michael xie, our co-founder, president and chief technology officer, and any of our senior sales leaders or functional area leaders, could significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our development and strategic objectives. the loss of the services, or distraction, of our senior management for any reason could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
our future success depends, in part, on our ability to continue to attract and retain highly skilled personnel. the loss of the services of any of our key personnel, the inability to attract or retain qualified personnel, or delays in hiring required personnel, particularly in engineering, sales and marketing, may seriously harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. from time to time, we experience turnover in our management-level personnel. none of our key employees has an employment agreement for a specific term, and any of our employees may terminate their employment at any time. our ability to continue to attract and retain highly skilled personnel will be critical to our future success. competition for highly-skilled personnel is frequently intense, especially for qualified employees in network security and especially in the locations where we have a substantial presence and need for highly-skilled personnel, such as the san francisco bay area and vancouver, canada. we may not be successful in attracting, assimilating or retaining qualified personnel to fulfill our current or future needs. also, to the extent we hire personnel from competitors, we may be subject to allegations that they have been improperly solicited or divulged proprietary or other confidential information. changes in immigration laws, including changes to the rules regarding h1-b visas, may also harm our ability to attract personnel from other countries.
although we have a channel sales model, members of our sales organization often engage in direct interaction with our prospective end-customers. therefore, we continue to be substantially dependent on our sales organization to obtain new end-customers and sell additional products and services to our existing end-customers. there is significant competition for sales personnel with the skills and technical knowledge that we require. our ability to grow our revenue depends, in large part, on our success in recruiting, training and retaining sufficient numbers of sales personnel to support our growth and on the effectiveness of those personnel. new hires require substantial training and may take significant time before they achieve full productivity. our recent hires and planned hires may not become productive as quickly as we expect, and we may be unable to hire or retain sufficient numbers of qualified individuals in the markets where we do business or plan to do business. for example, we realigned our sales organization in early 2016 and it has taken more time than we expected to ramp up the productivity of our realigned sales organization, which negatively impacted our revenue growth in the third quarter of 2016 in some regions. furthermore, hiring sales personnel in new countries requires additional setup and upfront costs that we may not recover if the sales personnel fail to achieve full productivity. if our new sales employees do not become fully productive on the timelines that we have projected, our revenue will not increase at anticipated levels and our ability to achieve long term
the sales prices of our products and services may decrease, which may reduce our gross profits and adversely impact our financial results and the trading price of our common stock.
the sales prices for our products and services may decline for a variety of reasons, including competitive pricing pressures, discounts or promotional programs we offer, a change in our mix of products and services and anticipation of the introduction of new products and services. competition continues to increase in the market segments in which we participate, and we expect competition to further increase in the future, thereby leading to increased pricing pressures. larger competitors with more diverse product offerings may reduce the price of products and services that compete with ours in order to promote the sale of other products or services or may bundle them with other products or services. additionally, although we price our products and services worldwide in u.s. dollars, currency fluctuations in certain countries and regions have in the past, and may in the future, negatively impact actual prices that partners and customers are willing to pay in those countries and regions. furthermore, we anticipate that the sales prices and gross profits for our products or services will decrease over product life cycles. we cannot ensure that we will be successful in developing and introducing new offerings with enhanced functionality on a timely basis, or that our product and service offerings, if introduced, will enable us to maintain our prices and gross profits at levels that will allow us to maintain profitability.
as a result of customer-buying patterns and the efforts of our sales force and channel partners to meet or exceed quarterly quotas, we have historically received a substantial portion of each quarter's sales orders and generated a substantial portion of each quarter's billings and revenue during the last two weeks of the quarter. for example, in 2016, the portion of billings during the last two weeks of the quarter was 37%, and, on average over the past eight quarters, our billings during the last two weeks accounted for 35% of aggregate billings for each quarter. if expected orders at the end of any quarter are delayed for any reason, including the failure of anticipated purchase orders to materialize, our logistics partners' inability to ship products prior to quarter-end to fulfill purchase orders received near the end of the quarter, our failure to accurately forecast our inventory requirements and to appropriately manage inventory to meet demand, our inability to release new products on schedule, any failure of our systems related to order review and processing, any delays in shipments due to trade compliance requirements, labor disputes or logistics changes at shipping ports or otherwise, our billings and revenue for that quarter could fall below our expectations or those of securities analysts and investors, resulting in a decline in our stock price.
increased market awareness of our capabilities and products and increased lead generation are essential to our continued growth and our success in all of our markets, particularly for the large enterprise, service provider and government organization market. we have historically had relatively low spending on marketing activities. while we have increased our investments in sales and marketing, it is not clear that these investments will continue to result in increased revenue. if our investments in additional sales personnel or if our marketing programs are not successful in continuing to create market awareness of our company and products and increased lead generation, or if we experience turnover and disruption in our sales and marketing teams, we will not be able to achieve sustained growth, and our business, financial condition and results of operations will be adversely affected.
we rely on third-party channel partners to generate substantially all of our revenue. if our partners fail to perform, our ability to sell our products and services will be limited, and if we fail to optimize our channel partner model going forward, our operating results will be harmed.
a significant portion of our sales is generated through a limited number of distributors, and substantially all of our revenue is generated through sales by our channel partners, including distributors and resellers. we depend upon our channel partners to generate a significant portion of our sales opportunities and manage the sales process. to the extent our channel partners are unsuccessful in selling our products, or we are unable to enter into arrangements with and retain a sufficient number of high-quality channel partners in each of the regions in which we sell products, and if we are unable to keep them motivated to sell our products, our ability to sell our products and operating results will be harmed. the termination of our relationship with any significant channel partner may adversely impact our sales and operating results.
we provide sales channel partners with specific programs to assist them in selling our products and incentivize them to sell our products, but there can be no assurance that these programs will be effective. in addition, our channel partners may be unsuccessful in marketing, selling and supporting our products and services and may purchase more inventory than they can sell. our channel partners generally do not have minimum purchase requirements. some of our channel partners may have insufficient financial resources to withstand changes and challenges in business conditions. in addition, if our channel partners' financial condition or operations weaken it could negatively impact their ability to sell our product and services. our channel partners may also market, sell and support products and services that are competitive with ours, and may devote more resources to the marketing, sales and support of such products. they may also have incentives to promote our competitors' products to the detriment of our own, or they may cease selling our products altogether. we cannot ensure that we will retain these channel partners or that we will be able to secure additional or replacement partners or that existing channel partners will continue to perform. the loss of one or more of our significant channel partners or the failure to obtain and ship a number of large orders each quarter through them could harm our operating results. during 2014, 2015 and 2016, exclusive, which distributed our solutions to a large group of resellers and end-customers, accounted for 15%, 18% and 20% of our total revenue, respectively. in addition, any new sales channel partner will require extensive training and may take several months or more to achieve productivity. our channel partner sales structure could subject us to lawsuits, potential liability and reputational harm if, for example, any of our channel partners misrepresent the functionality of our products or services to end-customers or our channel partners violate laws or our corporate policies. we depend on our global channel partners to comply with applicable legal and regulatory requirements. to the extent that they fail to do so, that could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. if we fail to optimize our channel partner model or fail to manage existing sales channels, our business will be seriously harmed.
actual, possible or perceived defects or vulnerabilities in our products or services, the failure of our products or services to prevent a virus or security breach, or misuse of our products could harm our reputation and divert resources.
because our products and services are complex, they have contained and may contain defects or errors that are not detected until after their commercial release and deployment by our customers. defects or vulnerabilities may impede or block network traffic, cause our products or services to be vulnerable to electronic break-ins or cause them to fail to help secure networks. different customers deploy and use our products in different ways, and certain deployments and usages may subject our products to adverse conditions that may negatively impact the effectiveness and useful lifetime of our products. we cannot ensure that our products will prevent all security threats. because the techniques used by computer hackers to access or sabotage networks change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques. in addition, defects or errors in our fortiguard security subscription updates or our fortigate appliances could result in a failure of our fortiguard security subscription services to effectively update end-customers' fortigate appliances and thereby leave customers vulnerable to attacks. furthermore, our solutions may also fail to detect or prevent viruses, worms or similar threats due to a number of reasons such as the evolving nature of such threats and the continual emergence of new threats that we may fail to add to our fortiguard databases in time to protect our end-customers' networks. our fortiguard or forticare data centers and networks may also experience technical failures and downtime, and may fail to distribute appropriate updates, or fail to meet the increased requirements of our customer base. any such technical failure, downtime or failures in general may temporarily or permanently expose our end-customers' networks, leaving their networks unprotected against the latest security threats.
an actual, possible or perceived security breach or infection of the network of one of our end-customers, regardless of whether the breach is attributable to the failure of our products or services to prevent the security breach, could adversely affect the market's perception of our security products and services and, in some instances, subject us to potential liability that is not contractually limited. we may not be able to correct any security flaws or vulnerabilities promptly, or at all. our products may also be misused by end-customers or third parties who obtain access to our products. for example, our products could be used to censor private access to certain information on the internet. such use of our products for censorship could result in negative press coverage and negatively affect our reputation, even if we take reasonable measures to prevent any improper shipment of our products or if our products are provided by an unauthorized third-party. any actual, possible or perceived defects, errors or vulnerabilities in our products, or misuse of our products, could result in:
•   expenditure of significant financial and product development resources in efforts to analyze, correct, eliminate or work around errors or defects or to address and eliminate vulnerabilities;
•   negative publicity and harm to our reputation; and
•   litigation, regulatory inquiries or investigations that may be costly and harm our reputation and, in some instances, subject us to potential liability that is not contractually limited.
our business has grown over the last several years. we rely heavily on information technology and accounting systems to help manage critical functions such as order processing, revenue recognition, financial forecasts, inventory and supply chain management and trade compliance reviews. certain of these systems were developed by us for our internal use and as such may have a higher risk of failure or not receive the same level of support as systems purchased from and supported by external technology companies. in addition, we have been slow to adopt and implement certain automated functions, which could have a negative impact on our business. for example, a large part of our order processing relies on manual data entry of customer purchase orders received through email and, to a lesser extent, through electronic data interchange from our customers. combined with the fact that we may receive a large amount of our orders in the last few weeks of any given quarter, a significant interruption in our email service or other systems could result in delayed order fulfillment and decreased billings and revenue for that quarter.
to manage any future growth effectively, we must continue to improve and expand our information technology and financial, operating and administrative systems and controls, and continue to manage headcount, capital and processes in an efficient manner. we may not be able to successfully implement requisite improvements to these systems, controls and processes, such as system capacity, access and change management controls, in a timely or efficient manner. our failure to improve our systems and processes, or their failure to operate in the intended manner, whether as a result of the significant growth of our business or otherwise, may result in our inability to manage the growth of our business and to accurately forecast our revenue, expenses and earnings, or to prevent certain losses. moreover, the failure of our systems and processes could undermine our ability to provide accurate, timely and reliable reports on our financial and operating results and could impact the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. in addition, our systems and processes may not prevent or detect all errors, omissions or fraud. our productivity and the quality of our products and services may also be adversely affected if we do not integrate and train our new employees quickly and effectively. any future growth would add complexity to our organization and require effective coordination throughout our organization. failure to manage any future growth effectively could result in increased costs and harm our results of operations.
further, it may be necessary to expand our real estate holdings to meet our projected growing need for office space. we recently approved plans to purchase office buildings in vancouver and ottawa, canada, and we are considering plans to significantly expand our headquarters in sunnyvale, california. these plans will require significant capital expenditure over the next several years and involve certain risks, including impairment charges and acceleration of depreciation, changes in future business strategy that may decrease the need for expansion (such as a decrease in headcount) and, with respect to our potential expansion plans in california, risks related to construction. future changes in growth or fluctuations in cash flow may also negatively impact our ability to pay for these projects. additionally, inaccuracies in our projected capital expenditures could negatively impact our business, operating results and financial condition.
we recently implemented a new erp system. the erp system is critical to our ability to provide important information to our management, obtain and deliver products, provide services and customer support, send invoices and track payments, fulfill contractual obligations, accurately maintain books and records, provide accurate, timely and reliable reports on our financial and operating results and otherwise operate our business. erp system implementations also require transformation of business and financial processes in order to reap the benefits of the erp system; any such transformation involves risks inherent in the conversion to a new computer system, including potential disruption to our normal operations. the implementation and maintenance of the new erp system has required, and will continue to require, the investment of significant financial and human resources. in addition, we may choose to upgrade or expand the functionality of our erp system, leading to additional costs. we may also discover deficiencies in our design or implementation or maintenance of the new erp system that could adversely affect our ability to process orders, ship products, provide services and customer support, send invoices and track payments, fulfill contractual obligations, accurately maintain books and records, provide accurate,
timely and reliable reports on our financial and operating results, or otherwise operate our business. additionally, if the system does not operate as intended, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting could be adversely affected or our ability to assess it adequately could be delayed.
if our estimates or judgments relating to our critical accounting policies are based on assumptions that change or prove to be incorrect, our operating results could fall below expectations of securities analysts and investors, resulting in a decline in our stock price.
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, as provided in "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" in this annual report on form 10-k, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. our operating results may be adversely affected if our assumptions change or if actual circumstances differ from those in our assumptions, which could cause our operating results to fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors, resulting in a decline in our stock price. significant assumptions and estimates used in preparing our consolidated financial statements include those related to revenue recognition and sales return reserves, stock-based compensation expense, valuation of inventory, investments, accounting for business combination, goodwill and other long-lived assets, restructuring, accounting for income taxes, and litigation and settlement costs.
we offer retroactive price protection to certain of our major distributors, and if we fail to balance their inventory with end-customer demand for our products, our allowance for price protection may be inadequate, which could adversely affect our results of operations.
we provide certain of our major distributors with price protection rights for inventories of our products held by them. if we reduce the list price of our products, certain distributors receive refunds or credits from us that reduce the price of such products held in their inventory based upon the new list price. future credits for price protection will depend on the percentage of our price reductions for the products in inventory and our ability to manage the levels of our major distributors' inventories. if future price protection adjustments are higher than expected, our future results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.
we outsource the manufacturing of our security appliance products to contract manufacturing partners and original design manufacturing partners including faraday, k-micro and renesas. our reliance on our third-party manufacturers in asia and elsewhere reduces our control over the manufacturing process, exposing us to risks, including reduced control over quality assurance and product costs, supply and timing. any manufacturing disruption by our third-party manufacturers could impair our ability to fulfill orders. if we are unable to manage our relationships with these third-party manufacturers effectively, or if these third-party manufacturers experience delays, increased manufacturing lead-times, disruptions, capacity constraints or quality control problems in their manufacturing operations, or fail to meet our future requirements for timely delivery, our ability to ship products to our customers could be impaired and our business would be seriously harmed.
these manufacturers fulfill our supply requirements on the basis of individual purchase orders. we have no long-term contracts or arrangements with certain of our third-party manufacturers that guarantee capacity, the continuation of particular payment terms or the extension of credit limits. accordingly, they are not obligated to continue to fulfill our supply requirements, and the prices we are charged for manufacturing services could be increased on short notice. if we are required to change third-party manufacturers, our ability to meet our scheduled product deliveries to our customers would be adversely affected, which could cause the loss of sales and existing or potential customers, delayed revenue or an increase in our costs, which could adversely affect our gross margins. our individual product lines are generally manufactured by only one manufacturing partner. any production or shipping interruptions for any reason, such as a natural disaster, epidemic, capacity shortages, quality problems, or strike or other labor disruption at one of our manufacturing partners or locations or at shipping ports or locations, would severely affect sales of our product lines manufactured by that manufacturing partner. furthermore, manufacturing cost increases for any reason could result in lower gross margins.
our proprietary spu, which is the key to the performance of our appliances, is fabricated by contract manufacturers in foundries operated by umc and tsmc on a purchase order basis, and umc and tsmc do not guarantee any capacity and
could reject orders or could try to increase pricing. accordingly, the foundries are not obligated to continue to fulfill our supply requirements, and due to the long lead time that a new foundry would require, we could suffer temporary or long term inventory shortages of our spu as well as increased costs. our suppliers may also prioritize orders by other companies that order higher volumes or more profitable products. if any of these manufacturers materially delays its supply of asics or specific product models to us, or requires us to find an alternate supplier and we are not able to do so on a timely and reasonable basis, or if these foundries materially increase their prices for fabrication of our asics, our business would be harmed.
in addition, our reliance on third-party manufacturers and foundries limits our control over environmental regulatory requirements such as the hazardous substance content of our products and therefore our ability to ensure compliance with the restriction of hazardous substances directive ("rohs") adopted in the european union (the "eu") and other similar laws. it also exposes us to the risk that certain minerals and metals, known as "conflict minerals," that are contained in our products have originated in the democratic republic of the congo or an adjoining country. as a result of the passage of the dodd-frank wall street reform and consumer protection act of 2010 ("dodd-frank"), the sec adopted disclosure requirements for public companies whose products contain conflict minerals that are necessary to the functionality or production of such products. under these rules, we are required to obtain sourcing data from suppliers, perform supply chain due diligence, and file annually with the sec a specialized disclosure report on form sd covering the prior calendar year. we have incurred and expect to incur additional costs to comply with the rules, including costs related to the determination of the origin, source and chain of custody of the conflict minerals used in our products and the adoption of conflict minerals-related governance policies, processes and controls.  moreover, the implementation of these compliance measures could adversely affect the sourcing, availability and pricing of materials used in the manufacture of our products to the extent that there may be only a limited number of suppliers that are able to meet our sourcing requirements. there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain such materials in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices. we may also encounter customers who require that all of the components of our products be certified as conflict-free. if we are not able to meet customer requirements, such customers may choose to not purchase our products, which could impact our sales and the value of portions of our inventory.
because some of the key components in our products come from limited sources of supply, we are susceptible to supply shortages, long lead times for components, and supply changes, each of which could disrupt or delay our scheduled product deliveries to our customers, result in inventory shortage, or loss of sales and customers, or increase component costs resulting in lower gross margins.
we and our contract manufacturers currently purchase several key parts and components used in the manufacture of our products from limited sources of supply. we are therefore subject to the risk of shortages and long lead times in the supply of these components and the risk that component suppliers discontinue or modify components used in our products. we have in the past experienced, and are currently experiencing, shortages and long lead times for certain components. certain of our limited source components for particular appliances and suppliers of those components include: specific types of cpus from intel, network chips from broadcom, marvell and intel, and memory devices from intel, adata, ocz, samsung and western digital. the introduction by component suppliers of new versions of their products, particularly if not anticipated by us or our contract manufacturers, could require us to expend significant resources to incorporate these new components into our products. in addition, if these suppliers were to discontinue production of a necessary part or component, we would be required to expend significant resources and time in locating and integrating replacement parts or components from another vendor. qualifying additional suppliers for limited source parts or components can be time-consuming and expensive.
our manufacturing partners have experienced long lead times for the purchase of components incorporated into our products. lead times for components may be adversely impacted by factors outside of our control, such as natural disasters and other factors. our reliance on a limited number of suppliers involves several additional risks, including:
•   a potential inability to obtain an adequate supply of required parts or components when required;
•   failure in component quality.
the occurrence of any of these events would be disruptive to us and could seriously harm our business. any interruption or delay in the supply of any of these parts or components, or the inability to obtain these parts or components from alternate sources at acceptable prices and within a reasonable amount of time, would harm our ability to meet our scheduled product deliveries to our distributors, resellers and end-customers. this could harm our relationships with our channel partners and end-customers and could cause delays in shipment of our products and adversely affect our results of operations. in addition, increased component costs could result in lower gross margins.
we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, which could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations.
a significant portion of our operating expenses are incurred outside the u.s. these expenses are denominated in foreign currencies and are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly changes in the euro and canadian dollar and, to a lesser extent, the british pound. additionally, fluctuations in the exchange rate of the canadian dollar may negatively impact our real estate purchase and development plans in vancouver and ottawa. while we are not currently engaged in material hedging activities, we have been hedging currency exposures relating to certain balance sheet accounts through the use of forward exchange contracts. if we stop hedging against any of these risks or if our attempts to hedge against these currency exposures are not successful, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. in addition, our sales contracts are primarily denominated in u.s. dollars and therefore, while substantially all of our revenue is not subject to foreign currency risk, it does not serve as a hedge to our foreign currency-denominated operating expenses. in addition, a strengthening of the u.s. dollar may increase the real cost of our products to our customers outside of the u.s., which may also adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
failure to comply with laws and regulations applicable to our business could subject us to fines and penalties and could also cause us to lose end-customers in the public sector or negatively impact our ability to contract with the public sector.
our business is subject to regulation by various federal, state, local and foreign governmental agencies, including agencies responsible for monitoring and enforcing employment and labor laws, workplace safety, product safety, product labelling, environmental laws, consumer protection laws, anti-bribery laws, import and export controls, federal securities laws and tax laws and regulations. in certain jurisdictions, these regulatory requirements may be more stringent than in the u.s. noncompliance with applicable regulations or requirements could subject us to investigations, sanctions, enforcement actions, disgorgement of profits, fines, damages and civil and criminal penalties or injunctions. if any governmental sanctions are imposed, or if we do not prevail in any possible civil or criminal litigation, our business, operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected. in addition, responding to any action will likely result in a significant diversion of management's attention and resources and an increase in professional fees. enforcement actions and sanctions could harm our business, operating results and financial condition.
selling our solutions to the u.s. government, whether directly or through channel partners, also subjects us to certain regulatory and contractual requirements. failure to comply with these requirements by either us or our channel partners could subject us to investigations, fines, other penalties and damages, which could have an adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition and prospects. as an example, the u.s. department of justice ("doj"), on its own behalf or on behalf of the general services administration ("gsa"), as well as individuals, has in the past pursued claims against, reached financial settlements with or otherwise obtained damages from companies that sell electronic equipment and from it vendors under the false claims act and other statutes related to pricing, discount practices and compliance with laws related to sales to the federal government, such as the trade agreements act. the doj continues to actively pursue such claims. violations of certain regulatory and contractual requirements could also result in us being suspended or debarred from future government contracting. any of these outcomes could have an adverse effect on our revenue, operating results, financial condition and prospects.
these laws and regulations impose added costs on our business, and failure to comply with these or other applicable regulations and requirements, including non-compliance in the past, could lead to claims for damages from our channel partners, penalties, termination of contracts, loss of exclusive rights in our intellectual property and temporary suspension or permanent debarment from government contracting. any such damages, penalties, disruptions or limitations in our ability to do business with the public sector could have an adverse effect on our business and operating results.
we are subject to governmental export and import controls that could subject us to liability or restrictions on sales, and could impair our ability to compete in international markets.
because we incorporate encryption technology into our products, certain of our products are subject to u.s. export controls and may be exported outside the u.s. only with the required export license or through an export license exception, and may be prohibited altogether from export to certain countries. if we were to fail to comply with u.s. export laws, u.s. customs regulations and import regulations, u.s. economic sanctions and other countries' import and export laws, we could be subject to substantial civil and criminal penalties, including fines for the company and incarceration for responsible employees and managers, and the possible loss of export or import privileges. in addition, if our channel partners fail to obtain appropriate import, export or re-export licenses or permits (for example, for stocking orders placed by our partners), we may also be adversely affected through reputational harm and penalties and we may not be able to provide support related to appliances shipped pursuant to such orders. obtaining the necessary export license for a particular sale may be time-consuming and may result in the delay or loss of sales opportunities.
furthermore, u.s. export control laws and economic sanctions prohibit the shipment of certain products to u.s. embargoed or sanctioned countries, governments and persons. even though we take precautions to prevent our product from being shipped to u.s. sanctions targets, our products could be shipped to those targets by our channel partners, despite such precautions. any such shipment could have negative consequences including government investigations and penalties and reputational harm. in addition, various countries regulate the import of certain encryption technology, including import permitting and licensing requirements, and have enacted laws that could limit our ability to distribute our products or could limit our customers' ability to implement our products in those countries. changes in our products or changes in export and import regulations may create delays in the introduction of our products in international markets, prevent our customers with international operations from deploying our products globally or, in some cases, prevent the export or import of our products to certain countries, governments or persons altogether. any change in export or import regulations, economic sanctions or related legislation, shift in the enforcement or scope of existing regulations, or change in the countries, governments, persons or technologies targeted by such regulations, could result in decreased use of our products by, or in our decreased ability to export or sell our products to, existing or potential customers with international operations. any decreased use of our products or limitation on our ability to export or sell our products would likely adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
efforts to withdraw from or materially modify nafta or other international trade agreements, to change tax provisions related to global manufacturing and sales or to impose new tariffs, economic sanctions or related legislation, any of which could our adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
our business benefits from free trade agreements, such as the north american free trade agreement ("nafta"), and we also rely on various u.s. corporate tax provisions related to international commerce, as we develop, market and sell our products and services globally. efforts to withdraw from or materially modify nafta or other international trade agreements, or to change corporate tax policy related to international commerce, could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations as could the continuing uncertainty regarding whether such actions will be taken. moreover, efforts to implement changes related to export or import regulations (including the imposition of new border taxes or tariffs on foreign imports), economic sanctions or related policies. any modification in these areas, any shift in the enforcement or scope of existing regulations or any change in the countries, governments, persons or technologies targeted by such regulations, could result in decreased use of our products by, or in our decreased ability to export or sell our products to, existing or potential end-customers with international operations and could result in increased costs. any decreased use of our products or limitation on our ability to export or sell our products would likely adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
if we fail to comply with environmental requirements, our business, financial condition, operating results and reputation could be adversely affected.
the eu rohs and the similar laws of other jurisdictions ban the use of certain hazardous materials such as lead, mercury and cadmium in the manufacture of electrical equipment, including our products. we have incurred costs to comply with these laws, including research and development costs, costs associated with assuring the supply of compliant components and costs associated with writing off noncompliant inventory. we expect to continue to incur costs related to environmental laws and regulations in the future. with respect to the eu rohs, we and our competitors rely on an exemption for lead in network infrastructure equipment. it is possible this exemption will be revoked in the near future. if this exemption is revoked, if there are other changes to these laws (or their interpretation) or if new similar laws are passed in other jurisdictions, we may be required to reengineer our products to use components compatible with these regulations. this reengineering and component substitution could result in additional costs to us or disrupt our operations or logistics.
the eu has also adopted the weee directive, which requires electronic goods producers to be responsible for the collection, recycling and treatment of such products. although currently our eu international channel partners are responsible for the requirements of this directive as the importer of record in most of the european countries in which we sell our products, changes in interpretation of the regulations may cause us to incur costs or have additional regulatory requirements in the future to meet in order to comply with this directive, or with any similar laws adopted in other jurisdictions.
our failure to comply with these and future environmental rules and regulations could result in reduced sales of our products, increased costs, substantial product inventory write-offs, reputational damage, penalties and other sanctions.
sales to u.s. and foreign federal, state and local governmental agency end-customers have accounted for a portion of our revenue in past periods, and we may in the future increase sales to government organizations. sales to government organizations are subject to a number of risks. selling to government organizations can be highly competitive, expensive and time consuming, often requiring significant upfront time and expense, with long sales cycles and without any assurance of winning a sale.
•   funding authorizations and requirements unique to government agencies, with funding or purchasing reductions or delays adversely affecting public sector demand for our products;
•   geopolitical matters; and
the rules and regulations applicable to sales to government organizations may also negatively impact sales to other organizations. to date, we have had limited traction in sales to u.s. federal government agencies, and any future sales to government organizations is uncertain. government organizations may have contractual or other legal rights to terminate contracts with our distributors and resellers for convenience or due to a default, and any such termination may adversely impact our future results of operations. for example, if the distributor receives a significant portion of its revenue from sales to such government organization, the financial health of the distributor could be substantially harmed, which could negatively affect our future sales to such distributor. governments routinely investigate and audit government contractors' administrative processes, and any unfavorable audit could result in the government refusing to continue buying our products and services, a reduction of revenue or fines or civil or criminal liability if the audit uncovers improper or illegal activities. any such penalties could adversely impact our results of operations in a material way. finally, purchases by the u.s. government may require certain products to be manufactured in the u.s. and other high cost manufacturing locations, and we may not manufacture all products in locations that meet the requirements of the u.s. government.
false detection of vulnerabilities, viruses or security breaches or false identification of spam or spyware could adversely affect our business.
other threats not based on any known signatures but based on characteristics or anomalies that may indicate that a particular item is a threat. when our end-customers enable the heuristics feature in our products, the risk of falsely identifying viruses and other threats significantly increases. these false positives, while typical in the industry, may impair the perceived reliability of our products and may therefore adversely impact market acceptance of our products. also, our anti-spam and anti-malware services may falsely identify emails or programs as unwanted spam or potentially unwanted programs, or alternatively fail to properly identify unwanted emails or programs, particularly as spam emails or spyware are often designed to circumvent anti-spam or spyware products. parties whose emails or programs are blocked by our products may seek redress against us for labeling them as spammers or spyware, or for interfering with their business. in addition, false identification of emails or programs as unwanted spam or potentially unwanted programs may reduce the adoption of our products. if our system restricts important files or applications based on falsely identifying them as malware or some other item that should be restricted, this could adversely affect end-customers' systems and cause material system failures. in addition, our threat researchers periodically identify vulnerabilities in various third-party products, and, if these identifications are perceived to be incorrect or are in fact incorrect, this could harm our business. any such false identification or perceived false identification of important files, applications or vulnerabilities could result in negative publicity, loss of end-customers and sales, increased costs to remedy any problem and costly litigation.
if our internal network system or our website is compromised, public perception of our products and services will be harmed, we may become subject to liability, and our business, operating results and stock price may be adversely impacted.
our success depends on the market's confidence in our ability to provide effective network security protection. despite our efforts and processes to prevent breaches of our internal network system and website, we are still vulnerable to computer viruses, break-ins, phishing attacks, attempts to overload our servers with denial-of-service and other cyber-attacks and similar disruptions from unauthorized access to our internal network system or our website. our security measures may also be breached due to employee error, malfeasance or otherwise, and third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce our employees to transfer funds or disclose information in order to gain access to our network and confidential information. we cannot guarantee that the measures we have taken to protect our network and website will provide absolute security. moreover, because we provide network security products, we may be a more attractive target for attacks by computer hackers. although we have not yet experienced significant damages from unauthorized access by a third party of our internal network or website, an actual or perceived breach of network security occurs in our internal systems or website could adversely affect the market perception of our products and services and investor confidence in our company. any breach of our network system or website could impair our ability to operate our business, including our ability to provide fortiguard security subscription and forticare technical support services to our end-customers, lead to interruptions or system slowdowns, cause loss of critical data, or lead to the unauthorized disclosure or use of confidential, proprietary or sensitive information. we could also be subject to liability and litigation and reputational harm and our channel partners and end-customers may be harmed, lose confidence in us and decrease or cease using our products and services. any breach of our internal network system or our website could have an adverse effect on our business, operating results and stock price.
our ability to sell our products is dependent on the quality of our technical support services, and our failure to offer high quality technical support services would have a material adverse effect on our sales and results of operations.
once our products are deployed within our end-customers' networks, our end-customers depend on our technical support services, as well as the support of our channel partners and other third parties, to resolve any issues relating to our products. if we, our channel partners or other third parties do not effectively assist our customers in deploying our products, succeed in helping our customers quickly resolve post-deployment issues and provide effective ongoing support, our ability to sell additional products and services to existing customers would be adversely affected and our reputation with potential customers could be damaged. many large end-customers, service provider and government organization end-customers require higher levels of support than smaller end-customers because of their more complex deployments. if we, our channel partners or other third parties fail to meet the requirements of our larger end-customers, it may be more difficult to execute on our strategy to increase our penetration with large enterprises, service providers and government organizations. as a result, our failure to maintain high quality support services would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
we could be subject to changes in our tax rates, the adoption of new u.s. or international tax legislation, or exposure to additional tax liabilities.
we are subject to taxes in the u.s. and numerous foreign jurisdictions, where a number of our subsidiaries are organized. our provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely affected by several factors, many of which are outside of our control, including:
•   the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates or withholding taxes;
•   changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities;
•   an increase in non-deductible expenses for tax purposes, including certain stock-based compensation expense, write-offs of acquired in-process research and development, and impairment of goodwill;
•   tax assessments resulting from income tax audits or any related tax interest or penalties that could significantly affect our provision for income taxes for the period in which the settlement takes place;
•   a change in our decision to indefinitely reinvest foreign earnings;
•   court decisions, tax rulings and interpretations of tax laws, and regulations by international, federal or local governmental authorities; or
•   changes in tax laws and regulations, including possible changes in the u.s. to the taxation of earnings of our foreign subsidiaries, the deductibility of expenses attributable to foreign income or the foreign tax credit rules, or changes to the u.s. income tax rate, which would necessitate a revaluation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities.
significant judgment is required to determine the recognition and measurement attribute prescribed in the financial accounting standards board standard. in addition, the standard applies to all income tax positions, including the potential recovery of previously paid taxes, which, if settled unfavorably, could adversely impact our provision for income taxes or additional paid-in capital. further, as a result of certain of our ongoing employment and capital investment actions and commitments, our income in certain foreign countries is subject to reduced tax rates and, in some cases, is wholly exempt from tax. our failure to meet these commitments could adversely impact our provision for income taxes. in addition, we are subject to the examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service ("irs") and other tax authorities. tax authorities in france are currently examining the inter-company relationship between fortinet, inc., fortinet france and fortinet singapore. we are in the early stages of this inquiry and as of yet no official audit has been opened. we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from such examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes.
although we currently do not have a valuation allowance, we may in the future be required to establish one. we will continue to assess the need for a valuation allowance on the deferred tax asset by evaluating both positive and negative evidence that may exist.
forecasts of our income tax position and effective tax rate are complex, subject to uncertainty and periodic updates because our income tax position for each year combines the effects of a mix of profits earned and losses incurred by us in various tax jurisdictions with a broad range of income tax rates, as well as changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, the impact of various accounting rules and changes to these rules and tax laws, the results of examinations by various tax authorities, and the impact of any acquisition, business combination or other reorganization or financing transaction. to forecast our global tax rate, we estimate our pre-tax profits and losses by jurisdiction and forecast our tax expense by jurisdiction. if the mix of profits and losses, our ability to use tax credits or effective tax rates in a given jurisdiction differs from our estimate, our actual tax rate could be materially different than forecasted, which could have a material impact on our results of business, financial condition and results of operations. additionally, our actual tax rate may be subject to further uncertainty due to potential changes in u.s. and foreign tax rules.
as a multinational corporation, we conduct our business in many countries and are subject to taxation in many jurisdictions. the taxation of our business is subject to the application of multiple and sometimes conflicting tax laws and regulations, as well as multinational tax conventions. our effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic distribution of our worldwide earnings or losses, the tax regulations and tax holidays in each geographic region, the availability of tax credits and carryforwards, and the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies. the application of tax laws and regulations is subject to legal and factual interpretation, judgment and uncertainty. tax laws themselves are subject to change as a result of changes in fiscal policy, changes in legislation, and the evolution of regulations and court rulings. consequently, taxing authorities may impose tax assessments or judgments against us that could materially impact our tax liability and/or our effective income tax rate.
the organisation for economic co-operation and development (the "oecd"), an international association comprised of 34 countries, including the u.s., has been working on a base erosion and profit sharing project. as part of this project, the oecd issued in 2015, and is expected to continue to issue, guidelines and proposals that may change various aspects of the existing framework under which our tax obligations are determined in many of the countries in which we do business. due to our extensive international business activities, any changes in the taxation of such activities could increase our tax obligations in many countries and may increase our worldwide effective tax rate.
in addition, we are subject to examination of our income tax returns by the irs and other tax authorities. if tax authorities challenge the relative mix of u.s. and international income, our future effective income tax rates could be adversely affected. while we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes from such examinations and the adequacy of our provision for income taxes, there can be no assurance that such provision is sufficient and that a determination by a tax authority will not have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
our inability to acquire and integrate other businesses, products or technologies could seriously harm our competitive position.
in order to remain competitive, we may seek to acquire additional businesses, products, or technologies and intellectual property, such as patents. for example, we closed our acquisitions of meru and accelops in the third quarter of 2015 and the second quarter of 2016, respectively. for any past acquisition or possible future acquisition, we may not be successful in negotiating the terms of the acquisition, financing the acquisition, or effectively integrating the acquired business, product, technology or intellectual property and sales force into our existing business and operations. we may have difficulty incorporating acquired technologies, intellectual property or products with our existing product lines, integrating reporting systems and procedures, and maintaining uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies. for example, we may experience difficulties integrating an acquired company's erp system, sales and support processes and systems, and other processes and systems with our current systems and processes. our due diligence may fail to identify all of the problems, liabilities or other shortcomings or challenges of an acquired business, product or technology, including issues with intellectual property, product quality or product architecture, regulatory compliance practices, revenue recognition or other accounting practices or employee or customer issues, and we may not accurately forecast the financial impact of an acquisition. in addition, any acquisitions we are able to complete may be dilutive to revenue growth and earnings and may not result in any synergies or other benefits we had expected to achieve, which could result in impairment charges that could be substantial. we may have to pay cash, incur debt, or issue equity securities to pay for any acquisition, each of which could affect our financial condition or the value of our capital stock and could result in dilution to our stockholders. acquisitions during a quarter may result in increased operating expenses and adversely affect our results of operations for that period or future periods compared to the results that we have previously forecasted or achieved. further, completing a potential acquisition and integrating acquired businesses, products, technologies or intellectual property could significantly divert management time and resources.
our business is subject to the risks of warranty claims, product returns, product liability and product defects.
our products are very complex and, despite testing prior to their release, have contained and may contain undetected defects or errors, especially when first introduced or when new versions are released. product errors have affected the performance of our products and could delay the development or release of new products or new versions of products, adversely affect our reputation and our end-customers' willingness to buy products from us, and adversely affect market acceptance or perception of our products. any such errors or delays in releasing new products or new versions of products or allegations of unsatisfactory performance could cause us to lose revenue or market share, increase our service costs, cause us to incur substantial costs in redesigning the products, cause us to lose significant end-customers, subject us to liability for damages and divert our resources from other tasks, any one of which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. our products must successfully interoperate with products from other vendors. as a result, when problems occur in a network, it may be difficult to identify the sources of these problems. the occurrence of hardware and software errors, whether or not caused by our products, could delay or reduce market acceptance of our products,
and have an adverse effect on our business and financial performance, and any necessary revisions may cause us to incur significant expenses. the occurrence of any such problems could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.
although we generally have limitation of liability provisions in our standard terms and conditions of sale, they may not fully or effectively protect us from claims as a result of federal, state or local laws or ordinances or unfavorable judicial decisions in the u.s. or other countries, and in some circumstances we may be required to indemnify a customer in full, without a limitation on liability, for certain liabilities, including potential liabilities that are not contractually limited. the sale and support of our products also entail the risk of product liability claims. we maintain insurance to protect against certain claims associated with the use of our products, but our insurance coverage may not cover such claim at all or may not adequately cover any claim asserted against us, and in some instances may subject us to potential liability that is not contractually limited. in addition, even claims that ultimately are unsuccessful could result in our expenditure of funds in litigation and divert management's time and other resources.
a significant natural disaster, such as an earthquake, fire, power outage, flood, or other catastrophic event could have a material adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial condition. our corporate headquarters are located in the san francisco bay area, a region known for seismic activity, and our research and development and data office center in vancouver, canada is subject to the risk of flooding and is also in a region known for seismic activity. in addition, natural disasters could affect our manufacturing vendors, suppliers or logistics providers' ability to perform services, such as obtaining product components and manufacturing products, or assisting with shipments, on a timely basis, as well as our customers' ability to order from us and our employees' ability to perform their duties. in the event our or our service providers' information technology systems or manufacturing or logistics abilities are hindered by any of the events discussed above, shipments could be delayed, resulting in our missing financial targets, such as revenue and shipment targets, for a particular quarter. in addition, regional instability, civil unrest, labor disruptions, acts of terrorism and other geo-political unrest could cause disruptions in our business or the business of our manufacturers, logistics providers, partners or end-customers, or of the economy as a whole. given our typical concentration of sales at the end of each quarter, any disruption in the business of our manufacturers, logistics providers, partners or end-customers that impacts sales at the end of our quarter could have a significant adverse impact on our quarterly results. to the extent that any of the above results in delays or cancellations of customer orders, or in the delay of the manufacture, deployment or shipment of our products, our business, financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected.
risks related to our industry the network security market is rapidly evolving and the complex technology incorporated in our products makes them difficult to develop. if we do not accurately predict, prepare for and respond promptly to technological and market developments and changing end-customer needs, our competitive position and prospects will be harmed.
the network security market is expected to continue to evolve rapidly. moreover, many of our end-customers operate in markets characterized by rapidly changing technologies and business plans, which require them to add numerous network access points and adapt increasingly complex enterprise networks, incorporating a variety of hardware, software applications, operating systems and networking protocols. in addition, computer hackers and others who try to attack networks employ increasingly sophisticated techniques to gain access to and attack systems and networks. the technology in our products is especially complex because it needs to effectively identify and respond to new and increasingly sophisticated methods of attack, while minimizing the impact on network performance. additionally, some of our new products and enhancements may require us to develop new hardware architectures and asics that involve complex, expensive and time consuming research and development processes. although the market expects rapid introduction of new products or product enhancements to respond to new threats, the development of these products is difficult and the timetable for commercial release and availability is uncertain and there can be long time periods between releases and availability of new products. we have in the past and may in the future experience unanticipated delays in the availability of new products and services and fail to meet previously announced timetables for such availability. if we do not quickly respond to the rapidly changing and rigorous needs of our end-customers by developing and releasing and making available on a timely basis new products and services or enhancements that can respond adequately to new security threats, our competitive position and business prospects will be harmed.
moreover, business models based on software-as-a-service ("saas") and infrastructure-as-a-service ("iaas"), both of which are hosted or cloud-based services, have become increasingly in-demand by our end-customers and adopted by other providers, including our competitors. while part of our platform is cloud-based, most of our platform is currently deployed on
premise, and therefore, if customers demand that our platform be provided through a saas or iaas business model, we would be required to make additional investments in our infrastructure and personnel to be able to more fully provide our platform through a saas or iaas model in order to maintain the competitiveness of our platform. such investments may involve expanding our data centers, servers and networks, and increasing our technical operations and engineering teams. these risks are compounded by the uncertainty concerning the future viability of saas and iaas business models and the future demand for such models by customers. additionally, if we are unable to meet the demand to provide our services through a saas or iaas model, we may lose customers to competitors.
our uniform resource locator ("url") database for our web filtering service may fail to keep pace with the rapid growth of urls and may not categorize websites in accordance with our end-customers' expectations.
the success of our web filtering service depends on the breadth and accuracy of our url database. although our url database currently catalogs millions of unique urls, it contains only a portion of the urls for all of the websites that are available on the internet. in addition, the total number of urls and software applications is growing rapidly, and we expect this rapid growth to continue in the future. accordingly, we must identify and categorize content for our security risk categories at an extremely rapid rate. our database and technologies may not be able to keep pace with the growth in the number of websites, especially the growing amount of content utilizing foreign languages and the increasing sophistication of malicious code and the delivery mechanisms associated with spyware, phishing and other hazards associated with the internet. further, the ongoing evolution of the internet and computing environments will require us to continually improve the functionality, features and reliability of our web filtering function. any failure of our databases to keep pace with the rapid growth and technological change of the internet could impair the market acceptance of our products, which in turn could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.
in addition, our web filtering service may not be successful in accurately categorizing internet and application content to meet our end-customers' expectations. we rely upon a combination of automated filtering technology and human review to categorize websites and software applications in our proprietary databases. our end-customers may not agree with our determinations that particular urls should be included or not included in specific categories of our databases. in addition, it is possible that our filtering processes may place material that is objectionable or that presents a security risk in categories that are generally unrestricted by our customers' internet and computer access policies, which could result in such material not being blocked from the network. conversely, we may miscategorize websites such that access is denied to websites containing information that is important or valuable to our customers. any miscategorization could result in customer dissatisfaction and harm our reputation. any failure to effectively categorize and filter websites according to our end-customers' and channel partners' expectations could impair the growth of our business.
if our new products and product enhancements do not achieve sufficient market acceptance, our results of operations and competitive position will suffer.
we spend substantial amounts of time and money to research and develop new products and enhanced versions of our existing products in order to incorporate additional features, improved functionality or other enhancements in order to meet our customers' rapidly evolving demands for network security in our highly competitive industry. when we develop a new product or an enhanced version of an existing product, we typically incur expenses and expend resources upfront to market, promote and sell the new offering. therefore, when we develop and introduce new or enhanced products, they must achieve high levels of market acceptance in order to justify the amount of our investment in developing and bringing them to market.
•   failure to accurately predict market demand in terms of product functionality and to supply products that meet this demand in a timely fashion;
•   inability to interoperate effectively with the networks or applications of our prospective end-customers;
•   inability to protect against new types of attacks or techniques used by hackers;
•   actual or perceived defects, vulnerabilities, errors or failures;
•   negative publicity about their performance or effectiveness;
•   introduction or anticipated introduction of competing products by our competitors;
•   poor business conditions for our end-customers, causing them to delay it purchases;
•   changes to the regulatory requirements around security; and
if our new products or enhancements do not achieve adequate acceptance in the market, our competitive position will be impaired, our revenue will be diminished and the effect on our operating results may be particularly acute because of the significant research, development, marketing, sales and other expenses we incurred in connection with the new product or enhancement.
demand for our products may be limited by market perception that individual products from one vendor that provide multiple layers of security protection in one product are inferior to point solution network security solutions from multiple vendors.
sales of many of our products depend on increased demand for incorporating broad security functionality in one appliance. if the market for these products fails to grow as we anticipate, our business will be seriously harmed. target customers may view "all-in-one" network security solutions as inferior to security solutions from multiple vendors because of, among other things, their perception that such products of ours provide security functions from only a single vendor and do not allow users to choose "best-of-breed" defenses from among the wide range of dedicated security applications available. target customers might also perceive that, by combining multiple security functions into a single platform, our solutions create a "single point of failure" in their networks, which means that an error, vulnerability or failure of our product may place the entire network at risk. in addition, the market perception that "all-in-one" solutions may be suitable only for small- and medium-sized businesses because such solution lacks the performance capabilities and functionality of other solutions may harm our sales to large enterprise, service provider and government organization end-customers. if the foregoing concerns and perceptions become prevalent, even if there is no factual basis for these concerns and perceptions, or if other issues arise with our market in general, demand for multi-security functionality products could be severely limited, which would limit our growth and harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. further, a successful and publicized targeted attack against us, exposing a "single point of failure," could significantly increase these concerns and perceptions and may harm our business and results of operations.
we face intense competition in our market and we may lack sufficient financial or other resources to maintain or improve our competitive position.
the market for network security products is intensely competitive, and we expect competition to intensify in the future. our competitors include companies such as check point, cisco, f5 networks, fireeye, intel, juniper, palo alto networks, sonicwall, sophos and symantec.
many of our existing and potential competitors enjoy substantial competitive advantages such as:
•   greater name recognition and longer operating histories;
•   broader distribution and established relationships with distribution partners and end-customers;
•   greater resources to make acquisitions;
in addition, some of our larger competitors have substantially broader product offerings, and leverage their relationships based on other products or incorporate functionality into existing products in a manner that discourages customers from purchasing our products. these larger competitors often have broader product lines and market focus, and are in a better position to withstand any significant reduction in capital spending by end-customers in these markets. therefore, these competitors will not be as susceptible to downturns in a particular market. also, many of our smaller competitors that specialize in providing protection from a single type of network security threat are often able to deliver these specialized network security products to the market more quickly than we can. some of our smaller competitors are using third-party chips designed to accelerate performance. conditions in our markets could change rapidly and significantly as a result of technological advancements or continuing market consolidation. our competitors and potential competitors may also be able to develop products or services that are equal or superior to ours, achieve greater market acceptance of their products and services, and increase sales by utilizing different distribution channels than we do. our current and potential competitors may also establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties that may further enhance their resources. in addition, current or potential competitors may be acquired by third parties with greater available resources, and new competitors may arise pursuant to acquisitions of network security companies or divisions. as a result of such acquisitions, competition in our market may continue to increase and our current or potential competitors might be able to adapt more quickly to new technologies and customer needs, devote greater resources to the promotion or sale of their products and services, initiate or withstand substantial price competition, take advantage of acquisition or other opportunities more readily, or develop and expand their product and service offerings more quickly than we do. in addition, our competitors may bundle products and services competitive with ours with other products and services. customers may accept these bundled products and services rather than separately purchasing our products and services. due to budget constraints or economic downturns, organizations may be more willing to incrementally add solutions to their existing network security infrastructure from competitors than to replace it with our solutions. these competitive pressures in our market or our failure to compete effectively may result in price reductions, fewer customer orders, reduced revenue and gross margins and loss of market share.
if functionality similar to that offered by our products is incorporated into existing network infrastructure products, organizations may decide against adding our appliances to their network, which would have an adverse effect on our business.
large, well-established providers of networking equipment such as cisco, f5 networks and juniper offer, and may continue to introduce, network security features that compete with our products, either in standalone security products or as additional features in their network infrastructure products. the inclusion of, or the announcement of an intent to include, functionality perceived to be similar to that offered by our security solutions in networking products that are already generally accepted as necessary components of network architecture may have an adverse effect on our ability to market and sell our products. furthermore, even if the functionality offered by network infrastructure providers is more limited than our products, a significant number of customers may elect to accept such limited functionality in lieu of adding appliances from an additional vendor such as us. many organizations have invested substantial personnel and financial resources to design and operate their networks and have established deep relationships with other providers of networking products, which may make them reluctant to add new components to their networks, particularly from other vendors such as us. in addition, an organization's existing vendors or new vendors with a broad product offering may be able to offer concessions that we are not able to match because we currently offer only network security products and have fewer resources than many of our competitors. if organizations are reluctant to add additional network infrastructure from new vendors or otherwise decide to work with their existing vendors, our business, financial condition and results of operations will be adversely affected.
risks related to intellectual property our proprietary rights may be difficult to enforce, which could enable others to copy or use aspects of our products without compensating us.
we rely primarily on patent, trademark, copyright and trade secrets laws and confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our technology. valid patents may not issue from our pending applications, and the claims eventually allowed on any patents may not be sufficiently broad to protect our technology or products. any issued patents may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, and any rights granted under these patents may not actually provide adequate defensive protection or competitive advantages to us. patent applications in the u.s. are typically not published until at least 18 months after filing, or, in some cases, not at all, and publications of discoveries in industry-related literature lag behind actual discoveries. we cannot be certain that we were the first to make the inventions claimed in our pending patent applications or that we were the first to file for patent protection. additionally, the process of obtaining patent protection is expensive and time-consuming, and we may not be able to prosecute all necessary or desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost or in a
timely manner. in addition, recent changes to the patent laws in the u.s. may bring into question the validity of certain software patents and may make it more difficult and costly to prosecute patent applications. as a result, we may not be able to obtain adequate patent protection or effectively enforce our issued patents.
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. we generally enter into confidentiality or license agreements with our employees, consultants, vendors and customers, and generally limit access to and distribution of our proprietary information. however, we cannot guarantee that the steps taken by us will prevent misappropriation of our technology. policing unauthorized use of our technology or products is difficult. in addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to as great an extent as the laws of the u.s., and many foreign countries do not enforce these laws as diligently as government agencies and private parties in the u.s. from time to time, legal action by us may be necessary to enforce our patents and other intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets, to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others or to defend against claims of infringement or invalidity. such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could negatively affect our business, operating results and financial condition. if we are unable to protect our proprietary rights (including aspects of our software and products protected other than by patent rights), we may find ourselves at a competitive disadvantage to others who need not incur the additional expense, time and effort required to create the innovative products that have enabled us to be successful to date.
our products contain third-party open source software components, and failure to comply with the terms of the underlying open source software licenses could restrict our ability to sell our products.
our products contain software modules licensed to us by third-party authors under "open source" licenses, including the gnu public license, the gnu lesser public license, the bsd license, the apache license the mit x license and the mozilla public license. from time to time, there have been claims against companies that distribute or use open source software in their products and services, asserting that open source software infringes the claimants' intellectual property rights. we could be subject to suits by parties claiming infringement of intellectual property rights in what we believe to be licensed open source software. use and distribution of open source software may entail greater risks than use of third-party commercial software, as open source licensors generally do not provide warranties or other contractual protections regarding infringement claims or the quality of the code. some open source licenses contain requirements that we make available source code for modifications or derivative works we create based upon the type of open source software we use. if we combine our proprietary software with open source software in a certain manner, we could, under certain open source licenses, be required to release the source code of our proprietary software to the public. this would allow our competitors to create similar products with lower development effort and time and ultimately could result in a loss of product sales for us.
although we monitor our use of open source software to avoid subjecting our products to conditions we do not intend, the terms of many open source licenses have not been interpreted by u.s. courts, and there is a risk that these licenses could be construed in a way that could impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize our products. in this event, we could be required to seek licenses from third parties to continue offering our products, to make our proprietary code generally available in source code form, to re-engineer our products or to discontinue the sale of our products if re-engineering could not be accomplished on a timely basis, any of which requirements could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.
claims by others that we infringe their proprietary technology or other litigation matters could harm our business.
patent and other intellectual property disputes are common in the network security industry. third parties are currently asserting, have asserted and may in the future assert claims of infringement of intellectual property rights against us. they have also asserted such claims against our end-customers or channel partners whom we may indemnify against claims that our products infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties. as the number of products and competitors in our market increases and overlaps occur, infringement claims may increase. any claim of infringement by a third-party, even those without merit, could cause us to incur substantial costs defending against the claim and could distract our management from our business. in addition, litigation may involve patent holding companies, non-practicing entities or other adverse patent owners who have no relevant product revenue and against whom our own patents may therefore provide little or no deterrence or protection.
although third parties may offer a license to their technology, the terms of any offered license may not be acceptable, and the failure to obtain a license or the costs associated with any license could cause our business, financial condition and results of operations to be materially and adversely affected. in addition, some licenses may be non-exclusive and, therefore, our competitors may have access to the same technology licensed to us.
alternatively, we may be required to develop non-infringing technology, which could require significant time, effort and expense, and may ultimately not be successful. furthermore, a successful claimant could secure a judgment or we may agree to a settlement that prevents us from distributing certain products or performing certain services or that requires us to pay substantial damages (including treble damages if we are found to have willfully infringed such claimant's patents or copyrights), royalties or other fees. any of these events could seriously harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.
from time to time we are subject to lawsuits claiming patent infringement. we are also subject to other litigation in addition to patent infringement claims, such as employment-related litigation and disputes, as well as general commercial litigation, and could become subject to other forms of litigation and disputes, including stockholder litigation. if we are unsuccessful in defending any such claims, our operating results and financial condition and results may be materially and adversely affected. for example, we may be required to pay substantial damages and could be prevented from selling certain of our products. litigation, with or without merit, could negatively impact our business, reputation and sales in a material fashion.
we have several ongoing patent lawsuits, several non-practicing entity patent holding companies have sent us letters proposing that we license certain of their patents and organizations have sent letters demanding that we provide indemnification for patent claims. given this and the proliferation of lawsuits in our industry and other similar industries by both non-practicing entities and operating entities, we expect that we will be sued for patent infringement in the future, regardless of the merits of any such lawsuits. the cost to defend such lawsuits and any adverse result in such lawsuits could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
we rely on the availability of third-party licenses.
many of our products include software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties. it may be necessary in the future to renew licenses relating to various aspects of these products or to seek new licenses for existing or new products. there can be no assurance that the necessary licenses would be available on acceptable terms, if at all. the inability to obtain certain licenses or other rights or to obtain such licenses or rights on favorable terms, or the need to engage in litigation regarding these matters, could result in delays in product releases until equivalent technology can be identified, licensed or developed, if at all, and integrated into our products and may have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition. moreover, the inclusion in our products of software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties on a nonexclusive basis could limit our ability to differentiate our products from those of our competitors.
risks related to ownership of our common stock as a public company, we are subject to compliance initiatives that will require substantial time from our management and result in significantly increased costs that may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.
the sarbanes-oxley act of 2002 ("sarbanes-oxley"), dodd-frank and other rules implemented by the sec and the nasdaq stock market impose various requirements on public companies, including requiring changes in corporate governance practices. these requirements, as well as proposed corporate governance laws and regulations under consideration, may further increase our compliance costs. if compliance with these various legal and regulatory requirements diverts our management's attention from other business concerns, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. sarbanes-oxley requires, among other things, that we assess the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting annually, and of our disclosure controls and procedures quarterly. although our most recent assessment, testing and evaluation resulted in our conclusion that as of december 31, 2016, our internal controls over financial reporting were effective, we cannot predict the outcome of our testing in 2017 or future periods. we may incur additional expenses and commitment of management's time in connection with further evaluations, both of which could materially increase our operating expenses and accordingly reduce our operating results.
a change in accounting standards or practices, and varying interpretations of existing or new accounting pronouncements, such as changes to standards related to revenue recognition (which are effective for us beginning on january 1, 2018) and accounting for leases, as well as the significant costs that may be incurred to adopt and to comply with these new pronouncements, could have a significant effect on our reported financial results or the way we conduct our business. if we do not ensure that our systems and processes are aligned with the new standards, we could encounter difficulties generating quarterly and annual financial statements in a timely manner, which would have an adverse effect on our business and our ability to meet our reporting obligations.
if securities or industry analysts stop publishing research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.
the trading market for our common stock will depend in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. if we do not maintain adequate research coverage or if one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrades our stock or publishes inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price could decline. if one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of our company or fails to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our stock could decrease, which could cause our stock price and trading volume to decline.
the market price of our common stock may be subject to wide fluctuations in response to, among other things, the risk factors described in this periodic report, news about us and our financial results, news about our competitors and their results, and other factors such as rumors or fluctuations in the valuation of companies perceived by investors to be comparable to us, or announcements regarding any stock repurchase programs and the timing and amount of shares we purchase under such programs. for example, during 2016, the closing price of our common stock ranged from $23.83 to $37.17 per share.
furthermore, the stock markets have experienced price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many companies. these fluctuations often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. these broad market and industry fluctuations, as well as general economic, political and market conditions, such as recessions, interest rate changes or international currency fluctuations, may negatively affect the market price of our common stock.
in the past, many companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been subject to securities class action litigation. we may be the target of this type of litigation in the future. securities litigation against us could result in substantial costs and divert our management's attention from other business concerns, which could seriously harm our business.
our certificate of incorporation, bylaws and delaware law contain provisions that could have the effect of rendering more difficult, delaying or preventing an acquisition deemed undesirable by our board of directors. our corporate governance documents include provisions:
•   authorizing "blank check" preferred stock, which could be issued by the board without stockholder approval and may contain voting, liquidation, dividend and other rights superior to our common stock;
•   limiting the liability of, and providing indemnification to, our directors and officers;
•   limiting the ability of our stockholders to call and bring business before special meetings;
•   providing that certain litigation matters may only be brought against us in state or federal courts in the state of delaware;
•   providing the board of directors with the express power to postpone previously scheduled annual meetings and to cancel previously scheduled special meetings.
as a delaware corporation, we are also subject to provisions of delaware law, including section 203 of the delaware general corporation law, which prevents some stockholders holding more than 15% of our outstanding common stock from engaging in certain business combinations without approval of the holders of a substantial majority of all of our outstanding common stock.
any provision of our certificate of incorporation or bylaws or delaware law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock, and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock.

business overview we provide high performance cybersecurity solutions to a wide variety of enterprises, service providers and government organizations of all sizes across the globe, including a majority of the 2016 fortune 100. our cybersecurity solutions are designed to provide broad, rapid protection against dynamic and sophisticated security threats, while simplifying the it and security infrastructure of our end-customers.
the evolving cyber threat environment is unprecedented both in terms of volume and sophistication of attacks. as a result, cybersecurity has increased both in priority and in management complexity for organizations of all sizes, especially enterprises. in addition, the growth of iot devices and the decision by organizations to increasingly move computing and infrastructure resources to the cloud necessitate increased visibility and security orchestration across a widely distributed ecosystem of networks. our common operating system, centralized management and open application program interfaces allow many of the solutions in our portfolio, as well as those of our partner community, to be combined to create an integrated security architecture. the fortinet security fabric is designed to address sophisticated threats and next-generation environments, including iot and the cloud. the fortinet security fabric connects our products, services and ecosystem partner solutions to help provide visibility and protection at all points in the network, from endpoint to data center to the cloud, regardless of whether deployed in physical, virtual or hybrid cloud environments or on endpoint devices. the fortinet security fabric delivers integrated scalability, access control, awareness, security, traffic segmentation, centralized management and orchestration. the fortinet security fabric is built around an open framework to ensure interoperability and synchronization of intelligence and response, and does so across the distributed network security infrastructure, including both from the cloud and for the cloud. at the core of the fortinet security fabric are our fortigate physical and software licenses, which ship with a broad set of security services, including firewall, vpn, anti-malware, anti-spam, application control, intrusion prevention, access control, web filtering, traffic and device segmentation and atp. many of these security services are tuned and updated by our fortiguard labs team, which provides threat research and a global cloud network of data collection and intelligence resources to deliver subscription-based services to fortigate appliances and software products.
enterprise customers select the form and deployment method that best meet their specific security requirements, such as a high-speed dcfw at the network core, a ngfw at the edge, an internal segmentation firewall ("isfw") between network zones, a distributed enterprise firewall at branch sites or software and hardware-based solutions designed for virtualized and cloud environments. many smaller businesses also tend to deploy utm devices. we derive a substantial majority of product sales from our fortigate appliances, which range from the fortigate-20 to -100 series, designed for small businesses, fortigate-200 to -900 series for medium-sized businesses, to the fortigate-1000 to -7000 series for large enterprises and service providers. our network security platform also includes our fortiguard security subscription services, which end-customers can subscribe to in order to obtain access to dynamic updates to application control, anti-virus, intrusion prevention, web filtering, and anti-spam functionality. end-customers may also purchase fortimanager and fortianalyzer products in conjunction with a fortigate deployment to provide enterprise-class centralized management, analysis and reporting capabilities. fortisiem provides organizations with a solution for analyzing and managing network security, performance and compliance standards across our and other vendors' products. finally, end-customers may purchase forticare technical support services for our products and forticare professional services to assist in the design, implementation and maintenance of their networks.
we complement our core fortigate product line with other appliances and software licenses that offer additional protection from security threats to other critical areas of the enterprise. these products include our fortimail email security, fortisandbox atp, fortiweb web application firewall, fortiddos, and fortidb database security appliances, as well as our forticlient endpoint security software, fortiap secure wireless access points and fortiswitch secure switch connectivity products.
sales of complementary products and software licenses have outpaced our overall growth in recent quarters. our strong technology advantages also position us to effectively deliver security to the cloud and for the cloud. sales of our cloud related products and services across public, private and hybrid cloud environments continue to grow faster than other part of our business.
•   we generated cash flows from operating activities of $345.7 million in 2016, an increase of $63.2 million, or 22%, compared to 2015.
revenue grew in 2016 as our strategy of investing in sales and marketing enabled us to continue to gain market share and customers. our sales increased in 2016, primarily due to the strength in sales of our enterprise service bundles and the fortinet security fabric. we are also starting to see a shift from product revenues to higher-margin, recurring service revenues. on a geographic basis, revenue continues to be diversified globally, which remains a key strength of our business.
the percentage of our fortigate related billings from mid-range products increased from 25% in 2015 to 28% in 2016 and the entry-level products remained at 34% in 2016, consistent with billings in 2015. the percentage of our fortigate related billings from high-end products decreased from 41% in 2015 to 38% in 2016. the sale of non-fortigate products also grew significantly, such as growth in our fortisandbox atp products. we also saw more deals that included multiple fortinet products in physical, virtual and cloud environments.
in 2016, operating expenses increased by $187.0 million, or 26%, as compared to 2015. the increase was primarily driven by our investments made to expand our sales coverage, grow our marketing capabilities, develop new products and scale our customer support. we also continue to invest in research and development to strengthen our technology leadership position. we believe that continued product innovation has strengthened our technology and resulted in market share gains. in addition, we incurred expenses from business design and reengineering related to the implementation of a new erp system. headcount increased by 16% to 4,665 employees and contractors as of december 31, 2016, up from 4,018 as of december 31, 2015.
business model our sales strategy is based on a distribution model whereby we primarily sell our products, software licenses and services directly to distributors which sell to resellers and service providers, which, in turn, sell to our end-customers. in certain cases, we sell directly to government-focused resellers, large service providers and major systems integrators, which have significant purchasing power and unique customer deployment requirements. we also offer our products through amazon web services and microsoft azure. while the revenue from such sales are still relatively insignificant, they are rapidly increasing and are aligned with the networking trends of our customers and the industry as a whole.
typically, fortiguard security subscription services and forticare technical support services are purchased along with our physical products and software licenses, most frequently as part of a bundle offering that includes hardware and services functionality. we generally invoice at the time of our sale for the total price of the products and security and technical support services, and the invoice is payable within 30 to 90 days. we also invoice certain software licenses and services on a monthly basis.
we generally recognize product revenue up front and ratably recognize revenue for the sale of new, and the renewal of existing, fortiguard security subscription and forticare technical support services contracts. we recognize revenue for certain software licenses up front as product revenue and, to a lesser extent, recognize other software licenses over the term of the agreement as services revenue. we recognize the security and support revenue over the service period, which is typically one to three years, but can be as long as five years. sales of new and renewal services are a source of recurring revenue and increase our deferred revenue balance, which contributes significantly to our positive cash flow from operations.
key metrics we monitor a number of financial and liquidity metrics, including the key financial metrics set forth below, in order to help us evaluate growth trends, establish budgets, measure the effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts, and assess operational efficiencies. the following table summarizes revenue, deferred revenue, billings (non-gaap), cash, cash equivalents and investments, net cash provided by operating activities, and free cash flow (non-gaap). we discuss revenue below under "-components of operating results," and we discuss our cash, cash equivalents, and investments, and net cash provided by operating activities below under "-liquidity and capital resources." deferred revenue, billings (non-gaap), and free cash flow (non-gaap) are discussed immediately below the following table.
net cash provided by operating activities        $345,708                  $282,547                $196,582
deferred revenue. our deferred revenue consists of amounts that have been invoiced but that have not yet been recognized as revenue. the majority of our deferred revenue balance consists of the unrecognized portion of service revenue from fortiguard security subscription and forticare technical support service contracts, which is recognized as revenue ratably over the contractual service period. we monitor our deferred revenue balance, growth and the mix of short-term and long-term deferred revenue because it represents a significant portion of revenue to be recognized in future periods. deferred revenue was $1.04 billion as of december 31, 2016, an increase of $244.0 million, or 31%, from december 31, 2015.
billings (non-gaap). we define billings as revenue recognized in accordance with gaap plus the change in deferred revenue from the beginning to the end of the period less any deferred revenue balances acquired from business combination(s) during the period. we consider billings to be a useful metric for management and investors because billings drive future revenue, which is an important indicator of the health and viability of our business. there are a number of limitations related to the use of billings instead of gaap revenue. first, billings include amounts that have not yet been recognized as revenue and are impacted by the term of security and support agreements. second, we may calculate billings in a manner that is different from peer companies that report similar financial measures. management accounts for these limitations by providing specific information regarding gaap revenue and evaluating billings together with gaap revenue. total billings were $1.52 billion for 2016, an increase of 23% compared to $1.23 billion in 2015.
a reconciliation of billings to revenue, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap, is provided below:
free cash flow (non-gaap). we define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities minus capital expenditures such as purchases of real estate and other property and equipment. we consider free cash flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the business that, after capital expenditures, can be used for strategic opportunities, including investing in our business, making strategic
acquisitions, repurchasing outstanding common stock and strengthening the balance sheet. analysis of free cash flow facilitates management's comparison of our operating results to those of our peer companies. a limitation of using free cash flow rather than the gaap measure of net cash provided by operating activities as a means for evaluating liquidity is that free cash flow does not represent the total increase or decrease in the cash, cash equivalents and investments balance for the period because it excludes cash provided by or used for other investing and financing activities. management accounts for this limitation by providing information about our capital expenditures and other investing and financing activities on the face of the cash flow statement and under "-liquidity and capital resources." a reconciliation of free cash flow to net cash provided by operating activities, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap, is provided below:
net cash provided by operating activities      $345,708                $282,547                $196,582
components of operating results revenue we generate the majority of our revenue from sales of our products, software licenses and amortization of amounts included in deferred revenue related to previous sales of fortiguard security subscription and forticare technical support services. revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured.
•   product revenue. product revenue is primarily generated from sales of our appliances. the substantial majority of our product revenue has been generated by our fortigate line of appliances, and we do not expect this to change in the foreseeable future. product revenue also includes revenue derived from sales of software. as a percentage of total revenue, we expect that our product revenue may vary from quarter-to-quarter based on seasonal and cyclical factors, as discussed below under "-quarterly results of operations", and we expect the trend to continue in 2017.
•   service revenue. service revenue is generated primarily from fortiguard security subscription services related to application control, antivirus, intrusion prevention, web filtering, anti-spam, atp and vulnerability management updates, and from forticare technical support services for software updates, maintenance releases and patches, internet access to technical content, telephone and internet access to technical support personnel and hardware support. we recognize revenue from fortiguard security subscription and forticare technical support services over the contractual service period. our typical contractual support and subscription term is one to three years. we also generate a small portion of our revenue from professional services and training services, for which we recognize revenue as the services are provided, and cloud-based services, for which we recognize revenue as the subscription service is delivered over the term, which is typically one year, or on a monthly usage basis. we are also starting to see a shift from product revenues to higher-margin, recurring service revenues, which reflects our ongoing success in driving sales of low-end and high-end service bundles, as well as increases in certain software sales and time based service models. our service revenue growth rate depends significantly on the growth of our customer base, the expansion of our service bundle offerings, the expansion and introduction of new service offerings and the renewal of service contracts by our existing customers.
•   cost of product revenue. a substantial majority of the cost of product revenue consists of third-party contract manufacturers' costs, as well as other costs of materials used in production. our cost of product revenue also includes supplies, shipping costs, personnel costs associated with logistics and quality control, facility-related
costs, excess and obsolete inventory costs, warranty costs, and amortization and impairment of intangible assets, if applicable. personnel costs include salaries, benefits and bonuses, as well as stock-based compensation.
•   cost of service revenue. cost of service revenue is primarily comprised of salaries, benefits and bonuses, as well as stock-based compensation. cost of service revenue also includes supplies and facility-related costs.
gross margin. gross profit as a percentage of revenue, or gross margin, has been and will continue to be affected by a variety of factors, including the average sales price of our products, any excess inventory write-offs, product costs, the mix of products sold and the mix of revenue between products, software licenses and services. service revenue and software licenses have had a positive effect on our total gross margin given the higher gross margins compared to product gross margins. during 2016, product gross margin was positively impacted by higher sales of software products, as well as inventory management and warehouse efficiencies. service gross margins remained relatively comparable in 2016 compared to 2015. we believe our overall gross margin will remain at a relatively comparable level in 2017.
operating expenses. our operating expenses consist of research and development, sales and marketing, general and administrative expenses, and restructuring charges. personnel costs are the most significant component of operating expenses and consist primarily of salaries, benefits, bonuses, stock-based compensation, and sales commissions, as applicable. we expect personnel costs to continue to increase in absolute dollars as we expand our workforce.
•   research and development. research and development expense consists primarily of personnel costs. additional research and development expenses include asic and system prototypes and certification-related expenses, depreciation of capital equipment and facility-related expenses. the majority of our research and development is focused on both software development and the ongoing development of our hardware platform. we record all research and development expenses as incurred. our research and development teams are primarily located in canada and the u.s.
•   sales and marketing. sales and marketing expense is the largest component of our operating expenses and primarily consists of personnel costs. additional sales and marketing expenses include promotional lead generation and other marketing expenses, travel, depreciation of capital equipment and facility-related expenses. we intend to hire additional personnel focused on sales and marketing and expand our sales and marketing efforts worldwide in order to capture additional market share in the high-return enterprise market, where customers tend to provide a higher lifetime value.
•   general and administrative. general and administrative expense consists of personnel costs, as well as professional fees, depreciation of capital equipment and software, facility-related expenses, expenses associated with the erp system implementation and business acquisition costs. general and administrative personnel include our executive, finance, human resources, information technology and legal organizations. our professional fees principally consist of outside legal, auditing, accounting, tax, information technology and other consulting costs.
•   restructuring charges. restructuring charges relate to alignment activities performed in connection with the meru and accelops acquisitions to reduce our cost structure and improve operational efficiencies, resulting in workforce reductions, contract terminations and other charges.
interest income. interest income consists of income earned on our cash, cash equivalents and investments. we have historically invested our cash in corporate debt securities, commercial paper, u.s. government and agency securities, municipal bonds, money market funds and certificates of deposit.
provision for income taxes. we are subject to tax in the u.s., as well as other tax jurisdictions or countries in which we conduct business. earnings from our non-u.s. activities are subject to income taxes in the local country which are generally lower than u.s. tax rates, and may be subject to u.s. income taxes. our effective tax rate differs from the u.s. statutory rate primarily due to foreign income subject to different tax rates than the u.s., research and development tax credits, withholding taxes and nondeductible stock-based compensation expense.
the income tax provision for 2016 was comprised of domestic income taxes, foreign income taxes and foreign withholding taxes. our effective tax rate approximates the u.s. federal statutory tax rates plus the impact of state taxes, excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation expense, research and development tax credits, foreign withholding tax, nondeductible stock-based compensation expense, and foreign income subject to lower tax rates than income earned in the u.s.
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with gaap. these principles require us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, cost of revenue and expenses, and related disclosures. we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. to the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and our actual results, our future financial statements will be affected.
we believe that, of the significant accounting policies described in note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k, the following accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity. accordingly, we believe these are the most critical to fully understand and evaluate our financial condition and results of operations.
revenue recognition we derive the majority of our revenue from sales of our hardware, software, fortiguard security subscription and forticare technical support services, and other services through our channel partners and a direct sales force.
revenue is recognized when all of the following criteria have been met:
•   delivery has occurred or services have been rendered. product delivery occurs when we fulfill an order and title and risk of loss has been transferred. software license delivery occurs upon electronic transfer of the license key to the customer. service revenue is deferred and recognized ratably over the contractual service period, which is typically from one to three years and, to a lesser extent, up to five years, and is generally recognized upon delivery or completion of service.
•   sales price is fixed or determinable. we assess whether the sales price is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction and when the sales price is deemed final.
•   collectability is reasonably assured. we assess collectability based primarily on creditworthiness as determined by credit checks, analysis, and payment history.
we recognize product revenue for sales to distributors that have no general right of return and direct sales to end-customers upon shipment, based on general revenue recognition accounting guidance once all other revenue recognition criteria have been met. certain distributors are granted stock rotation rights, limited rights of return and rebates for sales of our products. the arrangement fee for this group of distributors is not typically fixed or determinable when products are shipped and revenue is therefore deferred and recognized upon sell-through. for sales that include end-customer acceptance criteria, revenue is recognized upon acceptance. we recognize software license revenue upon delivery. historically, software license revenue has not been material.
substantially all of our products have been sold in combination with services, which consist of security subscriptions and technical support services. security services provide access to our antivirus, intrusion prevention, web filtering, and anti-spam functionality. support services include rights to unspecified software upgrades, maintenance releases and patches, telephone and internet access to technical support personnel, and hardware support.
service revenue consists of sales from our fortiguard security subscription and forticare technical support services, professional and training services and other services that include software as a service ("saas") and infrastructure as a service ("iaas"), both of which are hosted or cloud-based services. we recognize revenue from these arrangements as the subscription service is delivered over the term, which is typically one year, or on a monthly usage basis.  to date, saas and iaas revenues have not represented a significant percentage of our total revenue.
we reduce revenue for estimates of sales returns and allowances and record reductions to revenue for rebates and estimated commitments related to price protection and other customer incentive programs. additionally, in limited circumstances, we may permit end-customers, distributors and resellers to return our products, subject to varying limitations, for a refund within a reasonably short period from the date of purchase. we estimate and record reserves for sales incentives and sales returns based on historical experience.
our sales arrangements typically contain multiple elements, such as hardware, security subscription, technical support services and other services. the majority of our hardware appliance products contain our operating system software that together function to deliver the essential functionality of the product. our products and services generally qualify as separate units of accounting. we allocate revenue to each unit of accounting based on an estimated selling price using vendor-specific objective evidence ("vsoe") of selling price, if it exists, or third-party evidence ("tpe") of selling price. if neither vsoe nor tpe of selling price exists for a deliverable, we use our best estimate of selling price ("besp") for that deliverable. revenue allocated to each element is then recognized when the basic revenue recognition criteria are met for each element.
for our hardware appliances, we use besp as our selling price estimate. for our support and other services, we generally use vsoe as our selling price estimate. we determine vsoe of fair value for elements of an arrangement based on the historical pricing and discounting practices for those services when sold separately. in establishing vsoe, we require that a substantial majority of the selling prices for a service fall within a reasonably narrow pricing range, generally evidenced by a substantial majority of such historical stand-alone transactions falling within a reasonably narrow range as a percentage of list price. when we are unable to establish a selling price using vsoe for our support and other services, we use besp in our allocation of arrangement consideration. we determine besp for a product or service by considering multiple historical factors including, but not limited to, cost of products, gross margin objectives, pricing practices, geographies, customer classes and distribution channels that fall within a reasonably narrow range as a percentage of list price.
we currently are evaluating the impact of the new standard related to revenue recognition, and we may incur significant costs to adopt and to comply with this new pronouncement. see note 1 to our consolidated financial statements in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for further discussion.
stock-based compensation employee stock options. we estimate the fair value of employee stock options awarded to our employees using the black-scholes-merton ("black-scholes") pricing model. for all employee stock options, we recognize expense over the requisite service period using the straight-line method. our option pricing model requires the input of subjective assumptions, including the expected stock price volatility, expected term, risk-free interest rates and expected dividend yield of our common stock. the assumptions used in our option pricing model represent management's best estimates. these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management's judgment. a 10% change in any of these assumptions would not have a significant impact on our stock-based compensation expense.
employee stock purchase plan. we estimate the fair value of the rights to acquire stock under our employee stock purchase plan ("espp") using the black-scholes pricing model and we recognize expense over the requisite service period using the straight-line method. the pricing model requires the input of the fair value of our common stock and assumptions, including the expected term of the award, expected volatility of the price of our common stock, risk-free interest rates and expected dividend yield of our common stock. our espp provides for consecutive six-month offering periods and we use our own historical volatility data in the valuation of espp shares. a 10% change in any of these assumptions would not have a significant impact on our stock-based compensation expense.
valuation of inventory inventory is recorded at the lower of cost (using the first-in, first-out method) or market, after we give appropriate consideration to obsolescence and inventory in excess of anticipated future demand. in assessing the ultimate recoverability of inventory, we make estimates regarding future customer demand, the timing of new product introductions, economic trends and market conditions. if the actual product demand is significantly lower than forecasted, we could be required to record additional inventory write-downs which would be charged to cost of product revenue. any write-downs could have an adverse impact on our gross margins and profitability.
business combinations we include the results of operations of the businesses that we acquire as of the respective dates of acquisition. we allocate the fair value of the purchase price of our business acquisitions to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and intangible assets acquired, based on their estimated fair values. the excess of the purchase price over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. we often continue to gather additional information throughout the measurement period, and if we make changes to the amounts recorded, such charges are recorded in the period in which they are identified.
restructuring our restructuring expenses consist of severance and other one-time benefits, contract terminations and other expenses. liabilities for costs associated with a restructuring activity are measured at fair value. one-time termination benefits are expensed at the date we notify the employee, unless the employee must provide future service, in which case the benefits are expensed ratably over the future service period. a liability for terminating a contract before the end of its term, which termination is usually done by giving written notice to the counterparty within the notification period specified by the contract or by otherwise negotiating a termination with the counterparty, is recognized at fair value on the notification date. a liability for costs that will continue to be incurred under a contract for its remaining term without economic benefit to the entity is recognized at the cease-use date. other costs primarily consist of asset write-offs, which are expensed when incurred.
we continually evaluate the adequacy of the remaining liabilities under our restructuring initiatives. although we believe that these estimates accurately reflect the costs of our restructuring plan, actual results may differ and thereby require us to record an additional provision or reverse a portion of such a provision.
accounting for income taxes we record income taxes using the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. in addition, deferred tax assets are recorded for the future benefit of utilizing net operating losses and research and development credit carryforwards. deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets and liabilities are expected to be realized or settled. valuation allowances are provided when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.
we recognize tax benefits from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not, based on the technical merits of the position that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities. the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement.
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate our taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. we estimate actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items, such as accruals and allowances not currently deductible for tax purposes. these differences result in deferred tax assets, which are included in our consolidated balance sheets. in general, deferred tax assets represent future tax benefits to be received when certain expenses previously recognized in our consolidated statements of operations become deductible expenses under applicable income tax laws, or loss or credit carryforwards are utilized.
in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized. the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. we continue to assess the need for a valuation allowance on the deferred tax assets by evaluating both positive and negative evidence that may
we make estimates and judgments about our future taxable income that are based on assumptions that are consistent with our plans and estimates. should the actual amounts differ from our estimates, the amount of our tax expense and liabilities could be materially impacted.
gross profit:
total gross profit                               937,606                 722,491                 539,355
gross profit:
total revenue increased by $266.2 million, or 26%, in 2016 compared to 2015. we continued to experience global diversification of revenue in 2016. revenue from all our regions grew, with emea contributing the largest portion of our revenue growth both on an absolute dollar and on a percentage basis. product revenue increased by $71.3 million, or 15%, in
2016 compared to 2015. the increase in product revenue was primarily driven by greater sales volume in our fortigate product family across all product categories and in particular for our high-end and mid-range products for large enterprise customers. sales of non-fortigate products, such as fortisandbox, also grew significantly. service revenue increased by $194.8 million, or 37%, in 2016 compared to 2015. the increase in service revenue was primarily due to the recognition of revenue from our growing deferred revenue balance consisting of fortiguard security subscription and forticare technical support contracts sold to a larger customer base, as well as the renewals of similar contracts sold in earlier periods. we are also starting to see a shift from product revenues to higher-margin, recurring service revenues, which reflect our ongoing success in driving sales of low-end and high-end service bundles.
total gross margin increased by 1.9 percentage points in 2016 compared to 2015, as both product and service gross margins increased. product gross margin increased by 1.8 percentage points in 2016 compared to 2015. product gross margin was positively impacted by higher sales of software products such as certain of our virtualized security solutions and by lower warranty related costs, and was partially offset by higher inventory reserves.
sales and marketing sales and marketing expense increased by $156.1 million, or 33%, in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily due to an increase of $122.3 million in personnel costs as we continued to increase our sales and marketing headcount in order to drive continued market share gains globally. in addition, depreciation expense and other occupancy-related expense increased by $14.0 million, and travel and entertainment expense increased by $8.1 million. marketing-related expense increased by $7.6 million as we invested significantly in marketing programs to capture market share, particularly in the large enterprise market, including costs related to trade shows and lead generation. as a percentage of total revenue, sales and marketing expense increased as we accelerated the investment in our sales force and marketing programs to drive future growth. we intend to continue to make investments in our sales resources and infrastructure and marketing strategy, which are critical to support growth, but expect sales and marketing expense as a percentage of total revenue to decline in 2017.
general and administrative general and administrative expense increased by $9.6 million, or 13%, in 2016 compared to 2015. personnel costs increased by $9.6 million as we continued to increase headcount in order to support our expanding business and erp implementation. during 2016, we expensed $7.8 million of third-party costs relating to the implementation and maintenance of the erp system implementation compared to $5.4 million in 2015. these increases were partially offset by lower professional fees of $6.7 million in 2016. as a percentage of total revenue, we expect general and administrative expense to increase compared to 2016 as we continue to expand our erp capabilities and implement the new revenue recognition standard.
restructuring restructuring expenses of $4.0 million in 2016 primarily relate to our restructuring activities to improve operating efficiencies due to the acquisition of accelops and certain other activities. restructuring charges of $7.6 million during 2015 relate to restructuring activities in connection with the meru acquisition. see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for additional details, including the types of expenses incurred and cash payments made. see also the "liquidity and capital resources" section of this part ii, item 7, "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations."
our effective tax rate was 25% for 2016, compared with an effective tax rate of 53% for 2015. the provision for income taxes for 2016 was comprised primarily of u.s. federal and state taxes, other foreign income taxes, foreign withholding taxes, an increase in tax reserves, as well as transfer pricing allocations that impact jurisdictional income taxed at various tax rates. the decrease in the effective tax rate in 2016 was primarily due to the recognition of excess tax benefits for income tax provision from the adoption of asu 2016-09. in 2016, due to the early adoption of asu 2016-09, approximately $10.8 million
of excess tax benefits were recognized in the income tax provision. in 2015, there were no excess tax benefits included in the income tax provision.
it is our policy to classify accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for income taxes. as of december 31, 2016, we had accrued $9.5 million for estimated interest related to uncertain tax provisions compared to an accrual of $5.5 million as of december 31, 2015.
within the next twelve months, we do not believe there will be a decrease in uncertain tax benefits that could significantly impact our effective tax rate.
total revenue increased by $238.9 million, or 31%, in 2015 compared to 2014. total revenue in 2015 of $1.01 billion included meru's revenue from july 8, 2015 to december 31, 2015 of $28.1 million, or 3% of total revenue.  excluding meru's revenue, our revenue was $981.2 million, an increase of 27% compared to the same period last year. we continued to experience global diversification of revenue in 2015. the americas region contributed the largest portion of our revenue growth on an absolute dollar basis and all three regions showed growth on a percentage basis. product revenue increased by $116.2 million, or 32%, in 2015 compared to 2014. the increase in product revenue was primarily driven by greater sales volume in our fortigate product family across all product categories, particularly in our high-end products for large enterprise customers. service revenue increased by $122.7 million, or 30%, in 2015 compared to 2014. the increase in service revenue was primarily due to the recognition of revenue from our growing deferred revenue balance consisting of fortiguard security subscription and forticare technical support contracts sold to a larger customer base, as well as the renewals of similar contracts sold in earlier periods.
total gross margin increased by 1.6 percentage points in 2015 compared to 2014, as both product and service gross margins increased. product gross margin increased by 2.1 percentage points in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily due to a greater mix of high-end fortigate product sales compared to the same period last year, such as our fortigate-5000 series. in addition, product gross margin was positively impacted by higher sales of software products such as certain of our virtualized security solutions, as well as by inventory management efficiencies.
service gross margin increased during 2015 as compared to 2014, as we scaled efficiencies resulting from our ability to charge more for our fortiguard security subscription and forticare technical support offerings. cost of service revenue increased by $16.7 million primarily due to an $11.6 million increase in personnel costs related to headcount increases.
* not meaningful research and development research and development expense increased by $35.2 million, or 29%, in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily due to an increase of $25.8 million in personnel costs as a result of increased headcount to support the development of new products and continued enhancements of our existing products. depreciation and other occupancy-related costs increased by $3.6 million. in addition, during 2014, we had a reversal of $3.0 million related to a previously recorded liability for estimated contingent consideration.
sales and marketing sales and marketing expense increased by $154.6 million, or 49%, in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily due to an increase of $108.0 million in personnel costs as we continued to increase our sales and marketing headcount. marketing-related expenses increased by $16.9 million as we invested significantly in marketing investments to drive broader market awareness, create a global marketing engine, build broad market lead generation and nurture programs and accelerate pipeline. in addition, we incurred increases in travel expenses of $9.1 million, and depreciation and occupancy-related costs of $9.3 million. as a
general and administrative general and administrative expense increased by $30.2 million, or 73%, in 2015 compared to 2014. personnel costs increased by $14.6 million as we continued to increase headcount in order to support our expanding business. in addition, professional fees increased by $6.9 million, primarily due to legal services related to the assertion of our intellectual property and other rights. in 2015, we also incurred $5.4 million in third party expenses related to business process design and reengineering in preparation of an erp system implementation and $1.7 million of costs related to the meru acquisition.
restructuring restructuring expenses of $7.6 million in 2015, primarily relate to the restructuring activities in connection with the meru acquisition to reduce our cost structure and improve operational efficiencies. see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for additional details, including types of expenses incurred and the timing of future expenses and cash payments. see also the "liquidity and capital resources" section of this part ii, item 7, "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations."
our effective tax rate was 53% for 2015, compared with an effective tax rate of 59% for 2014. the provision for income taxes for 2015 was comprised primarily of u.s. federal and state taxes, other foreign income taxes, foreign withholding taxes and an increase in tax reserves, as well as the inclusion of stock-based compensation benefits and transfer pricing allocations which impacted jurisdictional income taxed at various tax rates. the decrease in the effective tax rate in 2015 was primarily due to higher research and development credits, additional tax benefits related to stock-based compensation expense and lower foreign withholding taxes.
it is our policy to classify accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for income taxes. as of december 31, 2015, we had accrued $5.5 million for estimated interest related to uncertain tax provisions compared to an accrual of $1.7 million as of december 31, 2014.
quarterly results of operations the following table sets forth our unaudited quarterly statements of operations data for the last eight quarters. the information for each of these quarters has been prepared on the same basis as the audited annual financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report and, in the opinion of management, includes all adjustments, which includes only normal recurring adjustments, necessary for the fair presentation of the results of operations for these periods. this data should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report. these quarterly operating results are not necessarily indicative of our operating results for any future period.
total gross profit                                271,939                231,847                226,888                206,932                214,553                188,367                170,287              149,284
provision for (benefit from) income taxes          18,341        298                             (2,302    )            (5,376    )            15,570                 (9,329    )             2,694                   83
(3)   in march 2016, the financial accounting standards board issued accounting standard update ("asu") no. 2016-09, which allows a company to make a policy election to account for forfeitures as they occur. we early adopted this standard and elected to account for forfeitures as they occur using the modified retrospective transition method. the adoption of this standard resulted in a decrease of $2.0 million in our share-based compensation during the first quarter of 2016. the adoption of asu 2016-09 resulted in a decrease of $3.6 million in our provision for income taxes during the first quarter of 2016.
seasonality, cyclicality and quarterly revenue trends our quarterly results reflect a pattern of increased customer buying at year-end, which has positively impacted billings and product revenue activity in the fourth quarter. in the first quarter, we generally experience lower sequential customer buying, which results in lower billings and product revenue. although these seasonal factors are common in the technology sector, historical patterns should not be considered a reliable indicator of our future sales activity or performance. on a quarterly basis, we have usually generated the majority of our product revenue in the final month of each quarter and a significant amount in the last two weeks of each quarter. we believe this is due to customer buying patterns typical in this industry.
our total quarterly revenue over the past eight quarters has generally increased sequentially in each quarter, except in the first quarters of 2016 and 2015. product revenue, on average throughout the year, increased in 2016 as compared to the same quarters in 2015, which we believe was due in part to the investments made in our sales and marketing organizations, to a robust security market and to continued product innovation. we are also starting to see a shift from product revenues to higher-margin, recurring service revenues, which reflect our ongoing success in driving sales of low-end and high-end service bundles.
total gross margin has fluctuated on a quarterly basis primarily due to shifts in the mix of sales between products and services and between products. product gross margin varies based on the types of products sold and the average selling prices of our products. in addition, product gross margin was positively impacted by higher sales of software products such as certain of our virtualized security solutions, as well as inventory management efficiencies. service gross margins, on average throughout the year, increased in 2016 compared to 2015 due to a mix shift to higher-margin service revenue, as well as scaled efficiencies.

liquidity and capital resources may be impacted by our operating activities, as well as by our business acquisitions, real estate and other capital expenditures, stock repurchases, proceeds associated with stock option exercises and issuances of common stock under the employee stock purchase plan, payment of taxes in connection with the net settlement of equity awards, and investments in strategic relationships that we have made or may make in the future. our previous stock repurchase program (the "2015 repurchase program") expired on december 31, 2015 with an unused balance under the 2015 repurchase program of $62.5 million. in january 2016, our board of directors approved a new share repurchase program, which authorizes the repurchase of up to $200.0 million of our outstanding common stock through december 31, 2017. in october 2016, our board of directors authorized the purchase of additional $100.0 million of shares of our common stock under the 2016 repurchase program, increasing our current authorization to $300.0 million through december 31, 2017. in recent years we have received significant capital resources as a result of the exercise of stock options. we expect proceeds in future years to be impacted by the increased mix of restricted stock units ("rsu") granted versus stock options and also to vary based on our share price. we expect to spend $140.0 million to $150.0 million in capital expenditures primarily related to purchase of real estate to expand our offices to support worldwide growth.
as of december 31, 2016, our cash, cash equivalents, and investments of $1.31 billion were invested primarily in corporate debt securities, commercial paper, u.s. government and agency securities, municipal bonds, money market funds, certificates of deposit and term deposits. it is our investment policy to invest excess cash in a manner that preserves capital, provides liquidity and maximizes return without significantly increasing risk.
as of december 31, 2016, $504.8 million of our cash and investments were held by our international subsidiaries and are therefore not immediately available to fund domestic operations unless the cash is repatriated. while we do not intend to do so, should this amount be repatriated, most of it would be subject to u.s. federal income tax that would be partially offset by foreign tax credits. in the fourth quarter of 2016, we repatriated $55.0 million of cash from offshore. a decision was made to bring this cash back to the u.s. as it carried a substantial foreign tax credit amounting to $22.3 million. we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes. we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next 12 months. our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our growth rate, the timing and extent of spending to support development efforts, the expansion of sales and marketing activities, the introduction of new and enhanced products and services offerings, the costs to ensure access to adequate manufacturing capacity, the continuing market acceptance of our products and our investments in real estate through purchases or long-term leases. we anticipate our capital expenditures spending in 2017 to be approximately $140.0 million to $150.0 million. such capital expenditures include purchases completed in january 2017, purchases currently in escrow and purchases signed but not yet in escrow totaling $2.7 million, $88.0 million and $13.0 million, respectively. historically, we have required capital principally to fund our working capital needs, capital expenditures, share repurchases and acquisition activities. in the event that additional financing is required from outside sources, we may not be able to raise it on terms acceptable to us or at all. if we are unable to raise additional capital when desired, our business, operating results and financial condition would be adversely affected.
operating activities cash generated by operating activities is our primary source of liquidity. it is primarily comprised of net income, as adjusted for non-cash items, and changes in operating assets and liabilities. non-cash adjustments consist primarily of stock-based compensation, depreciation of property and equipment, amortization of intangible assets and amortization of investment premiums.
our operating activities during 2016 provided $345.7 million in cash as a result of our continued growth of our business and the ability to successfully manage our working capital. changes in operating assets and liabilities primarily resulted from an increase in sales of our fortiguard security subscription and forticare technical supports to new and existing customers, as reflected by an increase in our deferred revenue, which was partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable and payments for inventory purchases. we are also starting to see a shift from product revenues to higher-margin, recurring service revenues. for example, our total revenue grew 26% in 2016 compared to 2015, while our total deferred revenue balance grew 31%.
our operating activities during 2015 provided $282.5 million in cash as a result of our continued growth in billings and the ability to successfully manage our working capital. additionally, in 2015, we received $9.0 million related to a mutual three-year covenant-not-to-sue agreement. changes in operating assets and liabilities primarily resulted from an increase in payments received from customers, partially offset by an increase in payments to vendors.
our operating activities during 2014 provided $196.6 million in cash as a result of profitability, timing of billings and collections, and the ability to successfully manage our working capital. the primary sources of cash from operating activities during 2014 consisted of net income of $25.3 million, increased by non-cash adjustments of $93.9 million and changes in operating assets and liabilities of $77.4 million. in 2014, we received $20.0 million pursuant to a six-year mutual covenant-not-to-sue and release agreement with palo alto networks. changes in operating assets and liabilities primarily included an increase in payments received from customers and a receipt of cash related to the mutual covenant-not-to-sue and release agreement, partially offset by payments for inventory purchases, prepayment of certain expenses and payments of income taxes during the period.
investing activities the changes in cash flows from investing activities primarily relate to timing of purchases, maturities and sales of investments, purchases of property and equipment, and payments made in connection with business acquisitions. historically, in making a lease versus purchase decision related to our larger facilities, we have elected to purchase the facility. we expect to make similar decisions in the future.
during 2016, cash used for investing activities was primarily due to the $67.2 million we spent on capital expenditures, including our purchases of a warehouse in union city, california for total cash of $18.5 million, and a $22.1 million payment for the acquisition of accelops. the outflow of cash was partially offset by positive cash flow due to maturities, net of purchases, from our investments of $15.1 million.
during 2015, cash used for investing activities was primarily due to $38.0 million used for the acquisition of meru. in addition we spent $37.4 million on capital expenditures, including our purchases of certain real properties in sunnyvale, california and sophia, france for total cash of $13.9 million. the outflow of cash was partially offset by positive cash flow due to maturities, net of purchases, from our investments of $74.4 million.
during 2014, cash used for investing activities was primarily due to $32.2 million spent on capital expenditures, partially offset by positive cash flow due to maturities, net of purchases, from our investments of $2.9 million.
financing activities the changes in cash flows from financing activities primarily relate to proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our equity incentive plan and espp, taxes paid related to net share settlement of equity awards, excess tax benefit from stock-based compensation, and repurchase and retirement of common stock.
during 2016, cash used for financing activities was $105.9 million, primarily due to $110.8 million used to repurchase our common stock. this was partially offset by $6.6 million of proceeds from the issuance of common stock, net of tax withholding.
during 2015, cash used for financing activities was $21.6 million primarily due to $60.0 million used to repurchase our common stock. this was partially offset by $38.4 million of proceeds from the issuance of common stock, net of tax withholding.
during 2014, cash provided by financing activities was $0.7 million as a result of proceeds of $55.3 million from the issuance of common stock under our stock plans. this cash inflow was partially offset by $44.0 million used to repurchase our common stock and $10.6 million of taxes payment related to withholding.
contractual obligations and commitments the following summarizes our contractual obligations as of december 31, 2016:
operating lease commitments (1)                                  $65,489                 $17,699                 $35,510             $6,416                $5,864
inventory purchase commitments (2)                                91,247                  91,247                       -             -                     -
other contractual commitments and open purchase orders (3)        50,686                  45,953                   4,733             -                     -
(2)   consists of minimum purchase commitments with independent contract manufacturers.
(3)   consists of an estimate of open purchase orders and contractual obligations in the ordinary course of business, other than commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers, for which we have not received the goods or services. no tax liabilities related to uncertain tax positions have been included in the table. as of december 31, 2016, we had $68.6 million of long-term tax liabilities, including interest, related to uncertain tax positions. because of the high degree of uncertainty regarding the settlement of these liabilities, we are unable to estimate the years in which future cash outflows may occur.
off-balance sheet arrangements during 2016, 2015 and 2014, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated organizations or financial partnerships, such as structured finance or special purpose entities that would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes.

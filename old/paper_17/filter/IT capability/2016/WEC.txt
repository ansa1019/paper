item 1a. risk factors we are subject to a variety of risks, many of which are beyond our control, that may adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. you should carefully consider the following risk factors, as well as the other information included in this report and other documents filed by us with the sec from time to time, when making an investment decision.
risks related to legislation and regulation our business is significantly impacted by governmental regulation.
we are subject to significant state, local, and federal governmental regulation, including regulation by the various utility commissions in the states where we serve customers. this regulation significantly influences our operating environment and may affect our ability to recover costs from utility customers. many aspects of our operations are regulated, including, but not limited to: the rates we charge our retail electric, natural gas, and steam customers; wholesale power service practices; electric reliability requirements and accounting; participation in the interstate natural gas pipeline capacity market; standards of service; issuance of securities; short-term debt obligations; construction and operation of facilities; transactions with affiliates; and billing practices. our significant level of regulation imposes restrictions on our operations and causes us to incur substantial compliance costs. failure to comply with any applicable rules or regulations may lead to customer refunds, penalties, and other payments, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
the rates, including adjustments determined under riders, we are allowed to charge our customers for retail and wholesale services have the most significant impact on our financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity. rate regulation is based on providing an opportunity to recover prudently incurred costs and earn a reasonable rate of return on invested capital. however, our ability to obtain rate adjustments in the future is dependent on regulatory action, and there is no assurance that our regulators will consider all of our costs to have been prudently incurred. in addition, our rate proceedings may not always result in rates that fully recover our costs or provide for a reasonable roe. we defer certain costs and revenues as regulatory assets and liabilities for future recovery or refund to customers, as authorized by our regulators. future recovery of regulatory assets is not assured, and is subject to review and approval by our regulators. if recovery of regulatory assets is not approved or is no longer deemed probable, these costs would be recognized in current period expense and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition.
we believe we have obtained the necessary permits, approvals, authorizations, certificates, and licenses for our existing operations, have complied with all of their associated terms, and that our businesses are conducted in accordance with applicable laws. these permits, approvals, authorizations, certificates, and licenses may be revoked or modified by the agencies that granted them if facts develop that differ significantly from the facts assumed when they were issued. in addition, discharge permits and other approvals and licenses are often granted for a term that is less than the expected life of the associated facility. licenses and permits may require periodic renewal, which may result in additional requirements being imposed by the granting agency. in addition, existing regulations may be revised or reinterpreted by federal, state, and local agencies, or these agencies may adopt new laws and regulations that apply to us. we cannot predict the impact on our business and operating results of any such actions by these agencies. changes in regulations, interpretations of regulations, or the imposition of new regulations could influence our operating environment, may result in substantial compliance costs, or may require us to change our business operations.
if we are unable to obtain, renew, or comply with these governmental permits, approvals, authorizations, certificates, or licenses, or if we are unable to recover any increased costs of complying with additional requirements or any other associated costs in customer rates in a timely manner, our results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.
we may face significant costs to comply with existing and future environmental laws and regulations.
our operations are subject to numerous federal and state environmental laws and regulations. these laws and regulations govern, among other things, air emissions (including co2, methane, mercury, so2, and nox), water quality, wastewater discharges, and management of hazardous, toxic, and solid wastes and substances. we incur significant costs to comply with these environmental requirements, including costs associated with the installation of pollution control equipment, environmental monitoring, emissions fees, and permits at our facilities. in addition, if we fail to comply with environmental laws and regulations, even if caused by factors beyond our control, that failure may result in the assessment of civil or criminal penalties and fines.
the epa adopted and implemented (or is in the process of implementing) regulations governing the emission of nox, so2, fine particulate matter, mercury, and other air pollutants under the caa through the naaqs, the mats rule, the clean power plan, the
2016 form 10-k   23   wec energy group, inc.
csapr, and other air quality regulations. in addition, the epa finalized regulations under the clean water act that govern cooling water intake structures at our power plants and revised the effluent guidelines for steam electric generating plants. the epa has also adopted a final rule that would expand traditional federal jurisdiction over navigable waters and related wetlands for permitting and other regulatory matters; however, this rule has been stayed. we continue to assess the potential cost of complying, and to explore different alternatives in order to comply, with these and other environmental regulations. in addition, as a result of the new federal executive administration taking office in january 2017 and other factors, there is uncertainty as to what capital expenditures or additional costs may ultimately be required to comply with existing and future environmental laws and regulations.
existing environmental laws and regulations may be revised or new laws or regulations may be adopted at the federal or state level that could result in significant additional expenditures for our generation units or distribution systems, including, without limitation, costs to further limit ghg emissions from our operations; operating restrictions on our facilities; and increased compliance costs. in addition, the operation of emission control equipment and compliance with rules regulating our intake and discharge of water could increase our operating costs and reduce the generating capacity of our power plants. any such regulation may also create substantial additional costs in the form of taxes or emission allowances and could affect the availability and/or cost of fossil fuels.
as a result, certain of our coal-fired electric generating facilities may become uneconomical to maintain and operate, which could result in some of these units being retired early or converted to an alternative type of fuel. for example, we expect to retire the remaining pulliam coal-fired units in the next several years. if generation facility owners in the midwest, including us, retire a significant number of older coal-fired generation facilities, a potential reduction in the region's capacity reserve margin below acceptable risk levels may result. this could impair the reliability of the grid in the midwest, particularly during peak demand periods. a reduction in available future capacity could also adversely affect our ability to serve our customers' needs.
our electric and natural gas utilities are also subject to significant liabilities related to the investigation and remediation of environmental impacts at certain of our current and former facilities and at third-party owned sites. we accrue liabilities and defer costs (recorded as regulatory assets) incurred in connection with our former manufactured gas plant sites. these costs include all costs incurred to date that we expect to recover, management's best estimates of future costs for investigation and remediation, and related legal expenses, and are net of amounts recovered by or that may be recovered from insurance or other third parties. due to the potential for imposition of stricter standards and greater regulation in the future, as well as the possibility that other potentially responsible parties may not be financially able to contribute to cleanup costs, conditions may change or additional contamination may be discovered, our remediation costs could increase, and the timing of our capital and/or operating expenditures in the future may accelerate or could vary from the amounts currently accrued.
in the event we are not able to recover all of our environmental expenditures and related costs from our customers in the future, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. further, increased costs recovered through rates could contribute to reduced demand for electricity, which could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition.
litigation over environmental issues and claims of various types, including property damage, personal injury, common law nuisance, and citizen enforcement of environmental laws and regulations, has increased generally throughout the united states. in particular, personal injury, property damage, and other claims for damages alleged to have been caused by environmental impacts and alleged exposure to hazardous materials have become more frequent. in addition to claims relating to our current facilities, we may also be subject to potential liability in connection with the environmental condition of facilities that we previously owned and operated, regardless of whether the liabilities arose before, during, or after the time we owned or operated these facilities. if we fail to comply with environmental laws and regulations or cause (or caused) harm to the environment or persons, that failure or harm may result in the assessment of civil penalties and damages against us. the incurrence of a material environmental liability or a material judgment in any action for personal injury or property damage related to environmental matters could have a significant adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
we may face significant costs to comply with the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions.
federal, state, regional, and international authorities have undertaken efforts to limit ghg emissions. in 2015, the epa issued the clean power plan, which is a final rule that regulates ghg emissions from existing generating units, as well as a proposed federal plan as an alternative to state compliance plans. the epa also issued final performance standards for modified and reconstructed generating units, as well as for new fossil-fueled power plants. with the january 2017 change in the federal executive administration, the legal and regulatory future of federal ghg regulations, including the clean power plan, faces increased uncertainty. we are continuing to analyze the ghg emission profile of our electric generation resources and to work with other stakeholders to determine the potential impacts to our operations of the clean power plan, any successor rule, and federal ghg
2016 form 10-k   24   wec energy group, inc.
regulations in general. in october 2015, numerous states (including wisconsin and michigan), trade associations, and private parties filed lawsuits challenging the clean power plan, including a request to stay the implementation of the final rule pending the outcome of these legal challenges. the d.c. circuit court of appeals denied the stay request, but in february 2016, the supreme court stayed the effectiveness of the clean power plan rules until disposition of the litigation in the d.c. circuit court of appeals and to the extent that further appellate review is sought, at the supreme court. in addition, in february 2016, the governor of wisconsin issued executive order 186, which prohibits state agencies, departments, boards, commissions, or other state entities from developing or promoting the development of a state plan. the clean power plan or its successor is not expected to result in significant additional compliance costs, including capital expenditures, but may impact how we operate our existing fossil-fueled power plants and biomass facility.
there is no guarantee that we will be allowed to fully recover costs incurred to comply with the clean power plan or other federal regulations, or that cost recovery will not be delayed or otherwise conditioned. the clean power plan and any other related regulations that may be adopted in the future, at either the federal or state level, may cause our environmental compliance spending to differ materially from the amounts currently estimated. in december 2016, michigan enacted act 342, which requires additional renewable energy requirements beyond 2015. the new legislation retains the 10% renewable energy portfolio requirement for years 2016 through 2018, increases the requirement to 12.5% for years 2019 through 2020, and increases the requirement to 15.0% for 2021. these regulations, as well as changes in the fuel markets and advances in technology, could make some of our electric generating units uneconomic to maintain or operate, and could affect unit retirement and replacement decisions. these regulations could also adversely affect our future results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition.
in addition, our natural gas delivery systems and natural gas storage fields may generate fugitive gas as a result of normal operations and as a result of excavation, construction, and repair. fugitive gas typically vents to the atmosphere and consists primarily of methane. co2 is also a byproduct of natural gas consumption. as a result, future regulation of ghg emissions could increase the price of natural gas, restrict the use of natural gas, and adversely affect our ability to operate our natural gas facilities. a significant increase in the price of natural gas may increase rates for our natural gas customers, which could reduce natural gas demand.
we may be negatively impacted by changes in federal income tax policy.
we are impacted by united states federal income tax policy. both the new federal executive administration and the republicans in the house of representatives have made public statements in support of comprehensive tax reform, including significant changes to corporate income tax laws. these proposed changes include, among other things, a reduction in the corporate income tax rate, the immediate deductibility of 100% of capital expenditures, and the elimination of the interest expense deduction. we are currently unable to predict whether these reform discussions will result in any significant changes to existing tax laws, or if any such changes would have a cumulative positive or negative impact on us. however, it is possible that changes in the united states federal income tax laws could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. for example, any changes that eliminate the interest expense deduction, particularly to the extent applicable to existing indebtedness at our holding company and non-utility operations, could have a negative impact on our financial condition. in addition, the immediate deductibility of capital expenditures could have the effect of reducing growth in our regulated rate base, which could negatively impact our results of operations.
our electric utilities could be subject to higher costs and penalties as a result of mandatory reliability standards.
our electric utilities are subject to mandatory reliability and critical infrastructure protection standards established by the north american electric reliability corporation and enforced by the ferc. the critical infrastructure protection standards focus on controlling access to critical physical and cyber security assets. compliance with the mandatory reliability standards could subject our electric utilities to higher operating costs. if our electric utilities were ever found to be in noncompliance with the mandatory reliability standards, they could be subject to sanctions, including substantial monetary penalties.
provisions of the wisconsin utility holding company act limit our ability to invest in non-utility businesses and could deter takeover attempts by a potential purchaser of our common stock that would be willing to pay a premium for our common stock.
under the wisconsin utility holding company act, we remain subject to certain restrictions that have the potential of limiting our diversification into non-utility businesses. under the act, the sum of certain assets of all non-utility affiliates in a holding company system generally may not exceed 25% of the assets of all public utility affiliates in the system, subject to certain exceptions.
in addition, the act precludes the acquisition of 10% or more of the voting shares of a holding company of a wisconsin public utility unless the pscw has first determined that the acquisition is in the best interests of utility customers, investors, and the public. this
2016 form 10-k   25   wec energy group, inc.
provision and other requirements of the act may delay or reduce the likelihood of a sale or change of control of wec energy group. as a result, stockholders may be deprived of opportunities to sell some or all of their shares of our common stock at prices that represent a premium over market prices.
risks related to the operation of our business our operations are subject to risks arising from the reliability of our electric generation, transmission, and distribution facilities, natural gas infrastructure facilities, and other facilities, as well as the reliability of third-party transmission providers.
our financial performance depends on the successful operation of our electric generation and natural gas and electric distribution facilities. the operation of these facilities involves many risks, including operator error and the breakdown or failure of equipment or processes. potential breakdown or failure may occur due to severe weather; catastrophic events (i.e., fires, earthquakes, explosions, tornadoes, floods, droughts, pandemic health events, etc.); significant changes in water levels in waterways; fuel supply or transportation disruptions; accidents; employee labor disputes; construction delays or cost overruns; shortages of or delays in obtaining equipment, material, and/or labor; performance below expected levels; operating limitations that may be imposed by environmental or other regulatory requirements; terrorist attacks; or cyber security intrusions. any of these events could lead to substantial financial losses.
because our electric generation facilities are interconnected with third-party transmission facilities, the operation of our facilities could also be adversely affected by events impacting their systems. unplanned outages at our power plants may reduce our revenues or cause us to incur significant costs if we are required to operate our higher cost electric generators or purchase replacement power to satisfy our obligations, and could result in additional maintenance expenses.
insurance, warranties, performance guarantees, or recovery through the regulatory process may not cover any or all of these lost revenues or increased expenses, which could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows.
our operations are subject to various conditions that can result in fluctuations in energy sales to customers, including customer growth and general economic conditions in our service areas, varying weather conditions, and energy conservation efforts.
our results of operations and cash flows are affected by the demand for electricity and natural gas, which can vary greatly based upon:
•   fluctuations in customer growth and general economic conditions in our service areas. customer growth and energy use can be negatively impacted by population declines as well as economic factors in our service territories, including job losses, decreases in income, and business closings. our electric and natural gas utilities are impacted by economic cycles and the competitiveness of the commercial and industrial customers we serve. any economic downturn or disruption of financial markets could adversely affect the financial condition of our customers and demand for their products. these risks could directly influence the demand for electricity and natural gas as well as the need for additional power generation and generating facilities. we could also be exposed to greater risks of accounts receivable write-offs if customers are unable to pay their bills.
•   weather conditions. demand for electricity is greater in the summer and winter months associated with cooling and heating. in addition, demand for natural gas peaks in the winter heating season. as a result, our overall results may fluctuate substantially on a seasonal basis. in addition, milder temperatures during the summer cooling season and during the winter heating season may result in lower revenues and net income.
•   our customers' continued focus on energy conservation and ability to meet their own energy needs. our customers' use of electricity and natural gas has decreased as a result of individual conservation efforts, including the use of more energy efficient technologies. these conservation efforts could continue. customers could also voluntarily reduce their consumption of energy in response to decreases in their disposable income and increases in energy prices. conservation of energy can be influenced by certain federal and state programs that are intended to influence how consumers use energy. in addition, several states, including wisconsin and michigan, have adopted energy efficiency targets to reduce energy consumption by certain dates.
as part of our planning process, we estimate the impacts of changes in customer growth and general economic conditions, weather, and customer energy conservation efforts, but risks still remain. any of these matters, as well as any regulatory delay in adjusting rates as a result of reduced sales from effective conservation measures or the adoption of new technologies, could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition.
2016 form 10-k   26   wec energy group, inc.
we are actively involved with several significant capital projects, which are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could adversely affect project costs and completion of construction projects.
our business requires substantial capital expenditures for investments in, among other things, capital improvements to our electric generating facilities, electric and natural gas distribution infrastructure, natural gas storage, and other projects, including projects for environmental compliance. in addition, wbs has various capital projects that are primarily related to the development of software applications used to support our utilities.
achieving the intended benefits of any large construction project is subject to many uncertainties, some of which we will have limited or no control over, that could adversely affect project costs and completion time. these risks include, but are not limited to, the ability to adhere to established budgets and time frames; the availability of labor or materials at estimated costs; the ability of contractors to perform under their contracts; strikes; adverse weather conditions; potential legal challenges; changes in applicable laws or regulations; other governmental actions; continued public and policymaker support for such projects; and events in the global economy. in addition, certain of these projects require the approval of our regulators. if construction of commission-approved projects should materially and adversely deviate from the schedules, estimates, and projections on which the approval was based, our regulators may deem the additional capital costs as imprudent and disallow recovery of them through rates.
to the extent that delays occur, costs become unrecoverable, or we otherwise become unable to effectively manage and complete our capital projects, our results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition may be adversely affected.
advances in technology could make our electric generating facilities less competitive.
research and development activities are ongoing for new technologies that produce power or reduce power consumption. these technologies include renewable energy, customer-oriented generation, energy storage, and energy efficiency. we generate power at central station power plants to achieve economies of scale and produce power at a competitive cost. there are distributed generation technologies that produce power, including fuel cells, microturbines, wind turbines, and solar cells, which have become more cost competitive. it is possible that legislation or regulations could be adopted supporting the use of these technologies. there is also a risk that advances in technology will continue to reduce the costs of these alternative methods of producing power to a level that is competitive with that of central station power production. if these technologies become cost competitive and achieve economies of scale, our market share could be eroded, and the value of our generating facilities could be reduced. advances in technology could also change the channels through which our electric customers purchase or use power, which could reduce our sales and revenues or increase our expenses.
our operations are subject to risks beyond our control, including but not limited to, cyber security intrusions, terrorist attacks, acts of war, or unauthorized access to personally identifiable information.
we face the risk of terrorist attacks and cyber intrusions, both threatened and actual, against our generation facilities, electric and natural gas distribution infrastructure, our information and technology systems, and network infrastructure, including that of third parties on which we rely, any of which could result in a full or partial disruption of our ability to generate, transmit, purchase, or distribute electricity or natural gas or cause environmental repercussions. any operational disruption or environmental repercussions could result in a significant decrease in our revenues or significant reconstruction or remediation costs, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.
we operate in an industry that requires the use of sophisticated information technology systems and network infrastructure, which control an interconnected system of generation, distribution, and transmission systems shared with third parties. a successful physical or cyber security intrusion may occur despite our security measures or those that we require our vendors to take, which include compliance with reliability standards and critical infrastructure protection standards. successful cyber security intrusions, including those targeting the electronic control systems used at our generating facilities and electric and natural gas transmission, distribution, and storage systems, could disrupt our operations and result in loss of service to customers. these intrusions may cause unplanned outages at our power plants, which may reduce our revenues or cause us to incur significant costs if we are required to operate our higher cost electric generators or purchase replacement power to satisfy our obligations, and could result in additional maintenance expenses. the risk of such intrusions may also increase our capital and operating costs as a result of having to implement increased security measures for protection of our information technology and infrastructure.
we face on-going threats to our assets and technology systems. despite the implementation of strong security measures, all assets and systems are potentially vulnerable to disability, failures, or unauthorized access due to human error or physical or cyber security
2016 form 10-k   27   wec energy group, inc.
intrusions. if our assets or systems were to fail, be physically damaged, or be breached and were not recovered in a timely manner, we may be unable to perform critical business functions, and sensitive and other data could be compromised.
our business requires the collection and retention of personally identifiable information of our customers, stockholders, and employees, who expect that we will adequately protect such information. security breaches may expose us to a risk of loss or misuse of confidential and proprietary information. a significant theft, loss, or fraudulent use of personally identifiable information may lead to potentially large costs to notify and protect the impacted persons, and/or could cause us to become subject to significant litigation, costs, liability, fines, or penalties, any of which could materially and adversely impact our results of operations as well as our reputation with customers, stockholders and regulators, among others. in addition, we may be required to incur significant costs associated with governmental actions in response to such intrusions or to strengthen our information and electronic control systems. we may also need to obtain additional insurance coverage related to the threat of such intrusions.
the costs of repairing damage to our facilities, protecting personally identifiable information, and notifying impacted persons, as well as related legal claims, may not be recoverable in rates, may exceed the insurance limits on our insurance policies, or, in some cases, may not be covered by insurance.
transporting, distributing, and storing natural gas involves numerous risks that may result in accidents and other operating risks and costs.
inherent in natural gas distribution activities are a variety of hazards and operational risks, such as leaks, accidental explosions, including third party damages, and mechanical problems, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. in addition, these risks could result in serious injury to employees and non-employees, loss of human life, significant damage to property, environmental pollution, impairment of operations, and substantial losses to us. the location of natural gas pipelines and storage facilities near populated areas, including residential areas, commercial business centers, and industrial sites, could increase the level of damages resulting from these risks. these activities may subject us to litigation or administrative proceedings from time to time, which could result in substantial monetary judgments, fines, or penalties against us, or be resolved on unfavorable terms.
we are a holding company and rely on the earnings of our subsidiaries to meet our financial obligations.
as a holding company with no operations of our own, our ability to meet our financial obligations and pay dividends on our common stock is dependent upon the ability of our subsidiaries to pay amounts to us, whether through dividends or other payments. our subsidiaries are separate legal entities that have no obligation to pay any of our obligations or to make any funds available for that purpose or for the payment of dividends on our common stock. the ability of our subsidiaries to pay amounts to us depends on their earnings, cash flows, capital requirements, and general financial condition, as well as regulatory limitations. prior to distributing cash to us, our subsidiaries have financial obligations that must be satisfied, including, among others, debt service and preferred stock dividends. in addition, each subsidiary's ability to pay amounts to us depends on any statutory, regulatory, and/or contractual restrictions and limitations applicable to such subsidiary, which may include requirements to maintain specified levels of debt or equity ratios, working capital, or other assets. our utility subsidiaries are regulated by various state utility commissions, which generally possess broad powers to ensure that the needs of the utility customers are being met.
we may fail to attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce.
we operate in an industry that requires many of our employees to possess unique technical skill sets. events such as an aging workforce without appropriate replacements, the mismatch of skill sets to future needs, or the unavailability of contract resources may lead to operating challenges or increased costs. these operating challenges include lack of resources, loss of knowledge, and a lengthy time period associated with skill development. in addition, current and prospective employees may determine that they do not wish to work for us. failure to hire and obtain replacement employees, including the ability to transfer significant internal historical knowledge and expertise to the new employees, may adversely affect our ability to manage and operate our business. if we are unable to successfully attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce, our results of operations could be adversely affected.
we are exposed to the risk that counterparties to various arrangements who owe us money, electricity, natural gas, or other commodities or services will not be able to perform their obligations. should the counterparties to these arrangements fail to
2016 form 10-k   28   wec energy group, inc.
perform, we may be required to replace the underlying commitment at current market prices or we may be unable to meet all of our customers' electric and natural gas requirements unless or until alternative supply arrangements are put in place. in such event, we may incur losses, and our results of operations, financial position, or liquidity could be adversely affected.
we have entered into several power purchase agreements with non-affiliated companies, and continue to look for additional opportunities to enter into these agreements. revenues are dependent on the continued performance by the purchasers of their obligations under the power purchase agreements. although we have a comprehensive credit evaluation process and contractual protections, it is possible that one or more purchasers could fail to perform their obligations under the power purchase agreements. if this were to occur, we would expect that any operating and other costs that were initially allocated to a defaulting customer's power purchase agreement would be reallocated among our retail customers. to the extent there is any regulatory delay in adjusting rates, a customer default under a power purchase agreement could have a negative impact on our results of operations and cash flows.
we may not be able to use tax credits, net operating losses, and/or charitable contribution carryforwards.
we have significantly reduced our consolidated federal and state income tax liability in the past through tax credits, net operating losses, and charitable contribution deductions available under the applicable tax codes. we have not fully used the allowed tax credits, net operating losses, and charitable contribution deductions in our previous tax filings. we may not be able to fully use the tax credits, net operating losses, and charitable contribution deductions available as carryforwards if our future federal and state taxable income and related income tax liability is insufficient to permit their use. in addition, any future disallowance of some or all of those tax credits, net operating losses, or charitable contribution carryforwards as a result of legislation or an adverse determination by one of the applicable taxing jurisdictions could materially affect our tax obligations and financial results.
the acquisition of integrys may not achieve its anticipated results, and we may be unable to integrate operations as expected.
the merger agreement was entered into with the expectation that the acquisition would result in various benefits, including, among other things, cost savings and operating efficiencies. achieving the anticipated benefits of the acquisition is subject to a number of uncertainties, including whether the businesses of the two companies can continue to be integrated in an efficient, effective, and timely manner.
it is possible that the remaining integration efforts could take longer and be more costly than anticipated, and could result in the loss of valuable employees; the disruption of ongoing businesses, processes, and systems; or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures, practices, policies, and compensation arrangements, any of which could adversely affect our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of the transaction as and when expected. although we expect that the elimination of certain duplicative costs, as well as the realization of other efficiencies related to the integration of the businesses of the two companies, will offset the incremental transaction-related costs over time, we may not achieve this net benefit in the near term, or at all. failure to achieve the anticipated benefits of the acquisition could result in increased costs or decreases in the amount of expected revenues and could adversely affect our future business, financial condition, operating results, and prospects.
we have recorded goodwill that could become impaired and adversely affect financial results.
we assess goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or whenever events or circumstances occur that would indicate a potential for impairment. if goodwill is deemed to be impaired, we may be required to incur material non-cash charges that could materially adversely affect our results of operations.
risks related to economic and market volatility our business is dependent on our ability to successfully access capital markets.
we rely on access to credit and capital markets to support our capital requirements, including expenditures for our utility infrastructure and to comply with future regulatory requirements, to the extent not satisfied by the cash flow generated by our operations. we have historically secured funds from a variety of sources, including the issuance of short-term and long-term debt securities. successful implementation of our long-term business strategies, including capital investment, is dependent upon our ability to access the capital markets, including the banking and commercial paper markets, on competitive terms and rates. in addition, we rely on committed bank credit agreements as back-up liquidity, which allows us to access the low cost commercial paper markets.
2016 form 10-k   29   wec energy group, inc.
our or our subsidiaries' access to the credit and capital markets could be limited, or our or our subsidiaries' cost of capital significantly increased, due to any of the following risks and uncertainties:
•   an economic downturn or uncertainty;
•   prevailing market conditions and rules;
•   concerns over foreign economic conditions;
•   changes in tax policy;
•   the overall health and view of the utility and financial institution industries.
if any of these risks or uncertainties limit our access to the credit and capital markets or significantly increase our cost of capital, it could limit our ability to implement, or increase the costs of implementing, our business plan, which, in turn, could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition, and could limit our ability to sustain our current common stock dividend level.
a downgrade in our or any of our subsidiaries' credit ratings could negatively affect our or our subsidiaries' ability to access capital at reasonable costs and/or require the posting of collateral.
there are a number of factors that impact our and our subsidiaries' credit ratings, including, but not limited to, capital structure, regulatory environment, the ability to cover liquidity requirements, and other requirements for capital. we or any of our subsidiaries could experience a downgrade in ratings if the rating agencies determine that the level of business or financial risk of us, our utilities, or the utility industry has deteriorated. changes in rating methodologies by the rating agencies could also have a negative impact on credit ratings.
•   increase borrowing costs under certain existing credit facilities;
•   require the payment of higher interest rates in future financings and possibly reduce the pool of creditors;
•   decrease funding sources by limiting our or our subsidiaries' access to the commercial paper market;
•   limit the availability of adequate credit support for our subsidiaries' operations; and
•   trigger collateral requirements in various contracts.
fluctuating commodity prices could negatively impact our electric and natural gas utility operations.
our operating and liquidity requirements are impacted by changes in the forward and current market prices of natural gas, coal, electricity, renewable energy credits, and ancillary services.
our electric utilities burn natural gas in several of their electric generation plants and as a supplemental fuel at several coal-fired plants. in many instances the cost of purchased power is tied to the cost of natural gas. the cost of natural gas may increase because of disruptions in the supply of natural gas due to a curtailment in production or distribution, international market conditions, the demand for natural gas, and the availability of shale gas and potential regulations affecting its accessibility.
for wisconsin retail electric customers, our utilities bear the risk for the recovery of fuel and purchased power costs within a symmetrical 2% fuel tolerance band compared to the forecast of fuel and purchased power costs established in their respective rate structures. our natural gas utilities receive dollar-for-dollar recovery of prudently incurred natural gas costs.
changes in commodity prices could result in:
•   higher working capital requirements, particularly related to natural gas inventory, accounts receivable, and cash collateral postings;
•   reduced profitability to the extent that lower revenues, increased bad debt, and interest expense are not recovered through rates;
•   higher rates charged to our customers, which could impact our competitive position;
•   reduced demand for energy, which could impact revenues and operating expenses; and
•   shutting down of generation facilities if the cost of generation exceeds the market price for electricity.
2016 form 10-k   30   wec energy group, inc.
we may not be able to obtain an adequate supply of coal, which could limit our ability to operate our coal-fired facilities and engage in opportunity sales.
we are dependent on coal for much of our electric generating capacity. although we generally carry sufficient coal inventory at our generating facilities to protect against an interruption or decline in supply, there can be no assurance that the inventory levels will be adequate. while we have coal supply and transportation contracts in place, we cannot assure that the counterparties to these agreements will be able to fulfill their obligations to supply coal to us or that we will be able to take delivery of all the coal volume contracted for. the suppliers under these agreements may experience financial or operational problems that inhibit their ability to fulfill their obligations to us, or we may experience operational problems or constraints that prevent us from taking delivery. in addition, suppliers under these agreements may not be required to supply coal to us under certain circumstances, such as in the event of a natural disaster. furthermore, demand for coal can impact its availability and cost. if we are unable to obtain our coal requirements under our coal supply and transportation contracts, we may be required to purchase coal at higher prices or we may be forced to reduce generation at our coal-fired units and replace this lost generation through additional power purchases in the miso energy markets. there is no guarantee that we would be able to fully recover any increased costs in rates or that recovery would not otherwise be delayed, either of which could adversely affect our cash flows.
our electric generation frequently exceeds our customer load. when this occurs, we generally sell the excess generation into the miso energy markets. if we do not have an adequate supply of coal for our coal-fired units or are unable to run our lower cost units, we may lose the ability to engage in these opportunity sales, which may adversely affect our results of operations.
the use of derivative contracts could result in financial losses.
we use derivative instruments such as swaps, options, futures, and forwards to manage commodity price exposure. we could recognize financial losses as a result of volatility in the market value of these contracts or if a counterparty fails to perform. these risks are managed through risk management policies, which might not work as planned and cannot entirely eliminate the risks associated with these activities. in addition, although the hedging programs of our utilities must be approved by the various state commissions, derivative contracts entered into for hedging purposes might not offset the underlying exposure being hedged as expected, resulting in financial losses. in the absence of actively quoted market prices and pricing information from external sources, the value of these financial instruments can involve management's judgment or use of estimates. changes in the underlying assumptions or use of alternative valuation methods could affect the reported fair value of these contracts.
restructuring in the regulated energy industry and competition in the retail and wholesale markets could have a negative impact on our business and revenues.
the regulated energy industry continues to experience significant structural changes. increased competition in the retail and wholesale markets, which may result from restructuring efforts, could have a significant adverse financial impact on us.
certain jurisdictions in which we operate, including michigan and illinois, have adopted retail choice. under michigan law, our retail customers may choose an alternative electric supplier to provide power supply service. the law limits customer choice to 10% of our michigan retail load. the iron ore mine located in the upper peninsula of michigan is excluded from this cap. when a customer switches to an alternative electric supplier, we continue to provide distribution and customer service functions for the customer. although illinois has adopted retail choice, there is currently little or no impact on the net income of our illinois utilities as they still earn a distribution charge for transporting the natural gas for these customers. it is uncertain whether retail choice might be implemented in wisconsin or minnesota.
the ferc continues to support the existing rtos that affect the structure of the wholesale market within these rtos. in connection with its status as a ferc approved rto, miso implemented bid-based energy markets that are part of the miso energy markets. the miso energy markets rules require that all market participants submit day-ahead and/or real-time bids and offers for energy at locations across the miso region. miso then calculates the most efficient solution for all of the bids and offers made into the market that day and establishes an lmp that reflects the market price for energy. as a participant in the miso energy markets, we are required to follow miso's instructions when dispatching generating units to support miso's responsibility for maintaining stability of the transmission system. miso also implemented an ancillary services market for operating reserves that schedules energy and ancillary services at the same time as part of the energy market, allowing for more efficient use of generation assets in the miso market. these market designs continue to have the potential to increase the costs of transmission, the costs associated with inefficient generation dispatching, the costs of participation in the miso energy markets, and the costs associated with estimated payment settlements.
2016 form 10-k   31   wec energy group, inc.
the ferc rules related to transmission are designed to facilitate competition in the wholesale electricity markets among regulated utilities, non-utility generators, wholesale power marketers, and brokers by providing greater flexibility and more choices to wholesale customers, including initiatives designed to encourage the integration of renewable sources of supply. in addition, along with transactions contemplating physical delivery of energy, financial laws and regulations impact hedging and trading based on futures contracts and derivatives that are traded on various commodities exchanges, as well as over-the-counter. technology changes in the power and fuel industries also have significant impacts on wholesale transactions and related costs. we currently cannot predict the impact of these and other developments or the effect of changes in levels of wholesale supply and demand, which are driven by factors beyond our control.
we may experience poor investment performance of benefit plan holdings due to changes in assumptions and market conditions.
we have significant obligations related to pension and opeb plans. if we are unable to successfully manage our benefit plan assets and medical costs, our cash flows, financial condition, or results of operations could be adversely impacted.
our cost of providing these plans is dependent upon a number of factors, including actual plan experience, changes made to the plans, and assumptions concerning the future. types of assumptions include earnings on plan assets, discount rates, the level of interest rates used to measure the required minimum funding levels of the plans, future government regulation, estimated withdrawals by retirees, and our required or voluntary contributions to the plans. plan assets are subject to market fluctuations and may yield returns that fall below projected return rates. in addition, medical costs for both active and retired employees may increase at a rate that is significantly higher than we currently anticipate. our funding requirements could be impacted by a decline in the market value of plan assets, changes in interest rates, changes in demographics (including the number of retirements), or changes in life expectancy assumptions.
we may be unable to obtain insurance on acceptable terms or at all, and the insurance coverage we do obtain may not provide protection against all significant losses.
our ability to obtain insurance, as well as the cost and coverage of such insurance, could be affected by developments affecting our business; international, national, state, or local events; and the financial condition of insurers. insurance coverage may not continue to be available at all or at rates or terms similar to those presently available to us. in addition, our insurance may not be sufficient or effective under all circumstances and against all hazards or liabilities to which we may be subject. any losses for which we are not fully insured or that are not covered by insurance at all could materially adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows, and financial position.
item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations corporate developments introduction we are a diversified holding company with natural gas and electric utility operations (serving customers in wisconsin, illinois, michigan, and minnesota), an approximately 60% equity ownership interest in atc (a federally regulated electric transmission company), and non-utility electric operations through our we power business. see note 24, segment information, for information on our reportable business segments.
corporate strategy our goal is to continue to create long-term value for our shareholders and our customers by focusing on the following:
reliability we have made significant reliability-related investments in recent years, and plan to continue making significant capital investments to strengthen and modernize the reliability of our generation and distribution networks. below are a few examples of reliability projects that are currently underway.
•   umerc, our newly created michigan electric and natural gas utility, is proposing a long-term generation solution for electric reliability in the upper peninsula of michigan. the plan calls for umerc to construct and operate approximately 180 mw of natural gas-fired generation that will be located in the upper peninsula of michigan. the new generation would provide the region with affordable, reliable electricity that generates less emissions than pipp. subject to regulatory approval, the new generation is expected to achieve commercial operation in 2019 and should allow for the retirement of pipp no later than 2020. for more information, see note 22, regulatory environment.
•   pgl is continuing to work on its smp, which primarily involves replacing old cast and ductile iron gas pipes and facilities in the city of chicago's natural gas delivery system with modern polyethylene pipes to reinforce the long-term safety and reliability of the system.
•   wps continues work on its smrp, which involves modernizing parts of its electric distribution system by burying or upgrading lines. the project focuses on electric lines that currently have the lowest reliability in its system, primarily in rural areas that are heavily forested. wps is planning to expand the scope of this project with smrp phase ii. if approved, smrp phase ii will address areas of wps's service territory where reliability is sub-standard to a lesser degree than the areas addressed in the initial phase of the smrp.
operating efficiency we continually look for ways to optimize the operating efficiency of our company. for example, we received approval from the pscw to make changes at ergs to enable the facility to burn coal from the powder river basin located in the western united states. the coal plant was originally designed to burn coal mined from the eastern united states. this project is creating flexibility and has enabled the plant to operate at lower costs, placing it in a better position to be called upon in the miso energy markets, resulting in lower fuel costs for our customers.
post merger, we continue to focus on integrating and improving business processes and consolidating our it infrastructure. we expect the emphasis we are placing on these integration efforts to continue to drive operational efficiency and to put us in position to effectively support plans for future growth.
financial discipline a strong adherence to financial discipline is essential to meeting our earnings projections and maintaining a strong balance sheet, stable cash flows, attractive dividends, and quality credit ratings.
2016 form 10-k   40   wec energy group, inc.
we follow an asset management strategy that focuses on investing in and acquiring assets consistent with our strategic plans, as well as disposing of assets, including property, plant, and equipment and entire business units, that are no longer strategic to operations, are not performing as intended, or have an unacceptable risk profile.
•   see note 2, acquisitions, for information about our acquisition of integrys and the pending acquisition of a natural gas storage facility in michigan.
•   see note 3, dispositions, for information on the sale of itf and the mcpp.
our primary investment opportunities are in three areas: our regulated utility business, our investment in atc, and our generation plants within our we power segment. over the next five years, we expect capital contributions to atc and atc holdco to be approximately $350 million. capital investments will be funded utilizing these capital contributions, in addition to cash generated from operations and debt. we currently forecast that our share of atc's and atc holdco's projected capital expenditures over the next five years will be $1.4 billion inside the traditional atc footprint and $300 million outside of the traditional atc footprint.
excluding atc, we expect total capital expenditures for our retail utilities to be approximately $9.7 billion over the next five years. ongoing projects are discussed in more detail within item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - liquidity and capital resources.
exceptional customer care our approach is driven by an intense focus on delivering exceptional customer care every day. we strive to provide the best value for our customers by embracing constructive change, leveraging our capabilities and expertise, and using creative solutions to meet or exceed our customers' expectations.
one example of how we obtain feedback from our customers is through our "we care" calls, where employees of our utility subsidiaries contact customers after a completed service call. this program began many years ago at we energies (the trade name of we and wg), and is now being rolled out to the integrys utilities. customer satisfaction is a priority, and making "we care" calls is one of the main methods we use to gauge our performance in order to improve customer satisfaction.

2016 compared with 2015
earnings increased $300.5 million in 2016, driven by a $201.7 million increase in earnings due to the inclusion of a full year of integrys's results for 2016, compared to six months of integrys's results for 2015. integrys was acquired on june 29, 2015. see note 2, acquisitions, for more information.
the most significant factor driving the remaining $98.8 million increase in earnings was a $104.1 million pre-tax ($80.1 million after tax) decrease in acquisition costs in 2016.
2015 compared with 2014
earnings increased $50.2 million in 2015, driven by a $30.1 million net increase in earnings due to the inclusion of integrys's results for the last six months of 2015, partially offset by acquisition costs recorded by us and our subsidiaries. also contributing to the increase was a $20.8 million pre-tax gain ($12.5 million after tax) from the sale of minergy llc and its remaining financial assets in june 2015.
non-gaap financial measure the discussions below address the operating income contribution of each of our segments and include financial information prepared in accordance with gaap, as well as electric margins and natural gas margins, which are not measures of financial performance under gaap. electric margin (electric revenues less fuel and purchased power costs) and natural gas margin (natural gas revenues less cost of natural gas sold) are non-gaap financial measures because they exclude other operation and maintenance expense, depreciation and amortization, and property and revenue taxes.
we believe that electric and natural gas margins provide a more meaningful basis for evaluating utility operations than operating revenues since the majority of prudently incurred fuel and purchased power costs, as well as prudently incurred natural gas costs, are passed through to customers in current rates. as a result, management uses electric and natural gas margins internally when assessing the operating performance of our segments as these measures exclude the majority of revenue fluctuations caused by changes in these expenses. similarly, the presentation of electric and natural gas margins herein is intended to provide supplemental information for investors regarding our operating performance.
our electric margins and natural gas margins may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies.  furthermore, these measures are not intended to replace operating income as determined in accordance with gaap as an indicator of our segment operating performance.  operating income for each of the last three fiscal years for each of our segments is presented in the "consolidated earnings" table above.
each applicable segment operating income discussion below includes a table that provides the calculation of electric margins and natural gas margins, as applicable, along with a reconciliation to segment operating income.

(1)   represents costs associated with the we power generation units, including operating and maintenance, as well as the lease payments that are billed from we power to we and then recovered in we's rates. during 2016, 2015, and 2014, $528.4 million, $483.4 million, and $475.7 million, respectively, of both lease and operating and maintenance costs were billed to we, with the difference in costs billed and expenses incurred deferred or deducted from the regulatory asset.
(2)   the pscw has approved escrow accounting for atc and miso network transmission expenses for our wisconsin electric utilities. as a result, we and wps defer as a regulatory asset or liability the differences between actual transmission costs and those included in rates until recovery or refund is authorized in a future rate proceeding. during 2016, 2015, and 2014, $486.0 million, $388.6 million, and $302.4 million, respectively, of costs were billed by transmission providers to our electric utilities.
(3)   regulatory amortizations and other pass through expenses are substantially offset in margins and therefore do not have a significant impact on operating income.

2016 compared with 2015
electric utility margins electric utility margins at the wisconsin segment increased $455.8 million during 2016, compared with 2015. the increase was primarily driven by a $386.4 million margin contribution from wps during the first six months of 2016, compared with no margin contribution from wps for the first six months of 2015.
2016 form 10-k   44   wec energy group, inc.
the significant factors impacting the remaining $69.4 million increase in electric utility margins at the wisconsin segment were:
•   the expiration of $12.5 million of bill credits refunded to customers in 2015 related to the treasury grant we received in connection with its biomass facility.
•   an $11.3 million increase in the last six months of 2016 as a result of wps's pscw rate order, effective january 1, 2016. see note 22, regulatory environment, for more information.
these increases were partially offset by a $12.9 million decrease in wholesale margins driven by a reduction in capacity sales year-over-year at we in addition to a reduction in sales volumes at wps for the second half of 2016, compared with the same period in 2015. certain wholesale customers have provisions in their contracts, which allowed them to reduce the amount of energy we provided to them.
natural gas utility margins natural gas utility margins at the wisconsin segment increased $74.3 million during 2016, compared with 2015. the increase in natural gas utiilty margins was driven by a $63.6 million margin contribution from wps during the first six months of 2016, compared with no margin contribution from wps for the first six months of 2015.
the most significant factor impacting the remaining $10.7 million increase in natural gas utility margins at the wisconsin segment was an $18.1 million net increase from both wg's rate order effective january 1, 2016, and a partially offsetting negative impact from wps's rate order during the last six months of 2016. see note 22, regulatory environment, for more information. this net increase was partially offset by a $3.2 million decrease related to lower sales volumes during 2016, primarily driven by warmer winter weather. as measured by heating degree days, 2016 was 6.2% warmer than 2015 in the milwaukee area.
operating income operating income at the wisconsin segment increased $142.8 million during 2016, compared with 2015. the increase was driven by the $530.1 million increase in margins discussed above, partially offset by $387.3 million of higher operating expenses (which include other operation and maintenance, depreciation and amortization, and property and revenues taxes). higher operating expenses were driven by $321.6 million of operating expenses from wps during the first six months of 2016, compared with no operating expenses from wps for the first six months of 2015.
the significant factors impacting the remaining $65.7 million increase in operating expenses at the wisconsin segment were:
•   a $27.0 million increase in depreciation and amortization, driven by an overall increase in utility plant in service. in november 2015, wg completed the western gas lateral project, and we completed the conversion of the fuel source for vapp from coal to natural gas.
•   a $25.3 million increase in expenses in 2016 related to a focus on projects that were beneficial to customers and the communities within our service territories.
•   a $24.4 million expense related to the earnings sharing mechanisms in place at we and wg, effective january 1, 2016. see the pscw conditions of approval related to the integrys acquisition in note 2, acquisitions, for more information.
these increases in operating expenses were partially offset by a $16.4 million positive impact at we from the sale of the mcpp in april 2016, including a gain on sale and lower operating costs in 2016. see note 3, dispositions, for more information.

2015 compared with 2014
electric utility margins electric utility margins at the wisconsin segment increased $482.1 million during 2015, compared with 2014. the increase was primarily driven by a $399.1 million margin contribution from wps during the last six months of 2015, compared with no margin contribution from wps during 2014.
•   a $38.4 million increase as a result of the pscw rate order, effective january 1, 2015. see note 22, regulatory environment, for more information.
•   a $35.0 million increase driven by the escrow accounting treatment of the ssr revenues in the pscw rate order, effective january 1, 2015. see note 22, regulatory environment, for more information.
•   a $24.2 million increase due to the return of the iron ore mines as customers in february 2015. the two iron ore mines, which we served on an interruptible tariff rate, switched to an alternative electric supplier effective september 1, 2013. effective february 1, 2015, the owner of the two mines returned them as retail customers. in 2015, we deferred, and expect to continue to defer, the margin from those sales and apply these amounts for the benefit of wisconsin retail electric customers in a future rate proceeding. michigan state law allows the mines to switch to an alternative electric supplier after sufficient notice. a large portion of this increase in margins was offset by higher transmission expense included in other operation and maintenance expense at we.
•   a $10.4 million positive impact from collections of fuel and purchased power costs compared with costs approved in rates in 2015, compared with 2014. under the wisconsin fuel rules, the margins of our electric utilities are impacted by under or over-collections of certain fuel and purchased power costs that are less than a 2% price variance from the costs included in rates, and the remaining variance that exceeds the 2% variance is deferred.
•   a $6.2 million increase primarily due to lower fly ash removal costs in 2015.
•   a partially offsetting $22.3 million decrease related to sales volume variances in 2015. this decrease was driven by lower margins from residential customers in 2015, primarily due to lower weather-normalized use per customer and warmer weather during the heating season.
natural gas utility margins natural gas utility margins at the wisconsin segment increased $22.1 million during 2015, compared with 2014. the increase was related to a $57.9 million margin contribution from wps during the last six months of 2015, compared with no margin contribution from wps during 2014. this increase was partially offset by a decrease in natural gas margins at we and wg of $35.8 million in 2015.
the most significant factor impacting the $35.8 million lower natural gas utility margins at we and wg was a $42.7 million decrease in sales volumes in 2015, largely related to warmer weather during the heating season as well as lower weather-normalized use per customer. as measured by heating degree days, 2015 was 15.1% warmer than 2014. this decrease in margins was partially offset by a $6.4 million net increase in margins as a result of the impact of the we and wg pscw rate orders, effective january 1, 2015. see note 22, regulatory environment, for more information.
operating income operating income at the wisconsin segment increased $114.0 million during 2015, compared with 2014. the increase was driven by the $504.2 million increase in margins discussed above, partially offset by $390.2 million of higher operating expenses (which include other operation and maintenance, depreciation and amortization, and property and revenues taxes). higher operating expenses were driven by $334.2 million of operating expenses from wps during the last six months of 2015, compared with no operating expenses from wps during 2014.
2016 form 10-k   46   wec energy group, inc.
the significant factors impacting the remaining $56.0 million of higher operating expenses at we and wg were:
◦   an overall increase in utility plant in service in 2015. in november 2015, wg completed the western gas lateral project, and we completed the conversion of the fuel source for vapp from coal to natural gas.
◦   new depreciation studies approved by the pscw for both the utilities, effective january 1, 2015.
◦   a $7.7 million reduction in income received in 2015 from the treasury grant we received in connection with the completion of its biomass plant in november 2013. the lower grant income corresponds to lower bill credits provided to we's retail electric customers in wisconsin.
•   a $16.0 million increase in transmission expense from miso and atc related to the iron ore mines returning as customers in february 2015.
•   a $16.1 million decrease in employee benefit costs in 2015 driven by lower performance units share-based compensation, deferred compensation, and medical costs.
•   a $9.3 million decrease in electric and natural gas distribution costs in 2015, related to amortization of design software and maintenance costs.

we did not have any operations in illinois until our acquisition of integrys on june 29, 2015. since the majority of pgl and nsg customers use natural gas for heating, operating income is sensitive to weather and is generally higher during the winter months.
natural gas utility margins natural gas utility margins at the illinois segment increased $506.8 million during 2016, compared with 2015. the increase was primarily driven by a $467.8 million margin contribution from the illinois segment during the first six months of 2016, compared to no margin contribution from this segment for the first six months of 2015.
the significant factors impacting the remaining $39.0 million increase in natural gas utility margins at the illinois segment were:
•   a $26.3 million increase in margins related to the riders included in the table above during the last six months of 2016, compared with the last six months of 2015. pgl and nsg recover certain operating expenses directly through separate riders, resulting in no impact on operating income as increases in operating expenses are offset by equal increases in margins.
•   a $10.8 million increase in revenue at pgl due to continued capital investment in projects under its qualifying infrastructure plant rider. pgl currently recovers the costs related to the smp through a surcharge on customer bills pursuant to an icc approved qualifying infrastructure plant rider, which is in effect through 2023.

•   a $3.9 million increase in the last six months of 2016 as a result of various rate orders. the merc interim rate order was effective january 1, 2016, and accounted for $2.5 million of the rate increase. the mgu rate order was also effective january 1, 2016, and accounted for $1.4 million to the rate increase. see note 22, regulatory environment, for more information.
•   a $3.0 million increase related to higher sales volumes during the last six months of 2016, driven by colder weather. as measured by heating degree days, the last six months of 2016 were 8.2% colder than the last six months of 2015 for these respective territories.
•   a $1.6 million increase related to the merc conservation improvement program financial incentive as a result of exceeding certain energy savings goals.
operating income operating income at the other states segment increased $43.9 million during 2016, compared with 2015. the increase was driven by the $121.8 million increase in margins discussed above, partially offset by $77.9 million of higher operating expenses. higher operating expenses were driven primarily by $76.3 million of operating expenses from the other states segment during the first six months of 2016, compared with no operating expenses during the first six months of 2015.
we power segment contribution to operating income year ended december 31
2016 compared with 2015
operating income at the we power segment increased $2.2 million, or 0.6%, when compared to 2015. this increase was primarily related to higher revenues in connection with capital additions to the plants it owns and leases to we.
2015 compared with 2014
operating income at the we power segment increased $5.4 million, or 1.5%, when compared to 2014. this increase was primarily related to higher revenues in connection with capital additions to the plants it owns and leases to we.
corporate and other segment contribution to operating income year ended december 31
2016 compared with 2015
the operating loss at the corporate and other segment decreased $81.2 million when compared to 2015, driven by a reduction in costs as a result of the acquisition of integrys. see note 2, acquisitions, for more information regarding costs associated with the acquisition.
2015 compared with 2014
the operating loss at the corporate and other segment increased $65.1 million when compared to 2014, driven by costs associated with the acquisition of integrys on june 29, 2015.

2016 compared with 2015
earnings from our ownership interest in atc increased $50.4 million when compared to 2015, primarily driven by the increase in our ownership interest from 26.2% to approximately 60% as a result of the acquisition of integrys on june 29, 2015. in addition, lower equity earnings in 2015 were driven by an alj initial decision in december 2015 related to the atc roe reviews, which was later affirmed by a ferc order in 2016. see item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - factors affecting results, liquidity, and capital resources - other matters - american transmission company allowed return on equity complaints below for more information on these decisions.
2015 compared with 2014
earnings from our ownership interest in atc increased $30.1 million when compared to 2014, primarily driven by the increase in our ownership interest from 26.2% to approximately 60% as a result of the acquisition of integrys. this increase was partially offset by lower earnings recognized by atc, as atc further reduced earnings in 2015 related to an anticipated refund to customers resulting from a complaint filed with the ferc requesting a lower roe for certain transmission owners.

2016 compared with 2015
other income, net increased by $21.9 million when compared to 2015. this increase was primarily due to the repurchase of a portion of integrys's 6.11% junior notes at a discount in february 2016, as well as higher afudc due to the inclusion of afudc from the integrys companies post acquisition. see note 14, long-term debt and capital lease obligations, for more information on the repurchase. partially offsetting this increase was a $19.6 million gain recorded in april 2016 from the sale of the chilled water generation and distribution assets of wisvest, compared with a $20.8 million gain from the sale of minergy llc and its remaining financial assets in june 2015, as well as excise tax credits recognized by itf in 2015. itf was sold in the first quarter of 2016. see note 3, dispositions, for more information on our asset sales.

2016 compared with 2015
interest expense increased $71.3 million, or 21.5%, when compared to 2015. the increase was primarily driven by $68.5 million of interest expense from integrys and its subsidiaries during the first six months of 2016, compared to no interest expense from these companies during the same period in 2015. additionally, we issued $1.2 billion of long-term debt in june 2015 to finance a portion of the cash consideration for the acquisition of integrys. this was offset, in part, by the repurchase of a portion of the 6.11% junior notes in february 2016. these notes were replaced with lower-interest rate short-term debt.
2015 compared with 2014
interest expense increased $91.1 million, or 37.9%, when compared to 2014, primarily due to higher debt levels. we assumed approximately $3.0 billion of debt from integrys and its subsidiaries upon the closing of the acquisition on june 29, 2015. additionally, we issued $1.2 billion of long-term debt in june 2015 to finance a portion of the cash consideration for the acquisition of integrys.
2016 compared with 2015
our effective tax rate was 37.6% in 2016 compared to 40.4% in 2015. this decrease was primarily related to a charge in 2015 to remeasure our state deferred income taxes as a result of the acquisition of integrys. see note 15, income taxes, for more information. we expect our 2017 annual effective tax rate to be between 37.0% and 38.0%.
2015 compared with 2014
our effective tax rate was 40.4% in 2015 compared to 38.0% in 2014. this increase in our effective tax rate was primarily related to a charge in 2015 to remeasure our state deferred income taxes as a result of the acquisition of integrys.

operating activities
2016 compared with 2015
net cash provided by operating activities increased $809.9 million during 2016. this increase was driven by $466.6 million of net cash flows from the operating activities of integrys during the first six months of 2016, since integrys was acquired on june 29, 2015. see note 2, acquisitions, for more information.
2016 form 10-k   52   wec energy group, inc.
the remaining $343.3 million increase in net cash provided by operating activities was driven by:
•   a $377.9 million increase in cash resulting from lower payments for natural gas and fuel and purchased power, due to lower commodity prices and warmer weather during the 2016 heating season. the average per-unit cost of natural gas sold decreased 18.5% in 2016.
•   a $94.2 million decrease in contributions and payments to our pension and opeb plans during 2016.
•   a $44.1 million increase in cash due to lower collateral requirements during 2016, driven by an increase in the fair value of our derivative instruments. see note 20, derivative instruments, for more information.
•   a $29.2 million increase in cash received for income taxes, primarily due to a wisconsin state income tax refund received in the fourth quarter of 2016.
these increases in net cash provided by operating activities were partially offset by a $210.8 million decrease in cash related to lower overall collections from customers. collections from customers decreased primarily because of lower commodity prices and warmer weather during the 2016 heating season.
2015 compared with 2014
net cash provided by operating activities increased $94.7 million during 2015, driven by a $141.6 million increase related to net cash flows from the operating activities of integrys during the last six months of 2015.
the $46.9 million decrease in net cash provided by operating activities from the legacy wisconsin energy corporation companies was driven by:
•   a $418.0 million decrease in cash related to lower overall collections from customers during 2015. collections from customers decreased primarily because of lower commodity prices and warmer weather during the 2015 heating season. the average per-unit cost of natural gas sold decreased 33.1% in 2015.
•   a $141.4 million decrease in cash related to higher payments for operating and maintenance costs during 2015, primarily due to costs related to the acquisition of integrys.
•   a $96.8 million increase in contributions and payments to our pension and opeb plans during 2015.
these decreases in net cash provided by operating activities from the legacy wisconsin energy corporation companies were partially offset by a $592.4 million increase in cash resulting from lower payments for natural gas and fuel and purchased power, due to lower commodity prices and warmer weather during the 2015 heating season.
investing activities
2016 compared with 2015
net cash used in investing activities decreased $1,247.4 million during 2016, driven by:

2016 compared with 2015
the decrease in cash paid for capital expenditures at the wisconsin segment during 2016 was driven by lower capital expenditures as a result of the november 2015 completion of both wg's western gas lateral project, which improved the reliability of wg's natural gas distribution network in the western part of wisconsin, and we's coal to natural gas conversion project at vapp. also contributing to the decrease were lower payments at we for environmental compliance projects and electric distribution upgrades. the inclusion of wps for all of 2016, as compared with only the last six months of 2015, substantially offset these lower capital expenditures. wps's capital expenditures of $154.1 million during the first six months of 2016 related to the reacttm emission control technology project at weston unit 3, a combustion turbine project at the fox energy center, and the smrp, a project to underground and upgrade certain electric distribution facilities in northern wisconsin.
the increase in cash paid for capital expenditures at the illinois segment during 2016 was due to the inclusion of pgl and nsg for all of 2016, compared with only the last six months of 2015. capital expenditures at the illinois segment were driven primarily by the smp at pgl.
the increase in cash paid for capital expenditures at the other states segment during 2016 was due to the inclusion of merc and mgu for all of 2016, compared with only the last six months of 2015. merc's and mgu's capital expenditures of $22.7 million during the first six months of 2016 primarily related to natural gas distribution systems and mains.
the increase in cash paid for capital expenditures at the corporate and other segment during 2016 was driven by a project to implement a new enterprise resource planning system and an information technology project created to improve the billing, call center, and credit collection functions of the integrys subsidiaries.

2015 compared with 2014
the increase in capital expenditures at the wisconsin segment during 2015 was primarily due to the inclusion of wps as a result of the integrys acquisition on june 29, 2015. significant projects included in wps's 2015 capital expenditures were the reacttm emission control technology project at weston unit 3 and the smrp. the wisconsin segment also included increased expenditures in 2015 related to wg's western gas lateral project. these increases were partially offset by lower capital expenditures in 2015 for we's conversion of the fuel source for vapp from coal to natural gas, as most of the capital expenditures related to this project were incurred in 2014.
the illinois segment includes capital expenditures from pgl and nsg as a result of the integrys acquisition on june 29, 2015. in 2015, pgl incurred significant capital expenditures related to the smp.
the other states segment includes capital expenditures from merc and mgu as a result of the integrys acquisition on june 29, 2015.
financing activities
2016 compared with 2015
net cash related to financing activities decreased $2,057.5 million during 2016, driven by:
•   a $1,526.4 million net decrease in cash due to a $1,750.0 million decrease in the issuance of long-term debt during 2016, partially offset by $223.6 million of lower repayments of long-term debt during 2016. we issued $1,200.0 million of long-term debt during 2015 in connection with the acquisition of integrys.
•   a $397.8 million net decrease in cash due to $234.8 million of net repayments of commercial paper during 2016 compared with $163.0 million of net borrowings of commercial paper during 2015.
•   a $169.5 million increase in dividends paid on common stock during 2016, due to the issuance of 90.2 million shares of our common stock in june 2015 as a result of the integrys acquisition and increases to our quarterly dividend rate. see note 2, acquisitions, for more information.
•   a $33.3 million increase in cash used to purchase shares of our common stock during 2016 to satisfy requirements of our stock-based compensation plans.
these decreases in net cash related to financing activities were partially offset by a $52.7 million increase in cash due to the redemption of all of wps's preferred stock during 2015.
2015 compared with 2014
net cash related to financing activities increased $1,618.0 million during 2015, driven by:
•   a $1,900.0 million increase in the issuance of long-term debt during 2015, of which $1,200.0 million related to the acquisition of integrys.
these increases in net cash related to financing activities were partially offset by:
•   a $205.3 million increase in retirements of long-term debt during 2015, of which $130.1 million related to legacy integrys and its subsidiaries.
•   a $103.4 million increase in dividends paid on common stock due to the issuance of 90.2 million shares of our common stock in june 2015 as a result of the integrys acquisition and an increase in our quarterly dividend rate effective with the closing of the acquisition.

capital resources and requirements capital resources liquidity we anticipate meeting our capital requirements for our existing operations through internally generated funds and short-term borrowings, supplemented by the issuance of intermediate or long-term debt securities, depending on market conditions and other factors.
we currently have access to the capital markets and have been able to generate funds internally and externally to meet our capital requirements. our ability to attract the necessary financial capital at reasonable terms is critical to our overall strategic plan. we currently believe that we have adequate capacity to fund our operations for the foreseeable future through our existing borrowing arrangements, access to capital markets, and internally generated cash.
wec energy group, we, wg, wps, and pgl maintain bank back-up credit facilities, which provide liquidity support for each company's obligations with respect to commercial paper and for general corporate purposes. we review our bank back-up credit facility needs on an ongoing basis and expect to be able to maintain adequate credit facilities to support our operations. see note 13, short-term debt and lines of credit, for more information about these credit facilities.
the following table shows our capitalization structure as of december 31, 2016 and 2015, as well as an adjusted capitalization structure that we believe is consistent with how the rating agencies currently view our 2007 6.25% series a junior subordinated notes due 2067 (6.25% junior notes):
(in millions)                                                 actual               adjusted                 actual               adjusted common equity                                          $8,929.8               $9,179.8               $8,654.8               $8,904.8

included in long-term debt on our balance sheets as of december 31, 2016 and 2015, is $500.0 million principal amount of 6.25% junior notes. the adjusted presentation attributes $250.0 million of the 6.25% junior notes to common equity and $250.0 million to long-term debt. as a result of integrys's repurchase and retirement of some of its 6.11% junior notes, we were informed by one rating agency that it will no longer attribute equity credit to integrys's remaining junior subordinated notes, consisting of $114.9 million aggregate principal amount of the 6.11% junior notes, and $400.0 million aggregate principal amount of its 6.00% junior subordinated notes due 2073. therefore, the integrys junior subordinated notes are no longer being adjusted in the table above. for additional information on the repurchase of the 6.11% junior notes, see note 14, long-term debt and capital lease obligations.
the adjusted presentation of our consolidated capitalization structure is presented as a complement to our capitalization structure presented in accordance with gaap. management evaluates and manages our capitalization structure, including our total debt to total capitalization ratio, using the gaap calculation as adjusted by the rating agency treatment of the 6.25% junior notes. therefore, we believe the non-gaap adjusted presentation reflecting this treatment is useful and relevant to investors in understanding how management and the rating agencies evaluate our capitalization structure.
for a summary of the interest rate, maturity, and amount outstanding of each series of our long-term debt on a consolidated basis, see our capitalization statements.
as described in note 11, common equity, certain restrictions exist on the ability of our subsidiaries to transfer funds to us. we do not expect these restrictions to have any material effect on our operations or ability to meet our cash obligations.
2016 form 10-k   57   wec energy group, inc.
at december 31, 2016, we were in compliance with all covenants related to outstanding short-term and long-term debt. we expect to be in compliance with all such debt covenants for the foreseeable future. see note 13, short-term debt and lines of credit, for more information about our credit facilities and other short-term credit agreements. see note 14, long-term debt and capital lease obligations, for more information about our long-term debt.
working capital as of december 31, 2016, our current liabilities exceeded our current assets by approximately $262.9 million. we do not expect this to have any impact on our liquidity since we believe we have adequate back-up lines of credit in place for ongoing operations. we also can access the capital markets to finance our construction programs and to refinance current maturities of long-term debt, if necessary.
credit rating risk we do not have any credit agreements that would require material changes in payment schedules or terminations as a result of a credit rating downgrade. however, we have certain agreements in the form of commodity contracts and employee benefit plans that could require collateral or a termination payment in the event of a credit rating change to below bbb- at s&p global ratings and/or baa3 at moody's investors service. we also have other commodity contracts that, in the event of a credit rating downgrade, could result in a reduction of our unsecured credit granted by counterparties.
in addition, access to capital markets at a reasonable cost is determined in large part by credit quality. any credit ratings downgrade could impact our ability to access capital markets.
subject to other factors affecting the credit markets as a whole, we believe our current ratings should provide a significant degree of flexibility in obtaining funds on competitive terms. however, these security ratings reflect the views of the rating agency only. an explanation of the significance of these ratings may be obtained from the rating agency. such ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold securities. any rating can be revised upward or downward or withdrawn at any time by a rating agency.
capital requirements contractual obligations we have the following contractual obligations and other commercial commitments as of december 31, 2016:
capital lease obligations (3)                                   85.3                    13.9                      30.2                    33.6                       7.6

(1)   the amounts included in the table are calculated using current market prices, forward curves, and other estimates.
(2)   principal and interest payments on long-term debt (excluding capital lease obligations).
(3)   capital lease obligations for power purchase commitments. this amount does not include we power leases to we which are eliminated upon consolidation.
(4)   operating lease obligations for power purchase commitments and rail car leases.
(5)   energy and transportation purchase obligations under various contracts for the procurement of fuel, power, gas supply, and associated transportation related to utility operations.
2016 form 10-k   58   wec energy group, inc.
(6)   purchase obligations related to normal business operations, information technology, and other services.
(7)   obligations for pension and opeb plans cannot reasonably be estimated beyond 2019.
the table above does not include liabilities related to the accounting treatment for uncertainty in income taxes because we are not able to make a reasonably reliable estimate as to the amount and period of related future payments at this time. for additional information regarding these liabilities, refer to note 15, income taxes.
aros in the amount of $557.7 million are not included in the above table. settlement of these liabilities cannot be determined with certainty, but we believe the majority of these liabilities will be settled in more than five years.
obligations for utility operations have historically been included as part of the rate-making process and therefore are generally recoverable from customers.
capital expenditures and significant capital projects we have several capital projects that will require significant capital expenditures over the next three years and beyond. all projected capital requirements are subject to periodic review and may vary significantly from estimates, depending on a number of factors. these factors include environmental requirements, regulatory restraints and requirements, changes in tax laws and regulations, acquisition and development opportunities, market volatility, and economic trends. our estimated capital expenditures for the next three years are as follows:
wps is continuing work on the smrp. this project includes converting more than 1,000 miles of overhead distribution power lines to underground in northern wisconsin and adding distribution automation equipment on 400 miles of lines. wps expects to invest approximately $45 million annually through 2018. subject to regulatory review, phase ii of the smrp will expand the scope and cost of the original smrp and will consist of over 900 miles of underground circuit installation. wps expects to invest approximately $200 million between 2018 and 2021 related to phase ii. we, wps, and wg will also continue to upgrade their electric and natural gas distribution systems to enhance reliability.
in connection with the formation of umerc, we entered into an agreement with tilden mining company under which it will purchase electric power from umerc for 20 years. the agreement calls for umerc to construct and operate approximately 180 mw of natural gas-fired generation located in the upper peninsula of michigan. the estimated cost of this project is approximately $265 million ($275 million including afudc). see note 22, regulatory environment, for more information about umerc and this new generation.
in january 2017, we signed an agreement for the acquisition of a natural gas storage facility in michigan for $225 million that would provide approximately one-third of the storage needs for our wisconsin natural gas utilities. in addition, we expect to incur approximately $5 million of acquisition related costs. see note 2, acquisitions, for more information on this transaction.
pgl is continuing work on the smp, a project under which pgl is replacing approximately 2,000 miles of chicago's aging natural gas pipeline infrastructure. pgl currently recovers these costs through a surcharge on customer bills pursuant to an icc approved qualifying infrastructure plant rider, which is in effect through 2023. pgl's projected average annual investment through 2019 is between $280 million and $300 million.
we expect to provide capital contributions to atc (not included in the above table) of approximately $226 million from 2017 through 2019.

on january 19, 2017, our board of directors increased our quarterly dividend to $0.52 per share effective with the first quarter of 2017 dividend payment, which equates to an annual dividend of $2.08 per share. in addition, the board of directors affirmed our dividend policy that continues to target a dividend payout ratio of 65-70% of earnings.
investments in outside trusts we use outside trusts to fund our pension and certain opeb obligations. these trusts had investments of approximately $3.5 billion as of december 31, 2016. these trusts hold investments that are subject to the volatility of the stock market and interest rates. we contributed $28.7 million, $121.0 million, and $13.9 million to our pension and opeb plans in 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. in january 2017, we contributed $100.0 million to the pension plans. future contributions to the plans will be dependent upon many factors, including the performance of existing plan assets and long-term discount rates. for additional information, see note 17, employee benefits.
off-balance sheet arrangements we are a party to various financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk as a part of our normal course of business, including financial guarantees and letters of credit that support construction projects, commodity contracts, and other payment obligations. we believe that these agreements do not have, and are not reasonably likely to have, a current or future material effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources. for additional information, see note 13, short-term debt and lines of credit, note 16, guarantees, and note 21, variable interest entities.
factors affecting results, liquidity, and capital resources market risks and other significant risks we are exposed to market and other significant risks as a result of the nature of our businesses and the environments in which those businesses operate. these risks, described in further detail below, include but are not limited to:
regulatory recovery our utilities account for their regulated operations in accordance with accounting guidance under the regulated operations topic of the fasb asc. our rates are determined by various regulatory commissions. see item 1. business - d. regulation for more information on these commissions.
regulated entities are allowed to defer certain costs that would otherwise be charged to expense if the regulated entity believes the recovery of those costs is probable. we record regulatory assets pursuant to specific orders or by a generic order issued by our regulators. recovery of these deferred costs in future rates is subject to the review and approval by those regulators. we assume the risks and benefits of ultimate recovery of these items in future rates. if the recovery of these deferred costs, including those referenced below, is not approved by our regulators, the costs would be charged to income in the current period. in general, our regulatory assets are recovered over a period of between one to six years. regulators can impose liabilities on a prospective basis for amounts previously collected from customers and for amounts that are expected to be refunded to customers. we record these items as regulatory liabilities. as of december 31, 2016, our regulatory assets were $3,138.3 million, and our regulatory liabilities were $1,597.2 million.
we expect to request or have requested recovery of the costs related to the following projects discussed in recent or pending rate proceedings, orders, and investigations involving our utilities:
•   in june 2016, the pscw approved deferral of costs related to wps's reacttm project above the originally authorized $275.0 million level through 2017. wps will be required to obtain a separate approval for collection of these deferred costs.
2016 form 10-k   60   wec energy group, inc.
•   prior to its acquisition, integrys initiated an information technology project with the goal of improving the customer experience at its subsidiaries. specifically, the project is expected to provide functional and technological benefits to the billing, call center, and credit collection functions. as of december 31, 2016, we had received no significant disallowances of the costs incurred for this project. we will be required to obtain approval for the recovery of additional costs incurred through the completion of this long-term project.
•   in january 2014, the icc approved pgl's use of the qualifying infrastructure plant rider as a recovery mechanism for costs incurred related to investments in qualifying infrastructure plant. this rider is subject to an annual reconciliation whereby costs are reviewed for accuracy and prudency. no schedule has been set for the 2015 reconciliation. the alj has placed the 2014 reconciliation on a stay, pending resolution of the icc ordered stakeholder workshops and the icc investigative docket regarding anonymous letters it received, both related to pgl's smp. although schedules have not been set for the reconciliations, discovery has continued for both the 2014 and 2015 reconciliations. as of december 31, 2016, there can be no assurance that all costs incurred under the qualifying infrastructure plant rider will be recoverable.
see note 22, regulatory environment, for more information regarding recent and pending rate proceedings, orders, and investigations involving our utilities.
commodity costs in the normal course of providing energy, we are subject to market fluctuations in the costs of coal, natural gas, purchased power, and fuel oil used in the delivery of coal. we manage our fuel and natural gas supply costs through a portfolio of short and long-term procurement contracts with various suppliers for the purchase of coal, natural gas, and fuel oil. in addition, we manage the risk of price volatility through natural gas and electric hedging programs.
embedded within our utilities' rates are amounts to recover fuel, natural gas, and purchased power costs. our utilities have recovery mechanisms in place that allow them to recover or refund all or a portion of the changes in prudently incurred fuel, natural gas, and purchased power costs from rate case-approved amounts. see item 1. business - d. regulation for more information on these mechanisms.
higher commodity costs can increase our working capital requirements, result in higher gross receipts taxes, and lead to increased energy efficiency investments by our customers to reduce utility usage and/or fuel substitution. higher commodity costs combined with slower economic conditions also expose us to greater risks of accounts receivable write-offs as more customers are unable to pay their bills. see note 1(d), revenues and customer receivables, for more information on riders and other mechanisms that allow for cost recovery or refund of uncollectible expense.
weather our utilities' rates are based upon estimated normal temperatures. our electric utility margins are unfavorably sensitive to below normal temperatures during the summer cooling season, and to some extent, to above normal temperatures during the winter heating season. our natural gas utility margins are unfavorably sensitive to above normal temperatures during the winter heating season. pgl, nsg, and merc have decoupling mechanisms in place that help reduce the impacts of weather. decoupling mechanisms differ by state and allow utilities to recover or refund certain differences between actual and authorized margins. a summary of actual weather information in our utilities' service territories during 2016, 2015, and 2014, as measured by degree days, may be found in item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - results of operations.
interest rates we are exposed to interest rate risk resulting from our short-term and long-term borrowings and projected near-term debt financing needs. we manage exposure to interest rate risk by limiting the amount of our variable rate obligations and continually monitoring the effects of market changes on interest rates. when it is advantageous to do so, we enter into long-term fixed rate debt. we may also enter into derivative financial instruments, such as swaps, to mitigate interest rate exposure.
based on the variable rate debt outstanding at december 31, 2016, and december 31, 2015, a hypothetical increase in market interest rates of one percentage point would have increased annual interest expense by $9.8 million and $11.0 million in 2016 and
2016 form 10-k   61   wec energy group, inc.
2015, respectively. this sensitivity analysis was performed assuming a constant level of variable rate debt during the period and an immediate increase in interest rates, with no other changes for the remainder of the period.
marketable securities return we use various trusts to fund our pension and opeb obligations. these trusts invest in debt and equity securities. changes in the market prices of these assets can affect future pension and opeb expenses. additionally, future contributions can also be affected by the investment returns on trust fund assets. we believe that the financial risks associated with investment returns would be partially mitigated through future rate actions by our various utility regulators.
the fair value of our trust fund assets and expected long-term returns were approximately:
(in millions)             as of december 31, 2016          expected return on assets in 2017
fiduciary oversight of the pension and opeb trust fund investments is the responsibility of an investment trust policy committee. the committee works with external actuaries and investment consultants on an ongoing basis to establish and monitor investment strategies and target asset allocations. forecasted cash flows for plan liabilities are regularly updated based on annual valuation results. target asset allocations are determined utilizing projected benefit payment cash flows and risk analyses of appropriate investments. the targeted asset allocations are intended to reduce risk, provide long-term financial stability for the plans, and maintain funded levels which meet long-term plan obligations while preserving sufficient liquidity for near-term benefit payments. investment strategies utilize a wide diversification of asset types and qualified external investment managers.
we consult with our investment advisors on an annual basis to help us forecast expected long-term returns on plan assets by reviewing actual historical returns and calculating expected total trust returns using the weighted-average of long-term market returns for each of the major target asset categories utilized in the fund.
economic conditions we have electric and natural gas utility operations that serve customers in wisconsin, illinois, michigan, and minnesota. as such, we are exposed to market risks in the regional midwest economy. in addition, any economic downturn or disruption of national or international markets could adversely affect the financial condition of our customers and demand for their products, which could affect their demand for our products.
inflation we continue to monitor the impact of inflation, especially with respect to the costs of medical plans, fuel, transmission access, construction costs, and regulatory and environmental compliance in order to minimize its effects in future years through pricing strategies, productivity improvements, and cost reductions. we do not believe the impact of general inflation will have a material impact on our future results of operations.

industry restructuring electric utility industry the regulated energy industry continues to experience significant changes. the ferc continues to support large rtos, which affects the structure of the wholesale market. to this end, miso implemented the miso energy markets, including the use of lmp to value electric transmission congestion and losses. increased competition in the retail and wholesale markets, which may result from restructuring efforts, could have a significant and adverse financial impact on us. it is uncertain when retail choice might be implemented, if at all, in wisconsin. however, michigan has adopted a limited retail choice program.
2016 form 10-k   62   wec energy group, inc.
restructuring in wisconsin electric utility revenues in wisconsin are regulated by the pscw. the pscw has been focused on electric reliability infrastructure issues for the state of wisconsin in recent years. the pscw continues to maintain the position that the question of whether to implement electric retail competition in wisconsin should ultimately be decided by the wisconsin legislature. no such legislation has been introduced in wisconsin to date.
restructuring in michigan under michigan law, our retail customers may choose an alternative electric supplier to provide power supply service. some of our small retail customers have switched to an alternative electric supplier. as of december 31, 2016, the law limited customer choice to 10% of our michigan retail load. due to the december 2016 passage of michigan act 341, this cap could potentially be reduced in future years. the iron ore mine in our service territory and certain load increases by facilities already using an alternative electric supplier are excluded from this cap, if various conditions are met. when a customer switches to an alternative electric supplier, we continue to provide distribution and customer service functions for the customer.
natural gas utility industry we offer natural gas transportation services to our customers that elect to purchase natural gas from an alternative retail natural gas supplier. since these transportation customers continue to use our distribution systems to transport the natural gas to their facilities, we earn distribution revenues from them. as such, the loss of revenue associated with the natural gas that transportation customers purchase from an alternative retail natural gas supplier has little impact on our net income, since it is offset by an equal reduction to natural gas costs.
restructuring in wisconsin the pscw previously instituted generic proceedings to consider how its regulation of natural gas distribution utilities should change to reflect a competitive environment in the natural gas industry. to date, the pscw has made a policy decision to provide customer classes with workably competitive market choices the option to choose an alternative retail natural gas supplier. the pscw has also adopted standards for transactions between a utility and its natural gas marketing affiliates. all of our wisconsin customer classes have workably competitive market choices and, therefore, can purchase natural gas directly from either an alternative retail natural gas supplier or their local natural gas utility. currently, we are unable to predict the impact of potential future industry restructuring on our results of operations or financial position.
restructuring in illinois since 2002, pgl and nsg have provided their customers with the option to choose an alternative retail natural gas supplier. we are not required by the icc or state law to make this option available to customers, but since this option is currently provided to our illinois customers, we would need icc approval to eliminate it.
restructuring in minnesota merc has provided its commercial and industrial customers with the option to choose an alternative retail natural gas supplier since 2006. we are not required by the mpuc or state law to make this option available to customers, but since this option is currently provided to our minnesota commercial and industrial customers, we would need mpuc approval to eliminate it.
restructuring in michigan the option to choose an alternative retail natural gas supplier has been provided to wps's michigan customers since the late 1990s and mgu's customers since 2005. we are not required by the mpsc or state law to make this option available to customers, but since this option is currently provided to our michigan customers, we would need mpsc approval to eliminate it.
environmental matters see note 18, commitments and contingencies, for a discussion of certain environmental matters affecting us, including rules and regulations relating to air quality, water quality, land quality, and climate change.

other matters american transmission company allowed return on equity complaints in november 2013, a group of miso industrial customer organizations filed a complaint with the ferc requesting to reduce the base roe used by miso transmission owners, including atc, from 12.2% to 9.15%. in october 2014, the ferc issued an order to hear the complaint on roe and set a refund effective date retroactive to november 2013. in december 2015, the alj issued an initial decision recommending that atc and all other miso transmission owners be authorized to collect a base roe of 10.32%, as well as the 0.5% incentive adder approved by the ferc in january 2015 for miso transmission owners. the incentive adder only applies to revenues collected after january 6, 2015. in september 2016, the ferc issued a final order related to this complaint affirming the use of the roes stated in the alj's initial decision, effective as of the order date, on a going-forward basis. the order also requires atc to provide refunds, with interest, for the 15-month refund period from november 13, 2013, through february 11, 2015. as of december 31, 2016, atc had started to provide refunds to we and wps for transmission costs paid during the refund period, and we expect the refund process to be completed by july 2017. as these refunds are received, we and wps reduce the regulatory assets recorded under the pscw-approved escrow accounting for transmission expense.
in february 2015, a second complaint was filed with the ferc requesting a reduction in the base roe used by miso transmission owners, including atc, to 8.67%, with a refund effective date retroactive to february 12, 2015. in june 2016, the alj issued an initial decision recommending that atc and all other miso transmission owners be authorized to collect a base roe of 9.7%, as well as the 0.5% incentive adder approved for miso transmission owners. the alj's initial decision is not binding on the ferc and applies to revenues collected from february 12, 2015, through may 11, 2016. we are not certain when a ferc order related to this matter will be issued.
miso transmission owners have filed various appeals related to several of the ferc orders with the d.c. circuit court of appeals as well as requests for rehearing.
the decrease in atc's roe resulting from the ferc's final order will have a negative impact on our equity earnings and distributions from atc in the future.
bonus depreciation provisions the protecting americans from tax hikes act of 2015 was signed into law on december 18, 2015. this act extended 50% bonus depreciation to assets placed in service during 2015 through 2017, 40% bonus depreciation to assets placed in service during 2018, and 30% bonus depreciation to assets placed in service during 2019. bonus depreciation is an additional amount of tax deductible depreciation that is awarded above what would normally be available. due to the resulting increase in federal tax depreciation, we did not make federal income tax payments for 2016, 2015, or 2014.
critical accounting policies and estimates preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in compliance with gaap requires the application of appropriate technical accounting rules and guidance as well as the use of estimates. the application of these policies necessarily involves judgments regarding future events, including the likelihood of success of particular projects, legal and regulatory challenges, and anticipated recovery of costs. these judgments, in and of themselves, could materially impact the financial statements and disclosures based on varying assumptions. in addition, the financial and operating environment may also have a significant effect, not only on the operation of our business, but on our results reported through the application of accounting measures used in preparing the financial statements and related disclosures, even if the nature of the accounting policies applied have not changed.
the following is a list of accounting policies that are most significant to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require management's most difficult, subjective, or complex judgments.

goodwill impairment we completed our annual goodwill impairment tests for all of our reporting units that carried a goodwill balance as of july 1, 2016. no impairments were recorded as a result of these tests. for all of our reporting units, the fair value calculated in step one of the test was greater than carrying value. the fair value of each reporting unit was calculated using a combination of the income approach and the market approach.
for the income approach, we used internal forecasts to project cash flows. any forecast contains a degree of uncertainty, and changes in these cash flows could significantly increase or decrease the fair value of a reporting unit. since all of our reporting units are regulated, a fair recovery of and return on costs prudently incurred to serve customers is assumed. an unfavorable outcome in a rate case could cause the fair values of our reporting units to decrease.
key assumptions used in the income approach include roes, long-term growth rates used to determine terminal values at the end of the discrete forecast period, and discount rates. the discount rate is applied to estimated future cash flows and is one of the most significant assumptions used to determine fair value under the income approach. as interest rates rise, the calculated fair values will decrease. the discount rate is based on the weighted-average cost of capital for each reporting unit, taking into account both the after-tax cost of debt and cost of equity. the terminal year roe for each utility is driven by its current allowed roe. the terminal growth rate is based primarily on a combination of historical and forecasted statistics for real gross domestic product and personal income for each utility service area.
for the market approach, we used an equal weighting of the guideline public company method and the guideline merged and acquired company method. the guideline public company method uses financial metrics from similar publicly traded companies to determine fair value. the guideline merged and acquired company method calculates fair value by analyzing the actual prices paid for recent mergers and acquisitions in the industry. we applied multiples derived from these two methods to the appropriate operating metrics for our reporting units to determine fair value.
the underlying assumptions and estimates used in the impairment tests were made as of a point in time. subsequent changes in these assumptions and estimates could change the results of the tests.
the fair values of our reporting units exceeded their carrying values by a substantial amount. based on these results, our reporting units are not at risk of failing step one of the goodwill impairment test.
our reporting units had the following goodwill balances at july 1, 2016:
see note 10, goodwill, for more information.
pension and other postretirement employee benefits the costs of providing non-contributory defined pension benefits and opeb, described in note 17, employee benefits, are dependent upon numerous factors resulting from actual plan experience and assumptions of future experience.
pension and opeb costs are impacted by actual employee demographics (including age, compensation levels, and employment periods), the level of contributions made to the plans, and earnings on plan assets. pension and opeb costs may also be significantly affected by changes in key actuarial assumptions, including anticipated rates of return on plan assets, mortality and discount rates, and expected health care cost trends. changes made to the plan provisions may also impact current and future pension and opeb costs.
pension and opeb plan assets are primarily made up of equity and fixed income investments. fluctuations in actual equity and fixed income market returns, as well as changes in general interest rates, may result in increased or decreased benefit costs in future periods. we believe that such changes in costs would be recovered or refunded at our utilities through the ratemaking process.

the discount rates are selected based on hypothetical bond portfolios consisting of noncallable (or callable with make-whole provisions), noncollateralized, high-quality corporate bonds across the full maturity spectrum. the bonds are generally rated "aa" with a minimum amount outstanding of $50.0 million. from the hypothetical bond portfolios, a single rate is determined that equates the market value of the bonds purchased to the discounted value of the plans' expected future benefit payments.
we establish our expected return on assets based on consideration of historical and projected asset class returns, as well as the target allocations of the benefit trust portfolios. the assumed long-term rate of return on pension plan assets was 7.12% in 2016, 7.37% in 2015, and 7.25% in 2014. the actual rate of return on pension plan assets, net of fees, was 7.75%, (3.85)%, and 6.17%, in 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively.
in selecting assumed health care cost trend rates, past performance and forecasts of health care costs are considered. for more information on health care cost trend rates and a table showing future payments that we expect to make for our pension and opeb, see note 17, employee benefits.
regulatory accounting our utility operations follow the guidance under the regulated operations topic of the fasb asc. our financial statements reflect the effects of the ratemaking principles followed by the various jurisdictions regulating us. certain items that would otherwise be immediately recognized as revenues and expenses are deferred as regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities for future recovery or refund to customers, as authorized by our regulators. future recovery of regulatory assets is not assured and is generally subject to review by regulators in rate proceedings for matters such as prudence and reasonableness. once approved, the regulatory assets and liabilities are amortized into earnings over the rate recovery period. if recovery or refund of costs is not approved or is no longer considered probable, these regulatory assets or liabilities are recognized in current period earnings. management regularly assesses whether these regulatory assets and liabilities are probable of future recovery or refund by considering factors such as changes in the regulatory environment, earnings from our electric and natural gas utility operations, and the status of any pending or potential deregulation legislation.
the application of the regulated operations topic of the fasb asc would be discontinued if all or a separable portion of our utility operations no longer met the criteria for application. our regulatory assets and liabilities would be written off as a charge to income as an unusual or infrequently occurring item in the period in which discontinuation occurred. as of december 31, 2016, we had $3,138.3 million in regulatory assets and $1,597.2 million in regulatory liabilities. see note 6, regulatory assets and liabilities, for more information.

unbilled revenues we record utility operating revenues when energy is delivered to our customers. however, the determination of energy sales to individual customers is based upon the reading of their meters, which occurs on a systematic basis throughout the month. at the end of each month, amounts of energy delivered to customers since the date of their last meter reading are estimated and corresponding unbilled revenues are calculated. this unbilled revenue is estimated each month based upon actual generation and throughput volumes, recorded sales, estimated customer usage by class, weather factors, estimated line losses, and applicable customer rates. significant fluctuations in energy demand for the unbilled period or changes in the composition of customer classes could impact the accuracy of the unbilled revenue estimate. total utility operating revenues during 2016 of approximately $7.4 billion included accrued utility revenues of $509.8 million as of december 31, 2016.
income tax expense we are required to estimate income taxes for each of the jurisdictions in which we operate as part of the process of preparing financial statements. this process involves estimating current income tax liabilities together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items, such as depreciation, for income tax and accounting purposes. these differences result in deferred income tax assets and liabilities, which are included within our balance sheets. we also assess the likelihood that our deferred income tax assets will be recovered through future taxable income. to the extent we believe that realization is not likely, we establish a valuation allowance, which is offset by an adjustment to the provision for income taxes in the income statements.
uncertainty associated with the application of tax statutes and regulations and the outcomes of tax audits and appeals requires that judgments and estimates be made in the accrual process and in the calculation of effective tax rates. only income tax benefits that meet the "more likely than not" recognition threshold may be recognized or continue to be recognized. unrecognized tax benefits are re-evaluated quarterly and changes are recorded based on new information, including the issuance of relevant guidance by the courts or tax authorities and developments occurring in the examinations of our tax returns.
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes, deferred income tax assets and liabilities, the liability for unrecognized tax benefits, and any valuation allowance recorded against deferred income tax assets. the assumptions involved are supported by historical data, reasonable projections, and interpretations of applicable tax laws and regulations across multiple taxing jurisdictions. significant changes in these assumptions could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations. see note 1(n), income taxes, and note 15, income taxes, for a discussion of accounting for income taxes.

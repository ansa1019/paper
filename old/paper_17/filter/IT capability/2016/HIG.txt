item 1a. risk factors in deciding whether to invest in the hartford, you should carefully consider the following risks, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operation or liquidity and could also impact the trading price of our securities. these risks are not exclusive, and additional risks to which we are subject include, but are not limited to, the factors mentioned under "forward-looking statements" above and the risks of our businesses described elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k.
the following risk factors have been organized by category for ease of use, however many of the risks may have impacts in more than one category. the occurrence of certain of them may, in turn, cause the emergence or exacerbate the effect of others. such a combination could materially increase the severity of the impact of these risks on our business, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.
risks relating to economic, political and global market conditions unfavorable economic, political and global market conditions may adversely impact our business and results of operations.
the company's investment portfolio and insurance liabilities are sensitive to changes in economic, political and global capital market conditions, such as the effect of a weak economy and changes in credit spreads, equity prices, interest rates and inflation. weak economic conditions, such as high unemployment, low labor force participation, lower family income, a weak real estate market, lower business investment and lower consumer spending may adversely affect the demand for insurance and financial products and lower the company's profitability in some cases. in addition, the company's investment portfolio includes limited partnerships and other alternative investments for which changes in value are reported in earnings. these investments may be adversely impacted by political turmoil and economic volatility, including real estate market deterioration, which could impact our net investment returns and result in an adverse impact on operating results.
below are several key factors impacted by changes in economic, political, and global market conditions and their potential effect on the company's business and results of operation:
•   credit spread risk- credit spread exposure is reflected in the market prices of fixed income instruments where lower rated securities generally trade at a higher credit spread. if issuer credit spreads increase or widen, the market value of our investment portfolio may decline. if the credit spread widening is significant and occurs over an extended period of time, the company may recognize other-than-temporary impairments, resulting in decreased earnings. if credit spreads tighten, significantly, the company's net investment income associated with new purchases of fixed maturities may be reduced. in addition, the value of credit derivatives under which the company assumes exposure or purchases protection are impacted by changes in credit spreads, with losses occurring when credit spreads widen for assumed exposure or, when credit spreads tighten if credit protection has been purchased.
our statutory surplus is also affected by widening credit spreads as a result of the accounting for the assets and liabilities on our fixed market value adjusted ("mva") annuities. statutory separate account assets supporting the fixed mva annuities are recorded at fair value. in determining the statutory reserve for the fixed mva annuity payments we owe contract-holders, we are required to use current crediting rates. in many capital market scenarios, current crediting rates are highly correlated with market rates implicit in the fair value of statutory separate account assets. as a result, the change in the statutory reserve from period to period will likely substantially offset the change in the fair value of the statutory separate account assets. however, in periods of volatile credit markets, actual credit spreads on investment assets may increase sharply for certain sub-sectors of the overall credit market, resulting in statutory separate account asset market value losses. as actual credit spreads are not fully reflected in current crediting rates, the calculation of statutory reserves may not substantially offset the change in fair value of the statutory separate account assets, resulting in reductions in statutory surplus. this may result in the need to devote significant additional capital to support the fixed mva product.
•   equity markets risk - a decline in equity markets may result in lower earnings from our mutual funds and talcott resolution operations where fee income is earned based upon the fair value of the assets under management. a decline in equity markets may also decrease the value of equity securities and limited partnerships and other alternative investments held in the company's general account portfolio, thereby negatively impacting our financial condition or reported earnings. in addition, certain of our annuity products have guaranteed minimum death benefits ("gmdb") or guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefits ("gmwb") that increase when equity markets decline requiring us to hold more statutory capital. while our hedging assets seek to reduce the net economic sensitivity of our potential obligations from guaranteed benefits to market fluctuations, because of the accounting asymmetries between our hedging targets and statutory and gaap accounting principles for our guaranteed benefits, rising equity markets and/or rising interest rates may result in statutory or gaap losses. the need to use additional capital to support these guaranteed benefits may adversely affect our ability to use funds for other purposes such as to support our other businesses, repay debt or repurchase shares.
•   interest rate risk - global economic conditions may result in the persistence of a low interest rate environment which would continue to pressure our net investment income and could result in lower margins and lower estimated gross profits on certain products.
part i - item 1a. risk factors new and renewal business for our property and casualty and group benefits products is priced based on prevailing interest rates. as interest rates decline, in order to achieve the same economic return, we would have to increase product prices to offset the lower anticipated investment income earned on invested premiums. conversely, as interest rates rise, pricing targets will tend to decrease to reflect higher anticipated investment income. our ability to effectively react to such changes in interest rates may affect our competitiveness in the marketplace, and in turn, could reduce written premium and earnings.
in addition, due to the long-term nature of the liabilities within our group benefits and talcott resolution operations, such as structured settlements, long-term disability and guaranteed benefits on variable annuities, declines in interest rates over an extended period of time would result in our having to reinvest at lower yields, increased hedging costs, reduced spreads on our annuity products and greater capital volatility. on the other hand, a rise in interest rates, in the absence of other countervailing changes, would reduce the market value of our investment portfolio and, if long-term interest rates were to rise dramatically, certain products within our talcott resolution segment might be exposed to disintermediation risk. disintermediation risk refers to the risk that our policyholders may surrender their contracts in a rising interest rate environment, requiring us to liquidate assets in an unrealized loss position. a decline in market value of invested assets due to an increase in interest rates could also limit our ability to realize tax benefits from previously recognized capital losses.
•   inflation risk - inflation is a risk to our property and casualty and group benefits businesses because, in many cases, claims are paid out many years after a policy is written and premium is collected for the risk. accordingly, a greater than expected increase in inflation related to the cost of medical services and repairs over the claim settlement period can result in higher claim costs than what was estimated at the time the policy was written. inflation can also affect consumer spending and business investment which can reduce the demand for our products and services.
concentration of our investment portfolio increases the potential for significant losses.
the concentration of our investment portfolios in any particular industry, collateral type, group of related industries or geographic sector could have an adverse effect on our investment portfolios and consequently on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity. events or developments that have a negative impact on any particular industry, collateral type, group of related industries or geographic region may have a greater adverse effect on our investment portfolio to the extent that the portfolio is concentrated rather than diversified.
further, if issuers of securities or loans we hold are acquired, merge or otherwise consolidate with other issuers of securities or loans held by the company, our investment portfolio's credit concentration risk to issuers could increase for a period of time, until the company is able to sell securities to get back in compliance with the established investment credit policies.
insurance industry and product related risks unfavorable loss development may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.
we establish property and casualty loss reserves to cover our estimated liability for the payment of all unpaid losses and loss expenses incurred with respect to premiums earned on our policies. loss reserves are estimates of what we expect the ultimate settlement and administration of claims will cost, less what has been paid to date. these estimates are based upon actuarial projections and on our assessment of currently available data, as well as estimates of claims severity and frequency, legal theories of liability and other factors.
loss reserve estimates are refined periodically as experience develops and claims are reported and settled, potentially resulting in increases to our reserves. increases in reserves would be recognized as an expense during the periods in which these determinations are made, thereby adversely affecting our results of operations for those periods. in addition, since reserve estimates of aggregate loss costs for prior years are used in pricing our insurance products, inaccurate reserves can lead to our products not being priced adequately to cover actual losses and related loss expenses in order to generate a profit.
we continue to receive asbestos and environmental ("a&e")claims, the vast majority of which relate to policies written before 1986. estimating the ultimate gross reserves needed for unpaid losses and related expenses for asbestos and environmental claims is particularly difficult for insurers and reinsurers. the actuarial tools and other techniques used to estimate the ultimate cost of more traditional insurance exposures tend to be less precise when used to estimate reserves for some a&e exposures.
moreover, the assumptions used to estimate gross reserves for a&e claims, such as claim frequency over time, average severity, and how various policy provisions will be interpreted, are subject to significant uncertainty. it is also not possible to predict changes in the legal and legislative environment and their effect on the future development of a&e claims. these factors, among others, make the variability of gross reserves estimates for these longer-tailed exposures significantly greater than for other more traditional exposures.
effective december 31, 2016, the company entered into an agreement with national indemnity company ("nico"), a subsidiary of berkshire hathaway inc. ("berkshire") whereby the company is reinsured for subsequent adverse development on substantially all of its net a&e reserves up to an aggregate net limit of $1.5 billion.  the adverse development cover excludes risk of adverse development on net asbestos and environmental reserves held by the company's u.k. property and casualty run-off subsidiaries which have been accounted for as liabilities held for sale in the consolidated balance sheets as of december 31, 2016. we remain directly liable to claimants and if the reinsurer does not fulfill its obligations under the agreement or if future adverse development exceeds the $1.5 billion aggregate limit, we may need to increase our recorded net reserves which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of
part i - item 1a. risk factors operations and liquidity. for additional information related to risks associated with the adverse development cover, see part ii, item 7, md&a - critical accounting estimates - property & casualty other operations - adverse development cover.
our insurance operations expose us to claims arising out of catastrophes. catastrophes can be caused by various unpredictable natural events, including, among others, earthquakes, hurricanes, hailstorms, severe winter weather, wind storms, fires, tornadoes, and pandemics. catastrophes can also be man-made, such as terrorist attacks, cyber-attacks, explosions or infrastructure failures.
the geographic distribution of our business subjects us to catastrophe exposure for events occurring in a number of areas, including, but not limited to: hurricanes in florida, the gulf coast, the northeast and the atlantic coast regions of the united states; tornadoes and hail in the midwest and southeast; earthquakes in california and the new madrid (midwest) region of the united states; and the spread of disease. any increases in the values and concentrations of insured employees and property in these areas would increase the severity of catastrophic events in the future. in addition, over time, climate change may increase the severity of certain natural catastrophe events. potential examples include, but are not limited to:
•   an increase in the frequency or severity of wind and thunderstorm and tornado/hailstorm events due to increased convection in the atmosphere,
•   the potential for an increase in severity of the largest hurricane events due to higher sea surface temperatures.
our businesses also have exposure to global or nationally occurring pandemics caused by highly infectious and potentially fatal diseases spread through human, animal or plant populations.
in the event of one or more catastrophes, policyholders may be unable to meet their obligations to pay premiums on our insurance policies. further, our liquidity could be constrained by a catastrophe, or multiple catastrophes, which could result in extraordinary losses. in addition, in part because accounting rules do not permit insurers to reserve for such catastrophic events until they occur, claims from catastrophic events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. the amount we charge for catastrophe exposure may be inadequate if the frequency or severity of catastrophe losses changes over time or if the models we use to estimate the exposure prove inadequate. in addition, regulators or legislators could limit our ability to charge adequate pricing for catastrophe exposures or shift more responsibility for covering risk.
terrorism is an example of a significant man-made caused potential catastrophe. private sector catastrophe reinsurance is limited and generally unavailable for terrorism losses caused by attacks with nuclear, biological, chemical or radiological weapons. reinsurance coverage from the federal government under the terrorism risk insurance program reauthorization act of 2015
("tripra") is also limited and only applies for certified acts of terrorism that exceed a certain threshold of industry losses. accordingly, the effects of a terrorist attack in the geographic areas we serve may result in claims and related losses for which we do not have adequate reinsurance. further, the continued threat of terrorism and the occurrence of terrorist attacks, as well as heightened security measures and military action in response to these threats and attacks or other geopolitical or military crises, may cause significant volatility in global financial markets, disruptions to commerce and reduced economic activity. these consequences could have an adverse effect on the value of the assets in our investment portfolio as well as those in our separate accounts. terrorist attacks also could disrupt our operation centers. for a further discussion of tripra, see part ii, item 7, md&a - enterprise risk management - insurance risk management, reinsurance as a risk management strategy.
as a result, it is possible that any, or a combination of all, of these factors related to a catastrophe, or multiple catastrophes, whether natural or man-made, can have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.
pricing for our products is subject to our ability to adequately assess risks, estimate losses and comply with state insurance regulations.
we seek to price our property and casualty and group benefits insurance policies such that insurance premiums and future net investment income earned on premiums received will provide for an acceptable profit in excess of underwriting expenses and the cost of paying claims. pricing adequacy depends on a number of factors, including proper evaluation of underwriting risks, the ability to project future claim costs, our expense levels, net investment income realized, our response to rate actions taken by competitors, legal and regulatory developments, and the ability to obtain regulatory approval for rate changes.
state insurance departments regulate many of the premium rates we charge and also propose rate changes for the benefit of the property and casualty consumer at the expense of the insurer, which may not allow us to reach targeted levels of profitability. in addition to regulating rates, certain states have enacted laws that require a property and casualty insurer to participate in assigned risk plans, reinsurance facilities, joint underwriting associations and other residual market plans. state regulators also require that an insurer offer property and casualty coverage to all consumers and often restrict an insurer's ability to charge the price it might otherwise charge or restrict an insurer's ability to offer or enforce specific policy deductibles. in these markets, we may be compelled to underwrite significant amounts of business at lower than desired rates or accept additional risk not contemplated in our existing rates, participate in the operating losses of residual market plans or pay assessments to fund operating deficits of state-sponsored funds, possibly leading to lower returns on equity. the laws and regulations of many states also limit an insurer's ability to withdraw from one or more lines of insurance in the state, except pursuant to a plan that is approved by the state's insurance department. additionally, certain states require insurers to participate in guaranty funds for impaired or insolvent insurance companies. these funds periodically assess losses against all insurance companies doing business in the state. any of these factors could have a material
part i - item 1a. risk factors adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.
additionally, the property and casualty and group benefits insurance markets have been historically cyclical, experiencing periods characterized by relatively high levels of price competition, less restrictive underwriting standards, more expansive coverage offerings, multi-year rate guarantees and declining premium rates, followed by periods of relatively low levels of competition, more selective underwriting standards, more coverage restrictions and increasing premium rates. in all of our property and casualty and group benefits insurance product lines and states, there is a risk that the premium we charge may ultimately prove to be inadequate as reported losses emerge. in addition, there is a risk that regulatory constraints, price competition or incorrect pricing assumptions could prevent us from achieving targeted returns. inadequate pricing could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
competitive activity, use of data analytics, or technological changes may adversely affect our market share, demand for our products, or our financial results.
the industries in which we operate are highly competitive. our principal competitors are other property and casualty insurers, group benefits providers and providers of mutual funds and exchange-traded products. competitors may expand their risk appetites in products and services where the hartford currently enjoys a competitive advantage. larger competitors with more capital and new entrants to the market could result in increased pricing pressures on a number of our products and services and may harm our ability to maintain or increase our profitability. for example, larger competitors, including those formed through consolidation, may have lower operating costs and an ability to absorb greater risk while maintaining their financial strength ratings, thereby allowing them to price their products more competitively. in addition, a number of insurers are making use of "big data" analytics to, among other things, improve pricing accuracy, be more targeted in marketing, strengthen customer relationships and provide more customized loss prevention services. if they are able to use big data more effectively than we are, it may give them a competitive advantage. because of the highly competitive nature of the industries we compete in, there can be no assurance that we will continue to compete effectively with our industry rivals, or that competitive pressure will not have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
our business could also be affected by technological changes, including further advancements in automotive safety features, the development of autonomous or "self-driving" vehicles, and platforms that facilitate ride sharing. these technologies could impact the frequency or severity of losses, disrupt the demand for certain of our products, or reduce the size of the automobile insurance market as a whole. in addition, the risks we insure are affected by the increased use of technology in homes and businesses, including technology used in heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems and the introduction of more automated loss control measures. while there is substantial uncertainty about the timing, penetration and reliability of such technologies, any such impacts could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
we may experience difficulty in marketing and providing insurance products and investment advisory services through distribution channels and advisory firms.
we distribute our insurance products, mutual funds and etps through a variety of distribution channels, including brokers, independent agents, broker-dealers, banks, affinity partners, our own internal sales force and other third-party organizations. in some areas of our business, we generate a significant portion of our business through third-party arrangements. for example, we market personal lines products in large part through an exclusive licensing arrangement with aarp that continues through january 1, 2023. our ability to distribute products through aarp may be adversely impacted by membership levels and the pace of membership growth. while we periodically seek to renew or extend third party arrangements, there can be no assurance that our relationship with these third parties will continue. an interruption in our relationship with certain of these third parties could materially affect our ability to market our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.
unexpected and unintended claim and coverage issues under our insurance contracts may adversely impact our financial performance.
changes in industry practices and in legal, judicial, social and other environmental conditions may require us to pay claims we did not intend to cover when we wrote the policies. these issues may either extend coverage beyond our underwriting intent or increase the frequency or severity of claims. in some instances, these changes may not become apparent until some time after we have issued insurance contracts that are affected by the changes. as a result, the full extent of liability under our insurance contracts may not be known for many years after a contract is issued, and this liability may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity at the time it becomes known.
our program to manage interest rate and equity risk related to our variable annuity guaranteed benefits may be ineffective which could result in statutory and gaap volatility in our earnings and potentially material charges to net income.
some of the in-force business within our talcott resolution operations, especially variable annuities, offer guaranteed benefits, including gmdbs and gmwbs. these gmdbs and gmwbs expose the company to interest rate risk and significant equity risk. a decline in equity markets would not only result in lower fee income, but would also increase our exposure to liability for benefit claims. we use reinsurance and benefit designs, such as caps, to mitigate the exposure associated with gmdb. we also use reinsurance in combination with product management actions, such as rider fee increases, investment restrictions and buyout offers, as well as derivative instruments to attempt to minimize the claim exposure and to reduce the volatility of net income associated with the gmwb liability. we remain liable for the guaranteed benefits in the event that
part i - item 1a. risk factors reinsurers or derivative counterparties are unable or unwilling to pay, which could result in a need for additional capital to support in-force business.
from time to time, we may adjust our risk management program based on contracts in force, market conditions, or other factors. while we believe that these actions improve the efficiency of our risk management related to these benefits, changes to the risk management program may result in greater statutory and gaap earnings volatility and, based upon the types of hedging instruments used, can result in potentially material charges to net income (loss) in periods of rising equity market pricing levels, higher interest rates and declines in volatility. we are also subject to the risk that these management actions prove ineffective or that unanticipated policyholder behavior, combined with adverse market events, produces economic losses beyond the scope of the risk management techniques employed, which individually or collectively may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.
financial strength, credit and counterparty risks downgrades in our financial strength or credit ratings may make our products less attractive, increase our cost of capital and inhibit our ability to refinance our debt.
financial strength and credit ratings are important in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies. rating agencies assign ratings based upon several factors. while most of the factors relate to the rated company, others relate to the views of the rating agency (including its assessment of the strategic importance of the rated company to the insurance group), general economic conditions, and circumstances outside the rated company's control. in addition, rating agencies may employ different models and formulas to assess the financial strength of a rated company, and from time to time rating agencies have altered these models. changes to the models or factors used by the rating agencies to assign ratings could adversely impact a rating agency's judgment of its internal rating and the publicly issued rating it assigns us.
our financial strength ratings, which are intended to measure our ability to meet policyholder obligations, are an important factor affecting public confidence in most of our products and, as a result, our competitiveness. a downgrade or a potential downgrade in the rating of our financial strength or of one of our principal insurance subsidiaries could affect our competitive position and reduce future sales of our products.
our credit ratings also affect our cost of capital. a downgrade or a potential downgrade of our credit ratings could make it more difficult or costly to refinance maturing debt obligations, to support business growth at our insurance subsidiaries and to maintain or improve the financial strength ratings of our principal insurance subsidiaries. downgrades could begin to trigger potentially material collateral calls on certain of our derivative instruments and enable counterparties to terminate derivative relationships, both of which could limit our ability to purchase additional derivative instruments. these events could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. for a further discussion of potential impacts of ratings downgrades on derivative instruments, including potential collateral calls, see part ii, item 7, md&a - capital resources and liquidity - derivative commitments.
the amount of statutory capital that we must hold to maintain our financial strength and credit ratings and meet other requirements can vary significantly from time to time and is sensitive to a number of factors outside of our control.
we conduct the vast majority of our business through licensed insurance company subsidiaries. statutory accounting standards and statutory capital and reserve requirements for these entities are prescribed by the applicable insurance regulators and the national association of insurance commissioners ("naic"). the minimum capital we must hold is based on risk-based capital ("rbc") formulas for both life and property and casualty companies. the rbc formula for life companies establishes capital requirements relating to insurance, business, asset and interest rate risks, including equity, interest rate and expense recovery risks associated with variable annuities and group annuities that contain death benefits or certain withdrawal benefits. the rbc formula for property and casualty companies sets required statutory surplus levels based on underwriting, asset, credit and off-balance sheet risks.
in any particular year, statutory surplus amounts and rbc ratios may increase or decrease depending on a variety of factors, including
•   the amount of additional capital our insurance subsidiaries must hold to support business growth,
•   changes in equity market levels,
•   the value of certain fixed-income and equity securities in our investment portfolio,
•   the value of certain derivative instruments,
•   changes in interest rates,
•   admissibility of deferred tax assets, and
•   changes to the naic rbc formulas.
most of these factors are outside of the company's control. the company's financial strength and credit ratings are significantly influenced by the statutory surplus amounts and rbc ratios of our insurance company subsidiaries. in addition, rating agencies may implement changes to their internal models that have the effect of increasing the amount of statutory capital we must hold in order to maintain our current ratings. also, in extreme scenarios of equity market declines and other capital market volatility, the amount of additional statutory reserves that we are required to hold for our variable annuity guarantees increases at a greater than linear rate. this reduces the statutory surplus used
part i - item 1a. risk factors in calculating our rbc ratios. when equity markets increase, surplus levels and rbc ratios would generally be expected to increase. however, as a result of a number of factors and market conditions, including the level of hedging costs and other risk transfer activities, statutory reserve requirements for death and withdrawal benefit guarantees and increases in rbc requirements, surplus and rbc ratios may not increase when equity markets increase. due to these factors, projecting statutory capital and the related rbc ratios is complex. if our statutory capital resources are insufficient to maintain a particular rating by one or more rating agencies, we may seek to raise capital through public or private equity or debt financing. if we were not to raise additional capital, either at our discretion or because we were unable to do so, our financial strength and credit ratings might be downgraded by one or more rating agencies.
losses due to nonperformance or defaults by counterparties can have a material adverse effect on the value of our investments, reduce our profitability or sources of liquidity.
we have credit risk with counterparties on investments, derivatives, premiums receivable and reinsurance recoverables. among others, our counterparties include issuers of fixed maturity and equity securities we hold, borrowers of mortgage loans we hold, customers, trading counterparties, counterparties under swaps and other derivative contracts, reinsurers, clearing agents, exchanges, clearing houses and other financial intermediaries and guarantors. these counterparties may default on their obligations to us due to bankruptcy, insolvency, lack of liquidity, adverse economic conditions, operational failure, fraud, government intervention and other reasons. defaults by these counterparties on their obligations to us could have a material adverse effect on the value of our investments, business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. additionally, if the underlying assets supporting the structured securities we invest in default on their payment obligations, our securities will incur losses.
the availability of reinsurance and our ability to recover under reinsurance contracts may not be sufficient to protect us against losses.
as an insurer, we frequently use reinsurance to reduce the effect of losses that may arise from, among other things, catastrophes and other risks that can cause unfavorable results of operations, gmdbs and gmwbs under variable annuity contracts, and to effect the sale of a line of business to an independent company. under these reinsurance arrangements, other insurers assume a portion of our losses and related expenses; however, we remain liable as the direct insurer on all risks reinsured. consequently, ceded reinsurance arrangements do not eliminate our obligation to pay claims, and we are subject to our reinsurers' credit risk with respect to our ability to recover amounts due from them. the inability or unwillingness of any reinsurer to meet its financial obligations to us, including the impact of any insolvency or rehabilitation proceedings involving a reinsurer that could affect the company's access to collateral held in trust, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. this risk may be magnified by a concentration of reinsurance-related credit risk resulting from the sale of the company's individual life and retirement products businesses. further details of such concentration can be found in part ii, item 7, md&a - enterprise risk management - reinsurance as a risk management strategy.
in addition, should the availability and cost of reinsurance change materially, we may have to pay higher reinsurance costs, accept an increase in our net liability exposure, reduce the amount of business we write, or access to the extent possible other alternatives to reinsurance, such as use of the capital markets. further, due to the inherent uncertainties as to collection and the length of time before reinsurance recoverables will be due, it is possible that future adjustments to the company's reinsurance recoverables, net of the allowance, could be required, which could have a material adverse effect on the company's consolidated results of operations or cash flows in a particular quarterly or annual period.
our ability to declare and pay dividends is subject to limitations.
the payment of future dividends on our capital stock is subject to the discretion of our board of directors, which considers, among other factors, our operating results, overall financial condition, credit-risk considerations and capital requirements, as well as general business and market conditions. our board of directors may only declare such dividends out of funds legally available for such payments. moreover, our common stockholders are subject to the prior dividend rights of any holders of depositary shares representing such preferred stock then outstanding. the terms of our outstanding junior subordinated debt securities prohibit us from declaring or paying any dividends or distributions on our capital stock or purchasing, acquiring, or making a liquidation payment on such stock, if we have given notice of our election to defer interest payments and the related deferral period has not yet commenced or a deferral period is continuing.
moreover, as a holding company that is separate and distinct from our insurance subsidiaries, we have no significant business operations of our own. therefore, we rely on dividends from our insurance company subsidiaries and other subsidiaries as the principal source of cash flow to meet our obligations. subsidiary dividends fund payments on our debt securities and the payment of dividends to shareholders on our capital stock. connecticut state laws and certain other jurisdictions in which we operate limit the payment of dividends and require notice to and approval by the state insurance commissioner for the declaration or payment of dividends above certain levels. dividends paid from our insurance subsidiaries are further dependent on their cash requirements. in addition, in the event of liquidation or reorganization of a subsidiary, prior claims of a subsidiary's creditors may take precedence over the holding company's right to a dividend or distribution from the subsidiary except to the extent that the holding company may be a creditor of that subsidiary. for further discussion on dividends from insurance subsidiaries, see part ii, item 7, md&a - capital resources & liquidity.
part i - item 1a. risk factors risks relating to estimates, assumptions and valuations actual results could materially differ from the analytical models we use to assist our decision making in key areas such as underwriting, capital, hedging, reserving, and catastrophe risks.
we use models to help make decisions related to, among other things, underwriting, pricing, capital allocation, reserving, investments, hedging, reinsurance, and catastrophe risk. both proprietary and third party models we use incorporate numerous assumptions and forecasts about the future level and variability of interest rates, capital requirements, loss frequency and severity, currency exchange rates, policyholder behavior, equity markets and inflation, among others. the models are subject to the inherent limitations of any statistical analysis as the historical internal and industry data and assumptions used in the models may not be indicative of what will happen in the future. consequently, actual results may differ materially from our modeled results. the profitability and financial condition of the company substantially depends on the extent to which our actual experience is consistent with assumptions we use in our models and ultimate model outputs. if, based upon these models or other factors, we misprice our products or our estimates of the risks we are exposed to prove to be materially inaccurate, our business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity may be adversely affected.
the valuation of our securities and investments and the determination of allowances and impairments are highly subjective and based on methodologies, estimations and assumptions that are subject to differing interpretations and market conditions.
estimated fair values of the company's investments are based on available market information and judgments about financial instruments, including estimates of the timing and amounts of expected future cash flows and the credit standing of the issuer or counterparty. during periods of market disruption, it may be difficult to value certain of our securities if trading becomes less frequent and/or market data becomes less observable. there may be certain asset classes that were in active markets with significant observable data that become illiquid due to the financial environment. in addition, there may be certain securities whose fair value is based on one or more unobservable inputs, even during normal market conditions. as a result, the determination of the fair values of these securities may include inputs and assumptions that require more estimation and management judgment and the use of complex valuation methodologies. these fair values may differ materially from the value at which the investments may be ultimately sold. further, rapidly changing or unprecedented credit and equity market conditions could materially impact the valuation of securities and the period-to-period changes in value could vary significantly.
decreases in value could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
similarly, management's decision on whether to record an other-than-temporary impairment or write down is subject to significant judgments and assumptions regarding changes in general economic conditions, the issuer's financial condition or future recovery prospects, estimated future cash flows, the effects of changes in interest rates or credit spreads, the expected recovery period and the accuracy of third party information used in internal assessments. as a result, management's evaluations and assessments are highly judgmental and its projections of future cash flows over the life of certain securities may ultimately prove incorrect as facts and circumstances change.
if assumptions used in estimating future gross profits differ from actual experience, we may be required to accelerate the amortization of dac and increase reserves for gmdb and gmwb on variable annuities, which could adversely affect our results of operation.
the company has deferred acquisition costs associated with the prior sales of its variable annuity products. deferred acquisition costs for the variable annuity products are amortized over the expected life of the contracts. the remaining deferred but not yet amortized cost is referred to as the deferred acquisition cost ("dac") asset. we amortize these costs based on the ratio of actual gross profits in the period to the present value of current and future estimated gross profits ("egps"). the company evaluates the egps compared to the dac asset to determine if an impairment exists. the company also establishes reserves for gmdb and the life contingent portion of gmwb using components of egps. the projection of egps, or components of egps, requires the use of certain assumptions that may not prove accurate, including those related to changes in the separate account fund returns, full or partial surrender rates, mortality, withdrawal benefit utilization, withdrawal rates, annuitization and hedging costs.
in addition, if our assumptions about policyholder behavior (e.g., full or partial surrenders, benefit utilization and annuitization) and costs related to mitigating risks, including hedging costs, prove to be inaccurate or if significant or sustained equity market declines occur, we could be required to accelerate the amortization of dac related to variable annuity contracts, and increase reserves for gmdb and life-contingent gmwb which would result in a charge to net income.
if our businesses do not perform well, we may be required to establish a valuation allowance against the deferred income tax asset or to recognize an impairment of our goodwill.
our income tax expense includes deferred income taxes arising from temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and carry-forwards for foreign tax credits, capital losses, net operating losses and alternative minimum tax credits. deferred tax assets are assessed periodically by management to determine if it is more likely than not that the deferred income tax assets will be realized. factors in management's determination include the performance of the
part i - item 1a. risk factors business, including the ability to generate, from a variety of sources and tax planning strategies, sufficient future taxable income and capital gains before net operating loss and capital loss carry-forwards expire. if based on available information, it is more likely than not that we are unable to recognize a full tax benefit on deferred tax assets, then a valuation allowance will be established with a corresponding charge to net income (loss). charges to increase our valuation allowance could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
goodwill represents the excess of the amounts we paid to acquire subsidiaries and other businesses over the fair value of their net assets at the date of acquisition. we test goodwill at least annually for impairment. impairment testing is performed based upon estimates of the fair value of the "reporting unit" to which the goodwill relates. the reporting unit is the operating segment or a business one level below an operating segment if discrete financial information is prepared and regularly reviewed by management at that level. the fair value of the reporting unit could decrease if new business, customer retention, profitability or other drivers of performance differ from expectations. if it is determined that the goodwill has been impaired, the company must write down the goodwill by the amount of the impairment, with a corresponding charge to net income (loss). these write downs could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.
strategic and operational risks as our talcott resolution business continues to run-off, the company is exposed to a number of risks related to the run-off business that could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
despite being in run-off, talcott resolution represents a meaningful share of the company's earnings. talcott resolution's revenues and earnings have been and will continue declining as variable and fixed annuity policies lapse. while the company has been reducing expenses associated with the talcott resolution business as the revenues from that business decline, going forward it may become more difficult to reduce expenses, particularly corporate and other enterprise shared services costs, and this could adversely affect the company's results of operations. in addition, as talcott resolution's earnings decline, there will be less retained earnings in the company's talcott resolution insurance subsidiaries available to fund capital management actions.
further, while the company continues to actively consider alternatives for reducing the size and risk of the annuity book of business, opportunities to do so may be limited and any initiatives pursued may not achieve the anticipated benefits and may negatively impact our statutory capital, net income, core earnings or shareholders' equity. the company could pursue transactions or other strategic options to reduce the size and risk of talcott resolution's annuity book of business which could result in a significant loss to the company.
our businesses may suffer and we may incur substantial costs if we are unable to access our systems and safeguard the security of our data in the event of a disaster, cyber breach or other information security incident.
we use technology to process, store, retrieve, evaluate and utilize customer and company data and information. our information technology and telecommunications systems, in turn, interface with and rely upon third-party systems. we and our third party vendors must be able to access our systems to provide insurance quotes, process premium payments, make changes to existing policies, file and pay claims, administer variable annuity products and mutual funds, provide customer support, manage our investment portfolios and hedge programs, report on financial results and perform other necessary business functions.
systems failures or outages could compromise our ability to perform these business functions in a timely manner, which could harm our ability to conduct business and hurt our relationships with our business partners and customers. in the event of a disaster such as a natural catastrophe, a pandemic, an industrial accident, a cyber attack, a blackout, a terrorist attack (including conventional, nuclear, biological, chemical or radiological) or war, systems upon which we rely may be inaccessible to our employees, customers or business partners for an extended period of time. even if our employees and business partners are able to report to work, they may be unable to perform their duties for an extended period of time if our data or systems used to conduct our business are disabled or destroyed.
our systems have been, and will likely continue to be, subject to viruses or other malicious codes, unauthorized access, cyber-attacks or other computer related penetrations. the frequency and sophistication of such threats continue to increase as well. while, to date, the hartford is not aware of having experienced a material breach of our cyber security systems, administrative and technical controls as well as other preventive actions may be insufficient to prevent physical and electronic break-ins, denial of service, cyber-attacks or other security breaches to our systems or those of third parties with whom we do business. such an event could compromise our confidential information as well as that of our clients and third parties, impede or interrupt our business operations and result in other negative consequences, including remediation costs, loss of revenue, additional regulatory scrutiny and litigation and reputational damage. in addition, we routinely transmit, to third parties personal, confidential and proprietary information, which may be related to employees and customers, by email and other electronic means, along with receiving and storing such information on our systems. although we attempt to keep such information confidential, we may be unable to secure the information in all events, especially with clients, vendors, service providers, counterparties and other third parties who may not have appropriate controls to protect confidential information.
furthermore, certain of our businesses must comply with regulations to control the privacy of customer, employee and third party data. a misuse or mishandling of confidential or proprietary information could result in legal liability, regulatory action and reputational harm.
third parties, including third party administrators, are also subject to cyber-breaches of confidential information, along with the other risks outlined above, any one of which may result in our
part i - item 1a. risk factors incurring substantial costs and other negative consequences, including a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. while we maintain cyber liability insurance that provides both third party liability and first party insurance coverages, our insurance may not be sufficient to protect against all loss.
performance problems due to outsourcing and other third-party relationships may compromise our ability to conduct business.
we outsource certain business and administrative functions and rely on third-party vendors to perform certain functions or provide certain services on our behalf and have a significant number of information technology and business processes outsourced with a single vendor. if we are unable to reach agreement in the negotiation of agreements or renewals with certain third-party providers, or if such third-party providers experience disruptions or do not perform as anticipated, we may we may be unable to meet our obligations to customers and claimants, incur higher costs and lose business which may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. for other risks associated with our outsourcing of certain functions, see the immediately preceding risk factor.
our ability to execute on our capital management plan, expense reduction initiatives and other actions, which may include acquisitions, divestitures or restructurings, is subject to material challenges, uncertainties and risks.
the ability to execute on our capital management plan remains subject to material challenges, uncertainties and risks. we may not achieve all of the benefits we expect to derive from our plan to repurchase our equity and reduce our debt. our capital management plan is subject to execution risks, including, among others, risks related to market fluctuations, investor interest and potential legal constraints that could delay execution at an otherwise optimal time. there can be no assurance that we will in fact complete our capital management plan over the planned time frame or at all. initiatives to reduce expenses so that our ongoing businesses remain or become cost efficient may not be successful and we may not be able to reduce corporate and shared services expenses in the manner and on the schedule we currently anticipate. we may take further actions beyond the capital management plan, which may include acquisitions, divestitures or restructurings, that may involve additional uncertainties and risks that negatively impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.
we rely on a combination of contractual rights and copyright, trademark, patent and trade secret laws to establish and protect our intellectual property. although we use a broad range of measures to protect our intellectual property rights, third parties may infringe or misappropriate our intellectual property. we may have to litigate to enforce and protect our intellectual property and to determine its scope, validity or enforceability, which could divert significant resources and may not prove successful.
litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights may not be successful and cost a lot of money. the inability to secure or enforce the protection of our intellectual property assets could harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business and our ability to compete. we also may be subject to costly litigation in the event that another party alleges our operations or activities infringe upon their intellectual property rights, including patent rights, or violate license usage rights. any such intellectual property claims and any resulting litigation could result in significant expense and liability for damages, and in some circumstances we could be enjoined from providing certain products or services to our customers, or utilizing and benefiting from certain patent, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets or licenses, or alternatively could be required to enter into costly licensing arrangements with third parties, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
regulatory and legal risks regulatory and legislative developments could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.
in the u.s., regulatory initiatives and legislative developments may significantly affect our operations and prospects in ways that we cannot predict.
for example, potential repeal and replacement of the affordable care act and modification of the dodd-frank act could have unanticipated consequences for the company and its businesses. with respect to the potential repeal and replacement of the affordable care act, see part ii, item 7, md&a - capital resources and liquidity - contingencies - regulatory and legal developments.
the dodd-frank act was enacted on july 21, 2010, mandating changes to the regulation of the financial services industry that could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. the dodd-frank act requires central clearing of certain derivatives transactions and greater margin requirements for those transactions, which increases the costs of our hedging program. in addition, the proprietary trading and market making limitation of the volcker rule could adversely affect the pricing and liquidity of our investment securities and limitations of banking entity involvement in and ownership of certain asset-backed securities transactions could adversely affect the market for insurance-linked securities, including catastrophe bonds. it is unclear whether and to what extent congress will make changes to the dodd-frank act, and how those changes might impact the company, its business, financial conditions, results of operations and liquidity.
we are subject to extensive laws and regulations that are complex, subject to change and often conflicting in their approach or intended outcomes. compliance with these laws and regulations can increase cost, affect our strategy, and constrain our ability to adequately price our products.
part i - item 1a. risk factors authorized to conduct business. state regulations generally seek to protect the interests of policyholders rather than an insurer or the insurer's shareholders and other investors. u.s. state laws grant insurance regulatory authorities broad administrative powers with respect to, among other things, licensing and authorizing lines of business, approving policy forms and premium rates, setting statutory capital and reserve requirements, limiting the types and amounts of certain investments and restricting underwriting practices. state insurance departments also set constraints on domestic insurer transactions with affiliates and dividends and, in many cases, must approve affiliate transactions and extraordinary dividends as well as strategic transactions such as acquisitions and divestitures.
in addition, future regulatory initiatives could be adopted at the federal or state level that could impact the profitability of our businesses. for example, the naic and state insurance regulators are continually reexamining existing laws and regulations, specifically focusing on modifications to statutory accounting principles, interpretations of existing laws and the development of new laws and regulations. the naic continues to enhance the u.s. system of insurance solvency regulation, with a particular focus on group supervision, risk-based capital, accounting and financial reporting, enterprise risk management and reinsurance. any proposed or future legislation or naic initiatives, if adopted, may be more restrictive on our ability to conduct business than current regulatory requirements or may result in higher costs or increased statutory capital and reserve requirements. in addition, the federal reserve board and the international association of insurance supervisors ("iais") each have initiatives underway to develop insurance group capital standards. while the company would not currently be subject to either of these capital standard regimes, it is possible that in the future standards similar to what is being contemplated by the federal reserve board or the iais could apply to the company. the naic is in the process of developing a u.s. group capital calculation that will employ a methodology based on aggregated risk-based capital.
further, a particular regulator or enforcement authority may interpret a legal, accounting, or reserving issue differently than we have, exposing us to different or additional regulatory risks. the application of these regulations and guidelines by insurers involves interpretations and judgments that may be challenged by state insurance departments. the result of those potential challenges could require us to increase levels of statutory capital and reserves or incur higher operating and/or tax costs.
in addition, our asset management businesses are also subject to extensive regulation in the various jurisdictions where they operate.. these laws and regulations are primarily intended to protect investors in the securities markets or investment advisory clients and generally grant supervisory authorities broad administrative powers. compliance with these laws and regulations is costly, time consuming and personnel intensive, and may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.
our insurance business is sensitive to significant changes in the legal environment that could adversely affect the hartford's results of operations or financial condition or harm its businesses.
like any major p&c insurance company, litigation is a routine part of the hartford's business - both in defending and indemnifying our insureds and in litigating insurance coverage disputes. the hartford accounts for such activity by establishing unpaid loss and loss adjustment expense reserves. significant changes in the legal environment could cause our ultimate liabilities to change from our current expectations. such changes could be judicial in nature, like trends in the size of jury awards, developments in the law relating to tort liability or the liability of insurers, and rulings concerning the scope of insurance coverage or the amount or types of damages covered by insurance. legislative developments, like changes in federal or state laws relating to the liability of policyholders or insurers, could have a similar effect. it is impossible to forecast such changes reliably, much less to predict how they might affect our loss reserves or how those changes might adversely affect our ability to price our insurance products appropriately. thus, significant judicial or legislative developments could adversely affect the hartford's business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.
changes in federal or state tax laws could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.
changes in federal or state tax laws and tax rates could have a material adverse effect on our profitability and financial condition, and could result in our incurring materially higher corporate taxes. higher tax rates may cause the small businesses we insure to hire fewer workers and decrease investment in their businesses, including purchasing fewer vehicles, property and equipment, which could adversely affect our ability to sell our products and services to these customers. if tax rates decline, our deferred tax asset would be reduced, resulting in a charge against earnings. in addition, a reduction in tax rates or change in laws could adversely affect the company's ability to realize the benefits of its net operating loss carryovers and alternative minimum tax credits. in addition, a reduction in tax rates could increase the level of statutory reserves the company must hold which could adversely affect statutory surplus.
in addition, the company's tax return reflects certain items such as tax-exempt bond interest, dividends received deductions, tax credits, and insurance reserve deductions. there is an increasing risk that, in the context of deficit reduction or overall tax reform, federal and/or state tax legislation could modify or eliminate these items, impacting the company, its investments, investment strategies, and/or its policyholders. in the context of deficit reduction or overall tax reform, federal and/or state tax legislation could modify or eliminate provisions of current tax law that are beneficial to the company, including tax-exempt bond interest, dividends received deduction, tax credits, and insurance reserve deductions, or could impose new taxes such as on goods or services purchased overseas.
moreover, many of the life and annuity products that the company previously sold benefit from one or more forms of tax-favored status under current federal and state income tax
part i - item 1a. risk factors regimes. for example, the company previously sold annuity contracts that allowed policyholders to defer the recognition of taxable income earned within the contract. because the company no longer sells these products, changes in the future taxation of life insurance and/or annuity contracts will not adversely impact future sales. if, however, the tax treatment of earnings accrued inside an annuity contract changed prospectively, and the tax favored status of existing contracts were grandfathered, holders of existing contracts would be less likely to surrender, which would make running off our existing life and annuity business more difficult.
regulatory requirements could delay, deter or prevent a takeover attempt that shareholders might consider in their best interests.
before a person can acquire control of a u.s. insurance company, prior written approval must be obtained from the insurance commissioner of the state where the domestic insurer is domiciled. prior to granting approval of an application to acquire control of a domestic insurer, the state insurance commissioner will consider such factors as the financial strength of the applicant, the acquirer's plans for the future operations of the domestic insurer, and any such additional information as the insurance commissioner may deem necessary or appropriate for the protection of policyholders or in the public interest. generally, state statutes provide that control over a domestic insurer is presumed to exist if any person, directly or indirectly, owns, controls, holds with the power to vote, or holds proxies representing 10 percent or more of the voting securities of the domestic insurer or its parent company. because a person acquiring 10 percent or more of our common stock would indirectly control the same percentage of the stock of our u.s. insurance subsidiaries, the insurance change of control laws of various u.s. jurisdictions would likely apply to such a transaction. other laws or required approvals pertaining to one or more of our existing subsidiaries, or a future subsidiary, may contain similar or additional restrictions on the acquisition of control of the company. these laws may discourage potential acquisition proposals and may delay, deter, or prevent a change of control, including transactions that our board of directors and some or all of our shareholders might consider to be desirable.
changes in accounting principles and financial reporting requirements could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition.
as an sec registrant, we are currently required to prepare our financial statements in accordance with u.s. gaap, as promulgated by the financial accounting standards board ("fasb"). accordingly, we are required to adopt new guidance or interpretations which may have a material effect on our results of operations and financial condition that is either unexpected or has a greater impact than expected. for a description of changes in accounting standards that are currently pending and, if known, our estimates of their expected impact, see note 1 of the consolidated financial statements.
the fasb is working on several projects that could result in significant changes in gaap, including how we account for our long-duration insurance contracts, which primarily relate to our life and annuity products.  in particular, liabilities for life-contingent fixed annuities would be discounted using current high-quality fixed-income instrument yields rather than using historical yields, likely resulting in greater volatility in other comprehensive income. as a result, the adoption of these future accounting standards relating to insurance contracts could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.
item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations
(dollar amounts in millions, except for per share data, unless otherwise stated)
the hartford provides projections and other forward-looking information in the following discussions, which contain many forward-looking statements, particularly relating to the company's future financial performance. these forward-looking statements are estimates based on information currently available to the company, are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 and are subject to the cautionary statements set forth on pages 4 and 5 of this form 10-k. actual results are likely to differ, and in the past have differed, materially from those forecast by the company, depending on the outcome of various factors, including, but not limited to, those set forth in each following discussion and in part i, item 1a, risk factors, and those identified from time to time in our other filings with the securities and exchange commission. the hartford undertakes no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise.

key performance measures and ratios the company considers the measures and ratios in the following discussion to be key performance indicators for its businesses. management believes that these ratios and measures are useful in understanding the underlying trends in the hartford's businesses. however, these key performance indicators should only be used in conjunction with, and not in lieu of, the results presented in the segment discussions that follow in this md&a. these ratios and measures may not be comparable to other performance measures used by the company's competitors.
definitions of non-gaap and other measures and ratios account value- includes policyholders' balances for investment and insurance contracts and reserves for certain future policy benefits for insurance contracts. account value is a measure used by the company because a significant portion of the company's fee income is based upon the level of account value. these revenues increase or decrease with a rise or fall in assets under management whether caused by changes in the market or through net flows.
assets under management ("aum")- include account values, mutual fund and etp assets. aum is a measure used by the company because a significant portion of the
part ii - item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations company's revenues are based upon asset values. these revenues increase or decrease with a rise or fall in aum whether caused by changes in the market or through net flows.
book value per diluted share- a u.s. gaap financial measure that represents a per share assessment of the value of a company's equity. it is calculated by dividing (a) common stockholders' equity by (b) common shares outstanding and dilutive potential common shares. the company provides book value per diluted share to enable investors to assess the value of the company's equity.
catastrophe ratio- (a component of the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio) represents the ratio of catastrophe losses incurred in the current calendar year (net of reinsurance) to earned premiums and includes catastrophe losses incurred for both the current and prior accident years. a catastrophe is an event that causes $25 or more in industry insured property losses and affects a significant number of property and casualty policyholders and insurers. the catastrophe ratio includes the effect of catastrophe losses, but does not include the effect of reinstatement premiums.
combined ratio- the sum of the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio, the expense ratio and the policyholder dividend ratio. this ratio is a relative measurement that describes the related cost of losses and expenses for every $100 of earned premiums. a combined ratio below 100 demonstrates underwriting profit; a combined ratio above 100 demonstrates underwriting losses.
core earnings- a non-gaap measure, is an important measure of the company's operating performance. the company believes that core earnings provides investors with a valuable measure of the underlying performance of the company's businesses because it reveals trends in our insurance and financial services businesses that may be obscured by including the net effect of certain realized capital gains and losses, certain restructuring and other costs, pension settlements, loss on extinguishment of debt, reinsurance gains and losses from disposal of businesses, income tax benefit from reduction in deferred income tax valuation allowance, discontinued operations, and the impact of unlocks to dac, sales inducement assets ("sia"), and death and other insurance benefit reserve balances. some realized capital gains and losses are primarily driven by investment decisions and external economic developments, the nature and timing of which are unrelated to the insurance and underwriting aspects of our business. accordingly, core earnings excludes the effect of all realized gains and losses (net of tax and the effects of dac) that tend to be highly variable from period to period based on capital market conditions. the company believes, however, that some realized capital gains and losses are integrally related to our insurance operations, so core earnings includes net realized gains and losses such as net periodic settlements on credit derivatives. these net realized gains and losses are directly related to an offsetting item included in the income statement such as net investment income. net income (loss) is the most directly comparable u.s. gaap measure. core earnings should not be considered as a substitute for net income (loss) and does not reflect the overall profitability of the company's business. therefore, the company believes that it is useful for investors to evaluate both net income (loss) and core earnings when reviewing the company's performance.

[1] includes income tax benefit on items not included in core earnings and other federal income tax benefits and charges.
core earnings margin- a non-gaap financial measure that the company uses to evaluate, and believes is an important measure of, the group benefits segment's operating performance. core earnings margin is calculated by dividing core earnings by revenues excluding buyouts and realized gains (losses). net income margin is the most directly comparable u.s. gaap measure. the company believes that core earnings margin provides investors with a valuable measure of the performance of group benefits because it reveals trends in the business that may be obscured by the effect of buyouts and realized gains (losses).
core earnings margin should not be considered as a substitute for net income margin and does not reflect the overall profitability of group benefits. therefore, the company believes it is important for investors to evaluate both core earnings margin and net income margin when reviewing performance. a reconciliation of net income margin to core earnings margin for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 is set forth in the results of operations section within md&a - group benefits.
expense ratio- for the underwriting segments of commercial lines and personal lines is the ratio of underwriting
part ii - item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations expenses to earned premiums. underwriting expenses include the amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs and insurance operating costs and expenses, including certain centralized services and bad debt expense. deferred policy acquisition costs include commissions, taxes, licenses and fees and other underwriting expenses and are amortized over the policy term.
the expense ratio for group benefits is expressed as the ratio of insurance operating costs and other expenses and amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs, to premiums and other considerations, excluding buyout premiums.
fee income- largely driven from amounts earned as a result of contractually defined percentages of assets under management, including account value of annuities and other products. these fees are generally earned on a daily basis. therefore, the growth in assets under management either through positive net flows or net sales, or favorable market performance will have a favorable impact on fee income. conversely, either negative net flows or net sales, or unfavorable market performance will reduce fee income.
full surrender rates- an internal measure of contract surrenders calculated using annualized full surrenders divided by a two-point average of annuity account values. the full surrender rate represents full contract liquidation and excludes partial withdrawals.
loss and loss adjustment expense ratio- a measure of the cost of claims incurred in the calendar year divided by earned premium and includes losses incurred for both the current and prior accident years, as well as the costs of mortality and morbidity and other contractholder benefits to policyholders. among other factors, the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio needed for the company to achieve its targeted return on equity fluctuates from year to year based on changes in the expected investment yield over the claim settlement period, the timing of expected claim settlements and the targeted returns set by management based on the competitive environment.
the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio is affected by claim frequency and claim severity, particularly for shorter-tail property lines of business, where the emergence of claim frequency and severity is credible and likely indicative of ultimate losses. claim frequency represents the percentage change in the average number of reported claims per unit of exposure in the current accident year compared to that of the previous accident year. claim severity represents the percentage change in the estimated average cost per claim in the current accident year compared to that of the previous accident year. as one of the factors used to determine pricing, the company's practice is to first make an overall assumption about claim frequency and severity for a given line of business and then, as part of the ratemaking process, adjust the assumption as appropriate for the particular state, product or coverage.
loss and loss adjustment expense ratio before catastrophes and prior accident year development- a measure of the cost of non-catastrophe claims incurred in the current accident year divided by earned premiums. management believes that the current accident year loss and loss adjustment expense ratio before catastrophes is a performance measure that is useful to investors as it removes the impact of volatile and unpredictable catastrophe losses and prior accident year development.
loss ratio, excluding buyouts- utilized for the group benefits segment and is expressed as a ratio of benefits, losses and loss adjustment expenses to premiums and other considerations, excluding buyout premiums. since group benefits occasionally buys a block of claims for a stated premium amount, the company excludes this buyout from the loss ratio used for evaluating the underwriting results of the business as buyouts may distort the loss ratio. buyout premiums represent takeover of open claim liabilities and other non-recurring premium amounts.
mutual fund and exchange-traded product assets-  owned by the shareholders of those products and not by the company and therefore are not reflected in the company's consolidated financial statements. mutual fund and etp assets are a measure used by the company primarily because a significant portion of the company's revenues are based upon asset values. these revenues increase or decrease with a rise or fall in aum whether caused by changes in the market or through net flows.
new business written premium- represents the amount of premiums charged for policies issued to customers who were not insured with the company in the previous policy term. new business written premium plus renewal policy written premium equals total written premium.
policies in force- represent the number of policies with coverage in effect as of the end of the period. the number of policies in force is a growth measure used for personal lines and standard commercial lines within commercial lines and is affected by both new business growth and policy count retention.
policy count retention- represents the ratio of the number of policies renewed during the period divided by the number of policies available to renew. the number of policies available to renew represents the number of policies, net of any cancellations, written in the previous policy term. policy count retention is affected by a number of factors, including the percentage of renewal policy quotes accepted and decisions by the company to non-renew policies because of specific policy underwriting concerns or because of a decision to reduce premium writings in certain classes of business or states. policy count retention is also affected by advertising and rate actions taken by competitors.
reinstatement premiums- represents additional ceded premium paid for the reinstatement of the amount of reinsurance coverage that was reduced as a result of a reinsurance loss payment.
renewal earned price increase (decrease)- written premiums are earned over the policy term, which is six
part ii - item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations months for certain personal lines auto business and twelve months for substantially all of the remainder of the company's property and casualty business. since the company earns premiums over the six to twelve month term of the policies, renewal earned price increases (decreases) lag renewal written price increases (decreases) by six to twelve months.
renewal written price increase (decrease)-represents the combined effect of rate changes, amount of insurance and individual risk pricing decisions per unit of exposure since the prior year. the rate component represents the change in rate filings during the period and the amount of insurance represents the change in the value of the rating base, such as model year/vehicle symbol for auto, building replacement costs for property and wage inflation for workers' compensation. a number of factors affect renewal written price increases (decreases) including expected loss costs as projected by the company's pricing actuaries, rate filings approved by state regulators, risk selection decisions made by the company's underwriters and marketplace competition. renewal written price changes reflect the property and casualty insurance market cycle. prices tend to increase for a particular line of business when insurance carriers have incurred significant losses in that line of business in the recent past or the industry as a whole commits less of its capital to writing exposures in that line of business. prices tend to decrease when recent loss experience has been favorable or when competition among insurance carriers increases. renewal written price statistics are subject to change from period to period, based on a number of factors, including changes in actuarial estimates and the effect of subsequent cancellations and non-renewals on rate achieved, and modifications made to better reflect ultimate pricing achieved.
return on assets ("roa"), core earnings- a non-gaap financial measure that the company uses to evaluate, and believes is an important measure of, certain of the segment's operating performance. roa is the most directly comparable u.s. gaap measure. the company believes that roa, core earnings, provides investors with a valuable measure of the performance of certain of the company's on-going businesses because it reveals trends in our businesses that may be obscured by the effect of realized gains (losses). roa, core earnings, should not be considered as a substitute for roa and does not reflect the overall profitability of our businesses. therefore, the company believes it is important for investors to evaluate both roa, core earnings, and roa when reviewing the company's performance. roa, core earnings is calculated by dividing core earnings by a daily average aum. a reconciliation of roa to roa, core earnings for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, is set forth in the results of operations section within md&a - mutual funds.
underlying combined ratio- a non-gaap financial measure, represents the combined ratio before catastrophes and prior accident year development. combined ratio is the most directly comparable u.s. gaap measure.  the company believes the underlying combined ratio is an important measure of the trend in profitability since it removes the impact of volatile and unpredictable catastrophe losses and prior accident year loss and loss adjustment expense reserve development. a reconciliation of combined ratio to underlying combined ratio for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 is set forth in the results of operations section within md&a - commercial lines and personal lines.
underwriting gain (loss)- the company's management evaluates profitability of the p&c businesses primarily on the basis of underwriting gain (loss). underwriting gain (loss) is a before-tax measure that represents earned premiums less incurred losses, loss adjustment expenses and underwriting expenses. underwriting gain (loss) is influenced significantly by earned premium growth and the adequacy of the company's pricing. underwriting profitability over time is also greatly influenced by the company's pricing and underwriting discipline, which seeks to manage exposure to loss through favorable risk selection and diversification, its management of claims, its use of reinsurance and its ability to manage its expense ratio, which it accomplishes through economies of scale and its management of acquisition costs and other underwriting expenses. net income (loss) is the most directly comparable gaap measure. the company believes that underwriting gain (loss) provides investors with a valuable measure of before-tax profitability derived from underwriting activities, which are managed separately from the company's investing activities. a reconciliation of underwriting gain (loss) to net income (loss) for commercial lines, personal lines and property & casualty other operations is set forth in segment sections of md&a.
written and earned premiums- written premium is a statutory accounting financial measure which represents the amount of premiums charged for policies issued, net of reinsurance, during a fiscal period. earned premium is a u.s. gaap and statutory measure. premiums are considered earned and are included in the financial results on a pro rata basis over the policy period. management believes that written premium is a performance measure that is useful to investors as it reflects current trends in the company's sale of property and casualty insurance products. written and earned premium are recorded net of ceded reinsurance premium.
traditional life insurance type products, such as those sold by group benefits, collect premiums from policyholders in exchange for financial protection for the policyholder from a specified insurable loss, such as death or disability. these premiums together with net investment income earned from the overall investment strategy are used to pay the contractual obligations under these insurance contracts. two major factors, new sales and persistency, impact premium growth. sales can increase or decrease in a given year based on a number of factors, including but not limited to, customer demand for the company's product offerings, pricing competition, distribution channels and the company's reputation and ratings. persistency refers to the percentage of policies remaining in-force from year-to-year.
the hartford's operations overview the hartford conducts business principally in six reporting segments including commercial lines, personal lines, property & casualty other operations, group benefits, mutual funds and talcott resolution, as well as a corporate category. the hartford includes in its corporate category the company's capital raising activities (including debt financing and related interest expense, purchase accounting adjustments related to goodwill and other expenses not allocated to the reporting segments).
part ii - item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the company derives its revenues principally from: (a) premiums earned for insurance coverage provided to insureds; (b) fee income, including asset management fees, on separate account, mutual fund and etp assets, mortality and expense fees, as well as cost of insurance charges; (c) net investment income; (d) fees earned for services provided to third parties; and (e) net realized capital gains and losses. premiums charged for insurance coverage are earned principally on a pro rata basis over the terms of the related policies in-force. asset management fees and mortality and expense fees are primarily generated from separate account assets and assets under management. cost of insurance charges are assessed on the net amount at risk for investment-oriented life insurance products.
the profitability of the company's property and casualty insurance businesses over time is greatly influenced by the company's underwriting discipline, which seeks to manage exposure to loss through favorable risk selection and diversification, its management of claims, its use of reinsurance, the size of its in force block, actual mortality and morbidity experience, and its ability to manage its expense ratio which it accomplishes through economies of scale and its management of acquisition costs and other underwriting expenses. pricing adequacy depends on a number of factors, including the ability to obtain regulatory approval for rate changes, proper evaluation of underwriting risks, the ability to project future loss cost frequency and severity based on historical loss experience adjusted for known trends, the company's response to rate actions taken by competitors, its expense levels and expectations about regulatory and legal developments. the company seeks to price its insurance policies such that insurance premiums and future net investment income earned on premiums received will cover underwriting expenses and the ultimate cost of paying claims reported on the policies and provide for a profit margin. for many of its insurance products, the company is required to obtain approval for its premium rates from state insurance departments.
the financial results in the company's mutual fund, etp and variable annuity businesses depend largely on the amount of the contract holder or shareholder account value or assets under management on which it earns fees and the level of fees charged. changes in account value or assets under management are driven by two main factors: net flows, and the market return of the funds, which is heavily influenced by the return realized in the equity markets. net flows are comprised of deposits less withdrawals and surrenders, redemptions, death benefits, policy charges and annuitizations of investment type contracts, such as variable annuity contracts. in the mutual fund and etp businesses, net flows are known as net sales. net sales are comprised of new sales less redemptions by mutual fund and etp shareholders. the company uses the average daily value of the s&p 500 index as an indicator for evaluating market returns of the underlying account portfolios for the variable annuity business. financial results of variable products are highly correlated to the growth in account values or assets under management since these products generally earn fee income on a daily basis. equity market movements could also result in benefits for or charges against deferred acquisition costs.
the profitability of fixed annuities and other "spread-based" products depends largely on the company's ability to earn target spreads between earned investment rates on its general account assets and interest credited to policyholders.
the investment return, or yield, on invested assets is an important element of the company's earnings since insurance products are priced with the assumption that premiums received can be invested for a period of time before benefits, loss and loss adjustment expenses are paid. due to the need to maintain sufficient liquidity to satisfy claim obligations, the majority of the company's invested assets have been held in available-for-sale securities, including, among other asset classes, equities, corporate bonds, municipal bonds, government debt, short-term debt, mortgage-backed securities and asset-backed securities and collateralized debt obligations.
the primary investment objective for the company is to maximize economic value, consistent with acceptable risk parameters, including the management of credit risk and interest rate sensitivity of invested assets, while generating sufficient after-tax income to meet policyholder and corporate obligations. investment strategies are developed based on a variety of factors including business needs, regulatory requirements and tax considerations.

part ii - item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations financial highlights net income   net income per diluted share   book value per diluted share net income was $896, or $2.31 per basic share and $2.27 per diluted share, down from prior year net income of $1,682, or $4.05 per basic share and $3.96 per diluted share, mostly due to a $423 after-tax loss on a reinsurance transaction covering asbestos and environmental exposures and higher current and prior accident year personal lines auto loss costs.
book value per diluted common share increased to $44.35 from $42.96 as of december 31, 2015 as a result of a 7% decrease in common shares outstanding and dilutive potential common shares, partially offset by a 4% decrease in stockholders' equity resulting from share repurchases and common stockholder dividends in excess of net income during 2016.
net investment income   investment yield after-tax net investment income decreased 2% to $2,961 compared with the prior year primarily due to lower make-whole payments on fixed maturities and prepayment penalties on mortgage loans, as well as lower asset levels and reinvesting at lower interest rates.
net realized capital losses increased by $112 compared with the prior year primarily due to increased macro hedge losses on the variable annuity hedge program and a change from net gains to net losses on non-qualifying derivatives, partially offset by an increase in net realized gains on sale of corporate securities, u.s. treasury securities, municipal bonds and equity securities.
annualized investment yield, after-tax of 3.0%, was consistent with the prior year.
net unrealized gains, after-tax, in the investment portfolio decreased by $3 compared with the prior year due primarily to tighter credit spreads, partially offset by higher interest rates and a decline in assets.
part ii - item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations written premiums   combined ratio written premiums decreased slightly over the prior year for property & casualty, comprised of 2% growth in commercial lines and a 2% decrease in personal lines.
combined ratio increased to 100.1 from 96.6 in the prior year for property & casualty, with deterioration principally in personal lines.
catastrophe losses of $416, before tax, increased from catastrophe losses of $332, before tax, in the prior year, largely due to higher losses from wind and hail events.
prior accident year development was unfavorable by $457, before tax, driven primarily by increases in asbestos and environmental reserves and personal lines auto liability reserves compared with unfavorable prior year development of $250, before tax, in the prior year driven primarily by asbestos and environmental reserves.
group benefits core earnings margin [1]   talcott resolution after-tax income fromcontinuing operations
[1]   a reconciliation of the net income margin to core earnings margin is set forth in the results of operations section within md&amp;a - group benefits.
core earnings margin increased to 5.7% from 5.6% in the prior year for group benefits, primarily due to higher earned premium and fee income, partially offset by higher group life loss severity.
after-tax income from continuing operations was $244 for talcott resolution, compared with $428 in the prior year primarily due to lower tax benefits recognized in 2016, a write-off of dac associated with fixed annuities, lower net investment income and a reinsurance gain on disposition in 2015.

net income decreased primarily due to a loss on a reinsurance transaction covering the company's asbestos and environmental exposure, lower net investment income and fee income, an increase in property & casualty and group benefits incurred losses and higher net realized capital losses, partially offset by higher earned premiums and lower insurance operating costs and other expenses.
earned premiums increased 2% or $234, before tax, reflecting growth of 2% in commercial lines, 1% in personal lines and 3% in group benefits. for a discussion of the company's operating results by segment, see md&a - results of operations by segment.
fee income decreased primarily due to the continued run-off of the talcott resolution variable annuity block.
net investment income decreased primarily due to lower make-whole payments on fixed maturities and prepayment penalties on mortgage loans, as well as lower asset levels and reinvesting at lower interest rates. for further discussion of investment results, see the net investment income (loss) section within md&a - investment results.
net realized capital losses increased primarily due to losses associated with the pending sale of the company's u.k.
property and casualty run-off subsidiaries and an increase in losses from the variable annuity hedge program, partially offset by higher net gains on sales of securities and lower impairment losses. also contributing to the increase in net realized capital losses was a $96 write-down of an investment in solar energy partnerships that generated tax credits and other tax benefits of $113 in 2016. for further discussion of investment results, see the net realized capital gains (losses) section within md&a - investment results, .
benefits, losses and loss adjustment expenses increased in both property & casualty and group benefits with the increase in group benefits due to the effect of growth in earned premium and higher group life loss severity. the net increase in incurred losses for property & casualty was due to:
•   losses and loss adjustment expenses before catastrophes and prior accident year development in property &amp; casualty increased $259, before tax, primarily resulting from higher personal and commercial auto loss costs and the effect of earned premium growth in small commercial and personal lines, partially offset by lower workers' compensation loss costs.
•   current accident year catastrophe losses of $416, before tax, in 2016, compared to $332, before tax, in 2015. catastrophe losses in 2016 were primarily due to multiple wind and hail events across various u.s. geographic regions, concentrated
part ii - item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in texas and the central and southern plains and, to a lesser extent, winter storms and hurricane matthew. catastrophe losses in 2015 were primarily due to multiple winter storms and wind and hail events across various u.s. geographic regions as well as tornadoes and wildfires. for additional information, see md&a - critical accounting estimates, property & casualty insurance product reserves.
•   unfavorable prior accident year reserve development in property &amp; casualty of $457, before tax, in 2016, compared to unfavorable reserve development of $250, before tax, in 2015.
▪   prior accident year reserve development in 2016 was primarily due to a $268 increase in asbestos and environmental reserves and a $160 increase in personal auto liability reserves. an increase in asbestos reserves of $197 primarily related to greater than expected mesothelioma claim filings for a small percentage of defendants in specific, adverse jurisdictions. as a result, aggregate indemnity and defense costs have not declined as expected. environmental reserves increased $71 in 2016 primarily due to deterioration associated with the tendering of new sites for policy coverage, increased defense costs stemming from individual bodily injury liability suits, and increased clean-up costs associated with waterways. reserves were increased in personal lines auto liability for accident years 2014 and 2015, primarily due to higher than expected emerged auto liability frequency and severity.
▪   prior accident year reserve development in 2015 was primarily due to an increase in asbestos reserves of $146 and environmental reserves of $52. for additional information, see md&amp;a - critical accounting estimates, reserve roll-forwards and development.
loss on reinsurance transaction in 2016 represents paid premium for an asbestos and environmental adverse development cover ("adc") reinsurance agreement with national indemnity company ("nico"), a subsidiary of berkshire hathaway inc. ("berkshire"), to reduce uncertainty about potential adverse development. for more information on this transaction, see md&a -critical accounting estimates, annual reserve reviews.
income tax benefit of $92 in 2016 compared to income tax expense of $305 in 2015, primarily due to a decrease in taxable income and the effect of $113 of federal tax credits and other tax benefits associated with investments in solar energy partnerships, partially offset by a decrease in benefits from the dividends received deduction.
differences between the company's effective income tax rate and the u.s. statutory rate of 35% are due primarily to tax exempt interest earned on invested assets, the dividends received deduction, changes in the valuation allowance recorded on capital loss carryovers and federal tax credits associated with investments in solar energy partnerships. for further discussion of income taxes, see note 16 - income taxes of notes to consolidated financial statements.
earned premiums increased 2% or $241, before tax, in 2015, compared to 2014, reflecting growth of 4% in commercial lines and 2% in personal lines.
fee income decreased $157, before tax, primarily due to the continued run-off of the talcott resolution annuity business.
net investment income decreased to $3,030, before tax, in 2015 from $3,154, before tax, in 2014, primarily due to lower income from limited partnerships and other alternative investments and the continued decline in talcott resolution assets under management.
net realized capital losses of $156, before tax, in 2015, compared to net realized capital gains of $16, before tax, in 2014, largely driven by results of the variable annuity hedge program.
benefits, losses and loss adjustment expenses included unfavorable prior accident year reserve development in property & casualty of $250, before tax, in 2015, compared to unfavorable reserve development of $228, before tax, in 2014. prior accident year reserve development in 2015 was primarily due to an increase in reserves for asbestos and environmental claims, in part, due to a small percentage of direct accounts having experienced greater than expected claim filings, including mesothelioma claims. prior accident year reserve development in 2014 was primarily due to an increase in reserves for asbestos and environmental claims, primarily due to a higher than previously estimated number of mesothelioma claim filings and an increase in costs associated with asbestos litigation.
amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs decreased $227, before tax, driven, in part, by a favorable unlock in talcott resolution in 2015, compared to an unfavorable unlock in 2014.
insurance operating costs and other expenses included a pension settlement charge of $128, before tax, in 2014, related to voluntary lump-sum settlements with vested participants in the company's defined benefit pension plan who had separated from service, but who had not yet commenced annuity benefits.
loss on extinguishment of debt increased $21, before tax, in 2015 related to the redemption of $296 aggregate principal amount of outstanding 4.0% senior notes. the resulting loss on extinguishment of debt consists of a make-whole premium.
income tax expense decreased by $45 in 2015 from $350 in 2014, primarily due to a federal income tax benefit of $36, related to the release of reserves due to the resolution of uncertain tax positions and a benefit of $94 from the partial reduction of the deferred tax valuation allowance on the capital loss carryover due to taxable gains on the termination of certain derivatives, partially offset by the effect of higher income from continuing operations, before tax.
part ii - item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations income (loss) from discontinued operations decreased $560, net of tax, in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to the realized capital loss of $659 on the sale of the japan variable annuity business in 2014.

total investments decreased since december 31, 2015, primarily due to a decrease in fixed maturities, afs and limited partnerships and other alternative investments, partially offset by an increase in short-term investments.
fixed maturities, afs decreased due to the continued run-off of talcott resolution and the transfer of investments to assets held for sale related to the u.k. property and casualty run-off subsidiaries, as well as a decline in valuations as a result of a rise in interest rates, which more than offset the effect of tightening credit spreads. for further discussion on the disposition, see note 2- business acquisitions and dispositions of notes to consolidated financial statements.
limited partnerships and other alternative investments decreased primarily due to redemptions in hedge fund investments which were reinvested into other asset classes.
short-term investments increased primarily due to holding more short-term investments until those investments are reinvested into longer duration asset classes.

part ii - item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations year ended december 31, 2016 compared to the year ended december 31, 2015
total net investment income decreased primarily due to lower make-whole payments on fixed maturities and prepayment penalties on mortgage loans, as well as lower asset levels and reinvesting at lower interest rates.
annualized net investment income yield excluding limited partnerships and other alternative investments, was 4.1% in 2016, consistent with 2015. excluding make-whole payments on fixed maturities, income received from previously impaired securities, and prepayment penalties on mortgage loans, the annualized investment income yield, excluding limited partnerships and other alternative investments, was 4.0% in 2016 and 2015.
new money yield excluding certain u.s. treasury securities and cash equivalent securities, for the year ended december 31, 2016, was approximately 3.5% which was below the average yield of sales and maturities of 4.0% for the same period. for the year ended december 31, 2016, the new money yield of 3.5% increased slightly from 3.4% in 2015, largely due to an increase in interest rates.
while interest rates have risen recently, we expect the annualized net investment income yield in 2017, excluding limited partnerships and other alternative investments, to be slightly below the portfolio yield earned in 2016. this assumes the company earns less income in 2017 from make-whole payments on fixed maturities and prepayment penalties on mortgage loans than it did in 2016 and that reinvestment rates continue to be below the average yield of sales and maturities. the estimated impact on net investment income is subject to change as the composition of the portfolio changes through portfolio management and trading activities and changes in market conditions.
total net investment income decreased primarily due to a decrease in income from limited partnerships and other alternative investments, the impact of reinvesting at lower interest rates and a decrease in invested asset levels, partially offset by make-whole payments on fixed maturities, higher income received from previously impaired securities, and prepayment penalties on mortgage loans.

gross gains and losses on sales were primarily a result of duration, liquidity and credit management within corporate, u.s. treasury, tax exempt municipal and equity securities.
variable annuity hedge program losses included losses on the combined gmwb derivatives, net, which include the gmwb product, reinsurance, and hedging derivatives, primarily driven by losses of $53 due to liability/model assumption updates, $22 due to the effect of increases in equity markets and losses of $12 resulting from regression updates and other changes, partially offset by gains of $40 resulting from policyholder behavior and $29 related to an outperformance of the underlying actively managed funds compared to their respective indices. the macro hedge program loss was primarily due to a loss of $96 due to an increase in equity markets and a loss of $58 driven by time decay on options.
other, net loss included losses of $96 related to the write-down of investments in solar energy partnerships that generated solar tax credits and losses of $81 associated with the company's u.k. property and casualty run-off subsidiaries currently held for sale. for further information related to the investment in solar energy partnerships and resulting solar tax credits, refer to note

gross gains and losses on sales were primarily a result of duration, liquidity and credit management, as well as tactical changes to the portfolio as a result of changing market conditions. this included sales to reduce exposure to energy, emerging markets and below investment grade corporate securities as well as sales within corporate, u.s. treasury and equity securities.
variable annuity hedge program losses included losses on the combined gmwb derivatives, net, primarily driven by losses of $42 due to liability/model assumption updates and losses of $18 resulting from an underperformance of the underlying actively managed funds compared to their respective indices. the macro hedge program loss was primarily due to a loss of $44 driven by time decay on options.
other, net gain was primarily related to gains of $46 related to modified coinsurance reinsurance contracts, primarily driven by widening credit spreads and an increase in interest rates. these gains were partially offset by losses of $14 on credit derivatives driven by widening credit spreads and losses of $12 on interest rate derivatives due to an increase in interest rates.
gross gains and losses on sales were primarily a result of duration, liquidity and credit management as well as tactical changes to the portfolio as a result of changing market conditions. the sales were primarily within commercial mortgage-backed securities ("cmbs"), residential mortgage-backed securities ("rmbs"), and municipal securities as well as sales of corporate and foreign government and government agency securities which primarily resulted from a reduction in our exposure to the emerging market and energy sectors.
variable annuity hedge program losses included losses on the macro hedge program primarily due to a loss of $25 driven by an improvement in domestic equity markets, partially offset by a gain of $17 related to a decrease in interest rates. these losses were partially offset by gains on the combined gmwb derivatives, net, primarily driven by gains of $25 on liability/model assumption updates and gains of $15 due to increased volatility, partially offset by a loss of $26 resulting from policyholder behavior primarily related to increased surrenders.
critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with u.s. gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. actual results could differ, and in the past have differed, from those estimates.
the company has identified the following estimates as critical in that they involve a higher degree of judgment and are subject to a significant degree of variability:
•   group benefit long-term disability reserves, net of reinsurance;
•   estimated gross profits used in the valuation and amortization of assets and liabilities associated with variable annuity and other universal life-type contracts;
•   living benefits required to be fair valued (in other policyholder funds and benefits payable);
•   evaluation of goodwill for impairment;
•   valuation of investments and derivative instruments including evaluation of other-than-temporary impairments on available-for-sale securities and valuation allowances on mortgage loans;
•   valuation allowance on deferred tax assets; and
•   contingencies relating to corporate litigation and regulatory matters.
certain of these estimates are particularly sensitive to market conditions, and deterioration and/or volatility in the worldwide debt or equity markets could have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. in developing these estimates management makes subjective and complex judgments that are inherently uncertain and subject to material change as facts and circumstances develop. although variability is inherent in these estimates, management believes the amounts provided are appropriate based upon the facts available upon compilation of the financial statements.

overview of reserving for property and casualty insurance claims it typically takes many months or years to pay claims incurred under a property and casualty insurance product; accordingly, the company must establish reserves at the time the loss is incurred. most of the company's policies provide for occurrence-based coverage where the loss is incurred when a claim event happens like an auto accident, house or building fire or injury to an employee under a workers' compensation policy. some of the company's policies, mostly for directors and officers insurance and errors and omissions insurance, are claims-made policies where the loss is incurred in the period the claim event is reported to the company even if the loss event itself occurred in an earlier period.
loss and loss adjustment expense reserves provide for the estimated ultimate costs of paying claims under insurance policies written by the company, less amounts paid to date. these reserves include estimates for both claims that have been reported and those that have not yet been reported, and include estimates of all expenses associated with processing and settling these claims. incurred but not reported ("ibnr") reserves represent the difference between the estimated ultimate cost of all claims and the actual loss and loss adjustment expenses reported to the company by claimants ("reported losses"). reported losses represent cumulative loss and loss adjustment expenses paid plus case reserves for outstanding reported claims. company actuaries evaluate the total reserves (ibnr and case reserves) on an accident year basis. an accident year is the calendar year in which a loss is incurred, or, in the case of claims-made policies, the calendar year in which a loss is reported.
factors that change reserve estimates- reserve estimates can change over time because of unexpected changes in the external environment. inflation in medical care, hospital care, auto parts, wages and home and building repair would cause claims to settle for more than they are initially reserved. changes in the economy can cause an increase or decrease in the number of reported claims (claim frequency). for example, an improving economy could result in more automobile miles driven and a higher number of auto reported claims while a contracting economy can sometimes lead to an increase in workers' compensation reported claims. an increase in the number or percentage of claims litigated can increase the average settlement amount per claim (claim severity). changes in the judicial environment can affect interpretations of damages and how policy coverage applies which could increase or decrease claim severity. over time, judges or juries in certain jurisdictions may be more inclined to determine liability and award damages. new legislation can also change how damages are defined resulting in greater frequency or severity. in addition, new types of injuries may arise from exposures not contemplated when the policies were written. past examples include pharmaceutical products, silica, lead paint, molestation or abuse and construction defects.
reserve estimates can also change over time because of changes in internal company operations. a delay or acceleration in handling claims may signal a need to increase or reduce reserves from what was initially estimated. new lines of business may have loss development patterns that are not well established. changes in the geographic mix of business, changes in the mix of business by industry and changes in the mix of business by policy limit or deductible can increase the risk that losses will ultimately develop differently than the loss development patterns assumed in our reserving. in addition, changes in the quality of risk selection in underwriting and changes in interpretations of policy language could increase or decrease ultimate losses from what was assumed in establishing the reserves.
in the case of assumed reinsurance, all of the above risks apply. the company assumes insurance risk from certain pools and associations and, prior to 2004, assumed property and casualty risks from other insurance companies. changes in the case reserving and reporting patterns of insurance companies ceding to the hartford can create additional uncertainty in estimating the reserves. due to the inherent complexity of the assumptions used, final claim settlements may vary significantly from the present estimates of direct and assumed reserves, particularly when those settlements may not occur until well into the future.
reinsurance recoverables- through both facultative and treaty reinsurance agreements, the company cedes a share of the risks it has underwritten to other insurance companies. the company records reinsurance recoverables for loss and loss adjustment expenses ceded to its reinsurers representing the anticipated recovery from reinsurers of unpaid claims, including ibnr.
the company estimates the portion of losses and loss adjustment expenses to be ceded based on the terms of any applicable facultative and treaty reinsurance, including an estimate of how ibnr for losses will ultimately be ceded.
the company provides an allowance for uncollectible reinsurance, reflecting management's best estimate of reinsurance cessions that may be uncollectible in the future due to reinsurers' unwillingness or inability to pay. the estimated allowance considers the credit quality of the company's reinsurers, recent outcomes in arbitration and litigation in disputes between reinsurers and cedants and recent communication activity between reinsurers and cedants that may signal how the company's own reinsurance claims may settle. where its reinsurance contracts permit, the company secures funding of future claim obligations with various forms of collateral, including irrevocable letters of credit, secured trusts, funds held accounts and group-wide offsets. the allowance for uncollectible reinsurance was $165 as of december 31, 2016, comprised of $29 related to commercial lines and $136 related to property & casualty other operations.
the company's estimate of reinsurance recoverables, net of an allowance for uncollectible reinsurance, is subject to similar risks and uncertainties as the estimate of the gross reserve for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses for direct and assumed exposures.
review of reserve adequacy- the hartford regularly reviews the appropriateness of reserve levels at the line of business or more detailed level, taking into consideration the variety of trends that impact the ultimate settlement of claims. for property & casualty other operations, asbestos and environmental ("a&e") reserves are reviewed by type of event rather than by line of business.
part ii - item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations determined to be necessary. in the judgment of management, information currently available has been properly considered in establishing the reserves for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses and in recording the reinsurance recoverables for ceded unpaid losses.
reserving methodology for a discussion of how a&e reserves are set, see md&a - p&c insurance product reserves, reserving for asbestos and environmental claims within property & casualty other operations. the following is a discussion of the reserving methods used for the company's property and casualty lines of business other than asbestos and environmental.
how reserves are set- reserves are set by line of business within the operating segments. a single line of business may be written in more than one segment. case reserves are established by a claims handler on each individual claim and are adjusted as new information becomes known during the course of handling the claim. lines of business for which reported losses emerge over a long period of time are referred to as long-tail lines of business. lines of business for which reported losses emerge more quickly are referred to as short-tail lines of business. the company's shortest-tail lines of business are homeowners, commercial property and auto physical damage. the longest tail lines of business include workers' compensation, general liability, professional liability and assumed reinsurance. for short-tail lines of business, emergence of paid loss and case reserves is credible and likely indicative of ultimate losses. for long-tail lines of business, emergence of paid losses and case reserves is less credible in the early periods after a given accident year and, accordingly, may not be indicative of ultimate losses.
use of actuarial methods and judgments- the company's reserving actuaries regularly review reserves for both current and prior accident years using the most current claim data. a variety of actuarial methods and judgments are used for most lines of business to arrive at selections of estimated ultimate losses and loss adjustment expenses. these selections incorporate input, as appropriate, from claims personnel, pricing actuaries and operating management about reported loss cost trends and other factors that could affect the reserve estimates. most reserves are reviewed fully each quarter, including loss and loss adjustment expense reserves for homeowners, commercial property, auto physical damage, auto liability, package business, workers' compensation, most general liability and professional liability. other reserves are reviewed semi-annually (twice per year) or annually. these primarily include reserves for losses incurred in accident years older than twelve years for personal lines and older than twenty years for commercial lines, as well as reserves for bond, assumed reinsurance, latent exposures, such as construction defects, and unallocated loss adjustment expense. for reserves that are reviewed semi-annually or annually, management monitors the emergence of paid and reported losses in the intervening quarters and, if necessary, performs a reserve review to determine whether the reserve estimate should change.
an expected loss ratio is used in initially recording the reserves for both short-tail and long-tail lines of business. this expected loss ratio is determined by starting with the average loss ratio of recent prior accident years and adjusting that ratio for the effect of expected changes to earned pricing, loss frequency and severity, mix of business, ceded reinsurance and other factors. for short-tail lines, ibnr for the current accident year is initially recorded as the product of the expected loss ratio for the period, earned premium for the period and the proportion of losses expected to be reported in future calendar periods for the current accident period. for long-tailed lines, ibnr reserves for the current accident year are initially recorded as the product of the expected loss ratio for the period and the earned premium for the period, less reported losses for the period.
as losses emerge or develop in periods subsequent to a given accident year, reserving actuaries use other methods to estimate ultimate unpaid losses in addition to the expected loss ratio method. these primarily include paid and reported loss development methods, frequency / severity techniques and the bornhuetter-ferguson method (a combination of the expected loss ratio and paid development or reported development method). within any one line of business, the methods that are given more influence vary based primarily on the maturity of the accident year, the mix of business and the particular internal and external influences impacting the claims experience or the methods. the output of the reserve reviews are reserve estimates that are referred to herein as the "actuarial indication".
reserve discounting- most of the company's property and casualty insurance product reserves are not discounted. however, the company has discounted liabilities funded through structured settlements and has discounted certain reserves for indemnity payments due to permanently disabled claimants under workers' compensation policies. for further discussion of these discounted liabilities, see note 1 - basis of presentation and significant accounting policies of notes to consolidated financial statements.
differences between gaap and statutory basis reserves- as of december 31, 2016 and 2015, u.s. property and casualty insurance product reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses, net of reinsurance recoverables, reported under u.s. gaap were approximately equal to net reserves reported on a statutory basis. under u.s. gaap, liabilities for unpaid losses for permanently disabled workers' compensation claimants are discounted at rates that are no higher than risk-free interest rates in effect at the time the claims are incurred and which can vary from the statutory discount rates set by regulators. in addition, a portion of the u.s. gaap provision for uncollectible reinsurance is not recognized under statutory accounting. these differences are offset by the reclassification of reserves associated with the pending sale of hfpi to liabilities held for sale under u.s. gaap that remain in carried reserves under statutory accounting.
reserving methods by line of business- apart from a&e which is discussed in the following section on property & casualty other operations, below is a general discussion of which reserving methods are preferred by line of business. because the actuarial estimates are generated at a much finer level of detail than line of business (e.g., by distribution channel, coverage, accident period), other methods than those described for the line of business may also be employed for a coverage and accident year within a line of business. also, as circumstances change, the methods that are given more influence will change.
part ii - item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations preferred reserving methods by line of business commercial property, homeowners and auto physical damage                         these short-tailed lines are fast-developing and paid and reported development techniques are used as these methods use historical data to develop paid and reported loss development patterns, which are then applied to cumulative paid and reported losses by accident period to estimate ultimate losses. in addition to paid and reported development methods, for the most immature accident months, the company uses frequency and severity techniques and the initial expected loss ratio. the advantage of frequency / severity techniques is that frequency estimates are generally easier to predict and external information can be used to supplement internal data in estimating average severity.
personal auto liability                                                          for auto liability, and bodily injury in particular, the company performs a greater number of techniques than it does for commercial property, homeowners and auto physical damage. in addition to traditional paid and reported development methods, the company relies on frequency/severity techniques and berquist-sherman techniques. because the paid development technique is affected by changes in claim closure patterns and the reported development method is affected by changes in case reserving practices, the company uses berquist-sherman techniques which adjust these patterns to reflect current settlement rates and case reserving practices. the company generally uses the reported development method for older accident years and a combination of reported development, frequency/severity and berquist-sherman methods for more recent accident years. for older accident periods, reported losses are a good indicator of ultimate losses given the high percentage of ultimate losses reported to date. for more recent periods, the frequency/severity techniques are not affected as much by changes in case reserve practices and changing disposal rates and the berquist-sherman techniques specifically adjust for these changes.
auto liability for commercial lines and short-tailed general liability           for older, more mature accident years, the company primarily uses reported development techniques. for more recent accident years, the company typically prefers frequency / severity techniques. these techniques separately analyze losses above and below a capping level (average severity) as larger claims typically behave differently than smaller claims.
professional liability                                                           reported and paid loss development patterns for this line tend to be volatile. therefore, the company typically relies on frequency and severity techniques.
long-tailed general liability, bond and large deductible workers' compensation   for these long-tailed lines of business, the company generally relies on the expected loss ratio and reported development techniques. the company generally weights these techniques together, relying more heavily on the expected loss ratio method at early ages of development and more on the reported development method as an accident year matures.
workers' compensation                                                            workers' compensation is the company's single largest reserve line of business and a wide range of methods are used. methods include paid and reported development techniques, the expected loss ratio and bornhuetter-ferguson methods, and an in-depth analysis on the largest states. in recent years, we have seen an acceleration of paid losses relative to historical patterns and have adjusted our expected loss development patterns accordingly. this acceleration has largely been due to two factors. first, in more recent accident years, we have seen a higher concentration of first dollar workers' compensation business and less excess of loss business resulting in fewer longer-tailed, excess workers' compensation claims. second, over the past couple of years, the company has seen an increase in lump sum settlements to claimants across multiple accident years. adjusting for the effect of an acceleration in payments compared to historical patterns, paid loss development techniques are generally preferred for the workers' compensation line, particularly for more mature accident years. for less mature accident years, the company places greater reliance on the expected loss ratio and reported development methods, open claim approaches, and state-by-state analysis.
assumed reinsurance and all other                                                for these lines, the company tends to rely mostly on reported development techniques. in assumed reinsurance, assumptions are influenced by information gained from claim and underwriting audits.
allocated loss adjustment expenses (alae)                                        for some lines of business (e.g., professional liability and assumed reinsurance), alae and losses are analyzed together. for most lines of business, however, alae is analyzed separately, using paid development techniques and a ratio of paid alae to paid loss is applied to loss reserves to estimate unpaid alae.
unallocated loss adjustment expenses (ulae)                                      ulae is analyzed separately from loss and alae. for most lines of business, incurred ulae costs to be paid in the future are projected based on an expected claim handling cost per claim year, the anticipated claim closure pattern and the ratio of paid ulae to paid loss is applied to estimated unpaid losses.
in the final step of the reserve review process, senior reserving actuaries and senior management apply their judgment to determine the appropriate level of reserves considering the actuarial indications and other factors not contemplated in the actuarial indications. those factors include, but are not limited to, the assessed reliability of key loss trends and assumptions used in the current actuarial indications, the maturity of the accident year, pertinent trends observed over the recent past, the level of volatility within a particular line of business, and the improvement or deterioration of actuarial indications in the current period as compared to the prior periods. the company also considers the magnitude of the difference between the actuarial indication and the recorded reserves.
based on the results of the quarterly reserve review process, the company determines the appropriate reserve adjustments, if any, to record. in general, adjustments are made more quickly to more mature accident years and less volatile lines of business. such adjustments of reserves are referred to as "prior accident year development". increases in previous estimates of ultimate loss costs are referred to as either an increase in prior accident year reserves or as unfavorable reserve development. decreases in previous estimates of ultimate loss costs are referred to as either a decrease in prior accident year reserves or as favorable reserve development. reserve development can influence the comparability of year over year underwriting results.
total recorded net reserves, excluding asbestos and environmental, were 4.2% higher than the actuarial indication of the reserves as of december 31, 2016.

current trends contributing to reserve uncertainty the hartford is a multi-line company in the property and casualty insurance business. the hartford is therefore subject to reserve uncertainty stemming from changes in loss trends and other conditions which could become material at any point in time. as market conditions and loss trends develop, management must assess whether those conditions constitute a long-term trend that should result in a reserving action (i.e., increasing or decreasing the reserve).
difficult to estimate tort exposures- within commercial lines and property & casualty other operations, the company has exposure to bodily injury claims as a result of long-term or continuous exposure to harmful products or substances. examples include, but are not limited to, pharmaceutical products, silica, talcum powder, head injuries and lead paint. the company also has exposure to claims from construction defects, where property damage or bodily injury from negligent construction is alleged. in addition, the company has exposure to claims asserted against religious institutions and other organizations relating to molestation or abuse. such exposures may involve potentially long latency periods and may implicate coverage in multiple policy periods. these factors make reserves for such claims more uncertain than other bodily injury or property damage claims. with regard to these exposures, the company monitors trends in litigation, the external environment, the similarities to other mass torts and the potential impact on the company's reserves.
standard commercial lines- in standard commercial lines, workers' compensation is the company's single biggest line of business and the line of business with the longest pattern of loss emergence. to the extent that patterns in the frequency of settlement payments deviate from historical patterns, loss reserve estimates would be less reliable. medical costs make up more than 50% of workers' compensation payments. as such, reserve estimates for workers' compensation are particularly sensitive to changes in medical inflation, the changing use of medical care procedures and changes in state legislative and regulatory environments. in addition, a deteriorating economic environment can reduce the ability of an injured worker to return to work and lengthen the time a worker receives disability benefits.
specialty lines- in specialty lines, many lines of insurance are "long-tail", including large deductible workers' compensation insurance; as such, reserve estimates for these lines are more difficult to determine than reserve estimates for shorter-tail lines of insurance. reserves for large deductible workers' compensation insurance require estimating losses attributable to the deductible amount that will be paid by the insured; if such losses are not paid by the insured due to financial difficulties, the company is contractually liable. uncertainty in estimated claim severity causes reserve variability for commercial auto losses including reserve variability due to changes in internal claim handling and case reserving practices as well as due to changes in the external environment. another example of reserve variability is with directors' and officers' insurance where uncertainty regarding the number and severity of class action suits can result in reserve volatility. additionally, the company's exposure to losses under directors' and officers' insurance policies is primarily in excess layers, making estimates of loss more complex.
personal lines- in personal lines, while claims emerge over relatively shorter periods, estimates can still vary due to a number of factors, including uncertain estimates of frequency and severity trends. severity trends are affected by changes in internal claim handling and case reserving practices as well as by changes in the external environment. changes in claim practices increase the uncertainty in the interpretation of case reserve data, which increases the uncertainty in recorded reserve levels. severity trends have increased in recent accident years causing additional uncertainty about the reliability of past patterns. in addition, the introduction of new products and class plans has led to a different mix of business by type of insured than the company experienced in the past. such changes in mix increase the uncertainty of the reserve projections, since historical data and reporting patterns may not be applicable to the new business.
impact of key assumptions on reserves as stated above, the company's practice is to estimate reserves using a variety of methods, assumptions and data elements within its reserve estimation process for reserves other than asbestos and environmental. the company does not consistently use statistical loss distributions or confidence levels around its reserve estimate and, as a result, does not disclose reserve ranges.
across most lines of business, the most important reserve assumptions are future loss development factors applied to paid or reported losses to date. the trend in loss cost frequency and severity is also a key assumption, particularly in the most recent accident years, where loss development factors are less credible.
the following discussion discloses possible variation from current estimates of loss reserves due to a change in certain key indicators of potential losses. for auto liability lines in both personal lines and commercial lines, the key indicator is the annual loss cost trend, particularly the severity trend component of loss costs. for workers' compensation and general liability, loss development patterns are a key indicator, particularly for more mature accident years. for workers' compensation, paid loss development patterns have been impacted by medical cost inflation and other changes in loss cost trends. for general liability, loss development patterns have been impacted by, among other things, emergence of new types of claims (e.g., construction defect claims) and a shift in the mixture between smaller, more routine claims and larger, more complex claims.
each of the impacts described below is estimated individually, without consideration for any correlation among key indicators or among lines of business. therefore, it would be inappropriate to take each of the amounts described below and add them together in an attempt to estimate volatility for the company's reserves in total. for any one reserving line of business, the estimated variation in reserves due to changes in key indicators is a reasonable estimate of possible variation that may occur in the future, likely over a period of several calendar years. the variation discussed is not meant to be a worst-case scenario, and, therefore, it is possible that future variation may be more than the amounts discussed below.

reserving for asbestos and environmental claims how a&e reserves are set- the process for establishing reserves for asbestos and environmental claims first involves estimating the required reserves gross of ceded reinsurance and then estimating reinsurance recoverables. in establishing reserves for gross asbestos claims, the company evaluates its insureds' estimated liabilities for such claims by examining exposures for individual insureds and assessing how coverage applies. the company considers a variety of factors, including the jurisdictions where underlying claims have been brought, past, pending and anticipated future claim activity, disease mix, past settlement values of similar claims, dismissal rates, allocated loss adjustment expense, and potential bankruptcy impact.
similarly, the company reviews exposures to establish gross environmental reserves. the company considers several factors in estimating environmental liabilities, including historical values of similar claims, the number of sites involved, the insureds' alleged activities at each site, the alleged environmental damage, the respective shares of liability of potentially responsible parties, the appropriateness and cost of remediation, the nature of governmental enforcement activities and potential bankruptcy impact.
after evaluating its insureds' probable liabilities for asbestos and/or environmental claims, the company evaluates the insurance coverage in place for such claims. the company considers its insureds' total available insurance coverage, including the coverage issued by the company. the company also considers relevant judicial interpretations of policy language and applicable coverage defenses or determinations, if any.
the estimated liabilities of insureds and the company's exposure to the insureds depends heavily on an analysis of the relevant legal issues and litigation environment. this analysis is conducted by the company's lawyers and is subject to applicable privileges.
for both asbestos and environmental reserves, the company also analyzes its historical paid and reported losses and expenses year by year, to assess any emerging trends, fluctuations or characteristics suggested by the aggregate paid and reported activity. the historical losses and expenses are analyzed on both a direct basis and net of reinsurance.
once the gross ultimate exposure for indemnity and allocated loss adjustment expense is determined for its insureds by each policy year, the company calculates its ceded reinsurance projection based on any applicable facultative and treaty reinsurance and the company's experience with reinsurance collections. see the section that follows entitled adverse development cover that discusses the impact the reinsurance agreement with nico may have on future adverse development of asbestos and environmental reserves, if any.
uncertainties regarding adequacy of a&e reserves- a number of factors affect the variability of estimates for gross asbestos and environmental reserves including assumptions with respect to the frequency of claims, the average severity of those claims settled with payment, the dismissal rate of claims with no payment, resolution of coverage disputes with our policyholders and the expense to indemnity ratio. reserve estimates for gross asbestos and environmental reserves are subject to greater variability than reserve estimates for more traditional exposures.
the process of estimating asbestos and environmental reserves remains subject to a wide variety of uncertainties, which are detailed in note 14 - commitments and contingencies of notes to consolidated financial statements. the company believes that its current asbestos and environmental reserves are appropriate. while future developments could cause the company to change its estimates of its gross asbestos and environmental reserves, the adverse development cover with nico will likely lessen the effect that these changes would have on the company's consolidated operating results and liquidity. consistent with past practice, the company will continue to monitor its reserves in property & casualty other operations regularly, including its annual reviews of asbestos liabilities, reinsurance recoverables, the allowance for uncollectible reinsurance, and environmental liabilities. where future developments indicate, we will make appropriate adjustments to the reserves at that time. in 2017, the company will complete the comprehensive annual review of asbestos and environmental reserves during the fourth quarter.
total p&c insurance product reserves development in the opinion of management, based upon the known facts and current law, the reserves recorded for the company's property and casualty insurance products at december 31, 2016 represent the company's best estimate of its ultimate liability for losses and loss adjustment expenses related to losses covered by policies written by the company. however, because of the significant uncertainties surrounding reserves. it is possible that management's estimate of the ultimate liabilities for these claims may change in the future and that the required adjustment to currently recorded reserves could be material to the company's results of operations and liquidity.

during 2016, the company's re-estimates of prior accident year reserves included the following significant reserve changes:
workers' compensation reserves consider favorable emergence on reported losses for recent accident years as well as a partially offsetting adverse impact related to two recent florida supreme court rulings that have increased the company's exposure to workers' compensation claims in that state. the favorable emergence has been driven by lower frequency and, to a lesser extent, lower medical severity and management has placed additional weight on this favorable experience as it becomes more credible.
general liability reserves increased for accident years 2012 - 2015 primarily due to higher severity losses incurred on a class of business that insures service and maintenance contractors and increased for accident years 2008 and 2010 primarily due to indemnity losses and legal costs associated with a litigated claim.
small commercial package business reserves increased due to higher than expected severity on liability claims, principally for accident years 2013 - 2015. severity for these accident years has developed unfavorably and management has placed more weight on emerged experience.
auto liability reserves increased due to increases in both commercial lines auto and personal lines auto. commercial auto liability reserves increased, predominately for the 2015 accident year, primarily due to increased frequency of large claims. personal auto liability reserves increased, primarily related to increased bodily injury frequency and severity for the 2015 accident year, including for uninsured and under-insured motorist claims, and increased bodily injury severity for the 2014 accident year. increases in auto liability loss costs were across both the direct and agency distribution channels.
professional liability reserves decreased for claims made years 2008 - 2013, primarily for large accounts, including on non-securities class action cases. claim costs have emerged favorably as these years have matured and management has placed more weight on the emerged experience.
asbestos and environmental reserves were increased during the period as a result of the second quarter 2016 comprehensive annual review.
uncollectible reinsurance reserves decreased as a result of giving greater weight to favorable collectability experience in recent calendar periods in estimating future collections.

during 2015, the company's re-estimates of prior accident year reserves included the following significant reserve changes:
workers' compensation reserves decreased due to an improvement in claim closure rates resulting in a decrease in outstanding claims for permanently disabled claimants. in addition, accident years 2013 and 2014 continue to exhibit favorable frequency and medical severity trends; management has been placing additional weight on this favorable experience as it becomes more credible.
small commercial package business reserves increased due to higher than expected severity on liability claims, impacting recent accident years.
commercial auto liability reserves increased due to increased severity of large claims predominantly for accident years 2010 to 2013.
professional liability reserves decreased for claims made years 2009 through 2012 primarily for large accounts.
claim costs have emerged favorably as these years have matured and management has placed more weight on the emerged experience.
asbestos and environmental reserves were increased during the period as a result of the 2015 comprehensive annual review.
catastrophe reserves decreased primarily for accident year 2014 as fourth quarter 2014 catastrophes have developed favorably.
other reserve re-estimates, net, decreased due to decreased contract surety reserves across several accident years and decreased commercial surety reserves for accident years 2012 through 2014 as a result of lower emerged losses. these reserve decreases were offset by an increase in commercial surety reserves related to accident years 2007 and prior, as the number of new claims reported has outpaced expectations.

during 2014, the company's re-estimates of prior accident years reserves included the following significant reserve changes:
workers' compensation reserves decreased for recent accident years due to improved frequency and lower estimated claim handling costs.
general liability reserves decreased due to lower frequency in late emerging claims.
commercial auto liability reserves increased due to an increased frequency of severe claims spread across several accident years.
professional liability reserves decreased for accident years 2013, 2012 and 2010 due to lower frequency of reported claims.
bond reserves emerged favorably for accident years 2008 to 2013, offset by adverse emergence on reserves for accident years 2007 and prior.
homeowners reserves emerged favorably for accident year 2013, primarily related to favorable development on fire and water related claims.
asbestos and environmental reserves were increased during the period as a result of the 2014 comprehensive annual review.
catastrophe reserves decreased primarily for accident year 2013, as fourth quarter 2013 catastrophes have developed favorably.
property & casualty other operations net reserves and reserve activity in property & casualty other operations are categorized and reported as asbestos, environmental, and "all other". the "all other" category of reserves covers a wide range of insurance and assumed reinsurance coverages, including, but not limited to, potential liability for construction defects, lead paint, silica, pharmaceutical products, molestation and other long-tail liabilities. in addition to various insurance and assumed reinsurance exposures, "all other" includes unallocated loss adjustment expense reserves. "all other" also includes the company's allowance for uncollectible reinsurance. when the company commutes a ceded reinsurance contract or settles a ceded reinsurance dispute, net reserves for the related cause of loss (including asbestos, environmental or all other) are increased for the portion of the allowance for uncollectible reinsurance attributable to that commutation or settlement.

the company classifies its asbestos and environmental reserves into three categories: direct, assumed reinsurance and london market.
•   direct insurance- includes primary and excess coverage. of the three categories of claims, direct policies tend to have the greatest factual development from which to estimate the company's exposures.
•   assumed reinsurance- includes both "treaty" reinsurance (covering broad categories of claims or blocks of business) and "facultative" reinsurance (covering specific risks or individual policies of primary or excess insurance companies). assumed reinsurance exposures are less predictable than direct insurance exposures because the company does not generally receive notice of a reinsurance claim until the underlying direct insurance claim is mature. this causes a delay in the receipt of information at the reinsurer level and adds to the uncertainty of estimating related reserves.
•   london market- includes the business written by one or more of the company's subsidiaries in the united kingdom, which are no longer active in the insurance or reinsurance business. such business includes both direct insurance and assumed reinsurance. london market exposures are the most uncertain of the three categories of claims. as a participant in the london market (comprised of both lloyd's of london and london market companies), certain subsidiaries of the company wrote business on a subscription basis, with those subsidiaries' involvement being limited to a relatively small percentage of a total contract placement. claims are reported, via a broker, to the "lead" underwriter and, once agreed to, are presented to the following markets for concurrence. this reporting and claim agreement process makes estimating liabilities for this business the most uncertain of the three categories of claims.

annual reserve reviews review of asbestos reserves beginning in 2017, the company expects to perform its regular comprehensive annual review of asbestos reserves in the fourth quarter. as part of this evaluation in the second quarter of 2016, the company reviewed all of its open direct domestic insurance accounts exposed to asbestos liability, as well as assumed reinsurance accounts.
during the 2016 second quarter review, a substantial majority of the company's direct accounts trended as expected, and the
part ii - item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations company observed no material changes in the underlying legal environment. however, mesothelioma claims filings have not declined as expected for a small subset of peripheral defendants with a high concentration of asbestos filings in specific, adverse jurisdictions. as a result, aggregate indemnity and defense costs did not decline as expected. while the mesothelioma and adverse jurisdiction claim trends observed in the 2016 comprehensive annual review were similar to the 2015 comprehensive annual review, most of the defendants that had reserve increases in the 2016 review did not have a material impact in the 2015 review. based on this evaluation, the company increased its net asbestos reserves for prior year development by $197 in second quarter 2016.
during the 2015 comprehensive annual review, the company found a substantial majority of direct accounts trended as expected, and the company saw no material changes in the underlying legal environment during the past year. however, a small percentage of the company's direct accounts experienced greater than expected claim filings, including mesothelioma claims. this was driven by a subset of peripheral defendants with a high concentration of filings in specific, adverse jurisdictions. as a result, the aggregate indemnity and defense costs did not decline as expected. to a lesser degree, the company also saw unfavorable development on certain assumed reinsurance accounts, driven by various account-specific factors, including filing activity experienced by the direct accounts. based on this evaluation, the company increased its net asbestos reserves for prior year development by $146 in second quarter 2015.
during the 2014 comprehensive annual review, the company found estimates for certain direct accounts increased, principally due to a higher than previously estimated number of mesothelioma claim filings and an increase in costs associated with asbestos litigation. the company also experienced unfavorable development on certain of its assumed reinsurance accounts driven by a variety of account-specific factors, including those experienced by the direct policyholders. based on this evaluation, the company increased its net asbestos reserves for prior year development by $212 in second quarter 2014.
review of environmental reserves beginning in 2017, the company expects to perform its regular comprehensive annual review of environmental reserves in the fourth quarter. as part of its evaluation in the second quarter of 2016, the company reviewed all of its open direct domestic insurance accounts exposed to environmental liability, as well as assumed reinsurance accounts and its london market exposures for both direct and assumed reinsurance. during 2016, a substantial majority of the company's direct environmental accounts trended as expected. however, a small percentage of the company's direct accounts exhibited deterioration associated with the tendering of new sites for coverage, increased defense costs stemming from individual bodily injury liability suits, and increased clean-up costs associated with waterways. during 2015, a substantial majority of the company's environmental exposures trended as expected, however the company found loss and expense estimates for certain individual account exposures increased based upon an increase in clean-up costs, including at a handful of superfund sites. in addition, new claim severity deteriorated, although frequency continued to decline as expected. during 2014, the company found estimates for certain individual account exposures increased based upon unfavorable litigation results and increased clean-up and expense costs. the net effect of these account-specific changes as well as quarterly actuarial evaluations of new account emergence and historical loss and expense paid experience resulted in increases of $71, $57 and $30 in net environmental reserves for prior years development in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
major categories of asbestos accounts as noted above, the company divides its gross asbestos and environmental exposures into direct, assumed reinsurance and london market.
•   major asbestos defendants- represent the "top 70" accounts in tillinghast's published tiers 1 and 2 and wellington accounts. major asbestos defendants have the fewest number of asbestos accounts and include reserves related to ppg industries, inc. ("ppg"). in may 2016, the company pre-paid its funding obligation in the amount of $315 as permitted under the settlement agreement, arising from participation in a 2002 settlement of asbestos liabilities of ppg. the company's funding obligation approximated the amount reserved for this exposure. major asbestos defendants gross asbestos reserves account for approximately 3% of the company's total direct gross asbestos reserves as of june 30, 2016. major asbestos defendants gross asbestos reserves accounted for approximately 25% of the company's total direct gross asbestos reserves as of june 30, 2015 when reserves for this category included the reserves for ppg.
•   unallocated direct accounts- includes an estimate of the reserves necessary for asbestos claims related to direct insureds that have not previously tendered asbestos claims to the company and exposures related to liability claims that may not be subject to an aggregate limit under the applicable policies.
adverse development cover effective december 31, 2016, the company entered into an asbestos and environmental adverse development cover ("adc") reinsurance agreement with national indemnity company ("nico"), a subsidiary of berkshire hathaway inc. ("berkshire"), to reduce uncertainty about potential adverse development.  under the adc, the company paid a reinsurance premium of $650 for nico to assume adverse net loss and allocated loss adjustment expense reserve development up to $1.5 billion above the company's existing net asbestos and environmental ("a&e") reserves as of december 31, 2016 of approximately $1.7 billion.  the $650 reinsurance premium was placed into a collateral trust account as security for nico's claim payment obligations to the company. the company has retained the risk of collection on amounts due from other third-party reinsurers and continues to be responsible for claims handling and other administrative services, subject to certain conditions.  the adc covers
part ii - item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations substantially all the company's a&e reserve development up to the reinsurance limit.  the adc excludes risk of adverse development on net asbestos and environmental reserves held by the company's u.k. property and casualty run-off subsidiaries which have been accounted for as liabilities held for sale in the consolidated balance sheets as of december 31, 2016.
the adc has been accounted for as retroactive reinsurance and the company reported the $650 cost as a loss on reinsurance transaction in 2016 in the consolidated statement of operations.  under retroactive reinsurance accounting, net adverse asbestos and environmental reserve development after december 31, 2016, if any, will result in an offsetting reinsurance recoverable up to the $1.5 billion limit.  cumulative ceded losses up to the $650 reinsurance premium paid would be recognized as a dollar-for-dollar offset to direct losses incurred.  cumulative ceded losses exceeding the $650 reinsurance premium paid would result in a deferred gain.  the deferred gain would be recognized over the claim settlement period in the proportion of the amount of cumulative ceded losses collected from the reinsurer to the estimated ultimate reinsurance recoveries. consequently, until periods when the deferred gain is recognized as a benefit to earnings, cumulative adverse development of asbestos and environmental claims after december 31, 2016 in excess of $650 may result in significant charges against earnings.
review of "all other" reserves in property & casualty other operations in the fourth quarters of 2016, 2015 and 2014, the company completed evaluations of certain of its non-asbestos and non-environmental reserves in property & casualty other operations, including its assumed reinsurance liabilities. in 2016, the company reclassified a $30 allowance for uncollectible reinsurance to net asbestos reserves. in 2015 and 2014, the company's prior year development was driven by unfavorable frequency of international workers' compensation claims, which resulted in overall adverse development of $29 and $19, respectively.
the company provides an allowance for uncollectible reinsurance, reflecting management's best estimate of reinsurance cessions that may be uncollectible in the future due to reinsurers' unwillingness or inability to pay. during the second quarters of 2016, 2015 and 2014, the company completed its annual evaluations of the collectability of the reinsurance recoverables and the adequacy of the allowance for uncollectible reinsurance associated with older, long-term casualty liabilities reported in property & casualty other operations. in conducting these evaluations, the company used its most recent detailed evaluations of ceded liabilities reported in the segment. the company analyzed the overall credit quality of the company's reinsurers, recent trends in arbitration and litigation outcomes in disputes between cedants and reinsurers and recent developments in commutation activity between reinsurers and cedants. the evaluations in the second quarters of 2016, 2015, and 2014 resulted in no material adjustments to the property & casualty other operations' overall ceded reinsurance reserves, including the allowance for uncollectible reinsurance. as of december 31, 2016 , 2015, and 2014 the allowance for uncollectible reinsurance for property & casualty other operations totaled $136 (excluding the allowance on u.k. ceded recoverable held for sale),$220, and $225, respectively. due to the inherent uncertainties as to collection and the length of time before reinsurance recoverables become due, particularly for older, long-term casualty liabilities, it is possible that future adjustments to the company's reinsurance recoverables, net of the allowance, could be required. beginning in 2017, the company expects to perform its regular annual comprehensive review of property & casualty other operations reinsurance recoverables in the fourth quarter.
impact of re-estimates on property and casualty insurance product reserves estimating property and casualty insurance product reserves uses a variety of methods, assumptions and data elements. ultimate losses may vary materially from the current estimates. many factors can contribute to these variations and the need to change the previous estimate of required reserve levels. prior accident year reserve development is generally due to the emergence of additional facts that were not known or anticipated at the time of the prior reserve estimate and/or due to changes in interpretations of information and trends.
the table below shows the range of annual reserve re-estimates experienced by the hartford over the past ten years. the amount of prior accident year development (as shown in the reserve roll-forward) for a given calendar year is expressed as a percent of the beginning calendar year reserves, net of reinsurance. the ranges presented are significantly influenced by the facts and circumstances of each particular year and by the fact that only the last ten years are included in the range. accordingly, these percentages are not intended to be a prediction of the range of possible future variability. for further discussion of the potential for variability in recorded loss reserves, see preferred reserving methods by line of business - impact of changes in key assumptions on reserve volatility section.

the following table summarizes the effect of reserve re-estimates, net of reinsurance, on calendar year operations for the ten-year period ended december 31, 2016. the total of each column details the amount of reserve re-estimates made in the indicated calendar year and shows the accident years to which the re-estimates are applicable. the amounts in the total column on the far right represent the cumulative reserve re-estimates during the ten year period ended december 31, 2016 for the indicated accident year in each row.
accident years 2006 and prior the net reserve re-estimates for accident years 2006 and prior are driven mostly by increased reserves for asbestos and environmental reserves, and also for increased estimates on assumed casualty reinsurance, workers' compensation and general liability claims.
estimates of ultimate losses have emerged favorably for accident years 2007 through 2009 with much of the favorable re-estimates for 2007 accident year on workers' compensation claims, driven, in part, by state regulatory reforms in california and florida, underwriting actions, and expense reduction initiatives that had a greater impact in controlling costs than originally estimated. also contributing to the favorable development were reserve decreases on short-tail lines of business, where results emerge quickly.
in addition, reserves for professional liability claims for the 2007 accident year were reduced due to a lower estimate of claim severity on both directors' and officers' insurance claims and errors and omissions insurance claims. reserves for personal lines auto liability claims were decreased largely due to an improvement in emerged claim severity for the 2007accident year.
unfavorable reserve re-estimates for accident year 2008 are related to elevated workers' compensation loss emergence and an increase in general liability reserves.
unfavorable reserve re-estimates on accident year 2010 and 2011 were primarily related to workers' compensation and commercial auto liability. workers' compensation loss cost trends were higher than initially expected as an increase in frequency outpaced a moderation of severity trends. unfavorable commercial auto liability reserve re-estimates were driven by higher frequency of large loss bodily injury claims.
reserves were decreased for accident year 2012 due to favorable frequency and medical severity trends for workers'
compensation, favorable professional liability claim emergence, and lower frequency of late emerging general liability claims, partially offset by increased reserves in commercial auto liability due to increased severity of large claims.
reserves were decreased for accident year 2013 due to lower estimated medical severity and claim handling costs for workers' compensation, lower frequency of reported claims for professional liability and favorable emergence of losses for property lines of business, including for catastrophes. favorable development for accident year 2013 was partially offset by unfavorable reserve re-estimates in commercial auto liability driven by increased severity of large claims.
reserves were decreased for the 2014 accident year largely due to favorable frequency and medical severity trends for workers' compensation and favorable development of fourth quarter catastrophes, partially offset by increased severity of liability claims on package business and unfavorable frequency and severity trends for personal and commercial auto liability.
reserves were increased for the 2015 accident year largely due to unfavorable frequency and severity trends for personal and commercial auto liability and to a lesser extent increased severity of liability claims on package business, partially offset by
part ii - item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations favorable frequency and medical severity trends for workers' compensation.
group benefit long-term disability ("ltd") reserves, net of reinsurance the company establishes reserves for group life and accident & health contracts, including long-term disability coverage, for both outstanding reported claims and claims related to insured events that the company estimates have been incurred but have not yet been reported. these reserve estimates can change over time based on facts and interpretations of circumstances, and consideration of various internal factors including the hartford's experience with similar cases, claim payment patterns, loss control programs and mix of business. in addition, the reserve estimates are influenced by various external factors including court decisions and economic conditions. the effects of inflation are implicitly considered in the reserving process. long-tail claim liabilities are discounted because the payment pattern and the ultimate costs are reasonably fixed and determinable on an individual claim basis. the majority of group benefits' reserves are for ltd claimants who are known to be disabled and are currently receiving benefits. the company held $4,687 and $4,765 of ltd unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, net of reinsurance, as of december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
reserving methodology how reserves are set - a disabled life reserve (dlr) is calculated for each ltd claim. the dlr for each claim is the expected present value of all future benefit payments starting with the known monthly gross benefit which is reduced for estimates of the expected claim recovery due to return to work or claimant death, offsets from other income including offsets from social security benefits, and discounting where the discount rate is tied to expected investment yield at the time the claim is incurred. estimated future benefit payments represent the monthly income benefit that is paid until recovery, death or expiration of benefits. claim recoveries are estimated based on claim characteristics such as age and diagnosis and represent an estimate of benefits that will terminate, generally as a result of the claimant returning to work or being deemed able to return to work. for claims recently closed due to recovery, a portion of the dlr is retained for the possibility that the claim reopens upon further evidence of disability.  in addition, a reserve for estimated unpaid claim expenses is included in the dlr.
the dlr also includes a liability for potential payments to pending claimants who have not yet been approved for ltd either because they have not yet satisfied the waiting (or elimination) period or because the approval or denial decision has not yet been made. in these cases, the present value of future benefits is reduced for the likelihood of recovery before benefit onset or claim denial based on company experience. for claims recently closed due to denial, a portion of the dlr is retained for the possibility that the claim is later approved upon further evidence of disability.
estimates for incurred but not reported (ibnr) claims are made by applying completion factors to the dollar amount of claims reported. completion factors are derived from standard actuarial techniques using triangles that display historical claim count emergence by incurral year. these estimates are reviewed for reasonableness and are adjusted for current trends and other factors expected to cause a change in claim emergence. the reserves include an estimate of unpaid claim expenses, including a provision for the cost of initial set-up of the claim once reported.
for all products, including ltd, there is a period generally ranging from two to twelve months, depending on the product, where emerged claims for an incurral year are not yet credible enough to be a basis for estimating reserves.  in these cases, the ultimate loss is estimated using earned premium multiplied by an expected loss ratio based on pricing assumptions of claim incidence, claim severity, and earned pricing.
current trends contributing to reserve uncertainty in group insurance, long-term disability (ltd) has the longest pattern of loss emergence and the highest reserve amount. one significant risk to the reserve would be a slowdown in recoveries. in particular, the economic environment can affect the ability of an injured worker to return-to-work and the length of time a worker receives disability benefits. another significant risk is a change in benefit offsets. often the company pays a reduced benefit due to offsets from other income sources such as pensions or social security disability insurance (ssdi). possible changes to the frequency, timing, or amount of offsets, such as a change in ssdi approval standards or benefit offerings, create a risk that the amount to settle open claims will exceed initial estimates. since the monthly income benefit for a claimant is established based on the individual's salary at the time of disability and the level of coverages and benefits provided, inflation is not considered a significant risk to the reserve estimate. few of the company's ltd policies provide for cost of living adjustments to the monthly income benefit.
discount rate - the discount rate is the interest rate at which expected future claim cash flows are discounted to determine the present value. a higher selected discount rate results in a lower reserve. if the discount rate is higher than our future investment returns, our invested assets will not earn enough investment income to cover the discount accretion on our claim reserves which would negatively affect our profit. for each incurral year, the discount rates are estimated based on investment yields expected to be earned net of investment expenses. the incurral year is the year in which the claim is incurred and the estimated settlement pattern is determined. once established, discount rates for each incurral year are unchanged. the weighted average discount rate on ltd reserves was 4.3% and 4.4% in 2016 and 2015, respectively. had the discount rate for each incurral year been 10 basis points lower at the time they were established, our group benefits unpaid loss and loss adjustment expense reserves would be higher by $22, pretax, as of december 31, 2016.
claim termination rates (inclusive of mortality, recoveries, and expiration of benefits) - claim termination rates are an estimate of the rate at which claimants will cease receiving benefits during a
part ii - item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations given calendar year. terminations result from a number of factors, including death, recoveries and expiration of benefits. the probability that benefits will terminate in each future month for each claim is estimated using a predictive model that uses past company experience, contract provisions, job characteristics and other claimant-specific characteristics such as diagnosis, time since disability began, and age.  actual claim termination experience will vary from period to period. over the past 10 years, claim termination rates for a single incurral year have generally increased and have ranged from 4% below to 8% above current assumptions over that time period.  for a single recent incurral year (such as 2016), a one percent decrease in our assumption for ltd claim termination rates would increase our reserves by $4. for all incurral years combined, as of december 31, 2016, a one percent decrease in our assumption for our ltd claim termination rates would increase our group benefits unpaid losses and loss adjustment expense reserves by $17.
estimated gross profits estimated gross profits ("egps") are used in the valuation and amortization of assets, including dac and sia. portions of egps are also used in the valuation of reserves for death and other insurance benefit features on variable annuity and other universal life type contracts.

the unlock charge, after-tax, for the year ended december 31, 2016 was primarily due to the reduction of the fixed annuity dac balance to zero, updates to the macro hedging program cost to reflect 2016 activity, and the effect of assumption updates for variable annuities, including to mortality, largely offset by separate account returns being above our aggregated estimated returns during the period, largely due to an increase in equity markets, as well as the effect of reducing the assumption about expected futures lapses of variable annuities.
the unlock benefit, after-tax, for the year ended december 31, 2015 was primarily due to assumption changes related to benefit utilization and lower assumed lapse rates, partially offset by a lower assumed general account spread and higher assumed withdrawal rates.
the unlock charge for the year ended december 31, 2014 was primarily due to lower future estimated gross profits on the fixed annuity block driven by the continued low interest rate environment as well as higher variable annuity unit costs due to higher than expected surrenders, partially offset by actual separate account returns being above our aggregated estimated returns during the period.
use of estimated gross profits in amortization and reserving for most annuity contracts, the company estimates gross profits over 20 years as egps emerging subsequent to that time frame are immaterial. products sold in a particular year are aggregated into cohorts. future gross profits for each cohort are projected over the estimated lives of the underlying contracts, based on future account value projections for variable annuity products. the projection of future account values requires the use of certain assumptions including: separate account returns; separate account fund mix; fees assessed against the contract holder's account balance; surrender and lapse rates; interest margin; mortality; and the extent and duration of hedging activities and hedging costs. changes in these assumptions and changes to other policyholder behavior assumptions such as resets, partial surrenders, reaction to price increases, and asset allocations cause egps to fluctuate, which impacts earnings.
the company determines egps from a single deterministic reversion to mean ("rtm") separate account return projection which is an estimation technique commonly used by insurance entities to project future separate account returns. through this estimation technique, the company's dac model is adjusted to reflect actual account values at the end of each quarter. through consideration of recent market returns, the company will unlock, or adjust, projected returns over a future period so that the account value returns to the long-term expected rate of return, providing that those projected returns do not exceed certain caps.
annual unlock of assumptions in the fourth quarter of 2016, the company completed a comprehensive policyholder behavior assumption study which resulted in a non-market related after-tax charge of $20 and incorporated the results of that study into its projection of future gross profits. additionally, throughout the year, the company evaluates various aspects of policyholder behavior and will revise its policyholder assumptions if credible emerging data indicates that changes are warranted. the company will continue to evaluate its assumptions related to policyholder behavior as initiatives to reduce the size of the annuity business are implemented by management. upon completion of an annual assumption study or evaluation of credible new information, the company will revise its assumptions to reflect its current best estimate. these assumption revisions will change the projected
part ii - item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations account values and the related egps in the dac and sia amortization models, as well as the death and other insurance benefit reserving model.
all assumption changes that affect the estimate of future egps including the update of current account values, the use of the rtm estimation technique and policyholder behavior assumptions are considered an unlock in the period of revision. an unlock adjusts dac, sia, and death and other insurance benefit reserve balances in the consolidated balance sheets with an offsetting benefit or charge in the consolidated statements of operations in the period of the revision. an unlock that results in an after-tax benefit generally occurs as a result of actual experience or future expectations of product profitability being favorable compared to previous estimates. an unlock that results in an after-tax charge generally occurs as a result of actual experience or future expectations of product profitability being unfavorable compared to previous estimates.
egps are also used to determine the expected excess benefits and assessments included in the measurement of death and other insurance benefit reserves. these excess benefits and assessments are derived from a range of stochastic scenarios that have been calibrated to the company's rtm separate account returns. the determination of death and other insurance benefit reserves is also impacted by discount rates, lapses, volatilities, mortality assumptions and benefit utilization, including assumptions around annuitization rates.
market unlocks in addition to updating assumptions in the fourth quarter of each year, an unlock revises egps, on a quarterly basis, to reflect the company's current best estimate assumptions and market updates of policyholder account value. the unlock for future separate account returns is determined each quarter. under rtm, the expected long-term weighted average rate of return is 8.3%. the annual return assumed over the next five years of approximately 1.5% was calculated based on the return needed over that period to produce an 8.3% return since march of 2009, the date the company adopted the rtm estimation technique to project future separate account returns. based on the expected trend of policy lapses and annuitizations, the company expects approximately 50% of its block of variable annuities to run-off in the next 5 years.
aggregate recoverability after each quarterly unlock, the company also tests the aggregate recoverability of dac by comparing the dac balance to the present value of future egps. the margin between the dac balance and the present value of future egps for variable annuities was 41% as of december 31, 2016. if the margin between the dac asset and the present value of future egps is exhausted, then further reductions in egps would cause portions of dac to be unrecoverable and the dac asset would be written down to equal future egps.
living benefits required to be fair valued fair values for gmwbs, classified as embedded derivatives and included in other policyholder funds and benefits payable, are calculated using the income approach based upon internally developed models, because active, observable markets do not exist for those items. the fair value of these gmwbs and the related reinsurance and customized freestanding derivatives are calculated as an aggregation of the following components: best estimate claim payments; credit standing adjustment; and margins. the resulting aggregation is reconciled or calibrated, if necessary, to market information that is available to the company, but may not be observable by other market participants, including reinsurance discussions and transactions. the company believes the aggregation of these components, as calibrated to market information, results in an amount that the company would be required to transfer to or receive from market participants in an active liquid market, if one existed, for those market participants to assume the risks associated with the guaranteed minimum benefits and the related reinsurance and customized derivatives. the fair value is likely to materially diverge from the ultimate settlement of the liability as the company believes settlement will be based on our best estimate assumptions rather than those best estimate assumptions plus risk margins. in the absence of any transfer of the guaranteed benefit liability to a third party, the release of risk margins is likely to be reflected as realized gains in future periods' net income.
a multidisciplinary group of finance, actuarial and risk management professionals reviews and approves changes to the company's valuation model as well as associated controls.
for further discussion on the impact of fair value changes from living benefits see note 5 - fair value measurements of notes to consolidated financial statements, and for a discussion on the sensitivities of certain living benefits due to capital market factors see part ii, item 7, md&a - variable product guarantee risks and risk management.
evaluation of goodwill for impairment goodwill balances are reviewed for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events occur or circumstances change that would indicate that a triggering event for a potential impairment has occurred. the goodwill impairment test follows a two-step process. in the first step, the fair value of a reporting unit is compared to its carrying value. if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step of the impairment test is performed for purposes of measuring the impairment. in the second step, the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit to determine an implied goodwill value. if the carrying amount of the reporting unit's goodwill exceeds the implied goodwill value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess, not to exceed the goodwill carrying value.
the estimated fair value of each reporting unit incorporates multiple inputs into discounted cash flow calculations including assumptions that market participants would make in valuing the reporting unit. assumptions include levels of economic capital, future business growth, earnings projections, assets under management for mutual funds, and the weighted average cost of capital used for purposes of discounting. decreases in business growth, decreases in earnings projections and increases in the weighted average cost of capital will all cause a reporting unit's fair value to decrease, increasing the possibility of impairment.
a reporting unit is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment. the company's reporting units, for which goodwill has been allocated include small commercial
part ii - item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations within the commercial lines segment, group benefits, personal lines and mutual funds.
the carrying value of goodwill is $567 as of december 31, 2016 and is comprised of $38 for small commercial, $272 for mutual funds, $138 for group benefits and $119 for personal lines.
the annual goodwill assessment for the small commercial, mutual funds, group benefits and personal lines reporting units was completed as of october 31, 2016, and resulted in no write-downs of goodwill for the year ended december 31, 2016. all reporting units passed the first step of the annual impairment test with a significant margin. for information regarding the 2015 and 2014 impairment tests see note 10 -goodwill of notes to consolidated financial statements.
valuation of investments and derivative instruments fixed maturities, equity securities, short-term investments and free-standing derivatives the company generally determines fair values using valuation techniques that use prices, rates, and other relevant information evident from market transactions involving identical or similar instruments. valuation techniques also include, where appropriate, estimates of future cash flows that are converted into a single discounted amount using current market expectations. the company uses a "waterfall" approach comprised of the following pricing sources which are listed in priority order: quoted prices, prices from third-party pricing services, internal matrix pricing, and independent broker quotes. the fair value of free-standing derivative instruments are determined primarily using a discounted cash flow model or option model technique and incorporate counterparty credit risk. in some cases, quoted market prices for exchange-traded transactions and transactions cleared through central clearing houses ("otc-cleared") may be used and in other cases independent broker quotes may be used. for further discussion, see the fixed maturities, equity securities, short-term investments and free-standing derivatives section in note 5 of notes to consolidated financial statements. for further discussion on the gmwb customized derivative valuation methodology, see the gmwb embedded, customized and reinsurance derivatives section in note 5 of notes to consolidated financial statements.
limited partnerships and other alternative investments the portion of limited partnerships and other alternative investments recorded at fair value represents hedge funds for which investment company accounting has been applied to a wholly-owned fund of funds measured at fair value. during 2016, the company liquidated this wholly-owned hedge fund of funds. fair value was determined for these funds using the fund's nav, as a practical expedient. for further discussion of fair value measurement, see note 5 of notes to consolidated financial statements. the remaining limited partnerships and other alternative investments are accounted for under the equity method of accounting. for further discussion of the accounting policy, see the investments - overview section of note 1 of notes to the consolidated financial statements.
evaluation of otti on available-for-sale securities and valuation allowances on mortgage loans each quarter, a committee of investment and accounting professionals evaluates investments to determine if an other-than-temporary impairment ("impairment") is present for afs securities or a valuation allowance is required for mortgage loans. this evaluation is a quantitative and qualitative process, which is subject to risks and uncertainties. for further discussion of the accounting policies, see the significant investment accounting policies section in note 1 - basis of presentation and significant accounting policies of notes to consolidated financial statements. for a discussion of impairments recorded, see the other-than-temporary impairments within the investment portfolio risks and risk management section of the md&a.
valuation allowance on deferred tax assets deferred tax assets represent the tax benefit of future deductible temporary differences and tax carryforwards. deferred tax assets are measured using the enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when such benefits are realized if there is no change in tax law. under u.s. gaap, we test the value of deferred tax assets for impairment on a quarterly basis at the entity level within each tax jurisdiction, consistent with our filed tax returns. deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion, or all, of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. the determination of the valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets requires management to make certain judgments and assumptions. in evaluating the ability to recover deferred tax assets, we have considered all available evidence as of december 31, 2016, including past operating results, forecasted earnings, future taxable income, and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. in the event we determine it is more likely than not that we will not be able to realize all or part of our deferred tax assets in the future, an increase to the valuation allowance would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made. likewise, if it is later determined that it is more likely than not that those deferred tax assets would be realized, the previously provided valuation allowance would be reversed. our judgments and assumptions are subject to change given the inherent uncertainty in predicting future performance and specific industry and investment market conditions.
as of december 31, 2016, the company had no valuation allowance. as of december 31, 2015, the company had a deferred tax asset valuation allowance $79 relating primarily to u.s. capital loss carryovers. the reduction in the valuation allowance in 2016 stems primarily from taxable gains on the termination of derivatives during the period. the company had no capital loss carryovers as of december 31, 2016.
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance, management considered future taxable temporary difference reversals, future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryovers, taxable income in open carry back years and other tax planning strategies. from time to time, tax planning strategies could include holding a portion of debt securities with market
part ii - item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations value losses until recovery, altering the level of tax exempt securities held, making investments which have specific tax characteristics, and business considerations such as asset-liability matching. management views such tax planning strategies as prudent and feasible and would implement them, if necessary, to realize the deferred tax assets.
contingencies relating to corporate litigation and regulatory matters management evaluates each contingent matter separately. a loss is recorded if probable and reasonably estimable. management establishes reserves for these contingencies at its "best estimate," or, if no one number within the range of possible losses is more probable than any other, the company records an estimated reserve at the low end of the range of losses.
the company has a quarterly monitoring process involving legal and accounting professionals. legal personnel first identify outstanding corporate litigation and regulatory matters posing a reasonable possibility of loss. these matters are then jointly reviewed by accounting and legal personnel to evaluate the facts and changes since the last review in order to determine if a provision for loss should be recorded or adjusted, the amount that should be recorded, and the appropriate disclosure. the outcomes of certain contingencies currently being evaluated by the company, which relate to corporate litigation and regulatory matters, are inherently difficult to predict, and the reserves that have been established for the estimated settlement amounts are subject to significant changes. management expects that the ultimate liability, if any, with respect to such lawsuits, after consideration of provisions made for estimated losses, will not be material to the consolidated financial condition of the company. in view of the uncertainties regarding the outcome of these matters, as well as the tax-deductibility of payments, it is possible that the ultimate cost to the company of these matters could exceed the reserve by an amount that would have a material adverse effect on the company's consolidated results of operations and liquidity in a particular quarterly or annual period.

2017 outlook based on an expectation that the economy will continue to grow slowly in 2017, the company expects low single-digit written premiums growth in commercial lines in 2017, almost entirely driven by small commercial.  written premiums for middle market and specialty commercial are expected to remain relatively flat compared to 2016 as growth in new business is expected to be offset by a decline in renewal premium. in small commercial, the company expects written premium growth through expanded product offerings, enhanced automation and deeper relationships with distribution partners as well as by taking advantage of new opportunities for growth from the acquisition of maxum.
pricing varies significantly by product line with moderate rate decreases possible in property, general liability and workers' compensation with further rate increases expected in commercial auto. market conditions could be influenced by interest rates.  if interest rates rise significantly, it could put downward pressure on the premium rates we and other insurers charge for our insurance coverages, particularly for longer-tailed commercial lines products.
the company expects the commercial lines combined ratio will be between approximately 92.5 and 94.5 for 2017, compared to 92.8 in 2016, as increases in average claim severity are expected to outpace the effect of overall modest earned pricing increases and a modest reduction in loss cost frequency. current accident year catastrophes are assumed to be 2.3 points of the combined ratio in 2017 compared to 3.0 points in 2016.
net income increased in 2016 primarily due to a shift to net realized capital gains in the current year from net realized capital losses in the prior year and higher net investment income.
net income increased in 2015 primarily due to a higher underwriting gain and lower realized capital losses, partially offset by lower net investment income.
underwriting gain year ended december 31, 2016 compared to the year ended december 31, 2015

written premiums increased in 2016 due to growth in small commercial. renewal written pricing increases and policy retention for standard commercial lines were both unchanged in 2016 compared to 2015.
•   small commercial increased primarily due to workers' compensation driven by higher new business, renewal and audit premium, and spectrum package business driven by higher renewal premium, as well as the acquisition of maxum.
•   the decrease in middle market was driven primarily by lower new business, renewal and endorsement premium in workers' compensation, and lower new business and renewal premium in general liability and specialty programs, partially offset by higher new business and renewal premium in construction.
•   specialty commercial decreased primarily as a result of lower retrospective premium on loss sensitive business in national accounts.
•   renewal written pricing increases averaged 2% in standard commercial, which included 3% for small commercial and 1% for middle market.
earned premiums increased in 2015 reflecting written premium growth over the preceding twelve months.

2017 outlook in 2017, the company expects premium rates for auto and home across the industry will continue to rise, as the industry continues to respond to the emergence of higher loss cost trends. automobile loss cost frequency and severity have increased due, in part, to an increase in miles driven and more expensive bodily injury and repair costs.  accordingly, the company expects written pricing increases to be at or near double-digits in 2017 for both automobile and homeowners.  the company has been executing multiple profitability improvement initiatives in personal automobile, including actions on pricing, underwriting and agency management and these will continue in 2017.  due to those actions, the company expects a mid-single digit decline in personal lines written premiums in 2017, with a modest decrease in aarp direct and a more significant decrease in the agency channel.
the company expects the combined ratio for personal lines will be between approximately 99.0 and 101.0 for 2017 compared to 104.8 in 2016 primarily due to an improvement in auto as 2016 included 3.9 points of adverse reserve development and the company expects earned pricing increases and the effect of other profitability improvement initiatives in 2017 will outpace an expected increase in loss cost severity.  current accident year
part ii - item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations catastrophes are assumed to be 5.8 points of the combined ratio in 2017 compared to 5.5 points in 2016. while management actions are expected to improve the combined ratio for auto in 2017, that expectation is subject to uncertainty given that severity trends had not yet moderated through year end 2016. for homeowners, the combined ratio is expected to increase in 2017 largely given that catastrophe losses and prior accident year development were favorable in 2016. the underlying combined ratio for homeowners is expected to remain relatively flat in 2017, driven by earned pricing increases, partially offset by increased average claim severity.

underwriting gain decreased driven by a deterioration in the current accident year loss and loss adjustment ratio before catastrophes and lower favorable prior accident year development, partially offset by a decrease in current accident year catastrophes.
earned premiums increased in 2016 reflecting written premium growth in 2015 over the prior six to twelve months.

current accident year catastrophe losses of $216, before tax, in 2016, increased compared to $211, before tax, in 2015. catastrophe losses in 2016 were primarily due to multiple wind and hail events across various u.s. geographic regions, concentrated in the midwest and central plains. catastrophe losses in 2015 were primarily due to wildfires in california and multiple events (wind and hail primarily) across various u.s. geographic regions.
prior accident year development of $151, before tax, was unfavorable in 2016, compared to favorable prior accident year development of $21, before tax, in 2015. net reserves increased for 2016 primarily due to increased bodily injury frequency and severity for the 2015 accident year and increased bodily injury severity for the 2014 accident year. net reserves decreased for 2015 primarily due to accident year 2014 catastrophes.

pre-tax charge for asbestos and environmental reserve increases year ended december 31, 2016 compared to the year ended december 31, 2015
asbestos reserves increased by $197 in 2016 arising from the second quarter reserve study which found that mesothelioma claims filings have not declined as expected in specific, adverse jurisdictions. as a result, aggregate indemnity and defense costs have not declined as expected resulting in unfavorable net asbestos reserve development.
environmental reserves increased by $71 in 2016 primarily due to deterioration associated with the tendering of new sites for policy coverage, increased defense costs stemming from individual bodily injury liability suits, and increased clean-up costs associated with waterways.
environmental reserves increased by $52 in 2015  primarily due to an increase in estimated environmental cleanup costs, including at certain superfund sites.

2017 outlook fully insured ongoing premiums in group benefits are expected to increase modestly in 2017 due primarily to continued strong book persistency and pricing increases. core earnings in 2017 may be negatively impacted by approximately a $10 to $15 after-tax charge due to state guaranty fund assessments related to the likely liquidation of a carrier in the life and health industry. excluding the potential impact from these state guaranty fund assessments, the company expects group benefits core earnings in 2017 will be relatively flat with 2016 as the effect of slightly higher expenses and lower net investment income will be largely offset by expected modest improvement in the group benefits loss ratio driven by improved pricing and improved severity.

2017 outlook leveraging capabilities from acquiring lattice strategies in july 2016 and adopting ten u.s. schroders funds in october 2016, the company expects to increase sales in 2017 from a diversified lineup of mutual funds and etp. assets under management will grow in 2017 provided the company experiences continued strong fund performance, market appreciation and positive net flows. assuming normal market conditions, the company expects earnings growth in 2017, driven by improved earnings in the mutual fund business, partially offset by the run-off of the talcott resolution assets supporting the company's legacy variable
part ii - item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations insurance products. part of the expected earnings growth in 2017 comes from the fact that 2016 earnings included approximately $3 of after-tax transaction costs associated with the lattice strategies acquisition and adoption of schroders funds.
net income decreased in 2016, compared to the prior year period, primarily due to lower investment management fees as a result of lower daily average aum combined with transaction costs of approximately $3 associated with the acquisition of lattice strategies, llc and the adoption of ten schroders funds during 2016. daily average aum decreased primarily due to market volatility early in the year and the continued run-off of talcott resolution assets.
net income decreased in 2015, compared to the prior year period, primarily due to a combination of lower average aum and higher spending on marketing initiatives and the effect of a one-time state tax benefit in 2014.
total mutual funds segment aum increased in 2016 primarily due to market appreciation and the adoption of 10 schroders funds partially offset by net outflows and the continued run-off of talcott resolution aum.
total mutual funds segment aum declined in 2015 reflecting market depreciation and the continued run-off of talcott resolution aum. mutual fund aum increased by 2% reflecting higher sales and stable redemptions.

2017 outlook the principal goal for talcott resolution is to efficiently manage the run-off of the annuity and private placement life insurance business while honoring the company's obligations to its contract holders. as a result, the company expects account values, and consequently earnings, to decline due to surrenders, policyholder initiatives or transactions with third parties, that will reduce the size of this legacy book of business. risk-reducing transactions may also cause a reduction in statutory capital and shareholders' equity. excluding the effect of favorable limited partnership returns and tax benefits recognized in 2016 that are not assumed to recur in 2017, core earnings are expected to be about $300 in 2017, reflecting the continued runoff of the company's annuity book though subject to change depending on market conditions and management initiatives. a key driver to the decline in earnings will be the pace at which customers surrender their contracts. in 2016, the company experienced a 7.1% variable annuity full surrender rates driven by market appreciation and continued aging of the block and management expects variable annuity surrender rates to remain relatively stable in 2017. contract counts decreased 10% for variable annuities in 2016 and a similar decline is expected in 2017.
part ii - item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations net income (loss)
net income for 2016 decreased primarily due to lower tax benefits recognized in 2016, a write-off of dac associated with fixed annuities, lower investment income and a reinsurance gain on disposition in 2015. net realized capital losses were down slightly as an increase in losses on the variable annuity hedge program and a loss on the modified coinsurance reinsurance contract related to the individual life business were largely offset by an increase in net gains from sales of investments and lower impairment losses. in addition, the continued run-off of the variable and fixed annuity block resulted in lower fee income,  partially offset by lower amortization of dac and lower insurance operating costs and other expenses.
net income increased primarily due to lower dac amortization driven by a favorable unlock in 2015 versus an unfavorable unlock in 2014, lower insurance operating costs and other expenses, and lower benefits and losses due to the continued run-off of the variable annuity block, partially offset by lower fee income due to the continued run-off of the variable annuity block, lower net investment income due to a decrease in income from limited partnerships and alternative investments and realized capital losses related to the variable annuity hedge program. in addition, 2014 included a loss from discontinued operations due to the sale of hlikk.
total account value year ended december 31, 2016 compared to the year ended december 31, 2015
account values for talcott resolution decreased to approximately $150 billion for 2016 primarily due to net outflows in variable annuity account value, partially offset by market appreciation.
variable annuity net outflows were approximately $5.8 billion due to the continued run-off of the business.
account values for talcott resolution decreased to approximately $156 billion for 2015 primarily due to a reduction in retirement plans' account value and net outflows and market value depreciation in variable annuity account value.
variable annuity net outflows decreased by approximately $3.8 billion due to lower outflows from in-force management initiatives.
variable annuity annualized full surrender rate
part ii - item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations year ended december 31, 2016 compared to the year ended december 31, 2015
variable annuity annualized full surrender rate declined to 7.1%. this decrease was primarily due to no in-force management initiatives in 2016 as well as the continued aging of the block, and is consistent with variable annuity industry trends.
variable annuity annualized full surrender rate for the year ended december 31, 2015 declined to 9.6% compared to 13.5% for the year ended december 31, 2014. this decline was primarily due to lower surrenders from in-force management initiatives as well as in-force management initiatives in prior years which accelerated surrenders resulting in lower surrender rates post initiatives.
contract counts decreased 10% and 5% for variable annuity and fixed annuity, respectively, during 2016 primarily due to the continued run-off of the blocks.
contract counts decreased 11% for variable annuities during 2015 primarily due to in-force management initiatives and the continued aging of the block.
income taxes the effective tax rates in 2016, 2015 and 2014 differ from the u.s. federal statutory rate of 35% primarily due to permanent differences related to investments in separate account dividends received deduction ("drd"). the income tax provision for the year ended december 31, 2015 included a $36 net reduction in the provision for income taxes primarily related to the release of reserves due to the resolution of uncertain tax positions. for further discussion of income taxes, see note 16 - income taxes of notes to consolidated financial statements.

net loss decreased in 2016 primarily due to a decrease in insurance operating costs and other expenses, an increase in net investment income and lower interest expense. the income tax benefit in 2016 included a federal income tax benefit of $113 associated with the investments in solar energy partnerships offset by realized capital losses of $96, before tax, associated with the write-down of investments in solar energy partnerships.
insurance operating costs and other expenses decreased in 2016 largely due a reduction in restructuring costs.
net loss decreased in 2015 primarily due to an increase in income tax benefit of $94 from the partial reduction of the deferred tax valuation allowance on capital loss carryovers established when the hlikk annuity business was sold. the reduction in valuation allowance stems primarily from taxable gains on sales of investments during the period. the net loss also decreased due to lower insurance operating costs and interest expense as well as the effect of a pension settlement charge in 2014, partially offset by a loss on extinguishment of debt in second quarter 2015.
insurance operating costs and other expenses decreased for 2015 largely due to a reduction in restructuring costs. in 2014, insurance operating costs and expenses included a benefit of $10, before tax, for recoveries for past legal expenses associated with closed litigation.

enterprise risk management the company's board of directors has ultimate responsibility for risk oversight, as described more fully in our proxy statement, while management is tasked with the day-to-day management of the company's risks.
the company manages and monitors risk through risk policies, controls and limits. at the senior management level, an enterprise risk and capital committee ("ercc") oversees the risk profile and risk management practices of the company. as illustrated below, a number of functional committees sit underneath the ercc, providing oversight of specific risk areas and recommending risk mitigation strategies to the ercc.
president chief financial officer chief investment officer chief risk officer general counsel others as deemed necessary by the committee chair ercc asset liability committee     underwriting risk committee     emerging risk steering committee      operational risk committee      catastrophe risk committee      economic capital executive committee      model oversight committee the company's enterprise risk management ("erm") function supports the ercc and functional committees, and is tasked with, among other things:
•   the development of risk appetites, tolerances, and limits;
•   risk monitoring; and
•   internal and external risk reporting.
the company categorizes its main risks as insurance risk, operational risk and financial risk, each of which is described in more detail below.
insurance risk insurance risk is the risk of losses of both a catastrophic and non-catastrophic nature on the p&c and life products the company has sold . catastrophe insurance risk is the exposure arising from both natural (e.g., weather, earthquakes, wildfires, pandemics) and man-made catastrophes (e.g., terrorism, cyber-attacks) that create a concentration or aggregation of loss across the company's insurance or asset portfolios.
sources of insurance risk non-catastrophe insurance risks exist within each of the company's divisions except mutual funds and include:
part ii - item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations
•   liability- risk of loss from automobile related accidents, uninsured and underinsured drivers, lawsuits from accidents, defective products, breach of warranty, negligent acts by professional practitioners, environmental claims, latent exposures, fraud, coercion, forgery, failure to fulfill obligations per contract surety, liability from errors and omissions, derivative lawsuits, and other securities actions and covered perils.
•   mortality- risk of loss from unexpected trends in insured deaths impacting timing of payouts from life insurance or annuity products, personal or commercial automobile related accidents, and death of employees or executives during the course of employment, while on disability, or while collecting workers compensation benefits.
•   morbidity- risk of loss to an insured from illness incurred during the course of employment or illness from other covered perils.
•   disability- risk of loss incurred from personal or commercial automobile related losses, accidents arising outside of the workplace, injuries or accidents incurred during the course of employment, or from equipment, with each loss resulting in short term or long-term disability payments.
•   longevity- risk of loss from increased life expectancy trends among policyholders receiving long-term benefit payments or annuity payouts.
catastrophe risk primarily arises in the group life, group disability, property, and workers' compensation product lines.
impact non-catastrophe insurance risk can arise from unexpected loss experience, underpriced business and/or underestimation of loss reserves and can have significant effects on the company's earnings. catastrophe insurance risk can arise from various unpredictable events and can have significant effects on the company's earnings and may result in losses that could constrain its liquidity.
management the company's policies and procedures for managing these risks include disciplined underwriting protocols, exposure controls, sophisticated risk-based pricing, risk modeling, risk transfer, and capital management strategies. the company has established underwriting guidelines for both individual risks, including individual policy limits, and risks in the aggregate, including aggregate exposure limits by geographic zone and peril. the company uses both internal and third-party models to estimate the potential loss resulting from various catastrophe events and the potential financial impact those events would have on the company's financial position and results of operations across its businesses.
among specific risk tolerances set by the company, risk limits are set for natural catastrophes, terrorism risk and pandemic risk.
part ii - item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations risk                  definition                                                                                                                                                                                                                          details and company limits natural catastrophe   exposure arising from natural phenomena (e.g., weather, earthquakes, wildfires, etc.) that create a concentration or aggregation of loss across the company's insurance or asset portfolios.                                        the company generally limits its estimated pre-tax loss as a result of natural catastrophes for property &amp; casualty exposures from a single 250-year event to less than 30% of statutory surplus of the property and casualty insurance subsidiaries prior to reinsurance and to less than 15% of statutory surplus of the property and casualty insurance subsidiaries after reinsurance. from time to time the estimated loss to natural catastrophes from a single 250-year event prior to reinsurance may fluctuate above or below these limits due to changes in modeled loss estimates, exposures or statutory surplus.
- the estimated 250 year pre-tax probable maximum loss from earthquake events is estimated to be $930 before reinsurance and $533 net of reinsurance. [1]
- the estimated 250 year pre-tax probable maximum losses from hurricane events are estimated to be $1.6 billion before reinsurance and $836 net of reinsurance. [1]
terrorism             the risk of losses from terrorist attacks, including losses caused by single-site and multi-site conventional attacks, as well as the potential for attacks using nuclear, biological, chemical or radiological weapons ("nbcr").   enterprise limits for terrorism apply to aggregations of risk across property-casualty, group benefits and specific asset portfolios and are defined based on a deterministic, single-site conventional terrorism attack scenario. the company manages its potential estimated loss from a conventional terrorism loss scenario, up to $1.7 billion net of reinsurance and $2.0 billion gross of reinsurance, before coverage under the terrorism risk insurance program established under "tripra". in addition, the company monitors exposures monthly and employs both internally developed and vendor-licensed loss modeling tools as part of its risk management discipline. our modeled exposures to conventional terrorist attacks around landmark locations may fluctuate above and below our stated limits.
pandemic              the exposure to loss arising from widespread influenza or other pathogens or bacterial infections that create an aggregation of loss across the company's insurance or asset portfolios.                                            the company generally limits its estimated pre-tax loss from a single 250 year pandemic event to less than 15% of statutory surplus of the property and casualty and group benefits insurance subsidiaries. in evaluating these scenarios, the company assesses the impact on group life policies, short-term and long-term disability, property &amp; casualty claims, and losses in the investment portfolio associated with market declines in the event of a widespread pandemic. while erm has a process to track and manage these limits, from time to time, the estimated loss for pandemics may fluctuate above or below these limits due to changes in modeled loss estimates, exposures, or statutory surplus.
[1]   the loss estimates represent total property losses for hurricane events and property and workers compensation losses for earthquake events resulting from a single event. the estimates provided are based on 250-year return period loss estimates that have a 0.4% likelihood of being exceeded in any single year. the net loss estimates provided assume that the company is able to recover all losses ceded to reinsurers under its reinsurance programs. the company also manages natural catastrophe risk for group life and group disability, which in combination with property and workers compensation loss estimates are subject to separate enterprise risk management net aggregate loss limits as a percent of enterprise surplus.
reinsurance as a risk management strategy in addition to the policies and procedures outlined above, the company uses reinsurance to transfer certain risks to reinsurance companies based on specific geographic or risk concentrations. a variety of traditional reinsurance products are used as part of the company's risk management strategy, including excess of loss occurrence-based products that reinsure property and workers compensation exposures, and individual risk or quota share arrangements, that reinsure losses from specific classes or lines of business. the company has no significant finite risk contracts in place and the statutory surplus benefit from all such prior year contracts is immaterial.
facultative reinsurance is used by the company to manage policy-specific risk exposures based on established underwriting guidelines. the hartford also participates in governmentally administered reinsurance facilities such as the florida hurricane catastrophe fund ("fhcf"), the terrorism risk insurance program established under "tripra" and other reinsurance programs relating to particular risks or specific lines of business.
reinsurance for catastrophes- the company has several catastrophe reinsurance programs, including reinsurance treaties that cover property and workers' compensation losses aggregating from single catastrophe events.
part ii - item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations primary catastrophe treaty reinsurance coverages as of january 1, 2017
effective for the period   % of layer(s) reinsurance       per occurrence limit               retention property losses arising from a single catastrophe event [1] [2]               1/1/2017 to 1/1/2018                         88%              $800                       $350
workers compensation losses arising from a single catastrophe event [4]     1/1/2017 to 12/31/2017                         80%              $350                       $100
[1]   certain aspects of our principal catastrophe treaty have terms that extend beyond the traditional one year term. while overall treaty is placed at 88%, each layer's placement varies slightly.
[3]   the per occurrence limit on the fhcf treaty is $109 for the 6/1/2016 to 6/1/2017 treaty year based on the company's election to purchase the required coverage from fhcf. coverage is based on the best available information from fhcf, which was updated in january 2017.
[4]   in addition to the limit shown, the workers compensation reinsurance includes a non-catastrophe, industrial accident layer, providing coverage for 80% of a$30 per event limit in excess of a $20 retention.
in addition to the property catastrophe reinsurance coverage described in the above table, the company has other catastrophe and working layer treaties and facultative reinsurance agreements that cover property catastrophe losses on an aggregate excess of loss and on a per risk basis. the principal property catastrophe reinsurance program and certain other reinsurance programs include a provision to reinstate limits in the event that a catastrophe loss exhausts limits on one or more layers under the treaties. in addition, covering the period from january 1, 2017 to december 31, 2017, the company has a property aggregate treaty in place which provides one limit of $200 of aggregate qualifying property catastrophe losses in excess of a net retention of $850.
reinsurance for terrorism- for the risk of terrorism, private sector catastrophe reinsurance capacity is generally limited and largely unavailable for terrorism losses caused by nbcr attacks. as such, the company's principal reinsurance protection against large-scale terrorist attacks is the coverage currently provided through tripra to the end of 2020.
tripra provides a backstop for insurance-related losses resulting from any "act of terrorism", which is certified by the secretary of the treasury, in consultation with the secretary of homeland security and the attorney general, for losses that exceed a threshold of industry losses of $100 in 2015, with the threshold increasing to $200 by 2020. under the program, in any one calendar year, the federal government would pay a percentage of losses incurred from a certified act of terrorism after an insurer's losses exceed 20% of the company's eligible direct commercial earned premiums of the prior calendar year up to a combined annual aggregate limit for the federal government and all insurers of $100 billion. the percentage of losses paid by the federal government is 83% in 2017, decreasing by 1 point annually to 80% in the year 2020. the company's estimated deductible under the program is $1.2 billion for 2017. if an act of terrorism or acts of terrorism result in covered losses exceeding the $100 billion annual industry aggregate limit, a future congress would be responsible for determining how additional losses in excess of $100 billion will be paid.
reinsurance recoverables property and casualty insurance product reinsurance recoverables represent loss and loss adjustment expense recoverables from a number of entities, including reinsurers and pools.

to manage reinsurer credit risk, a reinsurance security review committee evaluates the credit standing, financial performance, management and operational quality of each potential reinsurer. in placing reinsurance, the company considers the nature of the risk reinsured, including the expected liability payout duration, and establishes limits tiered by reinsurer credit rating.
where its contracts permit, the company secures future claim obligations with various forms of collateral, including irrevocable letters of credit, secured trusts, funds held accounts and group wide offsets. as part of its reinsurance recoverable review, the company analyzes recent developments in commutation activity between reinsurers and cedants, recent trends in arbitration and litigation outcomes in disputes between cedants and reinsurers and the overall credit quality of the company's reinsurers. as indicated in the above table, 73.1% of the gross reinsurance recoverables due from reinsurers rated by a.m. best were rated a- (excellent) or better as of december 31, 2016.
annually, the company completes evaluations of the reinsurance recoverable asset associated with older, long-term casualty liabilities reported in the property & casualty other operations reporting segment, and the allowance for uncollectible reinsurance reported in the commercial lines reporting segment. for a discussion regarding the results of these evaluations, see md&a - critical accounting estimates, property and casualty insurance product reserves, net of reinsurance.

guaranty funds and other insurance-related assessments as part of its risk management strategy, the company regularly monitors the financial strength of other insurers and, in particular, activity by insurance regulators and various state guaranty associations relating to troubled insurers. in all states, insurers licensed to transact certain classes of insurance are required to become members of a guaranty fund.
operational risk operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes and systems, human error, or from external events.
sources of operational risk operational risk is inherent in the company's business and functional areas. operational risks include legal; cyber and information security; models; third party vendors; technology; operations; business continuity; disaster recovery; external fraud; and compliance.
impact operational risk can result in financial loss, disruption of our business, regulatory actions or damage to our reputation.

part ii - item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations establishing, maintaining and communicating the framework, principles and guidelines of the company's operational risk management program. operational risk mitigation strategies include the following:
•   establishing policies and monitoring risk tolerances and exceptions;
•   conducting business risk assessments and implementing action plans where necessary;
•   validating existing crisis management protocols;
•   identifying and monitoring emerging risks; and
financial risk financial risks include direct and indirect risks to the company's financial objectives coming from events that impact market conditions or prices. some events may cause correlated movement in multiple risk factors. the primary sources of financial risks are the company's general account assets and the liabilities and the guarantees which the company has written over various liability products, particularly its fixed and variable annuity guarantees. consistent with its risk appetite, the company establishes financial risk limits to control potential loss on a u.s. gaap, statutory, and economic basis. exposures are actively monitored, and mitigated where appropriate. the company uses various risk management strategies, including reinsurance and over-the-counter and exchange traded derivatives with counterparties meeting the appropriate regulatory and due diligence requirements. derivatives are utilized to achieve one of four company-approved objectives: hedging risk arising from interest rate, equity market, commodity market, credit spread and issuer default, price or currency exchange rate risk or volatility; managing liquidity; controlling transaction costs; or entering into synthetic replication transactions. derivative activities are monitored and evaluated by the company's compliance and risk management teams and reviewed by senior management.
the company identifies different categories of financial risk, including liquidity, credit, interest rate, equity and foreign currency exchange, as described below.
liquidity risk liquidity risk is the risk to current or prospective earnings or capital arising from the company's inability or perceived inability to meet its contractual funding obligations as they come due.
sources of liquidity risk sources of liquidity risk include funding risk, company-specific liquidity risk and market liquidity risk resulting from differences in the amount and timing of sources and uses of cash as well as company-specific and general market conditions. stressed market conditions may impact the ability to sell assets or otherwise transact business and may result in a significant loss in value.
impact inadequate capital resources and liquidity could negatively affect the company's overall financial strength and its ability to generate cash flows from its businesses, borrow funds at competitive rates, and raise new capital to meet operating and growth needs.
management the company has defined ongoing monitoring and reporting requirements to assess liquidity across the enterprise under both current and stressed market conditions. the company measures and manages liquidity risk exposures and funding needs within prescribed limits across legal entities, taking into account legal, regulatory and operational limitations to the transferability of liquidity. the company also monitors internal and external conditions, and identifies material risk changes and emerging risks that may impact liquidity. the company's cfo has primary responsibility for liquidity risk.
for further discussion on liquidity see the section on capital resources and liquidity.
credit risk credit risk is the risk to earnings or capital due to uncertainty of an obligor's or counterparty's ability or willingness to meet its obligations in accordance with contractually agreed upon terms. credit risk is comprised of three major factors: the risk of change in credit quality, or credit migration risk; the risk of default; and the risk of a change in value due to changes in credit spread.
sources of credit risk the majority of the company's credit risk is concentrated in its investment holdings, but it is also present in the company's reinsurance and insurance portfolios.
impact a decline in creditworthiness is typically associated with an increase in an investment's credit spread, potentially resulting in an increase in other-than-temporary impairments and an increased probability of a realized loss upon sale. premiums receivable and reinsurance recoverables are also subject to credit risk based on the counterparty's unwillingness or inability to pay.
management the objective of the company's enterprise credit risk management strategy is to identify, quantify, and manage credit risk on an aggregate portfolio basis and to limit potential losses in accordance with an established credit risk management policy. the company primarily manages its credit risk by holding a diversified mix of investment grade issuers and counterparties across its investment, reinsurance, and insurance portfolios. potential losses are also limited within portfolios by diversifying across geographic regions, asset types, and sectors.
the company manages credit risk on an on-going basis through the use of various processes and analyses. both the investment and reinsurance areas have formulated procedures for counterparty approvals and authorizations, which establish minimum levels of creditworthiness and financial stability. credits considered for investment are subjected to underwriting reviews. within the investment portfolio, private securities are subject to committee review for approval. mitigation strategies vary across the three sources of credit risk, but may include:
•   investing in a portfolio of high-quality and diverse securities;
•   selling investments subject to credit risk;
•   hedging through use of single name or basket credit default swaps;
•   clearing transactions through central clearing houses that require daily variation margin;
•   entering into contracts only with strong creditworthy institutions
the company has developed credit exposure thresholds which are based upon counterparty ratings. aggregate counterparty credit quality and exposure are monitored on a daily basis utilizing an enterprise-wide credit exposure information system that contains data on issuers, ratings, exposures, and credit limits. exposures are tracked on a current and potential basis and aggregated by ultimate parent of the counterparty across investments, reinsurance receivables, insurance products with credit risk, and derivatives.
as of december 31, 2016, the company had no investment exposure to any credit concentration risk of a single issuer or counterparty greater than 10% of the company's stockholders' equity, other than the u.s. government and certain u.s. government securities. for further discussion of concentration of credit risk in the investment portfolio, see the concentration of credit risk section in note 6 - investments of notes to consolidated financial statements.
assets and liabilities subject to credit riskinvestments essentially all of the company's invested assets are subject to credit risk. credit related impairments on investments were $43 and $29, in 2016 and 2015, respectively. (see the enterprise risk management section of the md&a under "other-than-temporary impairments.")
reinsurance recoverables reinsurance recoverables, net of an allowance for uncollectible reinsurance, were $23,311 and $23,189, as of december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. (see the enterprise risk management section of the md&a under "reinsurance as a risk management strategy.")
premiums receivable and agents' balances premiums receivable and agents' balances, net of an allowance for doubtful accounts, were $3,731 and $3,537, as of december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. (for a discussion regarding collectibility of these balances, see note 1, basis of presentation and significant accounting policies of notes to consolidated financial statements under the section labeled "revenue recognition.")
credit risk of derivatives the company uses various derivative counterparties in executing its derivative transactions. the use of counterparties creates credit risk that the counterparty may not perform in accordance with the terms of the derivative transaction.
downgrades to the credit ratings of the company's insurance operating companies may have adverse implications for its use of derivatives including those used to hedge benefit guarantees of variable annuities. in some cases, downgrades may give derivative counterparties for over-the-counter ("otc") derivatives and clearing brokers for otc-cleared derivatives the right to cancel and settle outstanding derivative trades or require additional collateral to be posted. in addition, downgrades may result in counterparties and clearing brokers becoming unwilling to engage in or clear additional derivatives or may require collateralization before entering into any new trades. this would restrict the supply of derivative instruments commonly used to hedge variable annuity guarantees, particularly long-dated equity derivatives and interest rate swaps.
managing the credit risk of counterparties to derivative instruments the company has derivative counterparty exposure policies which limit the company's exposure to credit risk. the company monitors counterparty exposure on a monthly basis to ensure compliance with company policies and statutory limitations. the company's policies with respect to derivative counterparty exposure establishes market-based credit limits, favors long-term financial stability and creditworthiness of the counterparty and typically requires credit enhancement/credit risk reducing agreements, which are monitored and evaluated by the company's risk management team and reviewed by senior management.
the company minimizes the credit risk of derivative instruments by entering into transactions with high quality counterparties primarily rated a or better. the company also generally requires that otc derivative contracts be governed by an international swaps and derivatives association ("isda") master agreement, which is structured by legal entity and by counterparty and permits right of offset. the company enters into credit support annexes in conjunction with the isda agreements, which require daily collateral settlement based upon agreed upon thresholds.
the company has developed credit exposure thresholds which are based upon counterparty ratings. credit exposures are measured using the market value of the derivatives, resulting in amounts owed to the company by its counterparties or potential payment obligations from the company to its counterparties. the notional amounts of derivative contracts represent the basis upon which pay or receive amounts are calculated and are not reflective of credit risk. for purposes of daily derivative collateral maintenance, credit exposures are generally quantified based on the prior business day's market value and collateral is pledged to and held by, or on behalf of, the company to the extent the current value of the derivatives exceed the contractual thresholds. in accordance with industry standard and the contractual agreements, collateral is typically settled on the next business day. the company has exposure to credit risk for amounts below the exposure thresholds which are uncollateralized, as well as for market fluctuations that may occur between contractual settlement periods of collateral movements.
for the company's derivative programs, the maximum uncollateralized threshold for a derivative counterparty for a single legal entity is $10. the company currently transacts otc derivatives in five legal entities that have a threshold greater than zero. the maximum combined threshold for a single counterparty across all legal entities that use derivatives and have a threshold greater than zero is $30. in addition, the company may have exposure to multiple counterparties in a single corporate family due to a common credit support provider. as of december 31, 2016, the maximum combined threshold for all counterparties under a single credit support provider across all legal entities that use derivatives and have a threshold greater than zero was $60. based on the contractual terms of the collateral agreements, these thresholds may be immediately reduced due to a
downgrade in either party's credit rating. for further discussion, see the derivative commitments section of note 14 commitments and contingencies of notes to consolidated financial statements.
for the year ended december 31, 2016, the company incurred no losses on derivative instruments due to counterparty default.
use of credit derivatives the company may also use credit default swaps to manage credit exposure or to assume credit risk to enhance yield.
credit risk reduced through credit derivatives the company uses credit derivatives to purchase credit protection with respect to a single entity, referenced index, or asset pool. the company purchases credit protection through credit default swaps to economically hedge and manage credit risk of certain fixed maturity investments across multiple sectors of the investment portfolio. as of december 31, 2016 and 2015, the notional amount related to credit derivatives that purchase credit protection was $209 and $423, respectively, while the fair value was $(4) and $18, respectively. these amounts do not include positions that are in offsetting relationships.
credit risk assumed through credit derivatives the company also enters into credit default swaps that assume credit risk as part of replication transactions. replication transactions are used as an economical means to synthetically replicate the characteristics and performance of assets that are permissible investments under the company's investment policies. these swaps reference investment grade single corporate issuers and baskets, which include customized diversified portfolios of corporate issuers, which are established within sector concentration limits and may be divided into tranches which possess different credit ratings. as of december 31, 2016 and 2015, the notional amount related to credit derivatives that assume credit risk was $1.3 billion and $2.5 billion, respectively, while the fair value was $10 and $(13), respectively. these amounts do not include positions that are in offsetting relationships.
for further information on credit derivatives, see note 7 derivative instruments of notes to consolidated financial statements.
interest rate risk interest rate risk is the risk of financial loss due to adverse changes in the value of assets and liabilities arising from movements in interest rates. interest rate risk encompasses exposures with respect to changes in the level of interest rates, the shape of the term structure of rates and the volatility of interest rates. interest rate risk does not include exposure to changes in credit spreads.
sources of interest rate risk the company has exposure to interest rates arising from its fixed maturity securities, interest sensitive liabilities and discount rate assumptions associated with the company's pension and other post retirement benefit obligations. in addition, certain product liabilities, including those containing gmwb or gmdb, expose the company to interest rate risk but also have significant equity risk. these liabilities are discussed as part of the variable product guarantee risks and risk management section. management also evaluates performance of certain talcott resolution products based on net investment spread which is, in part, influenced by changes in interest rates.
impact changes in interest rates from current levels can have both favorable and unfavorable effects for the company.

the company also utilizes a variety of derivative instruments to mitigate interest rate risk associated with its investment portfolio or to hedge liabilities. interest rate caps, floors, swaps, swaptions, and futures may be used to manage portfolio duration. interest rate swaps are primarily used to convert interest receipts or payments to a fixed or variable rate. the use of such swaps
part ii - item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations enables the company to customize contract terms and conditions to desired objectives and manage the duration profile within established tolerances. interest rate swaps are also used to hedge the variability in the cash flows of a forecasted purchase or sale of fixed rate securities due to changes in interest rates. as of december 31, 2016 and 2015, notional amounts pertaining to derivatives utilized to manage interest rate risk, including offsetting positions, totaled $15.2 billion and $17.8 billion, respectively ($15.1 billion and $17.7 billion, respectively, related to investments and $68 and $89, respectively, related to talcott resolution liabilities). the fair value of these derivatives was $(969) and $(796) as of december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. these amounts do not include derivatives associated with the variable annuity hedging program.
assets and liabilities subject to interest rate risk fixed maturity investments the fair value of fixed maturity investments was $56.3 billion and $59.7 billion at december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. the weighted average duration of the portfolio, including fixed maturities, commercial mortgage loans, certain derivatives, and cash equivalents, was approximately 5.7 years and 5.5 years as of december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
investment contract liabilities and certain insurance product liabilities (e.g., fixed rate annuities) the company's issued investment contracts and certain insurance product liabilities, other than non-guaranteed separate accounts, include asset accumulation vehicles such as fixed annuities, guaranteed investment products, other investment and universal life-type contracts and certain insurance products such as long-term disability. the primary risk associated with these products is that, despite the use of market value adjustment features and surrender charges, the spread between investment return and credited rate may not be sufficient to earn targeted returns.
asset accumulation vehicles primarily require a fixed rate payment, often for a specified period of time, and fixed rate annuities contain surrender values that are based upon a market value adjustment formula if held for shorter periods. in addition, certain products such as corporate owned life insurance contracts and the general account portion of talcott resolution's variable annuity products credit interest to policyholders subject to market conditions and minimum interest rate guarantees. as of december 31, 2016 and 2015, the company had $5,189 and $5,615, respectively, of liabilities for fixed annuities and $194 and $192, respectively, of liabilities for guaranteed investment products.
structured settlements and other non-investment type product liabilities the company's issued non-investment type contracts include structured settlement contracts, terminal funding agreements, on-benefit annuities (i.e., the annuitant is currently receiving benefits) and short-term and long-term disability contracts. the cash outflows associated with these policy liabilities are not interest rate sensitive but do vary based on timing. similar to investment-type products, the aggregate cash flow payment streams are relatively predictable. products in this category may rely upon actuarial pricing assumptions (including mortality and morbidity) and have an element of cash flow uncertainty. as of december 31, 2016 and 2015, the company had $6,993 and $7,045, respectively, of liabilities for structured settlements and terminal funding agreements, $1,636 and $1,647, respectively, of liabilities for on-benefit payout annuities, and $4,947 and $5,029, respectively of reserves for short-term and long-term disability contracts.
pension and other post-retirement benefit obligations the company's pension and other post-retirement benefit obligations are exposed to interest rate risk based upon the sensitivity of present value obligations to changes in liability discount rates. the discount rate assumption is based upon an interest rate yield curve that reflects high-quality fixed income investments consistent with the maturity profile of the expected liability cash flows. the company is exposed to the risk of having to make additional plan contributions if the plans' investment returns are lower than expected. (for further discussion of discounting pension and other postretirement benefit obligations, refer to note 18 - employee benefit plans of notes to consolidated financial statements.) as of december 31, 2016 and 2015, the company had $1,106 and $1,443, respectively, of unfunded liabilities for pension and post-retirement benefit obligations recorded within other liabilities in the accompanying balance sheets.
interest rate sensitivity invested assets supporting fixed liabilities included in the following table is the before-tax change in the net economic value of investment contracts, including structured settlements, fixed annuity contracts and terminal funding agreements issued by the company's talcott resolution segment, as well as disability contracts issued by the company's group benefits segment, for which the payment rates are fixed at contract issuance and/or the investment experience is substantially absorbed by the company's operations, along with the corresponding invested assets. also included in this analysis are the interest rate sensitive derivatives used by the company to hedge its exposure to interest rate risk in the investment portfolios supporting these contracts. this analysis does not include the assets and corresponding liabilities of certain insurance products such as auto, property, term life insurance, and certain life contingent annuities. certain financial instruments, such as limited partnerships and other alternative investments, have been omitted from the analysis due to the fact that these investments generally lack sensitivity to interest rate changes. insulated separate account assets and liabilities are excluded from the analysis because gains and losses in separate

the carrying value of assets supporting the fixed liabilities related to the businesses included in the table above was $25.0 billion and $25.3 billion, as of december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and included fixed maturities, commercial mortgage loans and short-term investments. the assets supporting the fixed liabilities are monitored and managed within set duration guidelines and are evaluated on a daily basis, as well as annually, using scenario simulation techniques in compliance with regulatory requirements.
invested assets not supporting fixed liabilities the following table provides an analysis showing the estimated before-tax change in the fair value of the company's investments and related derivatives, excluding assets supporting fixed liabilities which are included in the table above, assuming 100 basis point upward and downward parallel shifts in the yield curve as of december 31, 2016 and 2015. certain financial instruments, such as limited partnerships and other alternative investments, have been omitted from the analysis due to the fact that these investments generally lack sensitivity to interest rate changes.

the carrying value of fixed maturities, commercial mortgage loans and short-term investments related to the businesses included in the table above was $40.2 billion and $41.9 billion, as of december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. the selection of the 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve was made only as an illustration of the potential hypothetical impact of such an event and should not be construed as a prediction of future market events. actual results could differ materially from those illustrated above due to the nature of the estimates and assumptions used in the above analysis. the company's sensitivity analysis calculation assumes that the composition of invested assets and liabilities remain materially consistent throughout the year and that the current relationship between short-term and long-term interest rates will remain constant over time. as a result, these calculations may not fully capture the impact of portfolio re-allocations, significant product sales or non-parallel changes in interest rates.
equity risk equity risk is the risk of financial loss due to changes in the value of global equities or equity indices.
sources of equity risk the company has exposure to equity risk from general account assets, variable annuity and mutual fund assets under management, embedded derivatives within the company's variable annuity products, and assets that support the company's pension and other post retirement benefit plans. the company's variable products are significantly influenced by the u.s. and other equity markets, as discussed below.
impact declines in equity markets may result in losses due to sales or impairments that are recognized as realized losses in earnings or in reductions in market value that are recognized as unrealized losses in accumulated other comprehensive income ("aoci"). declines in equity markets may also decrease the value of limited partnerships and other alternative investments or result in losses on derivatives, including on embedded product derivatives, thereby negatively impacting our reported earnings.
the company's variable annuity contracts and mutual funds are significantly influenced by the u.s. and other equity markets. generally, declines in equity markets will:
•   reduce the value of assets under management and the amount of fee income generated from those assets;
•   increase the value of derivative assets used to hedge product guarantees resulting in realized capital gains;
•   increase the costs of the hedging instruments we use in our hedging program;
•   increase the company's net amount at risk ("nar"), described below, for gmdb and gmwb;
•   increase the amount of required assets to be held backing variable annuity guarantees to maintain required regulatory reserve levels and targeted risk based capital ratios; and
•   decrease the company's estimated future gross profits, resulting in a dac unlock charge. see estimated gross profits within the critical accounting estimates section of the md&amp;a for further information.
increases in equity markets will generally have the inverse impact of those listed in the preceding discussion.
management the company uses various approaches in managing its equity exposure, including limits on the proportion of assets invested in equities, diversification of the equity portfolio, reinsurance of product liabilities and hedging of changes in equity indexes.
equity risk on the company's variable annuity products is mitigated through the hedging programs described below, which are primarily focused on mitigating the economic exposure while considering the potential impacts on statutory and gaap accounting results.
part ii - item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations assets and liabilities subject to equity risk equity investments in the general account portfolio the company's general account portfolio is exposed to losses from market declines affecting equity securities, alternative assets, and limited partnerships.
guaranteed benefits, primarily associated with variable annuity products the company may experience losses associated with gmdb or gmwb variable annuity guarantees when equity markets decline. (for further discussion, see the managing equity risk on the company's variable annuity products section below.)
assets under management mutual funds and variable annuities businesses may experience lower earnings during equity market declines because fee income is earned based upon the value of assets under management.
assets supporting pension and other post-retirement benefit plans the company may be required to make additional plan contributions if equity investments in the plan portfolio decline in value. the asset allocation mix is reviewed on a periodic basis. in order to minimize the risk, the pension plans maintain a listing of permissible and prohibited investments and impose concentration limits and investment quality requirements on permissible investment options. for further discussion of equity risk associated with the pension plans, see note 18 employee benefit plans of notes to consolidated financial statements.
managing equity risk on the company's variable annuity products- most of the company's variable annuities include gmdb and certain contracts with gmdb also include gmwb features. declines in the equity markets will increase the company's liability for these benefits. many contracts with a gmdb include a maximum anniversary value ("mav"), which in rising markets resets the guarantee on the anniversary to be 'at the money'. as the mav increases, it can increase the nar for subsequent declines in account value. generally, a gmwb contract is 'in the money' if the contractholder's guaranteed remaining balance ("grb") becomes greater than the account value.
the nar is generally defined as the guaranteed minimum benefit amount in excess of the contractholder's current account value. variable annuity account values with guarantee features were $40.7 billion and $44.2 billion as of december 31, 2016 and december 31, 2015, respectively.
the following tables summarize the account values of the company's variable annuities with guarantee features and the nar split between various guarantee features (retained net amount at risk does not take into consideration the effects of the variable annuity hedge programs in place as of each balance sheet date).

[1]   policies with a guaranteed living benefit also have a guaranteed death benefit. the nar for each benefit is shown; however these benefits are not additive. when a policy terminates due to death, any nar related to gmwb is released. similarly, when a policy goes into benefit status on a gmwb, the gmdb nar is reduced to zero.
[3]   for all contracts that are "in the money", this represents the percentage by which the average contract was in the money.
many policyholders with a gmdb also have a gmwb. policyholders that have a product that offers both guarantees can only receive the gmdb or gmwb. the gmdb nar disclosed in the preceding tables is a point in time measurement and assumes that all participants utilize the gmdb on that measurement date.
for policies with a gmwb rider, the company expects to incur gmwb payments in the future only if the account value is reduced over time to a specified level through a combination of market performance and periodic withdrawals, at which point the contractholder will receive an annuity equal to the grb which is generally equal to premiums less withdrawals. for the company's "life-time" gmwb products, this annuity can exceed the grb. as the account value fluctuates with equity market returns on a daily

variable annuity market risk exposures the following table summarizes the broad variable annuity guarantees offered by the company and the market risks to which the guarantee is most exposed from a u.s. gaap accounting perspective:

[1]   each of these guarantees and the related u.s. gaap accounting volatility will also be influenced by actual and estimated policyholder behavior.
variable annuity hedging program the company's variable annuity hedging program is primarily focused, through the use of reinsurance and capital market derivative instruments, on reducing the economic exposure to market risks associated with guaranteed benefits that are embedded in our variable annuity contracts. the variable annuity hedging program also considers the potential impacts on statutory capital.
reinsurance the company uses reinsurance for a portion of contracts with gmwb riders issued prior to the second quarter of 2006. the company also uses reinsurance for a majority of the gmdb with nar.
gmwb hedge program under the dynamic hedging program, the company enters into derivative contracts to hedge market risk exposures associated with the gmwb liabilities that are not reinsured. these derivative contracts include customized swaps, interest rate swaps and futures, and equity swaps, options, and futures, on certain indices including the s&p 500 index, eafe index, and nasdaq index.
additionally, the company holds customized derivative contracts to provide protection from certain capital market risks for the remaining term of specified blocks of non-reinsured gmwb riders. these customized derivative contracts are based on policyholder behavior assumptions specified at the inception of the derivative contracts. the company retains the risk for differences between assumed and actual policyholder behavior and between the performance of the actively managed funds underlying the separate accounts and their respective indices.
while the company actively manages this dynamic hedging program, increased u.s. gaap earnings volatility may result from factors including, but not limited to: policyholder behavior, capital markets, divergence between the performance of the underlying funds and the hedging indices, changes in hedging positions and the relative emphasis placed on various risk management objectives.
macro hedge program the company's macro hedging program uses derivative instruments, such as options and futures on equities and interest rates, to provide protection against the statutory tail scenario risk arising from gmwb and gmdb liabilities on the company's statutory surplus. these macro hedges cover some of the residual risks not otherwise covered by the dynamic hedging program. management assesses this residual risk under various scenarios in designing and executing the macro hedge program. the macro hedge program will result in additional u.s. gaap earnings volatility as changes in the value of the macro hedge derivatives, which are designed to reduce statutory reserve and capital volatility, may not be closely aligned to changes in gaap liabilities.
variable annuity hedging program sensitivities the underlying guaranteed withdrawal benefit liabilities (excluding the life contingent portion of gmwb contracts) and hedge assets within the gmwb hedge and macro hedge programs are carried at fair value.
the following table presents our estimates of the potential instantaneous impacts from sudden market stresses related to equity market prices, interest rates, and implied market volatilities. the following sensitivities represent: (1) the net estimated difference between the change in the fair value of gmwb liabilities and the underlying hedge instruments and (2) the estimated change in fair value of the hedge instruments for the macro program, before the impacts of amortization of dac and taxes. as noted in the preceding discussion, certain hedge assets are used to hedge liabilities that are not carried at fair value and will not have a liability offset in the u.s. gaap sensitivity analysis. all sensitivities are measured as of december 31, 2016 and are related to the fair value of liabilities and hedge instruments in place at that date for the company's variable annuity hedge programs. the impacts presented in the table that follows are estimated individually and measured without consideration of any correlation among market risk factors.

the preceding sensitivity analysis is an estimate and should not be used to predict the future financial performance of the company's variable annuity hedge programs. the actual net changes in the fair value liability and the hedging assets illustrated in the preceding table may vary materially depending on a variety of factors which include but are not limited to:
•   the sensitivity analysis is only valid as of the measurement date and assumes instantaneous changes in the capital market factors and no ability to rebalance hedge positions prior to the market changes;
•   changes to the underlying hedging program, policyholder behavior, and variation in underlying fund performance relative to the hedged index, which could materially impact the liability; and
•   the impact of elapsed time on liabilities or hedge assets, any non-parallel shifts in capital market factors, or correlated moves across the sensitivities.
foreign currency exchange risk foreign currency exchange risk is the risk of financial loss due to changes in the relative value between currencies.
sources of currency risk the company has foreign currency exchange risk in non-u.s. dollar denominated investments, which primarily consist of fixed maturity and equity investments, foreign denominated cash, a yen denominated fixed payout annuity and changes in equity of a p&c run-off entity in the united kingdom. in addition, the company's talcott resolution segment formerly issued non-u.s. dollar denominated funding agreement liability contracts.
impact changes in relative values between currencies can create variability in cash flows and realized or unrealized gains and losses on changes in the fair value of assets and liabilities.
based on the fair values of the company's non-u.s. dollar denominated securities and derivative instruments as of december 31, 2016 and 2015, management estimates that a hypothetical 10% unfavorable change in exchange rates would decrease the fair values by a before-tax total of $11 and $48, respectively, and as of december 31, 2016 excludes the impact of the assets that transferred to held for sale related to the u.k. property and casualty run-off subsidiaries . actual results could differ materially due to the nature of the estimates and assumptions used in the analysis.
management the open foreign currency exposure of non-u.s. dollar denominated investments will most commonly be reduced through the sale of the assets or through hedges using currency futures/forwards/swaps. in order to manage the currency risk related to any non-u.s. dollar denominated liability contracts, the company enters into foreign currency swaps or holds non-u.s. dollar denominated investments.
assets and liabilities subject to foreign currency exchange risk non-u.s. dollar denominated fixed maturities, equities, and cash the fair values of the non-u.s. dollar denominated fixed maturities and equities, excluding assets held for sale, at december 31, 2016 and 2015 were approximately $283 and $921, respectively. included in these amounts are $121 and $530 at december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, related to non-u.s. dollar denominated fixed maturities and equities that directly support liabilities denominated in the same currencies. the currency risk of the remaining non-u.s. dollar denominated fixed maturities and equities are hedged with foreign currency swaps. in addition, the company holds $726 of yen-denominated cash, of which $520 is hedged with foreign currency forwards and $206 is derivative cash collateral pledged by counterparties and has an offsetting collateral liability.
yen denominated fixed payout annuities under a reinsurance contract the company has entered into pay u.s. dollar, receive yen swap contracts to hedge the currency exposure between the u.s. dollar denominated assets and the yen denominated fixed liability reinsurance payments.
investment in a p&c run-off entity in the united kingdom during 2015, the company entered into certain foreign currency forwards to hedge the currency impacts on changes in equity of a p&c run-off entity in the united kingdom. at december 31, 2016 and 2015, the derivatives used to hedge the currency impacts had a total notional amount of $200 and $191, respectively, and a total fair value of $(2) and $6, respectively.
non-u.s. dollar denominated funding agreement liability contracts the company hedged the foreign currency risk associated with these liability contracts with currency rate swaps. at december 31, 2016
and 2015, the derivatives used to hedge foreign currency exchange risk related to foreign denominated liability contracts had a total notional amount of $94 and $94, and a total fair value of $(26) and $(26), respectively.
financial risk on statutory capital statutory surplus amounts and risk-based capital ("rbc") ratios may increase or decrease in any period depending upon a variety of factors and may be compounded in extreme scenarios or if multiple factors occur at the same time. in general, as equity market levels and interest rates decline, the amount and volatility of both our actual or potential obligation, as well as the related statutory surplus and capital margin can be materially negatively affected, sometimes at a greater than linear rate. at times the impact of changes in certain market factors or a combination of multiple factors on rbc ratios can be counterintuitive. factors include:
•   differences in performance of variable subaccounts relative to indices and/or realized equity and interest rate volatilities may affect rbc ratios.
•   rising equity markets will generally result in an increase in statutory surplus and rbc ratios. however, as a result of a number of factors and market conditions, including the level of hedging costs and other risk transfer activities, reserve requirements for death and living benefit guarantees and rbc requirements could increase with rising equity markets, resulting in lower rbc ratios. the company has reinsured approximately 39% of its risk associated with gmwb and 79% of its risk associated with the aggregate gmdb exposure. these reinsurance agreements reduce the company's exposure to changes in the statutory reserves and the related capital and rbc ratios associated with changes in the capital markets.
•   a decrease in the value of certain fixed-income and equity securities in our investment portfolio, due in part to credit spreads widening, may result in a decrease in statutory surplus and rbc ratios.
•   credit spreads on invested assets may increase sharply for certain sub-sectors of the overall credit market, resulting in statutory separate account asset market value losses. as actual credit spreads are not fully reflected in the current crediting rates, the calculation of statutory reserves for fixed mva annuities will not substantially offset the change in fair value of the statutory separate account assets resulting in reductions in statutory surplus.
•   decreases in the value of certain derivative instruments that do not get hedge accounting, may reduce statutory surplus and rbc ratios.
•   sustained low interest rates with respect to the fixed annuity business may result in a reduction in statutory surplus and an increase in naic required capital.
•   non-market factors, which can also impact the amount and volatility of both our actual potential obligation, as well as the related statutory surplus and capital margin, include actual and estimated policyholder behavior experience as it pertains to lapsation, partial withdrawals, and mortality.
most of these factors are outside of the company's control. the company's financial strength and credit ratings are significantly influenced by the statutory surplus amounts and rbc ratios of our insurance company subsidiaries. in addition, rating agencies may implement changes to their internal models that have the effect of increasing or decreasing the amount of statutory capital we must hold in order to maintain our current ratings.

the fair value of afs securities decreased, as compared with december 31, 2015, due to the continued run-off of talcott resolution and the transfer of assets to assets held for sale related to the u.k. property and casualty run-off subsidiaries. for further discussion on the disposition, see note 2 - business acquisitions, dispositions and discontinued operations of notes to consolidated financial statements. in addition, the decline relates to an increase in short-term investments until those assets are reinvested into longer duration asset classes. fixed maturities, fvo, are not included in the preceding table. for further discussion on fvo securities, see note 5 - fair value measurements of notes to consolidated financial statements.

the fair value of afs securities decreased, as compared with december 31, 2015, due to the continued run-off of talcott resolution and the transfer of $619 in assets to assets held for sale related to the u.k. property and casualty run-off subsidiaries. for further discussion on the disposition, see note 2 - business acquisitions, dispositions and discontinued operations of notes to consolidated financial statements. the company also reduced its allocation to financial services and u.s. treasuries and purchased rmbs.
european exposure certain economies in the european region have experienced adverse economic conditions in recent years, specifically in europe's peripheral region (greece, ireland, italy, portugal and spain). while some economic conditions have improved, continued slow gdp growth, elevated unemployment levels and increased volatility in the financial markets following the united kingdom's referendum to withdraw from the european union may continue to put pressure on sovereign debt. the company manages the credit risk associated with the european securities within the investment portfolio on an on-going basis using several processes which are supported by macroeconomic analysis and issuer credit analysis. for additional details regarding the company's management of credit risk, see the credit risk section of this md&a.
as of december 31, 2016, the company's european investment exposure had an amortized cost and fair value of $3.4 billion and
$3.6 billion, respectively, or 5% of total invested assets; as of december 31, 2015, amortized cost and fair value totaled $4.2 billion and $4.3 billion, respectively. the investment exposure largely relates to corporate entities which are domiciled in or generate a significant portion of their revenue within the united kingdom, the netherlands, germany and switzerland. the company does not hold any sovereign exposure to the peripheral region and does not hold any exposure to issuers in greece. as of both december 31, 2016 and 2015, the weighted average credit quality of european investments was a-. entities domiciled in the united kingdom comprise the company's largest exposure; as of december 31, 2016 and 2015, the u.k. exposure totals less than 2% of total invested assets and largely relates to industrial and financial services corporate securities and has an average credit rating of bbb+. the majority of the european investments are u.s. dollar-denominated, and those securities that are british pound or euro-denominated are hedged to u.s. dollars. for a discussion of foreign currency risks, see the foreign currency exchange risk section of this md&a.

available-for-sale securities - unrealized loss aging the total gross unrealized losses were $525 as of december 31, 2016, and have decreased $174, or 25%, from december 31, 2015, due to tighter credit spreads, partially offset by higher interest rates. as of december 31, 2016, $502 of the gross unrealized losses were associated with securities depressed less than 20% of cost or amortized cost. the remaining $23 of gross unrealized losses were associated with securities depressed greater than 20%. the securities depressed more than 20% are primarily securities with exposure to commercial real estate and corporate securities which are depressed primarily due to wider credit spreads since the securities were purchased.
as part of the company's ongoing security monitoring process, the company has reviewed its afs securities in an unrealized loss position and concluded that these securities are temporarily depressed and are expected to recover in value as the securities approach maturity or as market spreads tighten. for these securities in an unrealized loss position where a credit impairment has not been recorded, the company's best estimate of expected future cash flows are sufficient to recover the amortized cost basis of the security. furthermore, the company neither has an intention to sell nor does it expect to be required to sell these securities. for further information regarding the company's impairment analysis, see other-than-temporary impairments in the investment portfolio risks and risk management section of this md&a.

future impairments may develop as the result of changes in intent-to-sell specific securities or if actual results underperform current modeling assumptions, which may be the result of, but are not limited to, macroeconomic factors and security-specific performance below current expectations.
for the year ended december 31, 2015, impairments recognized in earnings were comprised of intent-to-sell impairments of $54 and credit impairments of $29, both of which were primarily concentrated in corporate securities. also, impairments recognized in earnings included impairments on equity securities of $16 that were in an unrealized loss position and the company no longer believed the securities would recover in the foreseeable future, as well as $3 of other impairments.
for the year ended december 31, 2014, impairments recognized in earnings were comprised of credit impairments of $37, primarily concentrated in corporate securities. also, included were impairments on debt securities for which the company had the intent-to-sell of $17, primarily related to equity, afs securities. in addition, impairments recognized in earnings included impairments on equity securities of $2 that were in an unrealized loss position and the company no longer believed the securities would recover in the foreseeable future.

liquidity requirements and sources of capital the hartford financial services group, inc. (holding company)
the liquidity requirements of the holding company of the hartford financial services group, inc. ("hfsg holding company") have been and will continue to be met by hfsg holding company's fixed maturities, short-term investments and cash, and dividends from its subsidiaries, principally its insurance operations, as well as the issuance of common stock, debt or other capital securities and borrowings from its credit facilities, as needed.
as of december 31, 2016, hfsg holding company held fixed maturities, short-term investments and cash of $1.2 billion. expected liquidity requirements of the hfsg holding company for the next twelve months include payments of 5.375% notes, due 2017 of $416 at maturity, interest payments on debt of approximately $320 and common stockholder dividends, subject to discretion of the board of directors, of approximately $340.
the hartford has an intercompany liquidity agreement that allows for short-term advances of funds among the hfsg holding company and certain affiliates of up to $2 billion for liquidity and other general corporate purposes. the connecticut insurance department ("ctdoi") granted approval for certain affiliated insurance companies that are parties to the agreement to treat receivables from a parent, including the hfsg holding company, as admitted assets for statutory accounting purposes. as of december 31, 2016, there were no amounts outstanding from the hfsg holding company.
debt on october 17, 2016, the company repaid its $275, 5.5% senior notes at maturity.
on february 15, 2017, pursuant to the put option agreement with the glen meadow abc trust, the company issued $500 junior subordinated notes with a scheduled maturity of february 12, 2047, and a final maturity of february 12, 2067. the junior subordinated notes bear interest at an annual rate of three-month libor plus 2.125%, payable quarterly. the hartford will have the right, on one or more occasions, to defer interest payments due on the junior subordinated notes under specified circumstances. the company expects to use the proceeds to fund the call of $500 in 8.125% junior subordinated debentures that are due 2068 and that are first callable in june 2018. as such, the proceeds of the $500 of junior subordinated notes issued under the contingent capital facility will be held at the holding company until june of 2018, resulting in an increase in debt to capital ratios during that time.
for further information regarding debt, see note 13 - debt of notes to consolidated financial statements.
intercompany liquidity agreements on january 5, 2017, hartford fire insurance company, a subsidiary of the company, issued a revolving note (the "note") in the principal amount of $230 to hartford accident and indemnity company, an indirectly wholly-owned subsidiary of the company, under the intercompany liquidity agreement. the note was issued to fund the liquidity needs associated with the $650
part ii - item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ceded premium paid in january 2017 for the adverse development cover with nico. the note bears interest at 1.85% and matures on december 29, 2017.
equity in october 2016, the board of directors authorized a new equity repurchase program for $1.3 billion for the period commencing october 31, 2016 through december 31, 2017. the $1.3 billion authorization is in addition to the company's prior authorization for $4.375 billion, which was completed by december 31, 2016. as of december 31, 2016, the company had $1.3 billion remaining under its new equity repurchase program. any repurchase of shares under the equity repurchase program is dependent on market conditions and other factors.
during the year ended december 31, 2016, the company repurchased 30.8 million common shares for $1,330. during the period january 1, 2017 through february 22, 2017, the company repurchased 4.0 million common shares for $192.
dividends on february 23, 2017, the hartford's board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.23 per common share payable on april 3, 2017 to common shareholders of record as of march 6, 2017. there are no current restrictions on the hfsg holding company's ability to pay dividends to its shareholders. for a discussion of restrictions on dividends to the hfsg holding company from its insurance subsidiaries, see "dividends from insurance subsidiaries" below. for a discussion of potential limitations on the hfsg holding company's ability to pay dividends, see part i, item 1a, - risk factors for the risk factor "our ability to declare and pay dividends is subject to limitations" .
pension plans and other postretirement benefits while the company has significant discretion in making voluntary contributions to the u. s. qualified defined benefit pension plan, minimum contributions are mandated in certain circumstances pursuant to the employee retirement income security act of 1974, as amended by the pension protection act of 2006, the worker, retiree, and employer recovery act of 2008, the preservation of access to care for medicare beneficiaries and pension relief act of 2010, the moving ahead for progress in the 21st century act of 2012 (map-21) and internal revenue code regulations. the company made contributions to the u. s. qualified defined benefit pension plan of approximately $300, $100 and $100 in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. no contributions were made to the other postretirement plans in 2016, 2015 and 2014. the company's 2016, 2015 and 2014 required minimum funding contributions were immaterial. the company does not have a 2017 required minimum funding contribution for the u.s. qualified defined benefit pension plan and the funding requirements for all pension plans are expected to be immaterial. the company has not determined whether, and to what extent, contributions may be made to the u. s. qualified defined benefit pension plan in 2017. the company will monitor the funded status of the u.s. qualified defined benefit pension plan during 2017 to make this determination.
beginning in 2017, the company will use a full yield-curve approach in the estimation of the interest cost component of net periodic benefit costs for its qualified and non-qualified pension plans and the postretirement benefit plan. the full yield curve approach applies the specific spot rates along the yield curve that are used in its determination of the projected benefit obligation at the beginning of the year. the change is being made to provide a better estimate of the interest cost component of net periodic benefit cost by better aligning projected benefit cash flows with corresponding spot rates on the yield curve rather than using a single weighted average discount rate derived from the yield curve as had been done historically.
this change does not affect the measurement of the company's total benefit obligations as the change in the interest cost in net income is completely offset in the actuarial (gain) loss reported for the period in other comprehensive income. the change will result in a reduction of the interest cost component of net periodic benefit cost for 2017 of $37 before tax. the discount rate that will be used to measure interest cost during 2017 is 3.58%, 3.55% and 3.13% for the qualified pension plan, non-qualified pension plan and postretirement benefit plan, respectively. under the company's historical estimation approach, the weighted average discount rate for the interest cost component would have been 4.22%, 4.19% and 3.97% for the qualified pension plan, non-qualified pension plan and postretirement benefit plan, respectively. the company will account for the change in estimation approach as a change in estimate, and accordingly, will recognize the effect prospectively beginning in 2017.
dividends from insurance subsidiaries dividends to the hfsg holding company from its insurance subsidiaries are restricted by insurance regulation. the payment of dividends by connecticut-domiciled insurers is limited under the insurance holding company laws of connecticut. these laws require notice to and approval by the state insurance commissioner for the declaration or payment of any dividend, which, together with other dividends or distributions made within the preceding twelve months, exceeds the greater of (i) 10% of the insurer's policyholder surplus as of december 31 of the preceding year or (ii) net income (or net gain from operations, if such company is a life insurance company) for the twelve-month period ending on the thirty-first day of december last preceding, in each case determined under statutory insurance accounting principles. the insurance holding company laws of the other jurisdictions in which the hartford's insurance subsidiaries are domiciled or deemed commercially domiciled under applicable state insurance laws contain similar or in certain state(s) more restrictive limitations on the payment of dividends. in addition, if any dividend of a domiciled insurer exceeds the insurer's earned surplus or certain other thresholds as calculated under applicable state insurance law, the dividend requires the prior approval of the domestic regulator. dividends paid to hfsg holding company by its life insurance subsidiaries are further dependent on cash requirements of hartford life, inc. ("hli") and other factors. in addition to statutory limitations on paying dividends, the company also takes other items into consideration when determining dividends from subsidiaries. these considerations include, but are not limited to, expected earnings and capitalization of the subsidiary, regulatory capital requirements and liquidity requirements of the individual operating company.
during 2016, hfsg holding company received approximately $1.2 billion in dividends from its property and casualty insurance subsidiaries. dividends received from its property-casualty subsidiaries included approximately $440 funded through principal and interest payments on an intercompany note paid by
part ii - item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations hartford holdings, inc. ("hhi") to hartford fire insurance company. in addition to the property and casualty insurance subsidiaries dividends, hfsg holding company received approximately $1 billion through a series of transactions with hli's life insurance subsidiaries.
2017 dividend capacity
•   p&amp;c - the company's property and casualty insurance subsidiaries are permitted to pay up to a maximum of approximately $1.5 billion in dividends to hfsg holding company without prior approval from the applicable insurance commissioner. in 2017, hfsg holding company anticipates receiving net dividends of approximately $850 from its property and casualty insurance subsidiaries.
•   group benefits - hartford life and accident insurance company ("hla") is permitted to pay up to a maximum of $207 in dividends without prior approval from the insurance commissioner. in 2017, hfsg holding company anticipates receiving dividends of approximately $250 from hla, subject to regulatory approval.
•   talcott resolution - hartford life insurance company ("hlic") is permitted to pay up to a maximum of $1 billion in dividends to hfsg holding company without prior approval from the insurance commissioner. however, to meet the liquidity needed to pay dividends up to the hfsg holding company, hlic may require receiving regulatory approval for extraordinary dividends from hlic's wholly-owned subsidiary, hartford life and annuity insurance company. on january 30, 2017, hartford life insurance company paid a dividend of $300. hfsg holding company anticipates receiving an additional $300 of dividends from hlic during 2017.
other sources of capital for the hfsg holding company the hartford endeavors to maintain a capital structure that provides financial and operational flexibility to its insurance subsidiaries, ratings that support its competitive position in the financial services marketplace (see the "ratings" section below for further discussion), and shareholder returns. as a result, the company may from time to time raise capital from the issuance of equity, equity-related debt or other capital securities and is continuously evaluating strategic opportunities. the issuance of debt, common equity, equity-related debt or other capital securities could result in the dilution of shareholder interests or reduced net income due to additional interest expense.
shelf registrations on july 29, 2016, the hartford filed with the securities and exchange commission (the "sec") an automatic shelf registration statement (registration no. 333-212778) for the potential offering and sale of debt and equity securities. the registration statement allows for the following types of securities to be offered: debt securities, junior subordinated debt securities, preferred stock, common stock, depositary shares, warrants, stock purchase contracts, and stock purchase units. in that the hartford is a well-known seasoned issuer, as defined in rule 405 under the securities act of 1933, the registration statement went effective immediately upon filing and the hartford may offer and sell an unlimited amount of securities under the registration statement during the three-year life of the registration statement.
contingent capital facility the hartford is party to a put option agreement that provides the hartford with the right to require the glen meadow abc trust, a delaware statutory trust, at any time and from time to time, to purchase the hartford's junior subordinated notes in a maximum aggregate principal amount not to exceed $500. on february 8, 2017, the hartford exercised the put option resulting in the issuance of $500 in junior subordinated notes with proceeds received on february 15, 2017. under the put option agreement, the hartford had been paying the glen meadow abc trust premiums on a periodic basis, calculated with respect to the aggregate principal amount of notes that the hartford had the right to put to the glen meadow abc trust for such period. the hartford has agreed to reimburse the glen meadow abc trust for certain fees and ordinary expenses. the company holds a variable interest in the glen meadow abc trust where the company is not the primary beneficiary. as a result, the company does not consolidate the glen meadow abc trust.
the junior subordinated notes have a scheduled maturity of february 12, 2047, and a final maturity of february 12, 2067. the company is required to use reasonable efforts to sell certain qualifying replacement securities in order to repay the debentures at the scheduled maturity date. the junior subordinated notes bear interest at an annual rate of three-month libor plus 2.125%, payable quarterly, and are unsecured, subordinated indebtedness of the hartford. the hartford will have the right, on one or more occasions, to defer interest payments due on the junior subordinated notes under specified circumstances.
upon receipt of the proceeds, the company entered into a replacement capital covenant (the "rcc"). under the terms of the rcc, if the company redeems the debentures at any time prior to february 12, 2047 (or such earlier date on which the rcc terminates by its terms) it can only do so with the proceeds from the sale of certain qualifying replacement securities. the rcc also prohibits the company from redeeming all or any portion of the notes on or prior to february 15, 2022.
commercial paper and revolving credit facility commercial paper the hartford's maximum borrowings available under its commercial paper program are $1 billion. the company is dependent upon market conditions to access short-term financing through the issuance of commercial paper to investors. as of december 31, 2016 there was no commercial paper outstanding.
revolving credit facilities the company has a senior unsecured five-year revolving credit facility (the "credit facility") that provides for borrowing capacity up to $1 billion of unsecured credit through october 31, 2019 available in u.s. dollars, euro, sterling, canadian dollars and japanese yen. as of december 31, 2016, no borrowings were outstanding under the credit facility. as of december 31, 2016, the company was in compliance with all financial covenants within the credit facility.
part ii - item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations derivative commitments certain of the company's derivative agreements contain provisions that are tied to the financial strength ratings, as set by nationally recognized statistical rating agencies, of the individual legal entity that entered into the derivative agreement. if the legal entity's financial strength were to fall below certain ratings, the counterparties to the derivative agreements could demand immediate and ongoing full collateralization and in certain instances demand immediate settlement of all outstanding derivative positions traded under each impacted bilateral agreement. the settlement amount is determined by netting the derivative positions transacted under each agreement. if the termination rights were to be exercised by the counterparties, it could impact the legal entity's ability to conduct hedging activities by increasing the associated costs and decreasing the willingness of counterparties to transact with the legal entity. the aggregate fair value of all derivative instruments with credit-risk-related contingent features that are in a net liability position as of december 31, 2016 was $1.4 billion. of this $1.4 billion, the legal entities have posted collateral of $1.7 billion in the normal course of business. in addition, the company has posted collateral of $31 associated with a customized gmwb derivative. based on derivative market values as of december 31, 2016, a downgrade of one level below the current financial strength ratings by either moody's or s&p would not require additional assets to be posted as collateral. based on derivative market values as of december 31, 2016, a downgrade of two levels below the current financial strength ratings by either moody's or s&p would require additional $10 of assets to be posted as collateral. these collateral amounts could change as derivative market values change, as a result of changes in our hedging activities or to the extent changes in contractual terms are negotiated. the nature of the collateral that we would post, if required, would be primarily in the form of u.s. treasury bills, u.s. treasury notes and government agency securities.
as of december 31, 2016, the aggregate notional amount and fair value of derivative relationships that could be subject to immediate termination in the event of a downgrade of one level below the current financial strength ratings was $1.1 billion and $23, respectively. these amounts could change as derivative market values change, as a result of changes in our hedging activities or to the extent changes in contractual terms are negotiated.
insurance operations while subject to variability period to period, claim frequency and severity patterns and the level of policy surrenders continue to be within historical norms and, therefore, the company's insurance operations' current liquidity position is considered to be sufficient to meet anticipated demands over the next twelve months. for a discussion and tabular presentation of the company's current contractual obligations by period, refer to off-balance sheet arrangements and aggregate contractual obligations within the capital resources and liquidity section of the md&a.
the principal sources of operating funds are premiums, fees earned from assets under management and investment income, while investing cash flows originate from maturities and sales of invested assets. the primary uses of funds are to pay claims, claim adjustment expenses, commissions and other underwriting expenses, taxes, to purchase new investments and to make dividend payments to the hfsg holding company.
the company's insurance operations consist of property and casualty insurance products (collectively referred to as "property & casualty operations") and life insurance and legacy annuity products (collectively referred to as "life operations").
property & casualty operations property & casualty operations holds fixed maturity securities including a significant short-term investment position (securities with maturities of one year or less at the time of purchase) to meet liquidity needs.
fixed maturities                    $24,488
short-term investments                1,162
liquidity requirements that are unable to be funded by property & casualty operation's short-term investments would be satisfied with current operating funds, including premiums received or through the sale of invested assets. a sale of invested assets could result in significant realized capital losses.
life operations life operations' total general account contractholder obligations are supported by $40 billion of cash and total general account invested assets, which included a significant short-term investment position to meet liquidity needs.
fixed maturities                    $30,956
short-term investments                1,751
capital resources available to fund liquidity upon contractholder surrender or termination are a function of the legal entity in which the liquidity requirement resides. generally, obligations of group benefits will be funded by hartford life and accident insurance company. obligations of talcott resolution will generally be funded by hartford life insurance company and hartford life and annuity insurance company.
hlic, an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary, is a member of the federal home loan bank of boston ("fhlbb"). membership allows hlic access to collateralized advances, which may be used to support various spread-based businesses and enhance liquidity management. fhlbb membership requires the company to own member stock and advances require the purchase of activity stock. the amount of advances that can be taken are dependent on the asset types pledged to secure the advances. the ctdoi will permit hlic to pledge up to $1.1 billion in qualifying assets to
part ii - item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations secure fhlbb advances for 2017. the pledge limit is recalculated annually based on statutory admitted assets and capital and surplus. hlic would need to seek the prior approval of the ctdoi in order to exceed these limits. as of december 31, 2016, hlic had no advances outstanding under the fhlbb facility.

[1]   in the event customers elect to surrender separate account assets, life operations will use the proceeds from the sale of the assets to fund the surrender, and life operations' liquidity position will not be impacted. in some instances life operations will receive a percentage of the surrender amount as compensation for early surrender (surrender charge), increasing life operations' liquidity position. in addition, a surrender of variable annuity separate account or general account assets (see the following) will decrease life operations' obligation for payments on guaranteed living and death benefits.
[2]   relates to contracts such as payout annuities, institutional notes, term life, group benefit contracts, or death and living benefit reserves, which cannot be surrendered for cash.
[3]   relates to annuities that are recorded in the general account under u.s. gaap as the contractholders are subject to the company's credit risk, although these annuities are held in a statutory separate account. in the statutory separate account, life operations is required to maintain invested assets with a fair value greater than or equal to the mva surrender value of the fixed mva contract. in the event assets decline in value at a greater rate than the mva surrender value of the fixed mva contract, life operations is required to contribute additional capital to the statutory separate account. life operations will fund these required contributions with operating cash flows or short-term investments. in the event that operating cash flows or short-term investments are not sufficient to fund required contributions, the company may have to sell other invested assets at a loss, potentially resulting in a decrease in statutory surplus. as the fair value of invested assets in the statutory separate account are at least equal to the mva surrender value of the fixed mva contract, surrender of fixed mva annuities will have an insignificant impact on the liquidity requirements of life operations.
[4]   surrenders of, or policy loans taken from, as applicable, these general account liabilities, which include the general account option for life operations' individual variable annuities and the variable life contracts of the former individual life business, the general account option for annuities of the former retirement plans business and universal life contracts sold by the former individual life business, may be funded through operating cash flows of life operations, available short-term investments, or life operations may be required to sell fixed maturity investments to fund the surrender payment. sales of fixed maturity investments could result in the recognition of realized losses and insufficient proceeds to fully fund the surrender amount. in this circumstance, life operations may need to take other actions, including enforcing certain contract provisions which could restrict surrenders and/or slow or defer payouts. the company has ceded reinsurance in connection with the sales of its retirement plans and individual life businesses to massmutual and prudential, respectively. these reinsurance transactions do not extinguish the company's primary liability on the insurance policies issued under these businesses.
off-balance sheet arrangements and aggregate contractual obligations the company does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that are reasonably likely to have a material effect on the financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, or capital resources of the company, except for the contingent capital facility described above, as well as unfunded commitments to purchase investments in limited partnerships and other alternative investments, private placements, and mortgage loans as disclosed in note 14 - commitments and contingencies of notes to consolidated financial statements.

[1]   the following points are significant to understanding the cash flows estimated for obligations (gross of reinsurance) under property and casualty contracts:
•   reserves for property &amp; casualty unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses include ibnr and case reserves. while payments due on claim reserves are considered contractual obligations because they relate to insurance policies issued by the company, the ultimate amount to be paid to settle both case reserves and ibnr is an estimate, subject to significant uncertainty. the actual amount to be paid is not finally determined until the company reaches a settlement with the claimant. final claim settlements may vary significantly from the present estimates, particularly since many claims will not be settled until well into the future.
•   in estimating the timing of future payments by year, the company has assumed that its historical payment patterns will continue. however, the actual timing of future payments could vary materially from these estimates due to, among other things, changes in claim reporting and payment patterns and large unanticipated settlements. in particular, there is significant uncertainty over the claim payment patterns of asbestos and environmental claims. in addition, the table does not include future cash flows related to the receipt of premiums that may be used, in part, to fund loss payments.
•   under u.s. gaap, the company is only permitted to discount reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses in cases where the payment pattern and ultimate loss costs are fixed and determinable on an individual claim basis. for the company, these include claim settlements with permanently disabled claimants. as of december 31, 2016, the total property and casualty reserves in the above table are gross of a reserve discount of $483.
[2]   estimated life, annuity and disability obligations (gross of reinsurance) include death and disability claims, policy surrenders, policyholder dividends and trail commissions offset by expected future deposits and premiums on in-force contracts. estimated life, annuity and disability obligations are based on mortality, morbidity and lapse assumptions comparable with the company's historical experience, modified for recent observed trends. the company has also assumed market growth and interest crediting consistent with other assumptions. in contrast to this table, the majority of the company's obligations are recorded on the balance sheet at the current account values and do not incorporate an expectation of future market growth, interest crediting, or future deposits. therefore, the estimated obligations presented in this table significantly exceed the liabilities recorded in reserve for future policy benefits and unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, other policyholder funds and benefits payable, and separate account liabilities. due to the significance of the assumptions used, the amounts presented could materially differ from actual results.
[3]   includes future minimum lease payments on operating lease agreements. see note 14 - commitments and contingencies of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion on lease commitments.
[4]   includes contractual principal and interest payments. see note 13 - debt of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of long-term debt obligations.
[5]   includes $1.6 billion in commitments to purchase investments including approximately $1.2 billion of limited partnership and other alternative investments, $313 of private placements, and $95 of mortgage loans. outstanding commitments under these limited partnerships and mortgage loans are included in payments due in less than 1 year since the timing of funding these commitments cannot be reliably estimated. the remaining commitments to purchase investments primarily represent payables for securities purchased which are reflected on the company's consolidated balance sheets. also included in purchase obligations is $962 relating to contractual commitments to purchase various goods and services such as maintenance, human resources, and information technology in the normal course of business. purchase obligations exclude contracts that are cancelable without penalty or contracts that do not specify minimum levels of goods or services to be purchased.
[6]   includes cash collateral of $387 which the company has accepted in connection with the company's derivative instruments. since the timing of the return of the collateral is uncertain, the return of the collateral has been included in the payments due in less than 1 year. also included in other long-term liabilities are net unrecognized tax benefits of $12, retained yen denominated fixed payout annuity liabilities of $540, and consumer notes of $21. consumer notes include principal payments and contractual interest for fixed rate notes and interest based on current rates for floating rate notes.

ratings ratings are an important factor in establishing a competitive position in the insurance marketplace and impact the company's ability to access financing and its cost of borrowing. there can be no assurance that the company's ratings will continue for any given period of time, or that they will not be changed. in the event the company's ratings are downgraded, the company's competitive position, ability to access financing, and its cost of borrowing, may be adversely impacted.

the agencies consider many factors in determining the final rating of an insurance company. one consideration is the relative level of statutory capital and surplus (referred to collectively as "statutory capital") necessary to support the business written and is reported in accordance with accounting practices prescribed by the applicable state insurance department. see part i, item 1a. risk factors - "downgrades in our financial strength or credit ratings may make our products less attractive, increase our cost of capital and inhibit our ability to refinance our debt."
statutory capital statutory capital for the company's insurance subsidiaries as of december 31,
life insurance subsidiaries - statutory ("stat") capital for the life insurance subsidiaries decreased by $569, primarily due to dividends of approximately $1 billion, and decreases in admitted deferred income tax of $213, partially offset by non-variable annuity net income of $215 as well as variable annuity net income and surplus impacts of $342 and $(89), respectively, included in talcott resolution, and other increases in surplus of $165.
p&c insurance subsidiaries - statutory capital for the property and casualty insurance subsidiaries decreased by $302, primarily due to dividends to the hfsg holding company of $1.2 billion, partially offset by an increase in net unrealized gains on investments of $530, statutory net income of $304 and an increase in deferred tax assets of $147.
stat to gaap differences significant differences between u.s. gaap stockholders' equity and aggregate statutory capital prepared in accordance with u.s. stat include the following:
•   u.s. stat excludes equity of non-insurance and foreign insurance subsidiaries not held by u.s. insurance subsidiaries.
•   costs incurred by the company to acquire insurance policies are deferred under u.s. gaap while those costs are expensed immediately under u.s. stat.
•   temporary differences between the book and tax basis of an asset or liability which are recorded as deferred tax assets are evaluated for recoverability under u.s. gaap while those amounts deferred are subject to limitations under u.s. stat.
•   the assumptions used in the determination of life benefit reserves are prescribed under u.s. stat, while the assumptions used under u.s. gaap are generally the company's best estimates. the methodologies for determining life insurance reserve amounts are also different. for example, reserving for living benefit reserves under u.s. stat is generally addressed by the commissioners' annuity reserving valuation methodology and the related actuarial guidelines, while under u.s. gaap, those same living benefits are either embedded derivatives recorded at fair value or are recorded as additional minimum guarantee benefit reserves. the sensitivity of these life insurance reserves to changes in equity markets, as applicable, will be different between u.s. gaap and u.s. stat.
•   the difference between the amortized cost and fair value of fixed maturity and other investments, net of tax, is recorded as an increase or decrease to the carrying value of the related asset and to equity under u.s. gaap, while u.s. stat only records certain securities at fair value, such as equity securities and certain lower rated bonds required by the naic to be recorded at the lower of amortized cost or fair value.
•   u.s. stat for life insurance companies establishes a formula reserve for realized and unrealized losses due to default and equity risks associated with certain invested assets (the asset valuation reserve), while u.s. gaap does not. also, for those realized gains and losses caused by changes in interest rates, u.s. stat for life insurance companies defers and amortizes the gains and losses, caused by changes in interest rates, into income over the original life to maturity of the asset sold (the interest maintenance reserve) while u.s. gaap does not.
•   goodwill arising from the acquisition of a business is tested for recoverability on an annual basis (or more frequently, as necessary) for u.s. gaap, while under u.s. stat goodwill is amortized over a period not to exceed 10 years and the amount of goodwill admitted as an asset is limited.
in addition, certain assets, including a portion of premiums receivable and fixed assets, are non-admitted (recorded at zero value and charged against surplus) under u.s. stat. u.s. gaap generally evaluates assets based on their recoverability.
risk-based capital the company's u.s. insurance companies' states of domicile impose rbc requirements. the requirements provide a means of measuring the minimum amount of statutory capital appropriate for an insurance company to support its overall business operations based on its size and risk profile. regulatory compliance is determined by a ratio of a company's total adjusted capital ("tac") to its authorized control level rbc ("acl rbc"). companies below specific trigger points or ratios are classified within certain levels, each of which requires specified corrective action. the minimum level of tac before corrective action commences ("company action level") is two times the acl rbc. the adequacy of a company's capital is determined by the ratio of a company's tac to its company action level, known as the "rbc ratio". all of the company's operating insurance subsidiaries had rbc ratios in excess of the minimum levels required by the applicable insurance regulations. on an aggregate basis, the company's u.s. property and casualty insurance companies' rbc ratio was in excess of 200% of its company action level as of december 31, 2016 and 2015. the rbc ratios for the company's principal life insurance operating subsidiaries were all in excess of 400% of their respective company action levels as of december 31, 2016 and 2015. the reporting of rbc ratios is not intended for the purpose of ranking any insurance company, or for use in
part ii - item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations connection with any marketing, advertising or promotional activities.
similar to the rbc ratios that are employed by u.s. insurance regulators, regulatory authorities in the international jurisdictions in which the company operates generally establish minimum solvency requirements for insurance companies. all of the hartford's international insurance subsidiaries have solvency margins in excess of the minimum levels required by the applicable regulatory authorities.
sensitivity in any particular year, statutory capital amounts and rbc ratios may increase or decrease depending upon a variety of factors. the amount of change in the statutory capital or rbc ratios can vary based on individual factors and may be compounded in extreme scenarios or if multiple factors occur at the same time. at times the impact of changes in certain market factors or a combination of multiple factors on rbc ratios can be counterintuitive. for further discussion on these factors and the potential impacts to the life insurance subsidiaries, see md&a - enterprise risk management, financial risk on statutory capital.
statutory capital at the property and casualty subsidiaries has historically been maintained at or above the capital level required to meet "aa level" ratings from rating agencies. statutory capital generated by the property and casualty subsidiaries in excess of the capital level required to meet "aa level" ratings is available for use by the enterprise or for corporate purposes. the amount of statutory capital can increase or decrease depending on a number of factors affecting property and casualty results including, among other factors, the level of catastrophe claims incurred, the amount of reserve development, the effect of changes in interest rates on investment income and the discounting of loss reserves, and the effect of realized gains and losses on investments.
contingencies legal proceedings for a discussion regarding contingencies related to the hartford's legal proceedings, please see the information contained under "litigation" and "asbestos and environmental claims," in note 14 - commitments and contingencies of the notes to consolidated financial statements and part ii, item 1 legal proceedings, which are incorporated herein by reference.
legislative and regulatory developments patient protection and affordable care act of 2010 (the "affordable care act") the outcome of the new administration's stated intention to repeal and replace the affordable care act may have an impact on various aspects of our business, including our insurance businesses. it is unclear what a replacement of the affordable care act would entail, and to what extent there may be a transition period for the phase out of the affordable care act. the impact to the hartford as an employer is consistent with other large employers. the hartford's core business does not involve the issuance of health insurance, and we have not observed any material impacts on the company's workers' compensation business or group benefits business. we will continue to monitor the impact of the affordable care act and any reforms on consumer, broker and medical provider behavior for leading indicators of changes in medical costs or loss payments primarily on the company's workers' compensation and disability liabilities.
united states department of labor fiduciary rule on april 6, 2016, the u.s. department of labor ("dol") issued a final regulation that expands the range of activities considered to be fiduciary investment advice under the employee retirement income security act of 1974 ("erisa") and the internal revenue code.  implementation will be phased in, with the regulation in full effect by january 1, 2018. the impact of the new regulation on our mutual funds business is difficult to assess because the regulation is new and is still being studied. while we continue to analyze the regulation, we believe the regulation may impact the compensation paid to the financial intermediaries who sell our mutual funds to their retirement clients and could negatively impact our mutual funds business.
in 2016, several plaintiffs, including insurers and industry groups such as the u.s. chamber of commerce and the securities industry and financial markets association ("sifma"), filed lawsuits against the dol challenging the constitutionality of the fiduciary rule and the dol's rulemaking authority. in most cases, the district courts have entered a summary judgment in favor of the dol. it is unclear whether the plaintiffs will appeal. we continue to monitor the potential effects of case law and the regulatory landscape on our mutual funds business.
tax reform tax proposals and regulatory initiatives which have been or are being considered by congress and/or the united states treasury department could have a material effect on the company and its insurance businesses. these proposals and initiatives include, or could include, changes pertaining to the income tax treatment of insurance companies and life insurance products and annuities, repeal or reform of the estate tax and comprehensive federal tax reform, and changes to the regulatory structure for financial institutions. the nature and timing of any congressional or regulatory action with respect to any such efforts is unclear. for additional information on risks to the company related to tax reform, please see the risk factor entitled "changes in federal or state tax laws could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity" under "risk factors" in part i.

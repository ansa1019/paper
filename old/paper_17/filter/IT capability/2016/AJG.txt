item 1a. risk factors.
risks relating to our business generally an overall economic downturn, as well as unstable economic conditions in the countries and regions in which we operate, could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
an overall decline in economic activity could adversely impact us in future years as a result of reductions in the overall amount of insurance coverage that our clients purchase due to reductions in their headcount, payroll, properties, and the market values of assets, among other factors. such reductions could also adversely impact future commission revenues when the carriers perform exposure audits if they lead to subsequent downward premium adjustments. we record the income effects of subsequent premium adjustments when the adjustments become known and, as a result, any improvement in our results of operations and financial condition may lag an improvement in the economy. in addition, some of our clients may experience liquidity problems or other financial difficulties in the event of a prolonged deterioration in the economy, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. if our clients become financially less stable, enter bankruptcy, liquidate their operations or consolidate, our revenues and collectability of receivables could be adversely affected. our growing operations in countries and regions undergoing economic downturns, particularly in the u.k., australia and certain emerging markets, expose us to risks and uncertainties that could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. in addition, some of our clients may experience liquidity problems or other financial difficulties in the event of a prolonged deterioration in the economy, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. for example, approximately 20% of our brokerage segment and approximately 3% of our risk management segment revenues came from the u.k. in 2016. in a referendum held on june 23, 2016, a majority of voters in the u.k. voted in favor of the u.k. leaving the european union. this vote to leave has created significant uncertainty regarding the u.k. economic outlook, and could lead to a decline in economic activity, a recession, or reduced future growth prospects in the u.k., any of which could damage our clients confidence and materially and adversely affect our business.
economic conditions that result in financial difficulties for insurance companies or reduced insurer capacity could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
we have a significant amount of trade accounts receivable from some of the insurance companies with which we place insurance. if those insurance companies experience liquidity problems or other financial difficulties, we could encounter delays or defaults in payments owed to us, which could have a significant adverse impact on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations. the failure of an insurer with whom we place business could result in errors and omissions claims against us by our clients, and the failure of errors and omissions insurance carriers could make the errors and omissions insurance we rely upon cost prohibitive or unavailable, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. in addition, if carriers merge or if a large carrier fails or withdraws from offering certain lines of coverage, overall underwriting capacity could be negatively affected, which could reduce our ability to place certain lines of coverage and, as a result, reduce our revenues and profitability.
volatility or declines in premiums or other adverse trends in the insurance industry may seriously undermine our profitability.
we derive much of our revenue from commissions and fees for our brokerage services. we do not determine the insurance premiums on which our commissions are generally based. moreover, insurance premiums are cyclical in nature and may vary widely based on market conditions. because of market cycles for insurance product pricing, which we cannot predict or control, our brokerage revenues and profitability can be volatile or remain depressed for significant periods of time.
as traditional risk-bearing insurance companies continue to outsource the production of premium revenue to non-affiliated brokers or agents such as us, those insurance companies may seek to further minimize their expenses by reducing the commission rates payable to insurance agents or brokers. the reduction of these commission rates, along with general volatility and/or declines in premiums, may significantly affect our profitability. because we do not determine the timing or extent of premium pricing changes, it is difficult to precisely forecast our commission revenues, including whether they will significantly decline. as a result, we may have to adjust our budgets for future acquisitions, capital expenditures, dividend payments, loan repayments and other expenditures to account for unexpected changes in revenues, and any decreases in premium rates may adversely affect the results of our operations.
in addition, there have been and may continue to be various trends in the insurance industry toward alternative insurance markets including, among other things, greater levels of self-insurance, captives, rent-a-captives, risk retention groups and non-insurance capital markets-based solutions to traditional insurance. while, historically, we have been able to participate in certain of these activities on behalf of our customers and obtain fee revenue for such services, there can be no assurance that we will realize revenues and profitability as favorable as those realized from our traditional brokerage activities. our ability to generate premium-based commission revenue may also be challenged by the growing desire of some clients to compensate brokers based upon flat fees rather than variable commission rates. this could negatively impact us because fees are generally not indexed for inflation and do not automatically increase with premium as does commission-based compensation.
a portion of our revenues consists of contingent and supplemental commissions we receive from insurance companies. contingent commissions are paid by insurance companies based upon the profitability, volume and/or growth of the business placed with such companies during the prior year. supplemental commissions are commissions paid by insurance companies that are established annually in advance based on historical performance criteria. if, due to the current economic environment or for any other reason, we are unable to meet insurance companies profitability, volume or growth thresholds, or insurance companies increase their estimate of loss reserves (over which we have no control), actual contingent commissions or supplemental commissions we receive could be less than anticipated, which could adversely affect our results of operations.
we face significant competitive pressures in each of our businesses.
the insurance brokerage and service business is highly competitive and many insurance brokerage and service organizations actively compete with us in one or more areas of our business around the world. we compete with three firms in the global risk management and brokerage markets, which have revenues significantly larger than ours. in addition, various other competing firms that operate nationally or that are strong in a particular country, region or locality may have, in that country, region or locality, an office with revenues as large as or larger than those of our corresponding local office. our third party claims administration operation also faces significant competition from stand-alone firms as well as divisions of larger firms.
the primary factors in determining our competitive position with other organizations in our industry are the quality of the services rendered and the overall costs to our clients. losing business to competitors offering similar products at lower prices or having other competitive advantages would adversely affect our business.
in addition, any increase in competition due to new legislative or industry developments could adversely affect us. these developments include:
   increased capital-raising by insurance underwriting companies, which could result in new capital in the industry, which in turn may lead to lower insurance premiums and commissions;
   insurance companies selling insurance directly to insureds without the involvement of a broker or other intermediary;
   federal and state governments establishing programs to provide health insurance or, in certain cases, property insurance in catastrophe-prone areas or other alternative market types of coverage, that compete with, or completely replace, insurance products offered by insurance carriers; and
   increased competition from new market participants such as banks, accounting firms, consulting firms and internet or other technology firms offering risk management or insurance brokerage services, or new distribution channels for insurance such as payroll firms.
new competition as a result of these or other competitive or industry developments could cause the demand for our products and services to decrease, which could in turn adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
our future success depends, in part, on our ability to anticipate and respond effectively to the threat of digital disruption and other technology change. we must also develop and implement technology solutions and technical expertise among our employees that anticipate and keep pace with rapid and continuing changes in technology, industry standards, client preferences and internal control standards. we may not be successful in anticipating or responding to these developments on a timely and cost-effective basis and our ideas may not be accepted in the marketplace. additionally, the effort to gain technological expertise and develop new technologies in our business requires us to incur significant expenses. if we cannot offer new technologies as quickly as our competitors, or if our competitors develop more cost-effective technologies or product offerings, we could experience a material adverse effect on our operating results, client relationships, growth and compliance programs.
in some cases, we depend on key vendors and partners to provide technology and other support for our strategic initiatives. if these third parties fail to perform their obligations or cease to work with us, our ability to execute on our strategic initiatives could be adversely affected.
our reputation is one of our key assets. we advise our clients on and provide services related to a wide range of subjects and our ability to attract and retain clients is highly dependent upon the external perceptions of our level of service, trustworthiness, business practices, financial condition and other subjective qualities. negative perceptions or publicity regarding these or other matters, including our association with clients or business partners who themselves have a damaged reputation, or from actual or alleged conduct by us or our employees, could damage our reputation. any resulting erosion of trust and confidence among existing and potential clients, regulators, stockholders and other parties important to the success of our business could make it difficult for us to attract new clients and maintain existing ones, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
we have historically acquired large numbers of insurance brokers, benefits consulting firms and risk management firms. we may not be able to continue such an acquisition strategy in the future and there are risks associated with such acquisitions, which could adversely affect our growth and results of operations.
our acquisition program has been an important part of our historical growth, particularly in our brokerage segment, and we believe that similar acquisition activity will be important to maintaining comparable growth in the future. failure to successfully identify and complete acquisitions likely would result in us achieving slower growth. continuing consolidation in our industry and growing interest in acquiring insurance brokers on the part of private equity firms and private equity-backed consolidators could make it more difficult for us to identify appropriate targets and could make them more expensive. even if we are able to identify appropriate acquisition targets, we may not have sufficient capital to fund acquisitions, be able to execute transactions on favorable terms or integrate targets in a manner that allows us to realize the benefits we have historically experienced from acquisitions. when regulatory approval of acquisitions is required, our ability to complete acquisitions may be limited by an ongoing regulatory review or other issues with the relevant regulator. our ability to finance and integrate acquisitions may also decrease if we complete a greater number of large acquisitions than we have historically.
post-acquisition risks include those relating to retention of personnel, retention of clients, entry into unfamiliar markets or lines of business, contingencies or liabilities, such as violations of sanctions laws or anti-corruption laws including the fcpa and u.k. bribery act, risks relating to ensuring compliance with licensing and regulatory requirements, tax and accounting issues, the risk that the acquisition distracts management and personnel from our existing business, and integration difficulties relating to accounting, information technology, human resources, or organizational culture and fit, some or all of which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and growth. the failure of acquisition targets to achieve anticipated revenue and earnings levels could also result in goodwill impairment charges.
we own interests in firms where we do not exercise management control (such as jiang tai re, our joint venture with jiang tai insurance brokers in china, or casanueva perez s.a.p. de c.v. (grupo cp) in mexico) and are therefore unable to direct or manage the business to realize the anticipated benefits, including mitigation of risks, that could be achieved through full integration.
our future success depends, in part, on our ability to attract and retain experienced and qualified personnel.
our future success depends, in part, on our ability to attract and retain both new talent and experienced personnel, including our senior management, brokers and other key personnel. in addition, we could be adversely affected if we fail to adequately plan for the succession of members of our senior management team. the insurance brokerage industry has experienced intense competition for the services of leading brokers, and in the past we have lost key brokers and groups of brokers, along with their client and business relationships, to competitors. such departures could lead to the loss of clients and intellectual property. the loss of our chief executive officer or any of our other senior managers, brokers or other key personnel (including the key personnel that manage our interests in our irc section 45 investments), or our inability to identify, recruit and retain highly skilled personnel, could materially and adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.
in 2016, we generated approximately 31% of our revenues outside the u.s., including in countries where the risk of political and economic uncertainty is relatively greater than that present in the u.s. and more stable countries. the global nature of our business creates operational and economic risks. adverse geopolitical or economic conditions may temporarily or permanently disrupt our operations in these countries or create difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations. for example, we have substantial operations in india to provide certain back-office services. to date, the dispute between india and pakistan involving the kashmir region, incidents of terrorism in india and general geopolitical uncertainties have not adversely affected our operations in india. however, such factors could potentially affect our operations there in the future. should our access to these services be disrupted, our business, operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected.
                                              maintaining awareness of and complying with a wide variety of labor practices and foreign laws, including those relating to export and import duties, environmental policies and privacy issues, as well as laws and regulations applicable to u.s. business operations abroad. these and other international regulatory risks are described below under regulatory, legal and accounting risks;
   the potential costs, difficulties and risks associated with local regulations across the globe, including the risk of personal liability for directors and officers and piercing the corporate veil risks under the corporate law regimes of certain countries;
   less flexible employee relationships, which may limit our ability to prohibit employees from competing with us after they are no longer employed with us or recovering damages in the event they do so, and may make it more difficult and expensive to terminate their employment;
   political and economic instability, including in the u.k., the eurozone, australia and certain emerging markets (including risks relating to undeveloped or evolving legal systems, unstable governments, acts of terrorism and outbreaks of war);
                                                                            unfavorable audits and exposure to additional liabilities relating to various non-income taxes (such as payroll, sales, use, value-added, net worth, property and goods and services taxes) in foreign jurisdictions. in addition, our future effective tax rates could be unfavorably affected by changes in tax rates, discriminatory or confiscatory taxation, changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets or liabilities, changes in tax laws or their interpretation and the financial results of our international subsidiaries. the organization for economic cooperation and development issued reports and recommendations as part of its base erosion and profit shifting project (beps), and in response many countries in which we do business are expected to adopt rules which may change various aspects of the existing framework under which our tax obligations are determined. for example, in response to beps, the u.k. adopted rules in 2016 that will affect the deductibility of interest paid on intercompany debt, and other jurisdictions where we operate, including australia and new zealand, may do so as well in the near future;
   legal or political constraints on our ability to maintain or increase prices;
   cash balances held in foreign banks and institutions where governments have not specifically enacted formal guarantee programs;
   lost business or other financial harm due to governmental actions affecting the flow of goods, services and currency, including protectionist policies that discriminate in favor of local competitors; and
following the recent presidential election in the u.s., the foreign and international trade policies of the u.s. could change in ways that exacerbate the risks described above, or introduce new risks for our international operations. if any of these risks materialize, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.
a large and growing portion of our business is located outside the u.s. some of our foreign subsidiaries receive revenues or incur obligations in currencies that differ from their functional currencies. we must also translate the financial results of our foreign subsidiaries into u.s. dollars. although we have used foreign currency hedging strategies in the past and currently have some in place, such risks cannot be eliminated entirely, and significant changes in exchange rates may adversely affect our results of operations. in the u.k., the vote to leave the european union may result in substantial volatility in foreign exchange markets and may lead to a sustained weakness in the british pounds exchange rate against the u.s. dollar. any significant weakening of the british pound to the u.s. dollar will have an adverse impact on our brokerage and risk management segment revenues and earnings as reported in u.s. dollars.
   concentration of large amounts of revenue with certain clients results in greater exposure to the potential negative effects of lost business due to changes in management at such clients or changes in state government policies, in the case of our government-entity clients, or for other reasons;
   contracting terms will become less favorable or that the margins on our services will decrease due to increased competition, regulatory constraints or other developments;
                   we will not be able to satisfy regulatory requirements related to third party administrators or that regulatory developments (including unanticipated regulatory developments relating to security and data privacy outside the u.s.) will impose additional burdens, costs or business restrictions that make our business less profitable;
   economic weakness or a slow-down in economic activity could lead to a reduction in the number of claims we process;
   if we do not control our labor and technology costs, we may be unable to remain competitive in the marketplace and profitably fulfill our existing contracts (other than those that provide cost-plus or other margin protection);
   insurance companies or certain insurance consumers may create in-house servicing capabilities that compete with our third party administration and other administration, servicing and risk management products.
if any of these risks materialize, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.
sustained increases in the cost of employee benefits could reduce our profitability.
the cost of current employees medical and other benefits, as well as pension retirement benefits and postretirement medical benefits under our legacy defined benefit plans, substantially affects our profitability. in the past, we have occasionally experienced significant increases in these costs as a result of macro-economic factors beyond our control, including increases in health care costs, declines in investment returns on pension assets and changes in discount rates used to calculate pension and related liabilities. a significant decrease in the value of our defined benefit pension plan assets or decreases in the interest rates used to discount the pension plans liabilities could cause an increase in pension plan costs in future years. although we have actively sought to control increases in these costs, we can make no assurance that we will succeed in limiting future cost increases, and continued upward pressure in these costs could reduce our profitability.
our inability to recover successfully should we experience a disaster, cybersecurity attack or other disruption to business continuity could have a material adverse effect on our operations, damage our reputation and impact client relationships.
our ability to conduct business may be adversely affected, even in the short-term, by a disruption in the infrastructure that supports our business and the communities where we are located. for example, our third party claims administration operation is highly dependent on the continued and efficient functioning of risx-facs®, our proprietary risk management information system, to provide clients with insurance claim settlement and administration services.
disruptions could be caused by, among other things, restricted physical site access, terrorist activities, disease pandemics, cybersecurity attacks, or outages to electrical, communications or other services we use, our employees or third parties with whom we conduct business. we have disaster recovery procedures in place and insurance to protect against such contingencies. however, such procedures may not be effective and any insurance or recovery procedures may not continue to be available at reasonable prices and may not address all such losses or compensate us for the possible loss of clients or increase in claims and lawsuits directed against us because of any period during which we are unable to provide services. we anticipate moving our corporate headquarters during the first quarter of 2017. any major disruption in the move, or our inability to successfully recover should we experience a disaster or other disruption to business continuity could have a material adverse effect on our operations. the occurrence of such events could also cause reputational harm and damage our client relationships.
regulatory, legal and accounting risks improper disclosure of confidential, personal or proprietary data, whether due to human error, misuse of information by employees or vendors, or as a result of cyberattacks, could result in regulatory scrutiny, legal liability or reputational harm, and could have an adverse effect on our business or operations.
we maintain confidential, personal and proprietary information relating to our company, our employees and our clients. this information includes personally identifiable information, protected health information and financial information. in many jurisdictions, particularly in the u.s. and the european union, we are subject to laws and regulations relating to the collection, use, retention, security and transfer of this information. these laws apply to transfers of information among our affiliates, as well as to transactions we enter into with third party vendors.
we have from time to time experienced cybersecurity breaches, such as computer viruses, unauthorized parties gaining access to our information technology systems and similar incidents, which to date have not had a material impact on our business. in the future, these types of incidents could disrupt the security of our internal systems and business applications, impair our ability to provide services to our clients and protect the privacy of their data, compromise confidential business information, result in intellectual property or other confidential information being lost or stolen, including client, employee or company data, which could harm our competitive position or otherwise adversely affect our business. cyber threats are constantly evolving, which makes it more difficult to detect cybersecurity incidents, assess their severity or impact in a timely manner, and successfully defend against them.
we maintain policies, procedures and technical safeguards designed to protect the security and privacy of confidential, personal and proprietary information. nonetheless, we cannot eliminate the risk of human error or inadequate safeguards against employee or vendor malfeasance. it is possible that the steps we follow, including our security controls over personal data and training of employees on data security, may not prevent improper access to, disclosure of, or misuse of confidential, personal or proprietary information. this could cause harm to our reputation, create legal exposure, or subject us to liability under laws that protect personal data, resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue.
significant costs are involved with maintaining system safeguards for our technology infrastructure. if we are unable to effectively maintain and upgrade our system safeguards, including in connection with the integration of acquisitions, we may incur unexpected costs and certain of our systems may become more vulnerable to unauthorized access.
with respect to our commercial arrangements with third party vendors, we have processes designed to require third party it outsourcing, offsite storage and other vendors to agree to maintain certain standards with respect to the storage, protection and transfer of confidential, personal and proprietary information. however, we remain at risk of a data breach due to the intentional or unintentional non-compliance by a vendors employee or agent, the breakdown of a vendors data protection processes, or a cyber attack on a vendors information systems.
data privacy is subject to frequently changing laws, rules and regulations in the various jurisdictions and countries in which we operate. for example, in 2015, the european court of justice invalidated a key safe harbor relied upon by many businesses to transfer personal data legally from the european union to the u.s. there is a growing body of international data protection law, which, in part, includes security breach notification obligations, more stringent operational requirements and significant penalties for non-compliance. in addition, legislators in the u.s. are proposing new and more robust cybersecurity legislation in light of the recent broad-based cyberattacks at a number of companies. these and similar initiatives around the world could increase the cost of developing, implementing or securing our servers and require us to allocate more resources to improved technologies, adding to our it and compliance costs. our failure to adhere to, or successfully implement processes in response to, changing legal or regulatory requirements in this area could result in legal liability or damage to our reputation in the marketplace.
we are subject to regulation worldwide. if we fail to comply with regulatory requirements or if regulations change in a way that adversely affects our operations, we may not be able to conduct our business, or we may be less profitable.
many of our activities throughout the world are subject to regulatory supervision and regulations promulgated by bodies such as the securities and exchange commission (sec), the department of justice (doj), the internal revenue service (irs) and the office of foreign assets control (ofac) in the u.s., the financial conduct authority (fca) in the u.k., the australian securities and investments commission in australia and insurance regulators in nearly every jurisdiction in which we operate. our activities are also subject to a variety of other laws, rules and regulations addressing licensing, data privacy, wage-and-hour standards, employment and labor relations, anti-competition, anti-corruption, currency, reserves and the amount of local investment with respect to our operations in certain countries. this regulatory supervision could reduce our profitability or growth by increasing the costs of compliance, restricting the products or services we sell, the markets we enter, the methods by which we sell our products and services, or the prices we can charge for our services and the form of compensation we can accept from our clients, carriers and third parties. as our operations grow around the world, it is increasingly difficult to monitor and enforce regulatory compliance across the organization. a compliance failure by even one of our smallest branches could lead to litigation and/or disciplinary actions that may include compensating clients for loss, the imposition of penalties and the revocation of our authorization to operate. in all such cases, we would also likely incur significant internal investigation costs and legal fees.
the global nature of our operations increases the complexity and cost of compliance with laws and regulations, including increased staffing needs, the development of new policies, procedures and internal controls and providing training to employees in multiple locations, adding to our cost of doing business. many of these laws and regulations may have differing or conflicting legal standards across jurisdictions, increasing further the complexity and cost of compliance. in emerging markets and other jurisdictions with less developed legal systems, local laws and regulations may not be established with sufficiently clear and reliable guidance to provide us with adequate assurance that we are aware of all necessary licenses to operate our business, that we are operating our business in a compliant manner, or that our rights are otherwise protected. in addition, in light of recent events associated with the planned exit of the u.k. from the european union, we will likely face new regulatory costs and challenges. for example, our u.k. operations could lose their european union financial services passport which provides them the license to operate across borders within the single european union market without obtaining local regulatory approval.
changes in legislation or regulations and actions by regulators, including changes in administration and enforcement policies, could from time to time require operational changes that could result in lost revenues or higher costs or hinder our ability to operate our business.
for example, the method by which insurance brokers are compensated has received substantial scrutiny in the past because of the potential for conflicts of interest. the potential for conflicts of interest arises when a broker is compensated by two parties in connection with the same or similar transactions. the vast majority of the compensation we receive for our work as insurance brokers is in the form of retail commissions and fees. we receive additional revenue from insurance companies, separate from retail commissions and fees, including, among other things, contingent and supplemental commissions and payments for consulting and analytics services provided to insurance carriers. future changes in the regulatory environment may impact our ability to collect these additional revenue streams. adverse regulatory, legal or other developments regarding these revenues could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition, expose us to negative publicity and reputational damage and harm our client, insurer or other relationships.
in foreign countries where we operate, a risk exists that our employees, third party partners or agents could engage in business practices prohibited by applicable laws and regulations, such as the fcpa and the u.k. bribery act. such anti-corruption laws generally prohibit companies from making improper payments to foreign officials and require companies to keep accurate books and records and maintain appropriate internal controls. our policies mandate strict compliance with such laws and we devote substantial resources to programs to ensure compliance. however, we operate in some parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption, and, in certain circumstances, local customs and practice might not be consistent with the requirements of anti-corruption laws. in addition, in recent years, two of the five publicly traded insurance brokerage firms were investigated in the u.s. and the u.k. for improper payments to foreign officials. these firms undertook internal investigations and paid significant settlements.
we remain subject to the risk that our employees, third party partners or agents will engage in business practices that are prohibited by our policies and violate such laws and regulations. violations by us or a third party acting on our behalf could result in significant internal investigation costs and legal fees, civil and criminal penalties, including prohibitions on the conduct of our business, and reputational harm.
we may also be subject to legal liability and reputational damage if we violate u.s. trade sanctions administered by ofac, the european union and the united nations, and trade sanction laws such as the iran threat reduction and syria human rights act of 2012.
in addition, fatca requires certain of our subsidiaries, affiliates and other entities to obtain valid fatca documentation from payees prior to remitting certain payments to such payees. in the event we do not obtain valid fatca documents, we may be obliged to withhold a portion of such payments. this obligation is shared with our customers and clients who may fail to comply, in whole or in part. in such circumstances, we may incur fatca compliance costs including withholding taxes, interest and penalties. in addition, regulatory initiatives and changes in the regulations and guidance promulgated under fatca may increase our costs of operations, and could adversely affect the market for our services as intermediaries, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
the 2010 health care reform legislation, among other things, increases the level of regulatory complexity for companies that offer health and welfare benefits to their employees, and continues to be amended through regulations issued by various government agencies. initiatives by the incoming presidential administration to change certain aspects of this legislation may increase such complexity. many clients of our brokerage segment purchase health and welfare products for their employees and, therefore, are impacted by the 2010 health care reform legislation. we have made significant investments in product and knowledge development to assist clients as they navigate the complex requirements of this legislation. depending on future changes to health legislation, these investments may not yield returns. in addition, if we are unable to adapt our services to changes resulting from this law and any subsequent regulations, our ability to grow our business or to provide effective services, particularly in our employee benefits consulting business, will be negatively impacted. in addition, if our clients reduce the role or extent of employer sponsored health care in response to this or any other law, our results of operations could be adversely impacted.
we are subject to numerous claims, tax assessments, lawsuits and proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business. such claims, lawsuits and other proceedings could, for example, include claims for damages based on allegations that our employees or sub-agents improperly failed to procure coverage, report claims on behalf of clients, provide insurance companies with complete and accurate information relating to the risks being insured, or provide clients with appropriate consulting, advisory and claims handling services. there is the risk that our employees or sub-agents may fail to appropriately apply funds that we hold for our clients on a fiduciary basis. certain of our benefits and retirement consultants provide investment advice or decision-making services to clients. if these clients experience investment losses, our reputation could be damaged and our financial results could be negatively affected as a result of claims asserted against us and lost business. we have established provisions against these potential matters that we believe are adequate in light of current information and legal advice, and we adjust such provisions from time to time based on current material developments. the damages claimed in such matters are or may be substantial, including, in many instances, claims for punitive, treble or other extraordinary damages. it is possible that, if the outcomes of these contingencies and legal proceedings were not favorable to us, it could materially adversely affect our future financial results. in addition, our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity may be adversely affected if, in the future, our insurance coverage proves to be inadequate or unavailable or we experience an increase in liabilities for which we self-insure. we have purchased errors and omissions insurance and other insurance to provide protection against losses that arise in such matters. accruals for these items, net of insurance receivables, when applicable, have been provided to the extent that losses are deemed probable and are reasonably estimable. these accruals and receivables are adjusted from time to time as current developments warrant.
as more fully described in note 15 to our consolidated financial statements, we are a defendant in various legal actions incidental to our business, including but not limited to matters related to employment practices, alleged breaches of non-compete or other restrictive covenants, theft of trade secrets, breaches of fiduciary duties, intellectual property infringement and related causes of action. we are also periodically the subject of inquiries and investigations by regulatory and taxing authorities into various matters related to our business. for example, our micro-captive advisory services are currently the subject of an investigation by the irs. in addition, we were named in a lawsuit asserting that we, our subsidiary, gallagher clean energy, llc, and chem-mod llc are liable for infringement of a patent held by nalco company. an adverse outcome in connection with one or more of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition in any given quarterly or annual period, or on an ongoing basis. in addition, regardless of any eventual monetary costs, any such matter could expose us to negative publicity, reputational damage, harm to our client or employee relationships, or diversion of personnel and management resources, which could adversely affect our ability to recruit quality brokers and other significant employees to our business, and otherwise adversely affect our results of operations.
changes in our accounting estimates and assumptions could negatively affect our financial position and operating results.
we prepare our financial statements in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles (which we refer to as gaap). these accounting principles require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our consolidated financial statements. we are also required to make certain judgments that affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during each reporting period. we periodically evaluate our estimates and assumptions, including those relating to the valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets, investments (including our irc section 45 investments), income taxes, stock-based compensation, claims handling obligations, retirement plans, litigation and contingencies. we base our estimates on historical experience and various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable based on specific circumstances. actual results could differ from these estimates. additionally, changes in accounting standards (such as new standards relating to revenue recognition and leases) could increase costs to the organization and could have an adverse impact on our future financial position and results of operations. see note 2 to our 2016 consolidated financial statements for information with respect to the potential impacts the new standards relating to revenue recognition and leases could have on our future financial position and operating results.
we have invested in clean energy operations capable of producing refined coal that we believe qualify for tax credits under irc section 45.
see note 13 to our consolidated financial statements for a description of these investments. our ability to generate returns and avoid write-offs in connection with these investments is subject to various risks and uncertainties. these include, but are not limited to, the risks and uncertainties set forth below.
                                                                                                                           availability of the tax credits under irc section 45. our ability to claim tax credits under irc section 45 depends upon the operations in which we have invested satisfying certain ongoing conditions set forth in irc section 45. these include, among others, the emissions reduction, qualifying technology, placed-in-service and coal sales to unrelated parties requirements of irc section 45, as well as the requirement that at least one of the operations owners qualifies as a
producer of refined coal. while we have received some degree of confirmation from the irs relating to our ability to claim these tax credits, the irs could ultimately determine that the operations have not satisfied, or have not continued to satisfy, the conditions set forth in irc section 45.
                                                   value of the tax credits. the value of the tax credits could be impacted by changes in the tax code as a result of the recent presidential and congressional elections in the u.s. congress could modify or repeal irc section 45 and remove the tax credits (either prospectively or through the elimination of the carryover of the credits), which might adversely affect the value of our investment. also, if congress reduces tax rates as proposed, although we would pay less in taxes overall, it would reduce the tax benefit of operating costs associated with the production of refined coal.
                                                                                                                                                    co-investor tax credit risks. we have co-investors in several of the operations currently producing refined coal, and are working to negotiate arrangements with potential co-investors for the purchase of equity stakes in other operations. if no satisfactory arrangements can be reached with these potential co-investors, or if in the future any one of our co-investors leaves a project, we could have difficulty finding replacements in a timely manner. on february 10, 2017, one of the refined coal partnerships in which we are an investor received a notice from the irs setting forth its view that certain of our co-investors are unable to claim tax credits based on the structure of their partnership interests. the irs notice does not challenge the validity of the tax credits or our ability to utilize tax credits. our co-investors have the right to appeal and defend their position in tax court. while it is not possible to predict the ultimate outcome of any such appeal, an adverse ruling would likely make it more difficult for us to reach satisfactory arrangements with new co-investors. we could also be subject to claims against us from the co-investors affected by this irs notice.
                                                                                                                                                                                              operational risks. chem-mods multi-pollutant reduction technologies (the chem-modtm solution) require chemicals that may not be readily available in the marketplace at reasonable costs. utilities that use the technologies could be idled for various reasons, including operational or environmental problems at the plants or in the boilers, disruptions in the supply or transportation of coal, revocation of their chem-mod technologies environmental permits, labor strikes, force majeure events such as hurricanes, or terrorist attacks, any of which could halt or impede the operations. long-term operations using chem-mods multi-pollutant reduction technologies could also lead to unforeseen technical or other problems not evident in the short- or medium-term. a serious injury or death of a worker connected with the production of refined coal using chem-mods technologies could expose the operations to material liabilities, jeopardizing our investment, and could lead to reputational harm. in the event of any such operational problems, we may not be able to take full advantage of the tax credits. we could also be exposed to risk due to our lack of control over the operations if future developments, for example a regulatory change affecting public and private companies differently, causes our interests and those of our co-investors to diverge. finally, our partners responsible for operation and management could fail to run the operations in compliance with irc section 45. if any of these developments occur, our investment returns may be negatively impacted.
                                                        market demand for coal. when the price of natural gas and/or oil declines relative to that of coal, some utilities may choose to burn natural gas or oil instead of coal. market demand for coal may also decline as a result of an economic slowdown or mild weather and a corresponding decline in the use of electricity. sustained low natural gas prices may also cause utilities to phase out or close existing coal-fired power plants. if utilities burn less coal or eliminate coal in the production of electricity, the availability of the tax credits would also be reduced.
                                                    demand for commercial refined coal plants. the implementation of environmental regulations regarding certain pollution control and permitting requirements has been delayed from time to time due to various lawsuits. the uncertainty created by litigation and reconsiderations of rule-making by the environmental protection agency could negatively impact power generational facilities
                                                     incompatible coal. if utilities purchase coal of a quality or type incompatible with their boilers and operations, treating such coal through a commercial refined coal plant could magnify the negative impacts of burning such coal. as a result, refined coal plants at such utilities may be removed from production until the incompatible coal has all been burned, which could cause us to be unable to take full advantage of the tax credits.
                                                       moving a commercial refined coal plant. changes in circumstances, such as those described above, may cause a commercial refined coal plant to be moved to a different power generation facility, which could require us to invest additional capital. three plants do not currently have long-term production contracts, and may have to be moved once negotiations for such contracts are finalized. in addition, if for any reason one or more of these operations are unable to satisfy regulatory permitting requirements and the utilities at which they are installed are unable to timely obtain long-term permits, we may not be able to generate additional earnings from these operations.
   intellectual property risks. there is a risk that foreign laws will not protect the intellectual property associated with the chem-mod solution to the same extent as u.s. laws, leaving us vulnerable to companies outside the u.s. who may attempt to copy such intellectual property. in addition, other companies may make claims of intellectual property infringement with respect to the chem-mod solution. such intellectual property claims, with or without merit, could require that chem-mod (or us and our investment and operational partners) obtain a license to use the intellectual property, which might not be obtainable on favorable terms, if at all. in july 2014, we were named in a lawsuit asserting that we and other defendants are liable for infringement of a patent held by nalco company. in response, we filed a motion to dismiss the complaint on behalf of all defendants, alleging no infringement of nalcos intellectual property. this motion and similar motions attacking amended complaints filed by nalco, were granted. on april 20, 2016 the court dismissed nalcos complaint and disallowed any further opportunity to amend or refile. although nalco has appealed this ruling, we believe that the probability of a material loss is remote. however, litigation is inherently uncertain and it is not possible to predict the ultimate disposition of this proceeding. if chem-mod (or we and our investment and operational partners) cannot defeat or defend this or other such claims or obtain necessary licenses on reasonable terms, the operations may be precluded from using the chem-mod solution.
                  irc section 45 phase out provisions. irc section 45 contains phase out provisions based upon the market price of coal, such that, if the price of coal rises to specified levels, we could lose some or all of the tax credits we expect to receive from these investments.
the irc section 45 operations in which we have invested and the by-products from such operations may result in environmental and product liability claims and environmental compliance costs.
the construction and operation of the irc section 45 operations are subject to federal, state and local laws, regulations and potential liabilities arising under or relating to the protection or preservation of the environment, natural resources and human health and safety. such laws and regulations generally require the operations and/or the utilities at which the operations are located to obtain and comply with various environmental registrations, licenses, permits, inspections and other approvals. there are costs associated with ensuring compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, and failure to fully comply with all applicable laws and regulations could lead to the imposition of penalties or other liability. failure of the chem-mod solution utilized at coal-fired generation facilities, for example, could result in violations of air emissions permits, which could lead to the imposition of penalties or other liability. additionally, some environmental laws, without regard to fault or the legality of a partys conduct, on certain entities that are considered to have contributed to, or are otherwise responsible for, the release or threatened release of hazardous substances into the environment. one party may, under certain circumstances, be required to bear more than its share or the entire share of investigation and cleanup costs at a site if payments or participation cannot be obtained from other responsible parties. by using the chem-mod solution at locations owned and operated by others, we and our partners may be exposed to the risk of being held liable for environmental damage from releases of hazardous substances we may have had little, if any, involvement in creating. such risk remains even after production ceases at an operation to the extent the environmental damage can be traced to the types of chemicals or compounds used or operations conducted in connection with the chem-mod solution. in addition, we and our partners could face the risk of environmental and product liability claims related to concrete incorporating fly ash produced using the chem-mod solution. no assurances can be given that contractual arrangements and precautions taken to ensure assumption of these risks by facility owners or operators, or other end users, will result in that facility owner or operator, or other end user, accepting full responsibility for any environmental or product liability claim. nor can we or our partners be certain that facility owners or operators, or other end users, will fully comply with all applicable laws and regulations, and this could result in environmental or product liability claims. it is also not uncommon for private claims by third parties alleging contamination to also include claims for personal injury, property damage, nuisance, diminution of property value, or similar claims. furthermore, many environmental, health and safety laws authorize citizen suits, permitting third parties to make claims for violations of laws or permits. our insurance may not cover all environmental risk and costs or may not provide sufficient coverage in the event of an environmental or product liability claim, and defense of such claims can be costly, even when such defense prevails. if significant uninsured losses arise from environmental or product liability claims, or if the costs of environmental compliance increase for any reason, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.
we have historically benefited from irc section 29 tax credits and that law expired on december 31, 2007. the disallowance of irc section 29 tax credits would likely cause a material loss.
the law permitting us to claim irc section 29 tax credits related to our synthetic coal operations expired on december 31, 2007. we believe our claim for irc section 29 tax credits in 2007 and prior years is in accordance with irc section 29 and four private letter rulings previously obtained by irc section 29-related limited liability companies in which we had an interest. we understand these private letter rulings are consistent with those issued to other taxpayers and have received no indication from the irs that it will seek to revoke or modify them. however, while our synthetic coal operations are not currently under audit, the irs could place those operations under audit and an adverse outcome may cause a material loss or cause us to be subject to liability under indemnification obligations related to prior sales of partnership interests in partnerships claiming irc section 29 tax credits. for additional information about the potential negative effects of adverse tax audits and related indemnification contingencies, see the discussion on irc section 29 tax credits included in managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.
we have debt outstanding that could adversely affect our financial flexibility and subjects us to restrictions and limitations that could significantly impact our ability to operate our business.
as of december 31, 2016, we had total consolidated debt outstanding of approximately $2.7 billion. the level of debt outstanding each period could adversely affect our financial flexibility. we also bear risk at the time debt matures. our ability to make interest and principal payments, to refinance our debt obligations and to fund our acquisition program and planned capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate cash from operations. this, to a certain extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control, such as an environment of rising interest rates. it will also reduce the ability to use that cash for other purposes, including working capital, dividends to stockholders, acquisitions, capital expenditures, share repurchases, and general corporate purposes. if we cannot service our indebtedness, we may have to take actions such as selling assets, seeking additional equity or reducing or delaying capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions, and investments, any of which could impede the implementation of our business strategy or prevent us from entering into transactions that would otherwise benefit our business. additionally, we may not be able to effect such actions, if necessary, on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. we may not be able to refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms, or at all.
the agreements governing our debt contain covenants that, among other things, restrict our ability to dispose of assets, incur additional debt, engage in certain asset sales, mergers, acquisitions or similar transactions, create liens on assets, engage in certain transactions with affiliates, change our business or make investments, and require us to comply with certain financial covenants. the restrictions in the agreements governing our debt may prevent us from taking actions that we believe would be in the best interest of our business and our stockholders and may make it difficult for us to execute our business strategy successfully or effectively compete with companies that are not similarly restricted. we may also incur future debt obligations that might subject us to additional or more restrictive covenants that could affect our financial and operational flexibility, including our ability to pay dividends. we cannot make any assurances that we will be able to refinance our debt or obtain additional financing on terms acceptable to us, or at all. a failure to comply with the restrictions under the agreements governing our debt could result in a default under the financing obligations or could require us to obtain waivers from our lenders for failure to comply with these restrictions. the occurrence of a default that remains uncured or the inability to secure a necessary consent or waiver could cause our obligations with respect to our debt to be accelerated and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
we are organized as a holding company, a legal entity separate and distinct from our operating subsidiaries. as a holding company without significant operations of our own, we are dependent upon dividends and other payments from our operating subsidiaries to meet our obligations for paying principal and interest on outstanding debt obligations, for paying dividends to stockholders, repurchasing our common stock and for corporate expenses. in the event our operating subsidiaries are unable to pay sufficient dividends and other payments to us, we may not be able to service our debt, pay our obligations, pay dividends on or repurchase our common stock.
further, we derive a significant portion of our revenue and operating profit from operating subsidiaries located outside the u.s. since the majority of financing obligations as well as dividends to stockholders are paid from the u.s., it is important to be able to access the cash generated by our operating subsidiaries located outside the u.s in the event we are unable to meet these u.s. based cash requirements.
funds from our operating subsidiaries outside the u.s. may be repatriated to the u.s. via stockholder distributions and intercompany financings, where necessary. a number of factors may arise that could limit our ability to repatriate funds or make repatriation cost prohibitive, including, but not limited to the imposition of currency controls and other government restrictions on repatriation in the jurisdictions in which our subsidiaries operate, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, the imposition of withholding and other taxes on such payments and our ability to repatriate earnings in a tax-efficient manner.
in the event we are unable to generate or repatriate cash from our operating subsidiaries for any of the reasons discussed above, our overall liquidity could deteriorate and our ability to finance our obligations, including to pay dividends on or repurchase our common stock, could be adversely affected.
future sales or other dilution of our equity could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.
we grow our business organically as well as through acquisitions. one method of acquiring companies or otherwise funding our corporate activities is through the issuance of additional equity securities. the issuance of any additional shares of common or of preferred stock or convertible securities could be substantially dilutive to holders of our common stock. moreover, to the extent that we issue restricted stock units, performance stock units, options or warrants to purchase our shares of our common stock in the future and those options or warrants are exercised or as the restricted stock units or performance stock units vest, our stockholders may experience further dilution. holders of our common stock have no preemptive rights that entitle holders to purchase their pro rata share of any offering of shares of any class or series and, therefore, such sales or offerings could result in increased dilution to our stockholders. the market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales of shares of our common stock or the perception that such sales could occur.
the price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly, and this may make it difficult for you to resell shares of common stock owned by you at times or at prices you find attractive.
the trading price of our common stock may fluctuate widely as a result of a number of factors, including the risk factors described above, many of which are outside our control. in addition, the stock market is subject to fluctuations in the share prices and trading volumes that affect the market prices of the shares of many companies. these broad market fluctuations have adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect the market price of our common stock. among the factors that could affect our stock price are:
   general economic and political conditions such as recessions, economic downturns and acts of war or terrorism;
   seasonality of our business cycle;
   our operating results failing to meet the expectation of securities analysts or investors in a particular period;
   changes in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts concerning us or the insurance brokerage or financial services industries in general;
   material announcements by us or our competitors;
   the impact or perceived impact of developments relating to our investments, including the possible perception by securities analysts or investors that such investments divert management attention from our core operations;
   market volatility;
   a negative market reaction to announced acquisitions;
   competitive pressures in each of our segments;
   general conditions in the insurance brokerage and insurance industries;
                                                  quarter-to-quarter volatility in the earnings impact of irc section 45 tax credits from our clean energy investments, due to the application of accounting standards applicable to the recognition of tax credits; and
stockholder class action lawsuits may be instituted against us following a period of volatility in our stock price. any such litigation could result in substantial cost and a diversion of managements attention and resources.
item 7. managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.
introduction the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in item 8 of this annual report. in addition, please see information regarding non-gaap measures and other beginning on page 31 for a reconciliation of the non-gaap measures for adjusted total revenues, organic commission, fee and supplemental commission revenues and adjusted ebitdac to the comparable gaap measures, as well as other important information regarding these measures.
we are engaged in providing insurance brokerage and third party property/casualty claims settlement and administration services to entities in the u.s. and abroad. we believe that one of our major strengths is our ability to deliver comprehensively structured insurance and risk management services to our clients. our brokers, agents and administrators act as intermediaries between insurers and our customers and we do not assume net underwriting risks. we are headquartered in itasca, illinois, have operations in 33 other countries and offer client-service capabilities in more than 150 countries globally through a network of correspondent brokers and consultants. in 2016, we expanded, and expect to continue to expand, our international operations through both acquisitions and organic growth. we generate approximately 69% of our revenues for the combined brokerage and risk management segments domestically, with the remaining 31% derived internationally, primarily in australia, bermuda, canada, the caribbean, new zealand and the u.k. (based on 2016 revenues). we expect that our international revenue as a percentage of our total revenues in 2017 will be comparable to 2016. we have three reportable segments: brokerage, risk management and corporate, which contributed approximately 63%, 13% and 24%, respectively, to 2016 revenues. our major sources of operating revenues are commissions, fees and supplemental and contingent commissions from brokerage operations and fees from risk management operations. investment income is generated from invested cash and fiduciary funds, clean energy and other investments, and interest income from premium financing.
this managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains certain statements relating to future results which are forward-looking statements as that term is defined in the private securities litigation reform act of 1995. please see information concerning forward-looking statements in part i of this annual report, for certain cautionary information regarding forward-looking statements and a list of factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those predicted in the forward-looking statements.

in our corporate segment, net after tax earnings from our clean energy investments was $114.4 million in 2016. we anticipate our clean energy investments to generate between $117.0 million and $133.0 million in net after tax earnings in 2017. we expect to use these additional earnings to continue our mergers and acquisition strategy in our core brokerage and risk management operations.
the following provides information that management believes is helpful when comparing revenues, net earnings, ebitdac and diluted net earnings per share for 2016 and 2015. in addition, these tables provide reconciliations to the most comparable gaap measures for adjusted revenues, adjusted ebitdac (non-gaap measure) and adjusted diluted net earnings per share. reconciliations of ebitdac for the brokerage and risk management segments are provided on pages 35 and 42 of this filing.

insurance market overview fluctuations in premiums charged by property/casualty insurance carriers have a direct and potentially material impact on the insurance brokerage industry. commission revenues are generally based on a percentage of the premiums paid by insureds and normally follow premium levels. insurance premiums are cyclical in nature and may vary widely based on market conditions. various factors, including competition for market share among insurance carriers, increased underwriting capacity and improved economies of scale following consolidations, can result in flat or reduced property/casualty premium rates (a soft market). a soft market tends to put downward pressure on commission revenues. various countervailing factors, such as greater than anticipated loss experience and capital shortages, can result in increasing property/casualty premium rates (a hard market). a hard market tends to favorably impact commission revenues. hard and soft markets may be broad-based or more narrowly focused across individual product lines or geographic areas. as markets harden, certain insureds, who are the buyers of insurance
(our brokerage clients), have historically resisted paying increased premiums and the higher commissions these premiums generate. such resistance often causes some buyers to raise their deductibles and/or reduce the overall amount of insurance coverage they purchase. as the market softens, or costs decrease, these trends have historically reversed. during a hard market, buyers may switch to negotiated fee in lieu of commission arrangements to compensate us for placing their risks, or may consider the alternative insurance market, which includes self-insurance, captives, rent-a-captives, risk retention groups and capital market solutions to transfer risk. according to industry estimates, these mechanisms now account for 50% of the total u.s. commercial property/casualty market. our brokerage units are very active in these markets as well. while increased use by insureds of these alternative markets historically has reduced commission revenue to us, such trends generally have been accompanied by new sales and renewal increases in the areas of risk management, claims management, captive insurance and self-insurance services and related growth in fee revenue. inflation tends to increase the levels of insured values and risk exposures, resulting in higher overall premiums and higher commissions. however, the impact of hard and soft market fluctuations has historically had a greater impact on changes in premium rates, and therefore on our revenues, than inflationary pressures.
the council of insurance agents & brokers (which we refer to as the ciab) 2016 quarterly surveys indicated that u.s. commercial property/casualty rates decreased by 3.7%, 3.9%, 3.2% and 3.3% on average across all lines, for the first, second, third and fourth quarters of 2016, respectively. the fourth quarter 2016 ciab survey indicated that rates declined for the eighth straight quarter. ciab survey respondents noted that the decrease in rates during the fourth quarter of 2016 were fairly consistent with the third quarter of 2016, signaling some stability in the market. in 2017, while we see retail property/casualty rates as a headwind, we do see property/casualty exposure growth offsetting this partially. we also see employment growth and complexity surrounding the affordable care act as tailwinds for our employee benefit units. in addition, our history of strong new business generation, solid retentions and enhanced value-added services for our carrier partners should all result in further organic growth opportunities around the world. we believe similar conditions exist as we start the january 1, 2017 renewal season. internationally, we see a similar market in u.k. retail canada, australia and new zealand, but more softening in london specialty. overall, we believe a modestly-down rate environment can be partially mitigated through exposure unit growth in certain lines and by our professionals demonstrating our expertise and high quality value added capabilities by strengthening our clients insurance portfolio in these times. based on our experience, insurance carriers appear to be making rational pricing decisions. in lines and accounts where rate increases or decreases are warranted, the underwriters are pricing accordingly. as carriers reach their profitability targets in lines, rates may start to flatten. in summary, in this environment, rates decreased at a moderate pace, clients can still obtain coverage, businesses continue to stay in standard-line markets and there is adequate capacity in the insurance market. it is not clear whether the rate retraction will continue due to the uncertainty of the current economic environment. the ciab represents the leading domestic and international insurance brokers, who write approximately 85% of the commercial property/casualty premiums in the u.s.
clean energy investments - in 2009 and 2011, we built a total of 29 commercial clean coal production plants to produce refined coal using chem-mods (see below) proprietary technologies. on september 1, 2013, we purchased a 99% interest in a limited liability company that has ownership interests in four limited liability companies that own five clean coal production plants. on march 1, 2014, we purchased an additional ownership interest in seven of the 2009 era plants and five of the 2011 era plants from a co-investor. for all seven of the 2009 era plants, our ownership increased from 49.5% to 100.0%. for the 2011 era plants, our ownership increased from 48.8% to 90.0% for one of the plants, from 49.0% to 100.0% for three of the plants and from 98.0% to 100.0% for one of the plants. we believe these operations produce refined coal that qualifies for tax credits under irc section 45. the law that provides for irc section 45 tax credits expires in december 2019 for the fourteen plants we built and placed in service in 2009 (2009 era plants) and in december 2021 for the fifteen plants we built and placed in service in 2011, plus the five plants we purchased interests in that were placed in service in 2011 (2011 era plants).
thirty-one plants are under long-term production contracts with several utilities. the remaining three plants are in early stages of seeking and negotiating long-term production contracts.
we also own a 46.5% controlling interest in chem-mod, which has been marketing the chem-mod solution proprietary technologies principally to refined fuel plants that sell refined fuel to coal-fired power plants owned by utility companies, including those plants in which we hold interests. based on current production estimates provided by licensees, chem-mod could generate for us approximately $4.0 million to $5.0 million of net after-tax earnings per quarter.
all estimates set forth above regarding the future results of our clean energy investments are subject to significant risks, including those set forth in the risk factors regarding our irc section 45 investments under item 1a, risk factors.
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles (which we refer to as gaap), which require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. we believe the following significant accounting policies may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity. see note 1 to our consolidated financial statements for other significant accounting policies.
revenue recognition - see revenue recognition in note 1 to our consolidated financial statements. see note 2 to our 2016 consolidated financial statements for information with respect to the potential impacts a new accounting standard relating to revenue recognition could have on our future financial position and operating results.
uncertain tax positions are measured based upon the facts and circumstances that exist at each reporting period and involve significant management judgment. subsequent changes in judgment based upon new information may lead to changes in recognition, derecognition and measurement. adjustments may result, for example, upon resolution of an issue with the taxing authorities, or expiration of a statute of limitations barring an assessment for an issue. we recognize interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits in our provision for income taxes. see note 17 to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion regarding the possibility that our gross unrecognized tax benefits balance may change within the next twelve months.
tax law requires certain items to be included in our tax returns at different times than such items are reflected in the financial statements. as a result, the annual tax expense reflected in our consolidated statements of earnings is different than that reported in the tax returns. some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible in the returns, and some differences are temporary and reverse over time, such as depreciation expense and amortization expense deductible for income tax purposes. temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax expense recognized in the financial statements for which a tax payment has been deferred, or expense which has been deducted in the tax return but has not yet been recognized in the financial statements. deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in tax returns in future years for which a benefit has already been recorded in the financial statements.
we establish or adjust valuation allowances for deferred tax assets when we estimate that it is more likely than not that future taxable income will be insufficient to fully use a deduction or credit in a specific jurisdiction. in assessing the need for the recognition of a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets, we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion, or all, of the deferred tax assets will not be realized and adjust the valuation allowance accordingly. we evaluate all significant available positive and negative evidence as part of our analysis. negative evidence includes the existence of losses in recent years. positive evidence includes the forecast of future taxable income by jurisdiction, tax-planning strategies that would result in the realization of deferred tax assets and the presence of taxable income in prior carryback years. the underlying assumptions we use in forecasting future taxable income require significant judgment and take into account our recent performance. the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets depends on the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which temporary differences are deductible or creditable.
current accounting guidance related to business combinations requires us to estimate and recognize the fair value of liabilities related to potential earnout obligations as of the acquisition dates for all of our acquisitions subject to earnout provisions. the maximum potential earnout payables disclosed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements represent the maximum amount of additional consideration that could be paid pursuant to the terms of the purchase agreement for the applicable acquisition. the amounts recorded as earnout payables, which are primarily based upon the estimated future operating results of the acquired entities over a two- to three-year period subsequent to the acquisition date, are measured at fair value as of the acquisition date and are included on that basis in the recorded purchase price consideration. we will record subsequent changes in these estimated earnout obligations, including the accretion of discount, in our consolidated statement of earnings when incurred.
the fair value of these earnout obligations is based on the present value of the expected future payments to be made to the sellers of the acquired entities in accordance with the provisions outlined in the respective purchase agreements. in determining fair value, we estimate the acquired entitys future performance using financial projections that are developed by management for the acquired entity and market participant assumptions that are derived for revenue growth and/or profitability. we estimate future payments using the earnout formula and performance targets specified in each purchase agreement and these financial projections. we then discount these payments to present value using a risk-adjusted rate that takes into consideration market-based rates of return that reflect the ability of the acquired entity to achieve the targets. changes in financial projections, market participant assumptions for revenue growth and/or profitability, or the risk-adjusted discount rate, would result in a change in the fair value of recorded earnout obligations. see note 3 to our consolidated financial statements for additional discussion on our 2016 business combinations.
business combinations and dispositions see note 3 to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our 2016 business combinations. we did not have any material dispositions in 2016, 2015 and 2014.
results of operations information regarding non-gaap measures and other in the discussion and analysis of our results of operations that follows, in addition to reporting financial results in accordance with gaap, we provide information regarding ebitdac, ebitdac margin, adjusted ebitdac, adjusted ebitdac margin, diluted net earnings per share, as adjusted (adjusted eps) for the brokerage and risk management segments, adjusted revenues, adjusted compensation and operating expenses, adjusted compensation expense ratio, adjusted operating expense ratio and organic revenue measures for each operating segment. these measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative to, the gaap information provided in this report. we believe that these presentations provide useful information to management, analysts and investors regarding financial and business trends relating to our results of operations and financial condition. our industry peers may provide similar supplemental non-gaap information with respect to one or more of these measures, although they may not use the same or comparable terminology and may not make identical adjustments. the non-gaap information we provide should be used in addition to, but not as a substitute for, the gaap information provided. as disclosed in our most recent proxy statement, we do not make determinations regarding executive officer incentive compensation on the basis of adjusted measures such as those described below in adjusted revenues and expenses or adjusted ebitdac. instead, incentive compensation determinations for executive officers are made on the basis of revenue and ebitac (defined as earnings before interest, taxes, amortization and change in estimated earnout payables) for the combined brokerage and risk management segments. certain reclassifications have been made to the prior-year amounts reported in this report in order to conform them to the current year presentation.
adjusted non-gaap presentation - we believe that the adjusted non-gaap presentation of our 2016, 2015 and 2014 information, presented on the following pages, provides stockholders and other interested persons with useful information regarding certain financial metrics that may assist such persons in analyzing our operating results as they develop a future earnings outlook for us. the after-tax amounts related to the adjustments were computed using the normalized effective tax rate for each respective period.
   net gains realized from sales of books of business, which are primarily net proceeds received related to sales of books of business and other divestiture transactions.
   acquisition integration costs, which include costs related to certain of our large acquisitions, outside the scope of our usual tuck-in strategy, not expected to occur on an ongoing basis in the future once we fully assimilate the applicable acquisition. these costs are typically associated with redundant workforce, extra lease space, duplicate services and external costs incurred to assimilate the acquisition with our it related systems.
   workforce related charges, which primarily include severance costs related to employee terminations and other costs associated with redundant workforce.
   acquisition related adjustments, which include change in estimated acquisition earnout payables adjustments, impacts of acquisition valuation true-ups, impairment charges and acquisition related compensation charges.
   the impact of foreign currency translation, as applicable. the amounts excluded with respect to foreign currency translation are calculated by applying current year foreign exchange rates to the same periods in the prior year.
                                                             ebitdac and ebitdac margin - ebitdac is net earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation, amortization and the change in estimated acquisition earnout payables and ebitdac margin is ebitdac divided by total revenues. these measures for the brokerage and risk management segments provide a meaningful representation of our operating performance and, for the overall business, provide a meaningful way to measure its financial performance on an ongoing basis.
                                                            adjusted ebitdac and adjusted ebitdac margin - adjusted ebitdac is ebitdac adjusted to exclude gains realized from sales of books of business, acquisition integration costs, workforce related charges, lease termination related charges, claim portfolio transfer ramp up fees/costs, client run-off/bankruptcy costs, acquisition related adjustments, and the period-over-period impact of foreign currency translation, as applicable and adjusted ebitdac margin is adjusted ebitdac divided by total adjusted revenues (defined above). these measures for the brokerage and risk management segments provide a meaningful representation of our operating performance, and are also presented to improve the comparability of our results between periods by eliminating the impact of the items that have a high degree of variability.
   adjusted eps for the brokerage and risk management segments - we define this measure as net earnings adjusted to exclude the after-tax impact of gains realized from sales of books of business, acquisition integration costs, claim portfolio transfer ramp up fees/costs, client run-off/bankruptcy costs, workforce related charges, lease termination related charges and acquisition related adjustments, the period-over-period impact of foreign currency translation, as applicable, divided by diluted weighted average shares outstanding. this measure provides a meaningful representation of our operating performance (and as such should not be used as a measure of our liquidity), and is also presented to improve the comparability of our results between periods by eliminating the impact of the items that have a high degree of variability.
organic revenues (a non-gaap measure) - for the brokerage segment, organic change in base commission and fee revenues excludes the first twelve months of net commission and fee revenues generated from acquisitions and the net commission and fee revenues related to operations disposed of in each year presented. these commissions and fees are excluded from organic revenues in order to help interested persons analyze the revenue growth associated with the operations that were a part of our business in both the current and prior year. in addition, change in base commission and fee revenue organic growth excludes the period-over-period impact of foreign currency translation. for the risk management segment, organic change in fee revenues excludes the first twelve months of fee revenues generated from acquisitions and the fee revenues related to operations disposed of in each year presented. in addition, change in organic growth excludes the impact of claim portfolio transfer ramp up fees, client run-off bankruptcy costs, and the period-over-period impact of foreign currency translation to improve the comparability of our results between periods by eliminating the impact of the items that have a high degree of variability or due to the limited-time nature of these revenue sources.
these revenue items are excluded from organic revenues in order to determine a comparable, but non-gaap, measurement of revenue growth that is associated with the revenue sources that are expected to continue in 2017 and beyond. we have historically viewed organic revenue growth as an important indicator when assessing and evaluating the performance of our brokerage and risk management segments. we also believe that using this non-gaap measure allows readers of our financial statements to measure, analyze and compare the growth from our brokerage and risk management segments in a meaningful and consistent manner.
reconciliation of non-gaap information presented to gaap measures - this report includes tabular reconciliations to the most comparable gaap measures for adjusted revenues, adjusted compensation expense and adjusted operating expense, ebitdac, ebitdac margin, adjusted ebitdac, adjusted ebitdac margin, diluted net earnings per share (as adjusted) and organic revenue measures.
brokerage segment the brokerage segment accounted for 63% of our revenue in 2016. our brokerage segment is primarily comprised of retail and wholesale brokerage operations. our retail brokerage operations negotiate and place property/casualty, employer-provided health and welfare insurance and retirement solutions, principally for middle-market commercial, industrial, public entity, religious and not-for-profit entities. many of our retail brokerage customers choose to place their insurance with insurance underwriters, while others choose to use alternative vehicles such as self-insurance pools, risk retention groups or captive insurance companies. our wholesale brokerage operations assist our brokers and other unaffiliated brokers and agents in the placement of specialized, unique and hard-to-place insurance programs.
our primary sources of compensation for our retail brokerage services are commissions paid by insurance companies, which are usually based upon a percentage of the premium paid by insureds, and brokerage and advisory fees paid directly by our clients. for wholesale brokerage services, we generally receive a share of the commission paid to the retail broker from the insurer. commission rates are dependent on a number of factors, including the type of insurance, the particular insurance company underwriting the policy and whether we act as a retail or wholesale broker. advisory fees are dependent on the extent and value of services we provide. in addition, under certain circumstances, both retail brokerage and wholesale brokerage services receive supplemental and contingent commissions. a supplemental commission is a commission paid by an insurance carrier that is above the base commission paid, is determined by the insurance carrier and is established annually in advance of the contractual period based on historical performance criteria. a contingent commission is a commission paid by an insurance carrier based on the overall profit and/or volume of the business placed with that insurance carrier during a particular calendar year and is determined after the contractual period.
litigation and regulatory matters - a portion of our brokerage business includes the development and management of micro-captives, through operations we acquired in 2010 in our acquisition of the assets of tribeca strategic advisors (tribeca). a captive is an insurance company that insures the risks of its owner, affiliates or a group of companies. micro-captives are captive insurance companies that are subject to taxation only on net investment income under irc section 831(b). our micro-captive advisory services are under investigation by the internal revenue service (irs). additionally, the irs has initiated audits for the 2012 tax year of over 100 of the micro-captive insurance companies organized and/or managed by us. among other matters, the irs is investigating whether we have been acting as a tax shelter promoter in connection with these operations. while the irs has not made specific allegations relating to our operations or the pre-acquisition activities of tribeca, if the irs were to successfully assert that the micro-captives organized and/or managed by us do not meet the requirements of irc section 831(b), we could be subject to monetary claims by the irs and/or our micro-captive clients, and our future earnings from our micro-captive operations could be materially adversely affected, any of which event could negatively impact the overall captive business and adversely affect our consolidated results of operations and financial condition. we may also experience lost earnings due to the negative effect of an extended irs investigation on our clients and potential clients businesses. annual renewals for micro-captive clients generally occur during the fourth quarter. therefore, any negative impact from this investigation would likely have a disproportionate impact on fourth-quarter results. in 2016, 2015 and 2014, our micro-captive operations contributed less than $3.5 million of net earnings and less than $5.0 million of ebitdac to our consolidated results in any one year. due to the fact that the irs has not made any allegation against us or completed all of its audits of our clients, we are not able to reasonably estimate the amount of any potential loss in connection with this investigation.

acquisition integration costs include costs related to our july 2, 2014 acquisition of noraxis capital corporation (which we refer to as noraxis), our june 16, 2014 acquisition of crombie/oamps (which we refer to as crombie/oamps), our april 1, 2014 acquisition of oval group of companies (which we refer to as oval), our november 14, 2013 acquisition of giles group of companies (which we refer to as giles) and our august 1, 2015 acquisition of william gallagher associates insurance brokers (which we refer to wga) that are not expected to occur on an ongoing basis in the future once we fully assimilate these acquisitions. these costs relate to on-boarding of employees, communication system conversion costs, related performance compensation, redundant workforce, extra lease space, duplicate services and external costs incurred to assimilate the acquired businesses with our it related systems. the wga integration costs in 2016 totaled $5.0 million and were primarily related to retention and incentive compensation. the noraxis integration costs in 2016 totaled $1.9 million and were primarily related to the consolidation of offices, technology costs and incentive compensation. the crombie/oamps integration costs in 2016 totaled $3.2 million, and were primarily related to technology costs and incentive compensation. the giles and oval integration costs in 2016 totaled $35.6 million and were primarily related to the consolidation of offices in the u.k., technology costs, branding and incentive compensation. the noraxis integration costs in 2015 totaled $7.4 million and were primarily related to the consolidation of offices, technology costs and incentive compensation. the crombie/oamps integration costs in 2015 totaled $23.4 million, and were primarily related to technology costs and incentive compensation. the giles and oval integration costs in 2015 totaled $69.0 million and were primarily related to the consolidation of offices in the u.k., technology costs, branding and incentive compensation. integration costs related to these acquisitions for the full year in 2017 are estimated to be less than a third of what they were in 2016.
commissions and fees - the aggregate increase in commissions and fees for 2016 was principally due to revenues associated with acquisitions that were made during 2016 ($173.2 million). commissions and fees in 2016 included new business production of $359.7 million, which was offset by lost business and renewal rate decreases of $362.6 million. the aggregate increase in commissions and fees for 2015 was principally due to revenues associated with acquisitions that were made during 2015 ($390.6 million). commissions and fees in 2015 included new business production of $345.2 million, which was offset by lost business and renewal rate decreases of $287.3 million. commission revenues increased 4% and fee revenues increased 10% in 2016 compared to 2015, respectively. commission revenues increased 12% and fee revenues increased 22% in 2015 compared to 2014, respectively. the organic change in base commission and fee revenues was 3% in 2016, 3% in 2015 and 4% in 2014.

the increase in compensation expense in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to an increase in the average number of employees, salary increases, one-time compensation payments and increases in incentive compensation linked to our overall operating results ($81.1 million in the aggregate), increases in employee benefits expense ($15.7 million), stock compensation expense ($4.7 million), deferred compensation ($3.5 million) and temporary staffing ($0.5 million), offset by decreases in severance related costs ($2.5 million) and earnout related compensation expense ($0.9 million). the increase in employee headcount in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily relates to the addition of employees associated with the acquisitions that we completed in 2016 and new production hires.
the increase in compensation expense in 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily due to an increase in the average number of employees, salary increases, one-time compensation payments and increases in incentive compensation linked to our overall operating results ($195.6 million in the aggregate), increases in employee benefits expense ($27.2 million), severance related costs ($12.8 million), stock compensation expense ($4.4 million), and temporary staffing ($0.6 million), offset by a decrease in deferred compensation ($4.0 million). the increase in employee headcount in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily relates to the addition of employees associated with the acquisitions that we completed in 2015 and new production hires.

the decrease in operating expense in 2016 compared to 2015 was due primarily to favorable foreign currency translation ($3.2 million), decreases in business insurance ($15.3 million), technology expenses ($11.4 million), professional and banking fees ($5.6 million), licenses and fees ($3.7 million), other expense ($3.4 million), bad debt expense ($2.4 million), employee expense ($1.0 million), premium financing interest expense ($0.7 million), real estate expenses ($0.3 million), slightly offset by increases in meeting and client entertainment expenses ($4.2 million), outside consulting fees ($2.9 million), office supplies ($1.3 million) and lease termination charges ($0.2 million). also contributing to the increase in operating expense in 2016 were increased expenses associated with the acquisitions completed in 2016.
the increase in operating expense in 2015 compared to 2014 was due primarily to increases in technology expenses ($30.5 million), outside consulting fees ($16.3 million), business insurance ($12.9 million), real estate expenses ($11.4 million), meeting and client entertainment expenses ($10.0 million), professional and banking fees ($7.7 million), bad debt expense ($6.4 million), licenses and fees ($4.8 million), employee expense ($2.4 million), lease termination charges ($2.4 million), other expense ($2.3 million), outside services expense ($0.6 million), premium financing interest expense ($0.4 million), interest expense ($0.1 million) and unfavorable foreign currency translation ($1.3 million), slightly offset by a decrease in office supplies ($1.4 million). also contributing to the increase in operating expense in 2015 were increased expenses associated with the acquisitions completed in 2015.
depreciation - the increases in depreciation expense in 2016 compared to 2015 and in 2015 compared to 2014 were due primarily to the purchases of furniture, equipment and leasehold improvements related to office expansions and moves, and expenditures related to upgrading computer systems. also contributing to the increases in depreciation expense in 2016, 2015 and 2014 were the depreciation expenses associated with acquisitions completed during these years.
amortization - the increases in amortization in 2016 compared to 2015 and in 2015 compared to 2014 were due primarily to amortization expense of intangible assets associated with acquisitions completed during these years. expiration lists, non-compete agreements and trade names are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives (three to fifteen years for expiration lists, three to five years for non-compete agreements and five to ten years for trade names). based on the results of impairment reviews in 2016, 2015 and 2014, we wrote off $1.8 million, $11.5 million and $1.8 million of amortizable intangible assets related to the brokerage segment acquisitions.
change in estimated acquisition earnout payables - the change in the expense from the change in estimated acquisition earnout payables in 2016 compared to 2015 and 2015 compared to 2014 was due primarily to adjustments made to the estimated fair value of earnout obligations related to revised projections of future performance. during 2016, 2015 and 2014, we recognized $16.9 million, $16.2 million and $14.5 million, respectively, of expense related to the accretion of the discount recorded for earnout obligations in connection with our 2016, 2015 and 2014 acquisitions. during 2016, 2015 and 2014, we recognized $15.2 million, $24.9 million and $3.1 million of expense, respectively, related to net adjustments in the estimated fair market values of earnout obligations in connection with revised projections of future performance for 101, 103 and 67 acquisitions, respectively.
the amounts initially recorded as earnout payables for our 2012 to 2016 acquisitions were measured at fair value as of the acquisition date and are primarily based upon the estimated future operating results of the acquired entities over a two- to three-year period subsequent to the acquisition date. the fair value of these earnout obligations is based on the present value of the expected future payments to be made to the sellers of the acquired entities in accordance with the provisions outlined in the respective purchase agreements. in determining fair value, we estimate the acquired entitys future performance using financial projections developed by management for the acquired entity and market participant assumptions that were derived for revenue growth and/or profitability. we estimate future earnout payments using the earnout formula and performance targets specified in each purchase agreement and these financial projections. subsequent changes in the underlying financial projections or assumptions will cause the estimated earnout obligations to change and such adjustments are recorded in our consolidated statement of earnings when incurred. increases in the earnout payable obligations will result in the recognition of expense and decreases in the earnout payable obligations will result in the recognition of income.
provision for income taxes - we allocate the provision for income taxes to the brokerage segment using local statutory rates. the brokerage segments effective tax rate in 2016, 2015 and 2014 was 35.2% (35.4% on a controlling basis), 35.1% and 36.4%, respectively. we anticipate reporting an effective tax rate on adjusted results of approximately 34.0% to 36.0% in our brokerage segment for the foreseeable future. in third quarter 2016, new tax legislation was enacted in the u.k., which will decrease the u.k. corporation tax rate from the current 18% to 17% effective april 1, 2020. accordingly, we adjusted our deferred tax asset and liability balances in 2016 to reflect these rate changes, which decreased the provision for income taxes in the brokerage segment by $1.5 million, or $0.01 per share. in fourth quarter 2015, new tax legislation was enacted in the u.k., which will decrease the u.k. corporation tax rate from the current 20% to 19% effective april 1, 2017 and from 19% to 18% effective april 1, 2020. accordingly, we adjusted our deferred tax asset and liability balances in 2015 to reflect these rate changes, which decreased the provision for income taxes in the brokerage segment by $4.2 million, or $0.02 per share.
net earnings (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests - the amounts reported in this line for 2016, 2015 and 2014 include non-controlling interest earnings of $3.6 million, $1.7 million and $0.9 million, respectively, primarily related to our investment in capsicum reinsurance brokers llp (which we refer to as capsicum). we are partners in this venture with grahame chilton, the ceo of our international brokerage division. we are the controlling partner, participating in 33% of capsicums net operating results and mr. chilton owns approximately 50% of capsicum.
risk management segment the risk management segment accounted for 13% of our revenue in 2016. the risk management segment provides contract claim settlement and administration services for enterprises that choose to self-insure some or all of their property/casualty coverages and for insurance companies that choose to outsource some or all of their property/casualty claims departments. in addition, this segment generates revenues from integrated disability management programs, information services, risk control consulting (loss control) services and appraisal services, either individually or in combination with arising claims. revenues for risk management services are substantially in the form of fees that are generally negotiated in advance on a per-claim or per-service basis, depending upon the type and estimated volume of the services to be performed.

on november 18, 2014, we announced that a contract for the administration of workers compensation claims with the new south wales workers compensation scheme in australia would be moved to run-off status on december 31, 2014. our net earnings from this contract were approximately $3.5 million in 2014. we took a $12.9 million charge in the fourth quarter of 2014 primarily relating to a non-cash impairment of capitalized software and personnel costs dedicated to servicing the new south wales run-off contract, and in 2015 during we broke even on this contract in the run-off period.

the decrease in compensation expense in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to favorable foreign currency translation ($2.6 million) and decreases in salaries ($0.4 million in the aggregate), temporary-staffing expense ($2.2 million) and severance related costs ($0.3 million), offset by increased headcount, increases in employee benefits ($1.6 million), stock compensation expense ($0.9 million) and deferred compensation ($0.3 million).
the increase in compensation expense in 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily due to increased headcount and increases in salaries ($27.9 million in the aggregate), employee benefits ($1.8 million), severance related costs ($1.4 million), offset by favorable foreign currency translation ($12.6 million), decreases in claim portfolio transfer ramp up costs ($3.6 million), temporary-staffing expense ($1.3 million) and deferred compensation ($0.6 million).
depreciation - depreciation expense increased in 2016 compared to 2015 and 2015 compared to 2014, which reflects the impact of purchases of furniture, equipment and leasehold improvements related to office expansions and moves and expenditures related to upgrading computer systems.
amortization - amortization expense decreased in 2016 compared to 2015 and 2015 compared to 2014. historically, the risk management segment has made few acquisitions. we made no material acquisitions in this segment in 2016, 2015 or 2014. no indicators of impairment were noted in 2016, 2015 or 2014.
change in estimated acquisition earnout payables - the increase in income from the change in estimated acquisition earnout payables in 2016 compared to 2015 and the decrease in income from the change in estimated acquisition earnout payable 2015 compared to 2014 was due primarily to adjustments made in 2015 to the estimated fair value of an earnout obligation related to a revised projections of future performance for two acquisitions. during 2016, 2015 and 2014, we recognized zero, $0.5 million and $0.1 million, respectively, of income related to net adjustments in the estimated fair value of earnout obligations related to revised projections of future performance for two acquisitions.

                                                     revenues from consolidated clean coal production plants represents revenues from the consolidated irc section 45 facilities that we operate and control under lease arrangements, and the investments in which we have a majority ownership position and maintain control over the operations of the related plants, including those that are currently not operating. when we relinquish control in connection with the sale of majority ownership interests in our investments, we deconsolidate these operations.
controlling interest in chem-mod. as chem-mods manager, we are required to consolidate its operations.
   loss from unconsolidated clean coal production plants represents our equity portion of the pretax operating results from the unconsolidated clean coal production plants. the production of refined coal generates pretax operating losses.
the losses in 2016, 2015 and 2014 were low because the vast majority of our operations are now consolidated.
                                                 other net revenues include the following: in 2016, we recorded $0.8 million of rental income related to our new headquarters facility. we also recognized $0.8 million of equity basis accounting losses related to our legacy investments. in addition, we recognized a $1.3 million impairment loss related to clean coal production plants including engineering costs of $0.7 million incurred for two locations that will not be used.
in 2015, we settled litigation against certain former u.k. executives and their advisors for a pretax $31.0 million gain ($22.3 million net of costs and taxes). incremental expenses that arose in connection with this matter will result in after-tax charges of approximately $4.5 million per quarter through june 30, 2017, which will also be presented as an adjustment to the corporate segment. also in 2015 we recognized $0.7 million of equity basis accounting losses related to our legacy investments and $0.2 million of rental income related to our new headquarters facility.
in 2014, other net revenues primarily included a pretax gains of $25.6 million, related to the 2014 acquisition of an additional ownership interest in seven 2009 era plants and five 2011 era plants from a co-investor. we have consolidated the operations of the limited liability companies that own these plants effective as of the acquisition dates. in addition, in 2014 we also recognized a $1.8 million gain adjustment related to the 2013 acquisition of additional ownership interests in twelve 2009 era plants, a $2.0 million impairment loss, under equity method accounting, of an additional 4% investment in the global operations of c-quest technologies llc and c-quest technologies international llc, a $0.5 million loss related to two legacy investments and a $10.9 million impairment loss related to two of our clean coal production plants which permanently stopped operations. we also realized a $1.9 million hedge gain related to the funding of the crombie/oamps acquisition and earned $2.5 million of interest on cash deposited in australia to fund the crombie/oamps acquisition.
cost of revenues - cost of revenues from consolidated clean coal production plants in 2016, 2015 and 2014 consists of the cost of coal, labor, equipment maintenance, chemicals, supplies, management fees and depreciation incurred by the clean coal production plants to generate the consolidated revenues discussed above, including the costs to run the leased facilities.
the $10.6 million increase in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to an increase in retention agreement compensation related to the litigation settlement, an increase in incentive compensation due to clean energy performance and an increase in benefits expense.
the $11.7 million increase in 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily due to retention agreement compensation related to the litigation settlement, compensation for corporate staff working outside the u.s., an increase in incentive compensation due to clean energy performance, offset by the reduction in expense related to the 2014 de-risking strategy of our u.s. defined pension plan.
operating expense - operating expense for 2016 includes banking and related fees of $3.2 million, external professional fees and other due diligence costs related to 2016 acquisitions of $3.9 million, other corporate and clean energy related expenses of $5.7 million, $4.8 million for a biennial corporate-wide meeting, corporate related marketing costs of $7.0 million and $0.8 million related to the litigation settlement.
operating expense for 2015 includes banking and related fees of $2.7 million, external professional fees and other due diligence costs related to 2015 acquisitions of $3.7 million, other corporate and clean energy related expenses of $9.9 million, $3.8 million for a biennial corporate-wide meeting and $1.7 million related to the litigation settlement.
operating expense for 2014 includes banking and related fees of $2.7 million, external professional fees and other due diligence costs related to 2014 acquisitions of $18.9 million, other corporate and clean energy related expenses of $12.8 million and $2.2 million for a biennial corporate-wide meeting.

capitalization of interest costs related to the purchase and development of our new headquarters building         (2.6   )         (0.4   )
the capitalization of interest costs related to the purchase and development of our new corporate headquarters building will occur until the development of it is completed in early 2017.
depreciation - the increase in depreciation expense in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily relates to clean coal plants re-deployed in 2016 and 2015. the increase in depreciation expense in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily relates to the assets of the additional ownership interests in the clean coal plants that we acquired from co-investors in 2014 and clean coal plants re-deployed in 2015.
benefit for income taxes - we allocate the provision for income taxes to the brokerage and risk management segments using local statutory rates. as a result, the provision for income taxes for the corporate segment reflects the entire benefit to us of the irc section 45 credits generated, because that is the segment which produced the credits. the law that provides for irc section 45 tax credits substantially expires in december 2019 for our fourteen 2009 era plants and in december 2021 for our twenty 2011 era plants. our consolidated effective tax rate was (24.7)%, (32.6)% and (12.3)% for 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. the tax rates for 2016, 2015 and 2014 were lower than the statutory rate primarily due to the amount of irc section 45 tax credits recognized during the year. there were $194.4 million, $181.3 million and $145.5 million of tax credits produced and recognized in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
potential u.s. federal income tax law changes - the value of our tax credits could be impacted by changes in the tax code as a result of the recent presidential and congressional elections in the u.s. congress could modify or repeal irc section 45 and remove the tax credits (either prospectively or through the elimination of the carryover of the credits), which would adversely affect the value of our investment. also, if congress reduces tax rates, although we might pay less in taxes overall, it would reduce the tax benefit of operating costs associated with the production of refined coal. although we are unable to predict how a reduction in tax rates during 2017 would affect our cash taxes paid in 2017, we estimate that if the u.s. federal corporate income tax rate had been reduced from 35% to 20% and if the alternative minimum tax had been eliminated as of january 1, 2016, our cash taxes paid for fiscal 2016 would have been $39.1 million rather than $66.1 million.

(3)                          during the third quarter of 2015, we settled litigation against certain former u.k. executives and their advisors for a pretax gain of $31.0 million
($22.3 million net of costs and taxes in third quarter). incremental expenses that arose in connection with this matter will result in after-tax charges of up to $4.5 million per quarter through june 30, 2017.
interest and banking costs includes expenses related to our debt. clean energy related includes the operating results related to our investments in clean coal production plants and chem-mod. acquisition costs include professional fees, due diligence and other costs incurred related to our acquisitions. corporate consists of overhead allocations mostly related to corporate staff compensation, costs related to biennial company-wide award, cross-selling and motivational meetings for our production staff and field management, expenses related to our new corporate headquarters, corporate related marketing costs, and in 2016 and 2015, retention agreement compensation related to the litigation settlement.
clean energy investments - we have investments in limited liability companies that own 29 clean coal production plants developed by us and five clean coal production plants we purchased from a third party on september 1, 2013. all 34 plants produce refined coal using propriety technologies owned by chem-mod. we believe that the production and sale of refined coal at these plants are qualified to receive refined coal tax credits under irc section 45. the fourteen plants which were placed in service prior to december 31, 2009 (which we refer to as the 2009 era plants) can receive tax credits through 2019 and the twenty plants which were placed in service prior to december 31, 2011 (which we refer to as the 2011 era plants) can receive tax credits through 2021.
our portion of estimated our   additional                                    low range                        high range tax-effected   required                                           2017                              2017

the estimated earnings information in the table reflects managements current best estimate of the 2017 low and high ranges of after-tax earnings based on early production estimates from the host utilities, other operating assumptions, and u.s. federal income tax laws in place at december 31, 2016. however, coal-fired power plants may not ultimately produce refined fuel at estimated levels due to seasonal electricity demand, production costs, natural gas prices, weather conditions, as well as many other operational, regulatory and environmental compliance reasons. future changes in epa regulations or u.s. federal income tax laws might materially impact these estimates.
our investment in chem-mod generates royalty income from refined coal production plants owned by those limited liability companies in which we invest as well as refined coal production plants owned by other unrelated parties. future changes in epa regulations or u.s. federal income tax laws might materially impact these estimates.
we may sell ownership interests in some or all of the plants to co-investors and relinquish control of the plants, thereby becoming a non-controlling, minority investor. in any limited liability company where we are a non-controlling, minority investor, the membership agreement for the operations contains provisions that preclude an individual member from being able to make major decisions that would denote control. as of any future date we become a non-controlling, minority investor, we would deconsolidate the entity and subsequently account for the investment using equity method accounting.
we currently have $2.7 million of construction commitments related to our refined coal plants.
we are aware that some of the coal-fired power plants that purchase the refined coal are considering changing to burning natural gas rather than coal, or shutting down completely for economic reasons. the entities that own such plants are prepared to move the refined coal plants to another coal-fired power plant, if necessary. if these potential developments were to occur, we estimate those refined coal plants will not operate for 12 to 18 months during their movement and redeployment, and the new coal-fired power plant may be a higher or lower volume plant, all of which could have a material impact on the amount of tax credits that are generated by these plants.
there is a provision in irc section 45 that phases out the tax credits if the coal reference price per ton, based on market prices, reaches certain levels as follows:
(1)   the irs will not release the factors for 2017 until april or may 2017. based on our analysis of the factors used in the irs phase out calculations, it is our belief that there will be no phase out in 2017.
see the risk factors regarding our irc section 45 investments under item 1a, risk factors. for a more detailed discussion of these and other factors could impact the information above. see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding risks and uncertainties related to these investments.
financial condition and liquidity liquidity describes the ability of a company to generate sufficient cash flows to meet the cash requirements of its business operations. the insurance brokerage industry is not capital intensive. historically, our capital requirements have primarily included dividend payments on our common stock, repurchases of our common stock, funding of our investments, acquisitions of brokerage and risk management operations and capital expenditures.
cash flows from operating activities historically, we have depended on our ability to generate positive cash flow from operations to meet a substantial portion of our cash requirements. we believe that our cash flows from operations and borrowings under our credit agreement will provide us with adequate resources to meet our liquidity needs in the foreseeable future. to fund acquisitions made during 2016, 2015 and 2014, we relied on a combination of net cash flows from operations, proceeds from borrowings under our credit agreement, proceeds from issuances of senior unsecured notes, issuances of our common stock, and a secondary public offering of our common stock in april 2014, in which 21.85 million shares of our stock were issued for net proceeds, after underwriting discounts and other expenses related to this offering, of $911.4 million.
cash provided by operating activities was $622.1 million, $652.6 million and $436.6 million for 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. the decrease in cash provided by operating activities in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to timing differences in the receipts and disbursements of client fiduciary related balances in 2016 compared to 2015. the following table summarizes three lines from our consolidated statement of cash flows and provides information that management believes is helpful when comparing changes in client fiduciary related balances for 2016, 2015 and 2014 (in millions):
in addition, cash provided by operating activities for 2016 was impacted by an unrealized foreign currency measurement loss of $112.7 million compared to an unrealized foreign currency measurement loss of $154.4 million in 2015 and by acquisition related integration costs in 2016 and 2015. the increase in cash provided by operating activities in 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily due to favorable timing differences in the payment of accrued liabilities and an increased amount of non-cash charges in 2015 compared to 2014, partially offset by cash used in 2015 in the production and sale of refined coal at the plants qualified to receive refined
coal tax credits under irc section 45. in addition, cash provided by operating activities for 2015 was adversely impacted by an unrealized foreign currency measurement loss of $154.4 million compared to an unrealized foreign currency measurement loss of $141.5 million in 2014 and an increase in acquisition related integration costs in 2015. also negatively impacting cash provided by operating activities between 2015 and 2014 was cash payments related to compensation-based retention agreements. during second quarter 2015, we entered into compensation-based retention agreements with certain key employees of our international brokerage operations. we estimate that these retention agreements will add after-tax charges of approximately $4.5 million per quarter through june 30, 2017 to our compensation expense. our cash flows from operating activities are primarily derived from our earnings from operations, as adjusted for realized gains and losses, and our non-cash expenses, which include depreciation, amortization, change in estimated acquisition earnout payables, deferred compensation, restricted stock, and stock-based and other non-cash compensation expenses. cash provided by operating activities can be unfavorably impacted by the amount of irc section 45 tax credits recognized compared to the amount of tax credits actually used during the respective periods. excess tax credits produced during the period result in an increase to our deferred tax assets, which is a net use of cash related to operating activities.
when assessing our overall liquidity, we believe that the focus should be on net earnings as reported in our consolidated statement of earnings, adjusted for non-cash items (i.e., ebitdac), and cash provided by operating activities in our consolidated statement of cash flows. net earnings attributable to controlling interests were $414.4 million and $356.8 million. consolidated ebitdac was $849.6 million and $771.3 million for 2016 and 2015, respectively. we believe that ebitdac items are indicators of trends in liquidity. from a balance sheet perspective, we believe the focus should not be on premium and fees receivable, premiums payable or restricted cash for trends in liquidity. net cash flows provided by operations will vary substantially from quarter to quarter and year to year because of the variability in the timing of premiums and fees receivable and premiums payable. we believe that in order to consider these items in assessing our trends in liquidity, they should be looked at in a combined manner, because changes in these balances are interrelated and are based on the timing of premium payments, both to and from us. in addition, funds legally restricted as to our use relating to premiums and clients claim funds held by us in a fiduciary capacity are presented in our consolidated balance sheet as restricted cash and have not been included in determining our overall liquidity.
our policy for funding our defined benefit pension plan is to contribute amounts at least sufficient to meet the minimum funding requirements under the irc. the employee retirement security act of 1974, as amended (which we refer to as erisa), could impose a minimum funding requirement for our plan. we were not required to make any minimum contributions to the plan for the 2016 and 2015 plan years. funding requirements are based on the plan being frozen and the aggregate amount of our historical funding. the plans actuaries determine contribution rates based on our funding practices and requirements. funding amounts may be influenced by future asset performance, the level of discount rates and other variables impacting the assets and/or liabilities of the plan. in addition, amounts funded in the future, to the extent not due under regulatory requirements, may be affected by alternative uses of our cash flows, including dividends, acquisitions and common stock repurchases. during 2016 and 2015 we did not make discretionary contributions to the plan. we are not considering making additional discretionary contributions to the plan in 2017, but may be required to make significantly larger minimum contributions to the plan in future periods.
see note 12 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information required to be disclosed relating to our defined benefit postretirement plans. we are required to recognize an accrued benefit plan liability for our underfunded defined benefit pension and unfunded retiree medical plans (which we refer to together as the plans). the offsetting adjustment to the liabilities required to be recognized for the plans is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive earnings (loss), net of tax, in our consolidated balance sheet. we will recognize subsequent changes in the funded status of the plans through the income statement and as a component of comprehensive earnings, as appropriate, in the year in which they occur. numerous items may lead to a change in funded status of the plans, including actual results differing from prior estimates and assumptions, as well as changes in assumptions to reflect information available at the respective measurement dates.
in august 2014, we decided to pursue a pension de-risking strategy to reduce the size of our long-term u.s. defined benefit pension plan obligations and the volatility of these obligations on our balance sheet. on september 12, 2014, the fiduciaries of the plan began offering certain former employees who were participants in the plan, the option of receiving the value of their pension benefit in a lump sum payment or as an accelerated reduced annuity, in lieu of monthly annuity payments when they retire. the voluntary offer was made to approximately 2,500 terminated, vested participants in the plan whose employment terminated with the company prior to august 1, 2014 and who had not commenced benefit payments as of november 1, 2014. eligible participants had from september 12, 2014 to november 30, 2014 to accept the offer, and the lump-sum payments were made in november and december of 2014, and the accelerated reduced annuity payments began as of december 1, 2014. the aggregate lump sum payout made in fourth quarter 2014 was $43.3 million. all payouts related to this offer were made using assets from the plan. this lump sum payout project reduced the plans pension benefit obligation by approximately $60.0 million, while improving its pension underfunding by almost $17.0 million as of december 31, 2014. due to this significant obligation settlement, we incurred a non-cash pre-tax charge of approximately $12.0 million in fourth quarter 2014, as a result of the u.s. gaap requirement to expense the portion of the unrealized actuarial losses currently recognized as accumulated other comprehensive loss, based on a ratio of the liability settled to the total liability within the plan at december 31, 2014.
in 2016, the funded status of the plans was unfavorably impacted by a decrease in the discount rates used in the measurement of the pension liabilities at december 31, 2016, the impact of which was approximately $8.2 million. however, the funded status was favorably impacted by returns on the plans assets being higher in 2016 than anticipated by approximately $0.3 million and improvements in the mortality assumptions of $4.3 million and other pension gains of $4.4 million. the net change in the funded status of the plan in 2016 resulted in a decrease in noncurrent liabilities in 2016 of $0.8 million. while the change in funded status of the plans had no direct impact on our cash flows from operations in 2016, 2015 and 2014, potential changes in the pension regulatory environment and investment losses in our pension plan have an effect on our capital position and could require us to make significant contributions to our defined benefit pension plan and increase our pension expense in future periods.
cash flows from investing activities capital expenditures - net capital expenditures were $217.8 million, $99.0 million and $81.5 million for 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, of which $112.1 million, $13.3 million and $16.3 million, respectively, related to expenditures on our new corporate headquarters building. in 2017, we expect total expenditures for capital improvements to be approximately $135.0 million, part of which is related to expenditures on our new corporate headquarters building (approximately $20.0 million), office moves and expansions and updating computer systems and equipment. relating to the development of our new corporate headquarters, we expect to receive property tax related credits under a tax-increment financing note from rolling meadows, illinois and an illinois state edge tax credit. incentives from these two programs could total between $60.0 million and $80.0 million over a fifteen-year period. the net capital expenditures in 2016, 2015 and 2014 primarily related to capitalized costs associated with expenditures on our new corporate headquarters building in 2016 and 2015 and the implementation of new accounting and financial reporting systems and several other system initiatives that occurred in 2016, 2015 and 2014.
acquisitions - cash paid for acquisitions, net of cash acquired, was $327.3 million, $342.3 million and $1,918.3 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. the decreased use of cash for acquisitions in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to a decrease in the number of acquisitions that occurred in 2016. the decreased use of cash for acquisitions in 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily due to a decrease in the number of acquisitions that occurred in 2015. in addition, during 2016, 2015 and 2014 we issued 2.0 million shares ($89.6 million), 7.3 million shares ($338.9 million) and 6.5 million shares ($292.8 million), respectively, of our common stock as payment for a portion of the total consideration paid for acquisitions and earnout payments. we completed 37, 44 and 60 acquisitions in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. annualized revenues of businesses acquired in 2016, 2015 and 2014 totaled approximately $137.9 million, $230.8 million and $761.2 million, respectively. in 2017, we expect to use our debt, cash from operations and our common stock to fund all or a portion of acquisitions we complete.
dispositions - during 2016, 2015 and 2014, we sold several books of business and recognized one-time gains of $6.6 million, $6.7 million and $7.3 million, respectively. we received cash proceeds of $7.8 million, $9.2 million and $8.2 million, respectively, related to these transactions.
clean energy investments - during the period from 2009 through 2016, we have made significant investments in clean energy operations capable of producing refined coal that we believe qualifies for tax credits under irc section 45. our current estimate of the 2017 annual net after tax earnings, including irc section 45 tax credits, which will be produced from all of our clean energy investments in 2017, is $117.0 million to $133.0 million. the irc section 45 tax credits generate positive cash flow by reducing the amount of federal income taxes we pay, which is offset by the operating expenses of the plants, by capital expenditures related to the redeployment, and in some cases the relocation of refined coal plants. we anticipate positive net cash flow related to irc section 45 activity in 2017. however, there are several variables that can impact net cash flow from clean energy investments in any given year. therefore, accurately predicting positive or negative cash flow in particular future periods is not possible at this time. nonetheless, if current ownership interests remain the same, if capital expenditures related to redeployment and relocation of refined coal plants remain as currently anticipated, and if we continue to generate sufficient taxable income to use the tax credits produced by our irc section 45 investments, we anticipate that these investments will continue to generate positive net cash flows for the period 2017 through at least 2021. while we cannot precisely forecast the cash flow impact in any particular period, we anticipate that the net cash flow impact of these investments will be positive overall. please see clean energy investments on pages 48 to 50 for a more detailed description of these investments (including the reference therein to risks and uncertainties).
cash flows from financing activities on april 8, 2016 we entered into an amendment and restatement to our multicurrency credit agreement dated september 19, 2013 (which we refer to as the credit agreement), with a group of fifteen financial institutions. the amendment and restatement, among other things, extended the expiration date of the credit agreement from september 19, 2018 to april 8, 2021 and increased the revolving credit commitment from $600.0 million to $800.0 million, of which $75.0 million may be used for issuances of standby or commercial letters of credit and up to $75.0 million may be used for the making of swing loans, (as defined in the credit agreement). we may from time to time request, subject to certain conditions, an increase in the revolving credit commitment under the credit agreement up to a maximum aggregate revolving credit commitment of $1,100.0 million. there were $278.0 million of borrowings outstanding under the credit agreement at december 31, 2016. due to the outstanding borrowing and letters of credit, $500.9 million remained available for potential borrowings under the credit agreement at december 31, 2016.
we use the credit agreement to post letters of credit and to borrow funds to supplement our operating cash flows from time to time. during 2016, we borrowed an aggregate of $2,740.0 million and repaid $2,657.0 million under our credit agreement. principal uses of the 2016 borrowings under the credit agreement were to fund acquisitions, earnout payments related to acquisitions and general corporate purposes. during 2015, we borrowed an aggregate of $849.0 million and repaid $794.0 million under our credit agreement. principal uses of the 2015 borrowings under the credit agreement were to fund acquisitions, earnout payments related to acquisitions and general corporate purposes. during 2014, we borrowed an aggregate of $1,109.9 million and repaid $1,500.4 million under our credit agreement. principal uses of the 2014 borrowings under the credit agreement were to fund acquisitions, earnout payments related to acquisitions and general corporate purposes.
we have a secured revolving loan facility (which we refer to as the premium financing debt facility), that provides funding for the three australian (au) and new zealand (nz) premium finance subsidiaries. the premium financing debt facility is comprised of: (i) facility b, with is separated into au$150.0 million and nz$35.0 million tranches, (ii) facility c, an au$25.0 million equivalent multi-currency overdraft tranche and (iii) facility d, a nz$15.0 million equivalent multi-currency overdraft tranche. the premium financing debt facility expires may 18, 2017. at december 31, 2016, $125.6 million of borrowings were outstanding under the premium financing debt facility.
we use the premium financing debt facility to borrow funds to fund the premium financing activities of three of our australian (au) and new zealand (nz) subsidiaries. in 2016 and 2015, we had net borrowings of $(12.2) million and $23.9 million, respectively, on the premium financing debt facility.
at december 31, 2016, we had $2,728.0 million of corporate-related borrowings outstanding under separate note purchase agreements entered into in the period 2007 to 2016 and a cash and cash equivalent balance of $545.5 million. see note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the terms of the note purchase agreements and the credit agreement.
we completed a $275.0 million, ten year maturity, private placement debt transaction in 2016, with a weighted average interest rate of 4.47%. in 2016, we entered into a pre-issuance interest rate hedging transaction related to the $175.0 million 10 year tranche of the $275.0 million private placement debt. we realized a cash gain of approximately $1.0 million on the hedging transaction that will be recognized on a pro rata basis as a reduction in our reported interest expense over the ten year life of the debt.
on november 30, 2016, we funded the $50.0 million 2016 maturity of our series c note.
we completed a $100.0 million, eleven year maturity, private placement debt transaction on december 1, 2016, with an interest rate of 3.46%. a portion of the proceeds was used to fund the $50.0 million of private placement debt that matured on november 30, 2016.
we anticipate raising at least $300.0 million in the second half of 2017, primarily to refinance the august 2017, $300.0 million maturity of our series b note.
the note purchase agreements, the credit agreement and the premium financing debt facility contain various financial covenants that require us to maintain specified financial ratios. we were in compliance with these covenants as of december 31, 2016.
dividends - our board of directors determines our dividend policy. our board of directors determines dividends on our common stock on a quarterly basis after considering our available cash from earnings, our anticipated cash needs and current conditions in the economy and financial markets.
in 2016, we declared $272.5 million in cash dividends on our common stock, or $1.52 per common share. on december 16, 2016, we paid a fourth quarter dividend of $0.38 per common share to shareholders of record as of december 2, 2016. on january 25, 2017, we announced a quarterly dividend for first quarter 2017 of $0.39 per common share. if the dividend is maintained at $0.39 per common share throughout 2017, this dividend level would result in an annualized net cash used by financing activities in 2017 of approximately $278.1 million (based on the outstanding shares as of december 31, 2016), or an anticipated increase in cash used of approximately $5.9 million compared to 2016. we can make no assurances regarding the amount of any future dividend payments.
common stock repurchases - we have in place a common stock repurchase plan approved by our board of directors. we repurchased 2.3 million shares of our common stock at cost of $101.0 million (7.7 million remain available). we did not repurchase any shares in 2015 and 2014. under the provisions of the repurchase plan, we were authorized to repurchase approximately 10,000,000 additional shares at december 31, 2016. the plan authorizes the repurchase of our common stock at such times and prices as we may deem advantageous, in transactions on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. we are under no commitment or obligation to repurchase any particular number of shares, and the plan may be suspended at any time at our discretion. funding for share repurchases may come from a variety of sources, including cash from operations, short-term or long-term borrowings under our credit agreement or other sources. there were no common stock repurchases made in 2015 and 2014 that impacted our consolidated financial statements.
at-the-market equity program - on november 20, 2013, we entered into an equity distribution agreement with morgan stanley & co. llc, pursuant to which we may offer and sell, from time to time, up to $200 million (of which $15.6 million is remaining) of our common stock through morgan stanley as sales agent. pursuant to the agreement, shares may be sold by means of ordinary brokers transactions, including on the new york stock exchange, at market prices prevailing at the time of sale, at prices related to the prevailing market prices, or at negotiated prices, in block transactions, or as otherwise agreed upon by us and morgan stanley. during 2016, we did not sell any shares of our common stock under the program.
common stock issuances - another source of liquidity to us is the issuance of our common stock pursuant to our stock option and employee stock purchase plans. proceeds from the issuance of common stock under these plans were $45.6 million in 2016, $54.1 million in 2015 and $56.3 million in 2014.
outlook - we believe that we have sufficient capital to meet our short- and long-term cash flow needs.
contractual obligations and commitments in connection with our investing and operating activities, we have entered into certain contractual obligations and commitments. see notes 7, 13 and 15 to our consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of these obligations and commitments. our future minimum cash payments, including interest, associated with our contractual obligations pursuant to our note purchase agreements and credit agreement, operating leases and purchase commitments as of december 31, 2016 are as follows (in millions):
credit agreement                            278.0                                                                                                                         278.0
premium financing debt facility             125.6                                                                                                                         125.6
the amounts presented in the table above may not necessarily reflect our actual future cash funding requirements, because the actual timing of the future payments made may vary from the stated contractual obligation. outstanding purchase commitments in the table above include $10.6 million related to expenditures on our new corporate headquarters building. in addition, due to the uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash flows associated with our unrecognized tax benefits at december 31, 2016, we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period in which cash settlements may be made with the respective taxing authorities. therefore, $14.5 million of unrecognized tax benefits have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above. see note 17 to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion on income taxes.
see note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the terms of the credit agreement and note purchase agreements.
off-balance sheet arrangements off-balance sheet commitments - our total unrecorded commitments associated with outstanding letters of credit, financial guarantees and funding commitments as of december 31, 2016 are as follows (in millions):
total amount of commitment expiration by period       amounts off-balance sheet commitments   2017              2018              2019              2020              2021                     thereafter     committed letters of credit                        $                $                $                $                $                   $21.1         $21.1
funding commitments                     2.7                                                                                         0.7           3.4
total commitments                      $2.9              $0.2              $0.2              $0.2              $0.2                   $23.2         $26.9
since commitments may expire unused, the amounts presented in the table above do not necessarily reflect our actual future cash funding requirements. see note 15 to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our funding commitments related to our corporate segment and the off-balance sheet debt section below for a discussion of other letters of credit. all of the letters of credit represent multiple year commitments that have annual, automatic renewing provisions and are classified by the latest commitment date.
since january 1, 2002, we have acquired 420 companies, all of which were accounted for using the acquisition method for recording business combinations. substantially all of the purchase agreements related to these acquisitions contain provisions for potential earnout obligations. for all of our acquisitions made in the period from 2013 to 2016 that contain potential earnout obligations, such obligations are measured at fair value as of the acquisition date and are included on that basis in the recorded purchase price consideration for the respective acquisition. the amounts recorded as earnout payables are primarily based upon estimated future operating results of the acquired entities over a two- to three-year period subsequent to the acquisition date. the aggregate amount of the maximum earnout obligations related to these acquisitions was $527.2 million, of which $242.3 million was recorded in our consolidated balance sheet as of december 31, 2016 based on the estimated fair value of the expected future payments to be made.
off-balance sheet debt - our unconsolidated investment portfolio includes investments in enterprises where our ownership interest is between 1% and 50%, in which management has determined that our level of influence and economic interest is not sufficient to require consolidation. as a result, these investments are accounted for under the equity method. none of these unconsolidated investments had any outstanding debt at december 31, 2016 and 2015 that was recourse to us.
at december 31, 2016, we had posted two letters of credit totaling $9.3 million, in the aggregate, related to our self-insurance deductibles, for which we have recorded a liability of $12.3 million. we have an equity investment in a rent-a-captive facility, which we use as a placement facility for certain of our insurance brokerage operations. at december 31, 2016, we had posted seven letters of credit totaling $6.3 million to allow certain of our captive operations to meet minimum statutory surplus requirements and for additional collateral related to premium and claim funds held in a fiduciary capacity, one letter of credit totaling $5.0 million to support our potential obligation under a clients insurance program and one letter of credit totaling $0.5 million as a security deposit for a 2015 acquisitions lease. these letters of credit have never been drawn upon.

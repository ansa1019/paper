item 1a.   risk factors
the statements in this section describe the major risks to our business and should be considered carefully, in connection with all of the other information set forth in this annual report on form 10-k. the risks that follow are those that we think, individually or in the aggregate, could cause our actual results to differ materially from those stated or implied in forward-looking statements.
failure to execute our opportunistic buying strategy and inventory management could adversely affect our results.
while opportunistic buying, operating with lean inventory levels and frequent inventory turns are key elements of our off-price business strategy, they subject us to risks related to the pricing, quantity, mix, nature and timing of inventory flowing to our stores. our merchants are in the marketplace frequently, as much of our merchandise is purchased for the current or immediately upcoming season, and our opportunistic buying places considerable discretion with them. our business model expects them to react to frequently changing opportunities and trends in the market, assess the desirability and value of merchandise and generally make determinations of how and what we source as well as when we source it. if we do not obtain the right merchandise at the right times, in the right quantities, at the right prices and in the right mix, our customer traffic, as well as our sales and margins, could be adversely affected.
we base our purchases of inventory, in part, on our sales forecasts. if our sales forecasts do not match customer demand, we may experience higher inventory levels and need to take markdowns on excess or slow-moving inventory, leading to decreased profit margins, or we may have insufficient inventory to meet customer demand, leading to lost sales, either of which could adversely affect our financial performance.
if we are unable to generally purchase inventory at prices sufficiently below prices paid by conventional retailers, we may not be able to maintain an overall pricing differential to regular department and specialty stores, and our ability to attract customers or sustain our margins may be adversely affected. we may not achieve this pricing differential at various times or in some segments, chains or geographies, which could adversely affect our results.
similarly, we must also properly execute our inventory management strategy of distributing the right product to the right stores in the right quantities at the right time. to respond to customer demand and effectively manage pricing and markdowns, we need to appropriately allocate and deliver merchandise to our stores, maintain an appropriate mix and level of inventory in each store, and appropriately change the allocation of floor space at our stores among product categories. if we are not able to do so, our ability to attract and retain customers and our results could be adversely affected.
failure to continue to expand our business and operations successfully or to manage our substantial size and scale effectively could adversely affect our financial results.
our growth strategy includes successfully expanding our off-price model within our current markets and into new geographic regions, product lines, businesses and channels and, as appropriate, adding new businesses, whether by development, investment or acquisition. there are significant risks associated with our ability to continue to expand successfully, including managing the implementation of this growth effectively. if any aspect of our expansion strategy does not achieve the success we expect, in whole or in part, we may fail to meet our financial performance expectations, be required to increase our investment, slow our planned growth or close stores or operations. for example, successful store growth requires us to find and lease appropriate real estate on attractive terms in each of the locations where we seek to open stores. the success of this process depends on many factors, including availability of appropriate sites; real estate, construction and development costs; costs and availability of capital; and zoning or other land use regulations. if we cannot lease appropriate sites on attractive terms, it could limit our ability to successfully grow in various markets or adversely affect the economics of new stores in various markets. similarly, new stores may not achieve the same sales or profit
levels as our existing stores, whether in current or new markets, or adding stores or banners to existing markets may otherwise adversely affect our sales and profitability.
further, our substantial size imposes demands on effectively managing our complex operations and maintaining appropriate internal resources and third party providers to support our business effectively. these demands may increase as we grow our business, adding pressure to management and various functions across our business, including administration, systems, merchandising, store operations, distribution and compliance, and on appropriately staffing and training associates in these areas as we grow. the large size and scale of our operations, our multiple banners and locations in the u.s., canada, europe and australia and the autonomy afforded to the banners in some aspects of the business increase the risk that our systems, controls, practices and policies will not be implemented effectively or consistently throughout our company and that information may not be appropriately shared across our operations. these risks may increase as we continue to grow, particularly as we expand into additional countries. if business information is not shared effectively, or if we are otherwise unable to manage our size or growth effectively, we may operate with decreased operational efficiency, may need to reduce our rate of expansion of one or more operations or otherwise curtail growth in one or more markets, which may adversely affect our success in executing our business goals and adversely impact our sales and results.
failure to identify consumer trends and preferences to meet customer demand in new or existing markets or channels could negatively impact our performance.
as our success depends on our ability to meet customer demand, we work to identify consumer trends and preferences on an ongoing basis and to offer inventory that meets those trends and preferences. however, doing so on a timely basis across our diverse merchandise categories and in the many markets in the u.s., canada, europe and australia in which we do business is challenging. trends and preferences in new markets may differ from what we anticipate. although our business model allows us greater flexibility than many traditional retailers to meet consumer preferences and trends and to expand and contract merchandise categories in response to consumersÂ’ changing tastes, we may not successfully do so, which could add difficulty in attracting new customers, retaining existing customers, encouraging frequent visits and adversely affect our results.
customers may also have expectations about how they shop in stores or through e-commerce or more generally engage with businesses across different channels (through internet-based and other digital or mobile channels or particular forms of social media outlets), which may vary across demographics and may evolve rapidly. meeting these expectations effectively involves identifying the right opportunities and making the right investments at the right time and with the right speed, among other things, and failure to do so may impact our reputation and our financial results.
if we fail to successfully implement our various marketing efforts or if our competitors are more effective with their programs than we are, our revenue or results of operations may be adversely affected.
customer traffic and demand for our merchandise may be influenced by our marketing efforts, the name recognition and reputation of our banners and the location of and service offered in our stores. although we use marketing to drive customer traffic through various media including television, radio, print, outdoor, digital/social media, email, mobile and direct mail, some of our competitors expend more for their programs than we do, or use different approaches than we do, which may provide them with a competitive advantage. further, we may not effectively implement strategies with respect to rapidly evolving internet-based and other digital or mobile communication channels and other social media. our programs may not be or remain effective or could require increased expenditures, which could have a significant adverse effect on our revenue and results of operations.
we operate in highly competitive markets, and we may not be able to compete effectively.
the retail apparel and home fashion businesses are highly competitive. we compete with local, regional, national and international retailers that sell apparel, home fashions and other merchandise we sell, including in stores, through e-commerce, catalogues or other media or channels. some of our competitors are larger than we are or have more experience in selling certain product lines than we do. new competitors frequently enter the
market and existing competitors enter or increase their presence in the markets in which we operate, expand their merchandise offerings, add new sales channels or change their pricing strategies, all of which affect the competitive landscape. we compete on the basis of value, meaning a combination of brand, fashion, price, and quality; merchandise selection and freshness; banner name recognition and appeal; customer service; reputation and store location. if we fail to compete effectively, our sales and results of operations could be adversely affected.
failure to employ quality associates in appropriate numbers, including key associates and management, could adversely affect our performance.
our performance depends on recruiting, hiring, developing, training and retaining talented associates in key areas such as buying and management as well as quality store, systems, distribution center and other associates in large numbers. a significant number of our associates are in entry level or part-time positions with historically high rates of turnover. availability and skill of associates may differ across markets in which we do business and in new markets we enter, and we may be unable to manage our labor needs effectively. in addition, because of the distinctive nature of our off-price model, we must provide significant internal training and development for key associates across the company, including within our buying organization. similar to other retailers, we face challenges in securing and retaining sufficient talent in management and other key areas for many reasons, including competition in the retail industry and for talent in various geographic markets. if we do not effectively attract qualified individuals, train them in our business model, support their development and retain them, our growth could be limited and our performance could be adversely affected.
labor costs, including pension and healthcare costs, and other challenges from our large workforce may adversely affect our results and profitability.
we have a large workforce, and our ability to meet our labor needs and control labor costs is subject to various factors such as unemployment levels; prevailing wage rates and wage requirements; participant benefit levels; changing demographics; economic conditions; interest rate changes; economic, demographic and other actuarial assumptions; health and other insurance costs and a dynamic regulatory environment, including health care legislation, immigration law, and governmental labor and employment and employee benefits programs and requirements, each of which could increase our costs. increased labor costs, including costs of providing and managing retirement, health and other employment benefits may adversely affect our results of operations. in addition, when wage rates or benefit levels increase in a market, increasing our wages or benefits may negatively impact our earnings as they did during fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2017, while failing to increase our wages or benefits competitively or reducing our wages or benefits, could result in a decline in our ability to attract or retain associates or in the quality of our workforce, causing our customer service or performance to suffer, which could impact our results. many associates in our distribution centers are members of unions and therefore subject us to the risk of labor actions of various kinds as well as risks and potential material expenses associated with multiemployer plans, including from plan underfunding, benefit cuts, withdrawal liability, or insolvency of other participating employers or governmental insurance programs. other associates are members of works councils, which may subject us to additional actions or expense.
compromises of our data security could materially harm our reputation and business.
in the ordinary course of our business, we collect, store, process and transmit certain information from individuals, such as our customers and associates, including, for example, customer payment card and check information. we rely in part on commercially available systems, software, hardware, services, tools and monitoring to provide security for collection, storage, processing, and transmission of personal and/or confidential information. as with many other companies, particularly in the retail industry, we are subject to attempts to compromise our data security. computer hackers may, for example, attempt to penetrate our computer systems or those of the third parties with whom we work or to whom we outsource business operations and, if successful, misappropriate customer or associate information or confidential business information of our company. while we have taken steps designed to further strengthen the security of our computer systems since the unauthorized intrusion(s) into our network discovered late in 2006, in which we believe customer data were stolen, there can be no assurance that we will not suffer a future data security
compromise, that unauthorized parties will not gain access to the information that we collect, store, process or transmit or otherwise interfere with our systems, or that any such data security compromise or unauthorized access will be discovered in a timely way. in addition, an associate, contractor or third parties with whom we work or to whom we outsource business operations may fail to monitor their or our systems effectively, may fail to maintain appropriate safeguards, may misuse the personal or confidential information to which they have access, may attempt to circumvent our security measures in order to access or misappropriate such types of information or may purposefully or, through error, inadvertently cause a breach involving, or otherwise disclose, such information. advances in computer and software technology and capabilities, rapid changes in the sources, methods and targets of cyber-attacks and other developments, including the increasing sophistication of cyber criminals generally, may increase the risk of such a breach.
compromise of our data security or that of third parties with whom we work or to whom we outsource business operations, including through cyber-attacks or other external or internal methods or error, failure to prevent or mitigate the loss of personal or business information and delays in detecting any such compromise or loss could disrupt our operations, damage our reputation and decrease our customersÂ’ willingness to shop in our stores or online, impact our ability to attract and retain customers, violate applicable laws, regulations, orders and agreements, and subject us to additional costs and liabilities which could be material.
failure to operate information systems and implement new technologies effectively could disrupt our business or reduce our sales or profitability.
we rely extensively on various information systems, including data centers, telecommunications systems, hardware and software and applications to manage many aspects of our business, including to process and record transactions in our stores, to enable effective communication systems, to source, plan and track inventory, to manage logistics, to generate performance and financial reports, to comply with regulatory requirements and to operate our e-commerce sites. we are dependent on the integrity, security and consistent operations of these systems and related back-up systems. supporting these internal and external systems requires a number of resources, including effective and qualified, and in some cases, specialized, teams. as we grow and as our systems evolve, we must continue to hire, train, manage and retain these teams, including those needed to support our customized and legacy systems in an effective way. our information systems, and the third-party systems we rely on, are also subject to damage or interruption from a number of causes, including power outages; system failures; computer viruses or malware; security breaches; cyber-attacks; catastrophic events such as fires, floods, earthquakes, tornadoes and hurricanes; acts of war or terrorism; and design or usage errors by our associates, contractors or third party service providers on which we rely. although we seek to maintain our systems effectively, manage our team of internal and third party resources effectively and successfully address the risk of compromises of the integrity, security and consistent operations of our systems, we may not be successful in doing so. our approach to disaster recovery may not be adequate and any compromises, interruptions or shutdowns of our systems, including those managed by third parties, whether intentional or inadvertent, could lead to delays in our business operations and, if significant or extreme, affect our results of operations. in addition, any interruption in the operation of our websites, particularly our e-commerce sites, could cause us to suffer reputational harm or to lose sales if customers are unable to access our site or purchase merchandise from us during such an interruption.
we modify, update, and replace our systems and infrastructure from time to time, including by adding new hardware, software and applications; maintaining, updating or replacing legacy programs; converting to global systems; integrating new service providers and adding enhanced or new functionality, such as for cloud computing technologies and for the continued operation and development of our e-commerce businesses; and adding or integrating with new systems when we acquire new businesses. we also modify and change our procedures for, and add and change vendors and internal teams who assist us with designing, implementing and maintaining our systems. although we believe we are diligent in selecting systems, teams and vendors and implementing procedures to enable us to maintain the integrity of our systems when we implement, modify or replace them, there are inherent risks associated with implementing, modifying or replacing systems, with new or changed relationships and with changes from and integrations with acquisitions, including accurately capturing and maintaining data, efficiently testing and implementing changes in a timely manner, realizing the expected
benefit of the change and managing the potential disruption of the operation of the systems and diversion of internal teamsÂ’ attention as the changes are implemented. further, potential issues associated with implementing technology initiatives and the time and resources required in seeking to optimize the benefits of new elements of our systems and its infrastructure could reduce the efficiency of our operations in the short term. overall, the efficient operation and successful growth of our business depends upon our information systems, including our ability to operate, maintain and develop them effectively and a failure of those systems could disrupt our business, subject us to liability or otherwise impact our financial results.
economic conditions, on a global level or in particular markets, may adversely affect our financial performance.
global financial markets can experience volatility, disruption and credit contraction, which could adversely affect global economic conditions. turmoil in the financial and credit markets or other changes in economic conditions could adversely affect sources of liquidity available to us or our costs of capital and could adversely affect plan asset values and investment performance, and increase our pension liabilities, expenses and funding requirements and other related financial exposure with respect to company-sponsored and multiemployer pension plans. economic conditions, both on a global level and in particular markets, including unemployment, decreased disposable income and actual and perceived wealth, energy and health care costs, costs of oil, gas and other commodities, interest and tax rates and policies, weakness in the housing market, volatility in capital markets, decreased credit availability, inflation and deflation, as well as political or other factors beyond our control such as threats or possibilities of war, terrorism, global or national unrest, actual or threatened epidemics, and political instability may also have significant effects on consumer confidence and spending that would, in turn, affect retail sales. these conditions and factors could adversely affect discretionary consumer spending and, although we believe our flexible off-price model helps us react, they may adversely affect our sales, cash flows and results of operations and performance.
adverse or unseasonable weather in the markets in which our stores operate or along our supply chain could adversely affect our operating results.
both adverse and unseasonable weather, such as storms, severe cold or heat or unseasonable temperatures, even if not extreme, may affect customersÂ’ buying patterns and willingness to shop certain categories or at all, and accordingly, can adversely affect the demand for the merchandise in our stores, particularly in apparel and seasonal merchandise. weather can also affect the ability to transport merchandise to our stores from our vendors, distribution and shipping centers or elsewhere in our supply chain efficiently or in a timely way. as a result, adverse or unseasonable weather could adversely affect our sales, increase markdowns and adversely affect our operating results.
as our business is subject to seasonal influences, a decrease in sales or margins, a severe disruption or other significant event that impacts our business during the second half of the year could have a disproportionately adverse effect on our operating results.
our business is subject to seasonal influences. we generally realize higher levels of sales and earnings in the second half of the year, which includes the back-to-school and year-end holiday seasons. any decrease in sales or margins or any significant adverse event during this period could have a disproportionately adverse effect on our results of operations.
unforeseen public health issues, such as pandemics and epidemics, natural or other disasters, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, earthquakes and other extreme weather and climate conditions, or fires, explosions and acts of war or terrorism could disrupt our operations or the operations of one or more of our vendors or of our supply chain or could severely damage or destroy one or more of our stores or distribution facilities located in the affected areas. day-to-day operations, including our ability to receive products from our vendors or transport products to our stores could be adversely affected, or we could be required to close stores or distribution centers in the affected areas or in areas served by affected distribution centers for a short or extended period of time. as a result, our business could be adversely affected.
we believe that building the brand reputation of our company and our retail banners is important to our continuing success. in the many different markets in which we do business, we work to build relationships with our customers through our various marketing campaigns and other activities. these relationships and our reputation are based, in part, on perceptions of subjective qualities, so incidents involving us, our employees, our policies, the merchandise that we carry or our industry more generally that erode trust or confidence could adversely affect our reputation and our business, particularly if the incidents result in rapid or significant adverse publicity or governmental inquiry. information about us, our retail banners, our employees, our policies, and the merchandise we sell, including our licensed or owned brands, publicized through traditional or digital media platforms and similar venues, including blogs, websites, and other forums for rapid, broad communications to an audience of consumers and other interested persons, may adversely affect our reputation and brand, even if the information is inaccurate, incomplete or unverified. the reputation of our company and our retail banners may be damaged by adverse events at the corporate level or at our retail banners, or by an associate acting outside of company policies in all, one or some of the markets in which we do business. similarly, challenges or reactions to action (or inaction) or perceived action (or inaction) by our company on issues like compliance related to social, product, labor and environmental standards or other sensitive topics, could harm our reputation. damage to the reputation of our company and our banners could result in declines in customer loyalty and sales; affect our vendor relationships, business development opportunities and associate retention; divert attention and resources from management, including to respond to inquiries or additional regulatory scrutiny; and otherwise adversely affect our results.
quality, safety or other issues with merchandise we sell could damage our reputation, sales and financial results.
various governmental authorities in the jurisdictions where we do business regulate the quality and safety of the merchandise we sell to consumers. regulations and standards in this area, including those related to the u.s. consumer product safety improvement act of 2008, state regulations like californiaÂ’s proposition 65, and similar legislation in other countries in which we operate, impose restrictions and requirements on the merchandise we sell in our stores and through e-commerce. these regulations change from time to time and new federal, state, provincial or local regulations in the u.s. and other countries that may affect our business are contemplated and enacted with some regularity. if we or our merchandise vendors are unable to comply with regulatory requirements on a timely basis or at all, or to adequately monitor new regulations that may apply to existing or new merchandise categories or in new geographies, significant fines or penalties could be incurred or we could have to curtail some aspects of our sales or operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results. we rely on our vendors to provide quality merchandise that complies with applicable product safety laws and other applicable laws, but they may not comply with their obligations to do so. although our arrangements with our vendors frequently provide for indemnification for product liabilities, the vendors may fail to honor those obligations to an extent we consider sufficient or at all. customer concerns or issues with the quality and safety of merchandise, particularly with products subject to increased levels of regulation, or the genuineness of merchandise, regardless of whether verified or our fault, could cause damage to our reputation and could result in lost sales, uninsured claims or losses, merchandise recalls and increased costs, and regulatory, civil or criminal fines or penalties, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.
failure to comply with existing laws, regulations and orders or changes in existing laws, regulations and applicable accounting principles and interpretations could negatively affect our business operations and financial performance.
we are subject to federal, state, provincial, regional and local laws, rules and regulations in various countries in which we operate, any of which may change from time to time, as well as orders and assurances. these legal, regulatory and administrative requirements collectively affect multiple aspects of our business, from the cost of providing health care and retirement benefits, workforce management, logistics, marketing, import/export, sourcing and manufacturing, tax, data protection and others. if we, or third parties that perform services on our
behalf, fail to comply with these laws, rules, regulations and orders, we may be subject to judgments, fines or other costs or penalties, which could materially adversely affect our operations and our financial results and condition.
complying with applicable laws, rules and regulations and our own internal policies may also require us to spend additional time and resources to implement new procedures and financial and other controls, conduct audits, train associates and third parties on our compliance methods or take other actions, particularly as we continue to grow globally and enter new markets or countries, any of which could adversely impact our results.
we must also comply with new and changing laws and regulations, new regulatory initiatives, evolving interpretation of existing laws by judicial and regulatory authorities, and reforms in jurisdictions where we do business. these changes could increase our costs of compliance or of doing business and could adversely affect our operating results, including such changes involving:
Â—   labor and employment practices and benefits, including regarding labor unions and works councils;
Â—   health and welfare and financial regulations;
Â—   consumer protection and product safety;
Â—   data protection and privacy;
Â—   climate change, supply chain, energy and waste;
Â—   internet regulations, including e-commerce, electronic communications and privacy; and
particularly in a dynamic regulatory environment, anticipated changes to laws and regulations may require us to invest in compliance efforts before changes are certain.
further, applicable accounting principles and interpretations may change from time to time, and the changes could have material effects on our future or previously reported financial results.
we have a significant retail presence in canada and in countries in europe and have established buying offices around the world. we have expanded our operations into additional countries in europe and into australia and our goal is to continue to expand our operations into other countries in the future. it can be costly and complex to establish, develop and maintain international operations and promote business in new international jurisdictions, which may differ significantly from other countries in which we currently operate. in addition to facing risks similar to our u.s. and current international operations, such as with regulations like the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act and the u.k. bribery act, there are additional risks inherent in opening and developing operations in new countries. these additional risks include, among others, understanding the local retail climate and trends, local customs and cultures, seasonal differences, business practices and competitive conditions; complying with relevant laws, rules and regulations; developing the appropriate infrastructure; identifying suitable partners for local operations and for integration with our global operations and effectively communicating and implementing company policies and practices in new, possibly remote jurisdictions. there are also financial, regulatory and other risks associated with international operations, including currency exchange fluctuations; potentially adverse tax consequences; limitations on the repatriation and investment of funds outside of the country where earned; trade regulations; the risk of sudden policy or regulatory changes; the risk of political, economic and civil instability and labor unrest; and uncertainties regarding interpretation, application and enforceability of laws and agreements. any of these risks could adversely impact our operations, profitability or liquidity.
we are subject to risks associated with sourcing merchandise from other countries and moving merchandise internationally.
importer of record, we may be subject to regulatory or other requirements including those similar to requirements imposed upon the manufacturer of such products. we are subject to the various risks of sourcing merchandise from other countries, including moving merchandise internationally, such as:
Â—   potential disruptions in manufacturing, logistics and supply;
Â—   changes in duties, tariffs, trade restrictions, quotas and voluntary export restrictions on imported merchandise, including, for example, new potential tariffs and border adjustment taxes or changes resulting from brexit;
Â—   transport capacity and costs;
Â—   information technology challenges;
Â—   problems in third-party distribution and warehousing and other interruptions of the supply chain;
Â—   consumer perceptions of the safety or quality of imported merchandise;
Â—   product and international trade compliance with laws and regulations of the destination country;
Â—   compliance with laws and regulations including changing labor, environmental, international trade and other laws in those countries and those concerning ethical business practices, such as the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act and the u.k. bribery act;
Â—   product liability claims from customers or penalties from government agencies relating to products that are recalled, defective or otherwise noncompliant or alleged to be harmful;
Â—   intellectual property enforcement and infringement issues;
Â—   concerns about human rights, working conditions and other labor rights and conditions in countries where merchandise is produced;
Â—   concerns about transparent sourcing and supply chains;
Â—   currency exchange rates, financial or economic instability; and
Â—   political or other disruptions in countries from, to or through which merchandise is imported.
these and other factors relating to international trade and imported merchandise beyond our control could affect the availability and the price of our inventory and our operating costs. furthermore, although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to facilitate compliance with laws and regulations relating to international operations and importing merchandise, there can be no assurance that our associates and our contractors, agents, vendors or other third parties with whom we do business or to whom we outsource business operations will not violate such laws and regulations or our policies, which could subject us to liability and could adversely affect our reputation, operations or operating results.
our results may be adversely affected by reduced availability or increases in the price of oil or other fuels, raw materials and other commodities or other increases in utility, transportation or logistics costs.
energy and fuel costs can fluctuate dramatically and, at times, have resulted in significant cost increases, particularly for the price of oil and gasoline. an increase in the price of oil increases our transportation costs for distribution, utility costs for our retail stores and costs to purchase our products from suppliers. although we typically enter into derivative instruments designed to manage a portion of our transportation costs (a hedging strategy), any such strategy may not be effective or sufficient and could result in increased operating costs. increased regulation related to environmental costs, including cap and trade, carbon taxes or other emissions management systems could also adversely affect our costs of doing business, including utility, transportation and logistics costs. similarly, other commodity prices can fluctuate dramatically, such as the cost of cotton and synthetic fabrics, which at times have risen significantly. such increases can increase the cost of merchandise, which could adversely affect our performance through potentially reduced consumer demand or reduced margins.
fluctuations in currency exchange rates may lead to lower revenues and earnings.
sales made by our stores outside the united states are denominated in the currency of the country in which the store is located, and changes in currency exchange rates affect the translation of the sales and earnings of these businesses into u.s. dollars for financial reporting purposes. because of this, movements in currency exchange rates have had and are expected to continue to have a significant impact on our consolidated and segment results from time to time. changes in currency exchange rates can also increase the cost of inventory purchases that are denominated in a currency other than the local currency of the business buying the merchandise. when exchange rates change significantly in a short period or move unfavorably over an extended period, as in recent years, it can be difficult for us to adjust retail prices accordingly, and gross margin can be adversely affected. in addition, a significant amount of merchandise we offer for sale is made in china and accordingly, a revaluation of chinese currency, or increased market flexibility in the exchange rate for that currency, increasing its value relative to the u.s. dollar or currencies in which our stores are located, could be significant.
additionally, we routinely enter into inventory-related derivative instruments (a hedging strategy) to mitigate the impact of currency exchange rates on merchandise margins of merchandise purchases by our segments denominated in currencies other than their local currencies. in accordance with gaap, we evaluate the fair value of these derivative instruments and make mark-to-market adjustments at the end of each accounting period. these adjustments are of a much greater magnitude when there is significant volatility in currency exchange rates and may have a significant impact on our earnings.
although we implement foreign currency hedging and risk management strategies to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in earnings and cash flows associated with changes in currency exchange rates, we expect that currency exchange rate fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on our sales and results of operations from time to time. in addition, fluctuations in currency exchange rates may have a greater impact on our earnings and operating results if a counterparty to one of our hedging arrangements fails to perform.
our quarterly operating results fluctuate and may fall short of prior periods, our projections or the expectations of securities analysts or investors, which could adversely affect our stock price.
our operating results have fluctuated from quarter to quarter at points in the past, and they may do so in the future. if we fail to increase our results over prior periods, to achieve our projected results or to meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors, our stock price may decline, and the decrease in the stock price may be disproportionate to the shortfall in our financial performance. results may be affected by various factors, including those described in these risk factors. we maintain a forecasting process that seeks to project sales and align expenses. if we do not control costs or appropriately adjust costs to actual results, or if actual results differ significantly from our forecast, our financial performance could be adversely affected. in addition, if we do not repurchase the number of shares we contemplated pursuant to our stock repurchase programs, our earnings per share may be adversely affected.
if we engage in mergers or acquisitions or investments in new businesses, or divest, close or consolidate any of our current businesses, our business will be subject to additional risks.
we may acquire new businesses (as we did with trade secret in fiscal 2016 and stp in fiscal 2013), invest in or enter into joint ventures with other businesses, develop new businesses internally (as with our new home store concept) and divest, close or consolidate businesses. failure to execute on mergers, acquisitions, investments, divestitures, closings and consolidations in a satisfactory manner could adversely affect our future results of operations and financial condition. acquisition, investment or divestiture activities may divert attention of management from operating the existing businesses, and we may not effectively evaluate target companies, investments or investment partners or assess the risks, benefits and cost of buying, investing in or closing businesses or of the integration of acquired businesses, all of which can be difficult, time-consuming and dilutive. these activities may not meet our performance and other expectations and may expose us to unexpected or greater-than-expected costs, liabilities and risks. in addition, we have recorded intangible assets and goodwill and the value of the tradenames in connection with our acquisitions of trade secret and stp and
may similarly do so in the future in connection with other acquisitions. if we are unable to realize the anticipated benefits from acquisitions, we may be required to impair some or all of the goodwill associated with an acquisition, which could adversely impact our results of operations and balance sheet. divestitures, closings and consolidations could involve risks such as significant costs and obligations of closure, including exposure on leases, owned real estate and other contractual, employment, pension and severance obligations, and potential liabilities that may arise under law as a result of the disposition or the subsequent failure of an acquirer.
our results may be materially adversely affected by the outcomes of litigation, legal proceedings and other legal or regulatory matters.
we are involved, or may in the future become involved, in legal proceedings, regulatory reviews, audits and other legal matters. these may involve inquiries, investigations, lawsuits and other proceedings by local, provincial, state and federal governmental entities (in the united states and other countries) and private plaintiffs, including with respect to employment and employee benefits including classification, employment rights, discrimination, wage and hour and retaliation; whistle blower claims; tax; securities; disclosure; real estate; tort; business practices; consumer protection; privacy/data security; product safety and compliance; advertising; and intellectual property. there continue to be a number of employment-related and consumer protection lawsuits, including putative class actions, in the united states, and we are subject to these types of suits. we cannot predict the results of legal and regulatory proceedings with certainty, and actual results may differ from any reserves we establish estimating the probable outcome. regardless of merit or outcome, litigation can be both time-consuming and disruptive to our operations and may cause significant expense and diversion of management attention. legal and regulatory proceedings and investigations could expose us to significant defense costs, fines, penalties and liability to private parties and governmental entities for monetary recoveries and other amounts and attorneysÂ’ fees and/or require us to change aspects of our operations, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
tax matters could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
we are subject to income and other taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions. our effective income tax rate and future tax liability could be adversely affected by numerous factors including the results of tax audits and examinations, income before taxes being lower than anticipated in countries with lower statutory income tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries with higher statutory income tax rates, changes in income tax rates, changes in transfer pricing, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in applicable tax legislation, regulations and treaties, exposure to additional tax liabilities, including interest and penalties, and changes in accounting principles and interpretations relating to tax matters, any of which could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition in future periods. significant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our worldwide provision and accruals for taxes, and actual results may differ from our estimations.
in addition, we are subject to the continuous examination of our tax returns and reports by federal, state, provincial and local tax authorities in the u.s. and foreign countries, and the examining authorities may challenge positions we take. we are engaged in various proceedings, which are at various stages, with such authorities with respect to assessments, claims, deficiencies and refunds. we regularly assess the likely outcomes of these proceedings to determine the adequacy and appropriateness of our provision for income taxes, and increase and decrease our provision as a result of these assessments. however, the developments in and actual results of proceedings or the result of rulings by or settlements with tax authorities and courts or due to changes in facts, law or legal interpretations, expiration of applicable statutes of limitations or other resolutions of tax positions could differ from the amounts we have accrued for such proceedings in either a positive or a negative manner, which could materially affect our effective income tax rate in a given financial period, the amount of taxes we are required to pay and our results of operations. in addition, we are subject to tax audits and examinations for payroll, value added, sales-based and other taxes relating to our businesses.
our real estate leases generally obligate us for long periods, which subjects us to financial risks.
we lease virtually all of our store locations, generally for an initial term of 10 years, with options to renew the term, in the u.s. and canada or an initial term of 10 to 15 years in europe. in addition, we either own or lease for long periods our primary distribution centers and administrative offices. accordingly, we are subject to the risks associated with leasing and owning real estate, which can adversely affect our results. while we have the right to terminate some of our leases under specified conditions, including by making specified payments, we may not be able to terminate a particular lease if or when we would like to do so. if we decide to close stores, we are generally required to continue to perform obligations under the applicable leases, which generally include, among other things, paying rent and operating expenses for the balance of the lease term, or paying to exercise rights to terminate, and the performance of any of these obligations may be expensive. when we assign leases or sublease space to third parties, or if we sell a business, we can remain liable on the lease obligations if the assignee or sublessee does not perform (as was the case with some of our former operations). in addition, when the lease term for the stores in our ongoing operations expire, we may be unable to negotiate renewals, either on commercially acceptable terms or at all, which could cause us to close stores or to relocate stores within a market on less favorable terms.
we depend upon strong cash flows from our operations to supply capital to fund our operations, growth, stock repurchases and dividends and interest and debt repayment.
our business depends upon our operations to continue to generate strong cash flow to supply capital to support our general operating activities, to fund our growth and our return of cash to stockholders through our stock repurchase programs and dividends, and to pay our interest and debt repayments. our inability to continue to generate sufficient cash flows to support these activities or to repatriate cash from our international operations in a manner that is cost effective could adversely affect our growth plans and financial performance including our earnings per share. we borrow on occasion to finance our activities and if financing were not available to us in adequate amounts and on appropriate terms when needed, it could also adversely affect our financial performance.
item 7. managementÂ’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the discussion that follows relates to our 52-week fiscal years ended january 28, 2017 (fiscal 2017), january 30, 2016 (fiscal 2016) and january 31, 2015 (fiscal 2015).
overview we are the leading off-price apparel and home fashions retailer in the u.s. and worldwide. we sell a rapidly changing assortment of apparel, home fashions and other merchandise at prices generally 20% to 60% below department and specialty store regular prices on comparable merchandise, every day. we operate over 3,800 stores through our four main segments: in the u.s., marmaxx (which operates t.j. maxx, marshalls and tjmaxx.com) and homegoods; tjx canada (which operates winners, homesense and marshalls in canada); and tjx international, (which operates t.k. maxx, homesense and tkmaxx.com in europe, and trade secret in australia). in the u.s. we also operate sierra trading post (stp), an off-price internet retailer with a small number of stores. the results of stp are reported in our marmaxx segment.
fiscal 2017 was another successful year for tjx. we posted a strong increase in net sales and solid earnings per share growth on top of strong increases in both fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015. we continued to generate strong cash flows, allowing us to return value to our shareholders through cash dividends and share repurchases. in addition, we continue to reinvest in our business by adding new stores and remodeling existing ones, while continuing to strengthen our infrastructure in support of our continuing growth, and we implemented the second phase of our wage initiative to raise wages for u.s. hourly store associates.
highlights of our financial performance for fiscal 2017 include the following:
Â—   same store sales increased 5% in fiscal 2017 over an increase of 5% in fiscal 2016 and an increase of 2% in fiscal 2015. the fiscal 2017 increase was driven primarily by an increase in customer traffic.
Â—   net sales increased to $33.2 billion for fiscal 2017, up 7% over the same period last year. net sales increased to $30.9 billion for fiscal 2016, up 6% over the prior year. at january 28, 2017, the number of stores in operation increased 5% and selling square footage increased 4% over the end of fiscal 2016.
Â—   earnings per share for fiscal 2017 were $3.46 per diluted share compared to $3.33 per diluted share in fiscal 2016. fiscal 2017 earnings per share was reduced by
Â—   our cost of sales ratio for fiscal 2017 was 71.0%, a 0.2 percentage point decrease compared to the fiscal 2016 ratio. this improvement was driven by an increase in merchandise margin.
Â—   our selling, general and administrative expense ratio for fiscal 2017 increased 0.6 percentage points to 17.4% from 16.8% in fiscal 2016. this increase is primarily due to higher store payroll costs due to wage increases and investments to support our growth.
Â—   our consolidated average per store inventories, including inventory on hand at our distribution centers (which excludes inventory in transit) and excluding our e-commerce businesses, were down 5% (down 4% on a constant currency basis) at the end of fiscal 2017 as compared to the prior year.
Â—   during fiscal 2017, we repurchased 22.3 million shares of our common stock for $1.7 billion. earnings per share reflect the benefit of the stock repurchase program. in january 2017, our board of directors authorized our 18th stock repurchase program for an additional $1.0 billion.
net sales: consolidated net sales for fiscal 2017 totaled $33.2 billion, a 7% increase over $30.9 billion in fiscal 2016. the increase reflected a 5% increase from same store sales and a 4% increase from new stores,
offset by a 2% negative impact from foreign currency exchange rates. net sales from our e-commerce businesses amount to approximately 1% of total sales and had an immaterial impact on fiscal 2017 sales growth. consolidated net sales for fiscal 2016 totaled $30.9 billion, a 6% increase over $29.1 billion in fiscal 2015. the increase reflected a 5% increase from same store sales and a 4% increase from new stores, offset by a 3% negative impact from foreign currency exchange rates.
same store sales increases in the u.s. for fiscal 2017 were primarily due to an increase in customer traffic. we also had a strong increase in units sold which was largely offset by a reduction in the average ticket. in fiscal 2017, home fashions performed better than apparel but both recorded strong same store sales growth. geographically, in the u.s., sales were strong in virtually all regions, with the southeast and the great lakes regions reporting the highest same store sales growth. in canada, same store sales increases were well above the consolidated average while tjx international was below the consolidated average.
same store sales increases in the u.s. for fiscal 2016 were due to an increase in customer traffic. we also had a strong increase in units sold which was offset by a reduction in the average ticket. in fiscal 2016, home fashions performed better than apparel but both recorded strong same store sales growth. geographically, in the u.s., sales were strong in virtually all regions, with the southeast reporting the highest same store sales growth. in canada, same store sales increases were well above the consolidated average while tjx international was slightly below the consolidated average.
we define same store sales to be sales of those stores that have been in operation for all or a portion of two consecutive fiscal years, or in other words, stores that are starting their third fiscal year of operation. the sales of our e-commerce businesses, meaning sierra trading post (including stores), tjmaxx.com and tkmaxx.com, are not included in same store sales. we classify a store as a new store until it meets the same store sales criteria. the recently acquired trade secret stores will be included in same store sales when they meet the above definition. we determine which stores are included in the same store sales calculation at the beginning of a fiscal year and the classification remains constant throughout that year, unless a store is closed. we calculate same store sales results by comparing the current and prior year weekly periods that are most closely aligned. relocated stores and stores that have increased in size are generally classified in the same way as the original store, and we believe that the impact of these stores on the consolidated same store percentage is immaterial. same store sales of our foreign segments are calculated by translating the current yearÂ’s same store sales of our foreign segments at the same exchange rates used in the prior year. this removes the effect of changes in currency exchange rates, which we believe is a more accurate measure of segment operating performance. we define customer traffic to be the number of transactions in stores included in the same store sales calculation and define average ticket to be the average retail price of the units sold. we define average transaction or average basket to be the average dollar value of transactions included in the same store sales calculation.
the following table sets forth our consolidated operating results as a percentage of net sales:
cost of sales, including buying and occupancy costs                  71.0                            71.2                            71.5
income before provision for income taxes*                            11.2    %                       11.8    %                       12.2   %
impact of foreign currency exchange rates: our operating results are affected by foreign currency exchange rates as a result of changes in the value of the u.s. dollar in relation to other currencies. two ways in which foreign currency exchange rates affect our reported results are as follows:
Â—                                                  translation of foreign operating results into u.s. dollars: in our financial statements, we translate the operations of tjx canada and tjx international from local currencies into u.s. dollars using currency rates in effect at different points in time. significant changes in foreign exchange rates between comparable prior periods can result in meaningful variations in consolidated net sales, net income and earnings per share growth as well as the net sales and operating results of these segments. currency translation generally does not affect operating margins as a percentage of net sales, or affects them only slightly, as sales and expenses of the foreign operations are translated at approximately the same rates within a given period.
Â—                                                  inventory-related derivatives: we routinely enter into inventory-related hedging instruments to mitigate the impact on earnings of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on merchandise purchases denominated in currencies other than the local currencies of our divisions, principally tjx canada and tjx international. as we have not elected Â“hedge accountingÂ” for these instruments as defined by u.s. generally accepted accounting principles (gaap), we record a mark-to-market gain or loss on the derivative instruments in our results of operations at the end of each reporting period. in subsequent periods, the income statement impact of the mark-to-market adjustment is effectively offset when the inventory being hedged is received and paid for. while these effects occur every reporting period, they are of much greater magnitude when there are sudden and significant changes in currency exchange rates during a short period of time. the mark-to-market adjustment on these derivatives does not affect net sales, but it does affect the cost of sales, operating margins and earnings we report.
we refer to the impact of the above two items throughout our discussion as Â“foreign currency.Â” this does not include the impact currency exchange rates can have on various transactions that are denominated in a currency other than an operating divisionÂ’s local currency. when discussing the impact on our results of the effect of currency exchange rates on such transactions we refer to it as Â“transactional foreign exchange.Â”
cost of sales, including buying and occupancy costs: cost of sales, including buying and occupancy costs, as a percentage of net sales was 71.0% in fiscal 2017 compared to 71.2% in fiscal 2016 and 71.5% in fiscal 2015. the improvement in this expense ratio was driven by an increase in our profit margin on merchandise sold (merchandise margin) along with leverage on buying and occupancy costs as a result of the 5% same store sales increase. together these two items benefitted the fiscal 2017 expense ratio by approximately 0.5 percentage points. merchandise margin improved despite the continued pressure transactional foreign exchange had on the cost of merchandise at our foreign segments this year versus the prior year. although not as significant as in fiscal 2016, the change in exchange rates continued to impact the cost of merchandise that was denominated in currencies other than our foreign segmentsÂ’ local currency, primarily the u.s. dollar. these improvements were partially offset by higher supply chain costs and the negative impact of the mark to market of inventory derivatives.
the improvement in the fiscal 2016 expense ratio as compared to fiscal 2015 was driven by leverage on buying and occupancy costs as a result of the 5% same store sales increase along with an increase in merchandise margin. similar to fiscal 2017, together these two items benefitted the fiscal 2016 expense ratio by approximately 0.5 percentage points. merchandise margin improved despite the negative impact transactional foreign exchange had on the cost of merchandise for tjx canada and europe for fiscal 2016 versus fiscal 2015. the change in exchange rates increased the cost of merchandise purchased by tjx canada and europe that were denominated in currencies other than the divisionsÂ’ respective local currency, primarily the u.s. dollar. this expense ratio was also negatively impacted by increased freight and distribution costs associated with moving more units through our supply chain and the mark to market of inventory derivatives.
selling, general and administrative expenses: selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales were 17.4% in fiscal 2017, 16.8% in fiscal 2016 and 16.1% in fiscal 2015. the increase in this ratio in fiscal 2017 was primarily due to a combination of higher employee payroll costs, due to wage
increases, investments to support our growth and supply chain costs, partially offset by the favorable impact of reduced contributions to the tjx charitable foundations in fiscal 2017.
similar to fiscal 2017, the increase in this ratio in fiscal 2016 was primarily due to a combination of higher employee payroll costs, due to our wage initiative and an increase in supply chain costs, along with our incremental investments. in addition the fiscal 2016 expense ratio was unfavorably impacted by higher contributions to tjxÂ’s charitable foundations in fiscal 2016 as compared to the prior year.
loss on early extinguishment of debt: on september 12, 2016 we issued $1.0 billion of 2.25% ten year notes. we used a portion of the proceeds to redeem our $375 million 6.95% notes on october 12, 2016, prior to their scheduled maturity of april 15, 2019. we recorded a pre-tax loss on the early extinguishment of debt of $51.8 million.
pension settlement charge: during the fiscal 2017 third quarter, we offered eligible former tjx associates, who had not yet commenced receiving their qualified pension plan benefit, an opportunity to receive a lump sum payout of their vested pension benefit. on october 21, 2016, tjxÂ’s qualified pension plan paid $103.2 million from pension plan assets to those who accepted this offer. this transaction had no cash impact on tjx, but did result in a non-cash pre-tax settlement charge of $31.2 million.
interest expense, net: the components of interest expense, net for the last three fiscal years are summarized below:
capitalized interest             (7,548   )                (7,984   )                (9,403   )
the decrease in net interest expense for fiscal 2017 is due to additional interest income as a result of an increase in investments as well as an increase in interest rates.
the increase in net interest expense for fiscal 2016 reflects interest expense in fiscal 2016 on the financing lease obligation related to tjx canadaÂ’s new home office of $3.7 million. the increase in net interest expense also reflects a reduction in capitalized interest costs and interest income in fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015.
income taxes: our effective annual income tax rate was 38.3% in fiscal 2017, 37.7% in fiscal 2016 and 37.6% in fiscal 2015. the increase in the fiscal 2017 income tax rate was due to the jurisdictional mix of income and the valuation allowance on foreign net operating losses. in addition, the fiscal 2016 effective income tax rates benefitted from a reduction in our reserve for uncertain tax positions related to our adoption of the new tangible property regulations. the increase in the fiscal 2016 effective income tax rate, as compared to fiscal 2015, was primarily due to the jurisdictional mix of income and the valuation allowance on foreign net operating losses.
net income and diluted earnings per share: net income was $2.3 billion in fiscal 2017, a 1% increase over $2.3 billion in fiscal 2016, which in turn was a 3% increase over $2.2 billion in fiscal 2015. diluted earnings per share were $3.46 in fiscal 2017, $3.33 in fiscal 2016 and $3.15 in fiscal 2015. the third quarter charges from the loss on early extinguishment of debt and the pension settlement, collectively reduced fiscal 2017 net income by $50.0 million, or $0.07 per share. foreign currency exchange rates also affected the comparability of our results. foreign currency exchange rates had a $0.07 negative impact on earnings per share in fiscal 2017 when compared to fiscal 2016, and a $0.09 negative impact in fiscal 2016 when compared to fiscal 2015.
our stock repurchase programs, which reduce our weighted average diluted shares outstanding, benefited our earnings per share growth by approximately 3% in each fiscal year. we repurchased 22.3 million shares of our stock at a cost of $1.7 billion in fiscal 2017, 26.5 million shares of our stock at a cost of $1.8 billion in fiscal 2016 and 27.7 million shares of our stock at a cost of $1.7 billion in fiscal 2015.
segment information: we operate four main business segments. our marmaxx (t.j. maxx, marshalls and tjmaxx.com) and homegoods segments both operate in the united states. our tjx canada segment operates winners, homesense and marshalls in canada, and our tjx international segment operates t.k. maxx, homesense and tkmaxx.com in europe and trade secret in australia. in the u.s., we also operate stp, an off-price internet retailer with a small number of stores. we currently consider all of stp, including its limited number of stores, as part of our e-commerce businesses. the results of stp have been included in our marmaxx segment. we evaluate the performance of our segments based on Â“segment profit or loss,Â” which we define as pre-tax income or loss before general corporate expense, loss on early extinguishment of debt, the pension settlement charge and interest expense. Â“segment profit or loss,Â” as we define the term, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other entities. the terms Â“segment marginÂ” or Â“segment profit marginÂ” are used to describe segment profit or loss as a percentage of net sales. these measures of performance should not be considered an alternative to net income or cash flows from operating activities as an indicator of our performance or as a measure of liquidity.
presented below is selected financial information related to our business segments:
segment profit                                                 $2,995.0                 $2,858.8                 $2,736.7
segment profit as a percentage of net sales                        14.1   %                 14.3   %                 14.6   %
net sales at marmaxx increased 7% in fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016. the increase reflected a 5% increase from same store sales and a 2% increase from new store sales. the same store sales increase of 5% in fiscal 2017 is on top of a 4% increase in the prior year. same store sales growth at marmaxx for fiscal 2017 was primarily due to an increase in customer traffic. marmaxx same store sales also reflect an increase in units sold, which was largely offset by a decrease in the average ticket. geographically, same store sales were strong throughout most of the country with the southeast and great lakes regions particularly strong. home fashions outperformed apparel for fiscal 2017 with both categories posting same store sales growth. overall, e-commerce sales represent approximately 2% of marmaxxÂ’s net sales.
the same store sales increase of 4% in fiscal 2016 was on top of a 1% increase in the prior year. same store sales growth at marmaxx for fiscal 2016 was due to an increase in customer traffic. marmaxx same store sales also reflect an increase in units sold, which was more than offset by a decrease in the average ticket. our merchandise mix and pricing strategy throughout fiscal 2016 resulted in the lower average ticket which we believe contributed to strong growth in customer traffic and in units sold. geographically, same store sales were strong throughout most of the country with the southeast region particularly strong. home fashions outperformed apparel for fiscal 2016 with both categories posting same store sales growth.
segment margin in fiscal 2017 was 14.1% compared to 14.3% in fiscal 2016. marmaxx results for fiscal 2017 reflect an increase in merchandise margin and buying and occupancy expense leverage, on same store
sales growth, of approximately 0.7 percentage points. however, these gains were more than offset by higher store payroll costs, primarily due to wage increases and processing more units at the store level, higher distribution costs, as well as an increase in credit card chargeback costs. tjmaxx.com and stp (our u.s. e-commerce businesses) did not have a significant impact on year-over-year segment margin comparisons.
segment margin in fiscal 2016 was 14.3%, compared to 14.6% in fiscal 2015. marmaxx results for fiscal 2016 reflect improvements in merchandise margin and occupancy expense leverage, on same store sales growth, of approximately 0.6 percentage points. however, these gains were offset by higher distribution costs, reflecting the increase in units processed as well as higher store payroll, primarily due to our wage initiative, and processing more units at the store level. in addition, tjmaxx.com and stp (our u.s. e-commerce businesses) had a negative impact on year-over-year segment margin comparisons of 0.3 percentage points. our e-commerce businesses operate at lower profit margins and at stp, we incurred additional costs as we continue to transition this business to a more fully off-price model and to adjust its merchandise mix.
segment profit                                                   $613.8                   $549.3                  $463.2
segment profit as a percentage of net sales                        13.9   %                 14.0   %                13.6   %
homegoodsÂ’ net sales increased 12% in fiscal 2017, on top of a 15% increase in fiscal 2016. the increase in fiscal 2017 reflected a 6% increase from same store sales and a 6% increase from new store sales. the sales increase of 15% in fiscal 2016 reflected a same store sales increase of 8% and an increase from new stores of 7%. the increase in same store sales for fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016 was primarily due to an increase in customer traffic.
segment profit margin for fiscal 2017 was 13.9% compared to 14.0% for fiscal 2016. segment margin for fiscal 2017 was favorably impacted by an increase in merchandise margin and expense leverage, primarily occupancy costs, on strong same store sales growth. these increases in segment margin were more than offset by higher payroll costs related to wage increases, an increase in distribution costs, which includes the opening of a new distribution center in fiscal 2017, and an increase in credit card chargeback costs. segment profit margin for fiscal 2016 was 14.0%, up from 13.6% for fiscal 2015. the increase in fiscal 2016 was driven by expense leverage, primarily buying and occupancy costs, on strong same store sales growth and an increase in merchandise margin, partially offset by an increase in distribution costs and higher payroll costs related to our wage initiative.
in fiscal 2018, we plan an increase of approximately 81 homegoods stores, which would increase selling square footage by approximately 11%. we also plan on launching a new u.s. home concept, with the first few stores opening later in fiscal 2018.
foreign segments:

segment profit as a percentage of net sales                       13.0   %                13.1   %                13.6   %
net sales for tjx canada increased 11% in fiscal 2017 compared to a decrease of 1% in fiscal 2016. the increase in sales for fiscal 2017 reflected same store sales growth of 8% and a 5% increase from new stores offset by 2% from the negative impact of foreign currency translation. the decrease in net sales of 1% in fiscal 2016 was due entirely to currency translation which negatively impacted sales growth by 16%, more than offsetting sales growth of 12% from same store sales and an increase of 3% from new stores. the same store sales increases in fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016 were primarily due to an increase in customer traffic.
segment profit margin decreased 0.1 percentage point to 13.0% in fiscal 2017. the decline in segment margin was driven by a decrease in merchandise margin and higher supply chain and distribution center costs, which included the opening of a new distribution center. the decline in merchandise margin, similar to the prior year, was primarily due to transactional foreign exchange as the year-over-year changes in currency exchange rates increased tjx canadaÂ’s cost of merchandise purchased in u.s. dollars. these declines in segment margin were largely offset by expense leverage, primarily buying and occupancy costs, on the same store sales growth, as well as the benefit of transactional foreign currency activity resulting in foreign currency gains in fiscal 2017 as compared to foreign currency losses in fiscal 2016. these foreign currency gains and losses result from the timing and settlement of payables denominated in currencies other than the canadian dollar.
segment profit margin decreased 0.5 percentage points to 13.1% in fiscal 2016. the decrease in segment margin was primarily due to a decrease in merchandise margins, the unfavorable impact of mark-to-market adjustments on inventory-related derivatives and an increase in incentive pay due to the above-plan performance. collectively, these items reduced segment margin by 1.2 percentage points. the decrease in merchandise margin was driven by transactional foreign exchange as the year-over-year changes in currency exchange rates increased tjx canadaÂ’s cost of merchandise purchased in u.s. dollars. these declines in the segment margin were partially offset by expense leverage on same store sales, particularly buying and occupancy costs.

net sales for tjx international increased 3% in fiscal 2017 to $4.4 billion compared to $4.2 billion in fiscal 2016, on top of a 3% increase in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015. the increase in fiscal 2017 reflected a 12% increase from new store sales (which includes trade secret for the full fiscal year) and a 2% increase from same store sales, offset by the unfavorable impact from currency translation of 11%. the increase in same store sales for fiscal 2017 was primarily driven by an increase in customer traffic. net sales for tjx international increased 3% in fiscal 2016 to $4.2 billion compared to $4.1 billion in fiscal 2015. the increase in fiscal 2016 reflected a 9% increase from new store sales and a 4% increase from same store sales, offset by the unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation of 10%. overall, e-commerce sales represent approximately 2% of tjx internationalÂ’s net sales.
segment profit margin decreased 2.1% percentage points to 5.4% in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016. the inclusion of trade secret for the full year negatively impacted segment margin by 0.9 percentage points. in addition fiscal 2017 segment margin was negatively affected by the unfavorable impact of the mark-to-market adjustment of inventory derivatives, higher store payroll costs and expense deleverage on the weak same store sales growth.
segment profit margin decreased 0.7 percentage points to 7.5% in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015. the fiscal 2016 segment margin was favorably impacted by strong buying and occupancy expense leverage on the strong same stores sales increase, which was more than offset by the impact of several of our investment initiatives and a decrease in merchandise margin. the investment initiatives include costs associated with centralizing support areas of our business, investing in our infrastructure to support our growth plans, our new store openings in austria and the netherlands and the acquisition of trade secret in australia.
general corporate expense for segment reporting purposes represents those costs not specifically related to the operations of our business segments. virtually all general corporate expenses are included in selling, general
and administrative expenses. the increase in general corporate expense for fiscal 2017 is driven by continued investments in corporate systems and technology along with increases in compensation, benefits and professional services. these increases were partially offset by the impact of lower contributions to the tjx charitable foundations in fiscal 2017 than fiscal 2016.
increased contributions to the tjx charitable foundations, higher incentive compensation accruals due to our above-plan performance and costs related to the acquisition of trade secret in australia accounted for approximately $61 million of the increase in general corporate expense in fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015.
liquidity and capital resources operating activities: net cash provided by operating activities was $3,602 million in fiscal 2017, $2,937 million in fiscal 2016 and $3,008 million in fiscal 2015. the cash generated from operating activities in each of these fiscal years was largely due to operating earnings.
operating cash flows for fiscal 2017 increased by $665 million compared to fiscal 2016. net income, adjusted for non-cash items and the early extinguishment of debt, increased operating cash flows in fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016 by $86 million. the change in merchandise inventory, net of the related change in accounts payable, resulted in an increase of cash of $60 million in fiscal 2017, compared to a use of cash of $290 million in fiscal 2016, positively impacting year-over-year cash flows by $350 million. the positive cash flow impact of the change in inventory and accounts payable in 2017 was due to lower inventory levels at fiscal 2017 year end and increased payments in fiscal 2016 due to merchandise received late in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 that was paid for in fiscal 2016. the change in accrued expenses and other liabilities favorably impacted cash flows by $536 million in fiscal 2017 versus a favorable impact of $353 million in fiscal 2016. this favorable impact of $183 million in year-over-year cash flows from operations was driven primarily by increased liabilities for deferred compensation, gift cards and deferred revenue, sales taxes and income taxes payable. fiscal 2016 cash flow from operations was reduced by $23 million for the cost to acquire favorable lease rights.
operating cash flows for fiscal 2016 decreased by $71 million compared to fiscal 2015. net income adjusted for the non-cash impact of depreciation and deferred income tax provision, provided cash of $2,926 million in fiscal 2016 compared to $2,906 million in fiscal 2015, an increase of $20 million. the change in merchandise inventory, net of the related change in accounts payable, resulted in a use of cash of $290 million in fiscal 2016, compared to a use of cash of $47 million in fiscal 2015, negatively impacting year-over-year cash flows by $243 million. the cash flow impact of the change in inventory and accounts payable was primarily due to an increase in packaway inventory at the end of fiscal 2016 as compared to the prior year as well as the impact of merchandise received late in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 that was paid for in fiscal 2016. the change in accrued expenses and other liabilities favorably impacted cash flows by $353 million in fiscal 2016 versus a favorable impact of $166 million in fiscal 2015. this favorable impact of $187 million in year-over-year cash flows from operations was driven primarily by an additional $100 million of voluntary contributions to our qualified pension plan in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2016. lastly, fiscal 2016 cash flow from operations was reduced by $23 million for the cost to acquire favorable lease rights.
investing activities: our cash flows for investing activities include capital expenditures for the last three fiscal years as set forth in the table below:
store renovations and improvements           274.8                   299.7                   266.8
capital expenditures                      $1,024.7                  $889.4                  $911.5
we expect our capital expenditures in fiscal 2018 will be approximately $1.2 billion, including approximately $600 million for our offices and distribution centers (including buying and merchandising systems and
information systems) to support growth, approximately $350 million for store renovations and approximately $250 million for new stores. we plan to fund these expenditures through internally generated funds.
in fiscal 2017, we purchased $717 million of investments, compared to $798 million in fiscal 2016. additionally, $529 million of investments were sold or matured during fiscal 2017 compared to $681 million in the prior year. this activity primarily relates to short-term investments which had initial maturities in excess of 90 days and, per our policy, are not classified as cash on the consolidated balance sheets presented. finally, fiscal 2016 investing activities include the initial payment of $57 million for the acquisition of trade secret.
financing activities: cash flows from financing activities resulted in net cash outflows of $1,562 million in fiscal 2017, $2,176 million in fiscal 2016 and $1,560 million in fiscal 2015.
during the fiscal 2017 third quarter we received net proceeds of $992.5 million from the issuance of $1 billion of 2.25% ten-year notes. a portion of the proceeds were used to redeem our $375 million 6.95% notes prior to their scheduled maturity. the redemption of the notes, including the prepayment penalty, resulted in cash outflows of $426 million. the remainder of the proceeds from the notes offering were used for working capital and other general corporate purposes.
tjx repurchased and retired 22.3 million shares of its common stock at a cost of $1.7 billion during fiscal 2017, on a Â“trade date basis.Â” tjx reflects stock repurchases in its financial statements on a Â“settlement dateÂ” or cash basis. under our stock repurchase programs, we spent $1.7 billion to repurchase 22.3 million shares of our stock in fiscal 2017, $1.8 billion to repurchase 26.6 million shares of our stock in fiscal 2016 and $1.7 billion to repurchase 27.6 million shares of our stock in fiscal 2015. see note e to the consolidated financial statements for more information. in february 2017, we announced that our board of directors authorized an additional repurchase program authorizing the repurchase of up to an additional $1.0 billion of tjx stock. we currently plan to repurchase approximately $1.3 billion to $1.8 billion of stock under our stock repurchase programs in fiscal 2018. we determine the timing and amount of repurchases based on our assessment of various factors including excess cash flow, liquidity, economic and market conditions, our assessment of prospects for our business, legal requirements and other factors. the timing and amount of these purchases may change.
we declared quarterly dividends on our common stock which totaled $1.04 per share in fiscal 2017, $0.84 per share in fiscal 2016 and $0.70 per share in fiscal 2015. cash payments for dividends on our common stock totaled $651 million in fiscal 2017, $544 million in fiscal 2016 and $466 million in fiscal 2015. we also received proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options of $164 million in fiscal 2017, $132 million in fiscal 2016 and $143 million in fiscal 2015. we expect to pay quarterly dividends for fiscal 2018 of $0.3125 per share, or an annual dividend of $1.25 per share, subject to the declaration and approval of our board of directors. this would represent a 20% increase over the per share dividends declared and paid in fiscal 2017.
we traditionally have funded our working capital requirements, including for seasonal merchandise, primarily through cash generated from operations, supplemented, as needed, by short-term bank borrowings and the issuance of commercial paper. as of january 28, 2017, our cash and cash equivalents held outside the u.s. were $1.3 billion, of which $341.7 million was held in countries where we have the intention to reinvest any undistributed earnings indefinitely. we have provided for deferred u.s. taxes on all undistributed earnings of our subsidiaries in canada, puerto rico, italy, india and hong kong. if we repatriate cash from such subsidiaries, we would not expect to incur additional tax expense, but our cash would be reduced by the amount of taxes paid. for all other foreign subsidiaries, no income taxes have been provided on the undistributed earnings because such earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested in the business. we have no current plans to repatriate cash balances held by such foreign subsidiaries. we believe our existing cash and cash equivalents, internally generated funds and our credit facilities are more than adequate to meet our operating needs over the next fiscal year. one of our credit facilities was amended subsequent to the fiscal year end and is more fully described in note k to the consolidated financial statements.
contractual obligations: as of january 28, 2017, we had known contractual obligations (including current installments) under long-term debt arrangements, operating leases for property and equipment and purchase obligations as follows (in thousands):
operating lease commitments(2)                          8,521,086                   1,455,642                   2,629,436                   1,997,670                   2,438,338
(1)   includes estimated interest costs and financing lease obligations.
(2)   reflects minimum rent. does not include costs for insurance, real estate taxes, other operating expenses and, in some cases, rentals based on a percentage of sales; these items totaled approximately one-third of the total minimum rent for fiscal 2017.
(3)   includes estimated obligations under purchase orders for merchandise and under agreements for capital items, products and services used in our business, including executive employment and other agreements. excludes agreements that can be cancelled without penalty.
we also have long-term liabilities for which it is not reasonably possible for us to predict when they may be paid which include $471.7 million for employee compensation and benefits, and $36.7 million for uncertain tax positions.
critical accounting policies we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america (gaap) which require us to make certain estimates and judgments that impact our reported results. these judgments and estimates are based on historical experience and other factors which we continually review and believe are reasonable. we consider our most critical accounting policies, involving management estimates and judgments, to be those relating to the areas described below.
inventory valuation: we use the retail method for valuing inventory for all our businesses except stp and trade secret. the businesses that utilize the retail method have some inventory that is initially valued at cost before the retail method is applied as it has not been fully processed for sale (i.e. inventory in transit and unprocessed inventory in our distribution centers). under the retail method, the cost value of inventory and gross margins are determined by calculating a cost-to-retail ratio and applying it to the retail value of inventory. it involves management estimates with regard to markdowns and inventory shrinkage. under the retail method, permanent markdowns are reflected in inventory valuation when the price of an item is reduced. typically, a significant area of judgment in the retail method is the amount and timing of permanent markdowns. however, as a normal business practice, we have a specific policy as to when and how markdowns are to be taken, greatly reducing managementÂ’s discretion and the need for management estimates as to markdowns. inventory shrinkage requires estimating a shrinkage rate for interim periods, but we take a full physical inventory near the fiscal year end to determine shrinkage at year end. historically, the variance between estimated shrinkage and actual shrinkage has not been material to our annual financial results. we do not generally enter into arrangements with vendors that provide for rebates and allowances that could ultimately affect the value of inventory.
impairment of long-lived assets, goodwill and tradenames: we evaluate the recoverability of the carrying value of our long-lived assets, goodwill and tradenames at least annually and whenever events or circumstances occur that would indicate that the carrying amounts of those assets are not recoverable. significant judgment is involved in projecting the cash flows of individual stores, as well as of our business units, which involve a number of factors including historical trends, recent performance and general economic assumptions. if we determine that an impairment of long-lived assets, goodwill and tradenames has occurred, we record an impairment charge equal to the excess of the carrying value of those assets over the estimated fair value of the assets. we determine the fair value of our business units using the discounted cash flow method which requires assumptions for the weighted average cost of capital (wacc) and revenue growth for the related business unit. the fair value of our business units exceeds their carrying value by a significant amount with the exception of
sierra trading post (stp). currently the fair value of stp exceeds the carrying value by approximately 10%. our valuation for stp assumes a wacc of 10.1% for similar type entities and a perpetuity growth rate of 2%. an increase of 50 basis points in the wacc reduces the valuation by approximately $30 million and a decrease in the perpetuity growth rate of 50 basis points reduces the fair value by approximately $10 to $15 million. the valuation also assumes 15 to 20 new stores are opened annually over the next 10 years. we continue to transition stp from a promotional model to the off-price model and expand its store base. although we are optimistic about the future of stp, since its acquisition these changes have resulted in operating results that have not met our short term expectations. the operating results of stp are not material to tjxÂ’s consolidated results, if however their operating results continue to fall short of our projections it is possible we could be faced with an impairment of some or all of the $97 million of goodwill recorded at the time of acquisition.
retirement obligations: retirement costs are accrued over the service life of an employee and represent, in the aggregate, obligations that will ultimately be settled far in the future and are therefore subject to estimates. we are required to make economic, demographic and other assumptions regarding variables, such as the discount rate for valuing pension obligations, the long-term rate of return assumed to be earned on pension assets and assumptions about mortality, all of which impact the net periodic pension cost for the period. these assumptions, including the discount rate, which we determine annually based on market interest rates, and our estimated long-term rate of return, which can differ considerably from actual returns, can have a significant impact on the annual cost of retirement benefits and the funded status of our qualified pension plan. if our discount rate decreased 0.25 percentage points, our fiscal 2017 pension cost for our funded plan would have increased by approximately $10 million. similarly, an increase in the discount of rate of 0.25 percentage points would result in a comparable reduction of pension cost. a change of 0.25 percentage points in our long-term rate of return would increase or decrease our fiscal 2017 pension cost by approximately $3 million. when the discount rate, market performance of our plan assets, changes in laws, regulations, actuarial standards or other factors have a negative impact on the funded status of our plan, our required contributions may increase. we also consider these factors in determining the amount of voluntary contributions we may make to the plan in excess of mandatory funding requirements. in fiscal 2017, we funded our qualified pension plan with a voluntary contribution of $50 million.
share-based compensation: in accordance with gaap, we estimate the fair value of stock awards issued to employees and directors under our stock incentive plan. the fair value of the awards is amortized as Â“share-based compensationÂ” over the vesting periods during which the recipients are required to provide service. we use the black-scholes option pricing model for determining the fair value of stock options granted, which requires management to make significant judgments and estimates such as participant activity and market results. the use of different assumptions and estimates could have a material impact on the estimated fair value of stock option grants and the related compensation cost. a 5% increase in expected volatility would increase the per-option value of our most recent option award by 6% while a decrease of the same amount would decrease the per-option value of our most recent option award by 6%.
casualty insurance: our casualty insurance program is a self-insured program which requires us to estimate the total claims we would incur as a component of our annual insurance cost. the estimated claims are developed, with the assistance of an actuary, based on historical experience and other factors. these estimates involve significant judgments and assumptions, and actual results could differ from these estimates. if our estimate for the claims component of our casualty insurance for fiscal 2017 were to change by 5%, the fiscal 2017 pre-tax cost would increase or decrease by approximately $4 million. a large portion of these claims is funded with a non-refundable payment during the policy year, offsetting our estimated claims accrual. we had a net accrual of $30.8 million for the unfunded portion of our casualty insurance program as of january 28, 2017.
reserves for uncertain tax positions: like many large corporations, our income and other tax returns and reports are regularly audited by federal, state and local tax authorities in the united states and in foreign jurisdictions where we operate and such authorities may challenge positions we take. we are engaged in various administrative and judicial proceedings in multiple jurisdictions with respect to assessments, claims, deficiencies and refunds and other tax matters, which proceedings are in various stages of negotiation, assessment, examination, litigation and settlement. the outcomes of these proceedings are uncertain. in accordance with gaap, we evaluate our uncertain tax positions based on our understanding of the facts, circumstances and information available at the reporting date, and we accrue for exposure when we believe that it is more likely
than not, based on the technical merits, that the positions we have taken will not be sustained. however, in the next twelve months and in future periods, the amounts we accrue for uncertain tax positions from time to time or ultimately pay, as the result of the final resolutions of examinations, judicial or administrative proceedings, changes in facts, law, or legal interpretations, expirations of applicable statute of limitations or other resolutions of, or changes in, tax positions may differ either positively or negatively from the amounts we have accrued, and may result in reductions to or additions to accruals, refund claims or payments for periods not currently under examination or for which no claims have been made. final resolutions of our tax positions or changes in accruals for uncertain tax positions could result in additional tax expense or benefit and could have a material impact on our results of operations of the period in which an examination or proceeding is resolved or in the period in which a changed outcome becomes probable and reasonably estimable.
loss contingencies: certain conditions may exist as of the date the financial statements are issued that may result in a loss to us but will not be resolved until one or more future events occur or fail to occur. our management, with the assistance of our legal counsel, assesses such contingent liabilities. such assessments inherently involve the exercise of judgment. in assessing loss contingencies related to legal proceedings that are pending against us or claims that may result in such proceedings, our legal counsel assists us in evaluating the perceived merits of any legal proceedings or claims as well as the perceived merits of the relief sought or expected to be sought therein.
if the assessment of a contingency indicates that it is probable that a material loss has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated, we will accrue for the estimated liability in the financial statements. if the assessment indicates that a potentially material loss contingency is not probable, but is reasonably possible, or is probable but cannot be reasonably estimated, we will disclose the nature of the contingent liability, together with an estimate of the range of the possible loss or a statement that such loss is not reasonably estimable.

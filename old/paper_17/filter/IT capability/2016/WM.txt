item 1a. risk factors.
you should view these statements with caution. these statements are not guarantees of future performance, circumstances or events. they are based on facts and circumstances known to us as of the date the statements are made. all aspects of our business are subject to uncertainties, risks and other influences, many of which we do not control. any of these factors, either alone or taken together, could have a material adverse effect on us and could change whether any forward-looking statement ultimately turns out to be true. additionally, we assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statement as a result of future events, circumstances or developments. the following discussion should be read together with the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto. outlined below are some of the risks that we believe could affect our business and financial statements for 2017 and beyond and that could cause actual results to be materially different from those that may be set forth in forward-looking statements made by the company.
the waste industry is highly competitive, and if we cannot successfully compete in the marketplace, our business, financial condition and operating results may be materially adversely affected.
we encounter intense competition from governmental, quasi-governmental and private sources in all aspects of our operations. in north america, the industry consists primarily of three national waste management companies and regional and local companies of varying sizes and financial resources, including companies that specialize in certain discrete areas of waste management, operators of alternative disposal facilities and companies that seek to use parts of the waste stream as feedstock for renewable energy and other by-products. in recent years, the industry has seen some additional consolidation, though the industry remains intensely competitive. the industrys national and regional competitors are often significant competitors in local markets. we compete with these companies as well as with counties and municipalities that maintain their own waste collection and disposal operations and waste brokers that rely upon haulers in local markets to address customer
index to financial statements needs. these counties and municipalities may have financial competitive advantages because tax revenues are available to them and tax-exempt financing is more readily available to them. also, such governmental units may attempt to impose flow control or other restrictions that would give them a competitive advantage. in addition, some of our competitors may have lower financial expectations, allowing them to reduce their prices to expand sales volume or to win competitively-bid contracts, including large national accounts and exclusive franchise arrangements with municipalities. when this happens, we may lose customers and be unable to execute our pricing strategy, resulting in a negative impact to our revenue growth from yield on base business.
our future financial performance and success are dependent in large part upon our ability to implement our business strategy successfully. implementation of our strategy will require effective management of our operational, financial and human resources and will place significant demands on those resources. see item 7. managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  overview for more information on our business strategy.
additionally, we have in the past and continue to face purported class action lawsuits related to our customer service agreements, prices and fees.
   strategic decisions with respect to our asset portfolio may result in impairments to our assets. see item 1a. risk factors  we may record material charges against our earnings due to impairments to our assets.
   our ability to make strategic acquisitions depends on our ability to identify desirable acquisition targets, negotiate advantageous transactions despite competition for such opportunities, fund such acquisitions on favorable terms, and realize the benefits we expect from those transactions.
   acquisitions, investments and/or new service offerings may not increase our earnings in the timeframe anticipated, or at all, due to difficulties operating in new markets or providing new service offerings, failure of emerging technologies to perform as expected, failure to operate within budget, integration issues, or regulatory issues, among others.
   integration of acquisitions and/or new services offerings could increase our exposure to the risk of inadvertent noncompliance with applicable laws and regulations.
   liabilities associated with acquisitions, including ones that may exist only because of past operations of an acquired business, may prove to be more difficult or costly to address than anticipated.
   execution of our strategy, particularly growth through acquisitions, may cause us to incur substantial additional indebtedness, which may divert capital away from our traditional business operations and other financial plans.
   we continue to seek to divest underperforming and non-strategic assets if we cannot improve their profitability. we may not be able to successfully negotiate the divestiture of underperforming and non-strategic operations, which could result in asset impairments or the continued operation of low-margin businesses.
in addition to the risks set forth above, implementation of our business strategy could also be affected by a number of factors beyond our control, such as increased competition, legal developments, government regulation, general economic conditions, increased operating costs or expenses and changes in industry trends. we may decide to alter or discontinue certain aspects of our business strategy at any time. if we are not able to implement our business strategy successfully, our long-term growth and profitability may be adversely affected. even if we are able to implement some or all of the initiatives of our business strategy successfully, our operating results may not improve to the extent we anticipate, or at all.
compliance with existing or increased future regulations and/or enforcement of such regulations may restrict or change our operations, increase our operating costs or require us to make additional capital expenditures, and a decrease in regulation may lower barriers to entry for our competitors.
stringent government regulations at the federal, state, provincial, and local level in the united states and canada have a substantial impact on our business, and compliance with such regulations is costly. a large number of complex laws, rules, orders and interpretations govern environmental protection, health, safety, land use, zoning, transportation and related matters. among other things, governmental regulations and enforcement actions may restrict our operations and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows by imposing conditions such as:
   limitations on siting and constructing new waste disposal, transfer, recycling or processing facilities or on expanding existing facilities;
   limitations, regulations or levies on collection and disposal prices, rates and volumes;
   limitations or bans on disposal or transportation of out-of-state waste or certain categories of waste;
   limitations or restrictions on the recycling, processing or transformation of waste, recycling and other streams.
regulations affecting the siting, design and closure of landfills could require us to undertake investigatory or remedial activities, curtail operations or close landfills temporarily or permanently. future changes in these regulations may require us to modify, supplement or replace equipment or facilities. the costs of complying with these regulations could be substantial.
in order to develop, expand or operate a landfill or other waste management facility, we must have various facility permits and other governmental approvals, including those relating to zoning, environmental protection and land use. the permits and approvals are often difficult, time consuming and costly to obtain and could contain conditions that limit our operations.
we also have significant financial obligations relating to final capping, closure, post-closure and environmental remediation at our existing landfills. we establish accruals for these estimated costs, but we could underestimate such accruals because of the types of waste collected and manner in which it is transported and disposed of, including actions taken in the past by companies we have acquired or third-party landfill operators, among other reasons. environmental regulatory changes could accelerate or increase capping, closure, post-closure and remediation costs, requiring our expenditures to materially exceed our current accruals.
various states have enacted, or are considering enacting, laws that restrict the disposal within the state of solid waste generated outside the state. from time to time, the united states congress has considered legislation
index to financial statements authorizing states to adopt regulations, restrictions, or taxes on the importation of out-of-state or out-of-jurisdiction waste. additionally, several state and local governments have enacted flow control regulations, which attempt to require that all waste generated within the state or local jurisdiction be deposited at specific sites. the united states congress adoption of legislation allowing restrictions on interstate transportation of out-of-state or out-of-jurisdiction waste certain types of flow control, or courts interpretations of interstate waste and flow control legislation, could adversely affect our solid and hazardous waste management services.
additionally, regulations establishing extended producer responsibility (epr) are being considered or implemented in many places around the world, including in the united states and canada. epr regulations are designed to place either partial or total responsibility on producers to fund the post-use life cycle of the products they create. along with the funding responsibility, producers may be required to take over management of local recycling programs by taking back their products from end users or managing the collection operations and recycling processing infrastructure. there is no federal law establishing epr in the united states or canada; however, state, provincial and local governments could, and in some cases have, taken steps to implement epr regulations. if wide-ranging epr regulations were adopted, they could have a fundamental impact on the waste streams we manage and how we operate our business, including contract terms and pricing. a significant reduction in the waste, recycling and other streams we manage could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
in recent years, we perceived an increase in both the amount of government regulation and the number of enforcement actions being brought by regulatory entities against operations in the waste services industry. however, the new united states presidential administration has called for substantial changes to areas of federal tax and foreign trade policy and has generally appeared to be in favor of reducing regulation, including environmental regulation. we cannot predict what impact the new administration will have on the political and regulatory environment in the united states, the timing of any such changes, or the impact of any such changes on our business. while reduction of regulation may have a favorable impact on our operating costs, the extensive environmental regulation applicable to landfills is a substantial barrier to entry that benefits our company. it is likely that some policies adopted by the new administration will benefit us and others will negatively affect us.
enforcement or implementation of foreign regulations can affect our ability to export products. a significant portion of the fiber that we market is shipped to export markets across the globe, particularly china. in 2013, the chinese government began to strictly enforce regulations that establish limits on moisture and non-conforming materials that may be contained in imported recycled paper and plastics as well as restricting the import of certain other plastic recyclables. the higher quality expectations resulting from initiatives such as operation green fence have driven up operating costs in the recycling industry, particularly for single stream mrfs. single stream mrfs process a wide range of commingled materials and tend to receive a higher percentage of non-recyclables, which results in increased processing and residual disposal costs. additionally, the new presidential administration has called for substantial changes to foreign trade policy and has raised the possibility of imposing significant increases in tariffs on international trade. if operation green fence or other similar initiatives, such as increased container weight tracking and port fees, new regulations, or restrictions and tariffs on exporting increase our operating costs in the future, and we are not able to recapture those costs from our customers, such initiatives regulations, restrictions and tariffs could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
our revenues, earnings and cash flows will fluctuate based on changes in commodity prices.
our recycling operations process for sale certain recyclable materials, including fibers, aluminum and plastics, which are subject to significant market price fluctuations. the majority of the recyclables that we process for sale are paper fibers, including old corrugated cardboard and old newsprint, and the price fluctuations for these commodities could be impacted by significant changes in united states foreign trade policy and increased tariffs on international trade, as chinese paper mills are the primary consumer of the fiber we market. the fluctuations in the market prices or demand for these commodities can affect our operating income and cash
index to financial statements flows positively, as we experienced in 2016, or negatively, as we experienced in 2015 and 2014. as we have increased the size of our recycling operations, we have also increased our exposure to commodity price fluctuations. the increase in market prices in 2016 for commodities resulted in a year-over-year increase in revenue of $51 million. the decline in market prices in 2015 and 2014 for commodities resulted in year-over-year decreases in revenue of $138 million and $53 million, respectively. additionally, under some agreements, our recycling operations are required to pay rebates to suppliers. in some cases, if we experience higher revenues based on increased market prices for recycling commodities, the rebates we pay will also increase. in other circumstances, the rebates may be subject to a floor, such that as market prices decrease, any expected profit margins on materials subject to the rebate floor are reduced or eliminated. as we work to revise service agreements to mitigate the impact of commodity price fluctuations, the potential increase in the cost for recycling services may make it more difficult for us to win bids and may slow the growth of recycling overall.
fluctuation in energy prices also affects our business, including recycling of plastics manufactured from petroleum products. significant variations in the price of methane gas, electricity and other energy-related products that are marketed and sold by our landfill gas recovery operations can result in corresponding significant impact to our revenue from yield from such operations. additionally, we provide specialized disposal services for oil and gas exploration and production operations through our energy services business. demand for these services decreases when drilling activity slows due to depressed oil and gas prices, such as the pronounced price decreases beginning in late 2014 and continuing low prices throughout 2015 and 2016. any of the commodity prices to which we are subject may fluctuate substantially and without notice in the future.
energy services business demand may also be adversely affected if drilling activity slows due to industry conditions beyond our control, in addition to changes in oil and gas prices. changes in laws or government regulations regarding ghg emissions from oil and gas operations and/or hydraulic fracturing could increase our customers costs of doing business and reduce oil and gas exploration and production by customers. there remains heightened attention from the public, some states and the epa to the alleged potential for hydraulic fracturing to impact drinking water supplies. there is also heightened federal regulatory focus on emissions of methane that occur during drilling and transportation of natural gas with regulations promulgated in 2012 and 2015 as well as state attention to protective disposal of drilling residuals. increased regulation of oil and gas exploration and production and new rules regarding the treatment and disposal of wastes associated with exploration and production operations could increase our costs to provide oilfield services and reduce our margins and revenue from such services.
our customers are increasingly diverting waste to alternatives to landfill disposal, such as recycling and composting, while also working to reduce the amount of waste they generate. in addition, many state and local governments mandate diversion, recycling and waste reduction at the source and prohibit the disposal of certain types of waste, such as yard waste, food waste, and electronics at landfills. where such organic waste is not banned from the landfill, some large customers such as grocery stores and restaurants are choosing to divert their organic waste from landfills. zero-waste goals (sending no waste to the landfill) have been set by many of north americas largest companies. although such mandates and initiatives help to protect our environment, these developments reduce the volume of waste going to our landfills which may affect the prices that we can charge for landfill disposal. our landfills currently provide and, together with our divested waste-to-energy facilities, have historically provided our highest income from operations margins. if we are not successful in expanding our service offerings and growing lines of businesses to service waste streams that do not go to landfills and to provide services for customers that wish to reduce waste entirely, then our revenues and operating results may decline. additionally, despite the development of new service offerings and lines of business, it is possible that our revenues and our income from operations margins could be negatively affected due to disposal alternatives.
index to financial statements developments in technology could trigger a fundamental change in the waste management industry, as waste streams are increasingly viewed as a resource, which may adversely impact volumes at our landfills and our profitability.
our company and others have recognized the value of the traditional waste stream as a potential resource. research and development activities are on-going to provide disposal alternatives that maximize the value of waste, including using waste as a source for renewable energy and other valuable by-products. we and many other companies are investing in these technologies. it is possible that such investments and technological advancements may reduce the cost of waste disposal or the value of landfill gas recovery to a level below our costs and may reduce the demand for landfill space. as a result, our revenues and margins could be adversely affected due to advancements in disposal alternatives.
if we are not able to develop new service offerings and protect intellectual property, or if a competitor develops or obtains exclusive rights to a breakthrough technology, our financial results may suffer.
our existing and proposed service offerings to customers may require that we invest in, develop or license, and protect, new technologies. research and development of new technologies and investment in emerging technologies often requires significant spending that may divert capital investment away from our traditional business operations. we may experience difficulties or delays in the research, development, production and/or marketing of new products and services or emerging technologies in which we have invested, which may negatively impact our operating results and prevent us from recouping or realizing a return on the investments required to bring new products and services to market. further, protecting our intellectual property rights and combating unlicensed copying and use of intellectual property is difficult, and any inability to obtain or protect new technologies could impact our services to customers and development of new revenue sources. our company and others are increasingly focusing on new technologies that provide alternatives to traditional disposal and maximize the resource value of waste. if a competitor develops or obtains exclusive rights to a breakthrough technology that provides a revolutionary change in traditional waste management, or if we have inferior intellectual property to our competitors, our financial results may suffer.
we believe we have developed a reputation for high-quality service, reliability and social and environmental responsibility, and we believe our brand symbolizes these attributes. the waste management brand name, trademarks and logos and our reputation are powerful sales and marketing tools, and we devote significant resources to promoting and protecting them. adverse publicity, whether or not justified, relating to activities by our operations, employees or agents could tarnish our reputation and reduce the value of our brand. damage to our reputation and loss of brand equity could reduce demand for our services. this reduction in demand, together with the dedication of time and expense necessary to defend our reputation, could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity and results of operations, as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation and restore the value of our brand.
our operations are subject to environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, as well as contractual obligations that may result in significant liabilities.
there is risk of incurring significant environmental liabilities in the use, treatment, storage, transfer and disposal of waste materials. under applicable environmental laws and regulations, we could be liable if our operations cause environmental damage to our properties or to the property of other landowners, particularly as a result of the contamination of air, drinking water or soil. under current law, we could also be held liable for damage caused by conditions that existed before we acquired the assets or operations involved. this risk is of particular concern as we execute our growth strategy, partially though acquisitions, because we may be unsuccessful in identifying and assessing potential liabilities during our due diligence investigations. further, the counterparties in such transactions may be unable to perform their indemnification obligations owed to us.
index to financial statements additionally, we could be liable if we arrange for the transportation, disposal or treatment of hazardous substances that cause environmental contamination, or if a predecessor owner made such arrangements and, under applicable law, we are treated as a successor to the prior owner. any substantial liability for environmental damage could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
   agencies of federal, state, local or foreign governments seek to impose liability on us under applicable statutes, sometimes involving civil or criminal penalties for violations, or to revoke or deny renewal of a permit we need; and
   local communities, citizen groups, landowners or governmental agencies oppose the issuance of a permit or approval we need, allege violations of the permits under which we operate or laws or regulations to which we are subject, or seek to impose liability on us for environmental damage.
we generally seek to work with the authorities or other persons involved in these proceedings to resolve any issues raised. if we are not successful, the adverse outcome of one or more of these proceedings could result in, among other things, material increases in our costs or liabilities as well as material charges for asset impairments.
further, we often enter into agreements with landowners imposing obligations on us to meet certain regulatory or contractual conditions upon site closure or upon termination of the agreements. compliance with these agreements inherently involves subjective determinations and may result in disputes, including litigation. costs to remediate or restore the condition of closed sites may be significant.
general economic conditions can directly and adversely affect our revenues and our income from operations margins.
our business is directly affected by changes in national and general economic factors that are outside of our control, including consumer confidence, interest rates and access to capital markets. a weak economy generally results in decreased consumer spending and decreases in volumes of waste generated, which decreases our revenues. a weak market for consumer goods can significantly decrease demand by paper mills for recycled corrugated cardboard used in packaging; such decrease in demand can negatively impact commodity prices and our operating income and cash flows. in addition, we have a relatively high fixed-cost structure, which is difficult to quickly adjust to match shifting volume levels. consumer uncertainty and the loss of consumer confidence may limit the number or amount of services requested by customers. economic conditions may also limit our ability to implement our pricing strategy. for example, many of our contracts have price adjustment provisions that are tied to an index such as the consumer price index, and our costs may increase in excess of the increase, if any, in the consumer price index. additionally, a prolonged economic downturn in china could significantly impact prices for post-consumer fiber and metals processed by our recycling operations.
some of our customers, including governmental entities, have suffered financial difficulties affecting their credit risk, which could negatively impact our operating results.
we provide service to a number of governmental entities and municipalities, some of which have suffered significant financial difficulties in recent years, due in part to reduced tax revenue and/or high cost structures. some of these entities could be unable to pay amounts owed to us or renew contracts with us at previous or increased rates.
many non-governmental customers have also suffered serious financial difficulties, including bankruptcy in some cases. purchasers of our recyclable commodities can be particularly vulnerable to financial difficulties in times of commodity price volatility. the inability of our customers to pay us in a timely manner or to pay increased rates, particularly large national accounts, could negatively affect our operating results.
index to financial statements in addition, the financial difficulties of municipalities could result in a decline in investors demand for municipal bonds and a correlating increase in interest rates. as of december 31, 2016, we had $491 million of variable-rate tax-exempt bonds with interest rates reset on either a daily or a weekly basis through a remarketing process and $473 million of tax-exempt bonds with term interest rate periods that are subject to repricing within the next 12 months, which is prior to their scheduled maturities. if the weakness in the municipal debt market results in repricing of our tax-exempt bonds at significantly higher interest rates, we will incur increased interest expenses that may negatively affect our operating results and cash flows.
we may be unable to obtain or maintain required permits or to expand existing permitted capacity of our landfills, which could decrease our revenue and increase our costs.
our ability to meet our financial and operating objectives depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain the permits necessary to operate landfill sites. permits to build, operate and expand solid waste management facilities, including landfills and transfer stations, have become more difficult and expensive to obtain and maintain. permits often take years to obtain as a result of numerous hearings and compliance requirements with regard to zoning, environmental and other regulations. these permits are also often subject to resistance from citizen or other groups and other political pressures. local communities and citizen groups, adjacent landowners or governmental agencies may oppose the issuance of a permit or approval we may need, allege violations of the permits under which we currently operate or laws or regulations to which we are subject, or seek to impose liability on us for environmental damage. responding to these challenges has, at times, increased our costs and extended the time associated with establishing new facilities and expanding existing facilities. in addition, failure to receive regulatory and zoning approval may prohibit us from establishing new facilities or expanding existing facilities. our failure to obtain the required permits to operate our landfills could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
the price and supply of diesel fuel can fluctuate significantly based on international, political and economic circumstances, as well as other factors outside our control, such as actions by the organization of the petroleum exporting countries (opec) and other oil and gas producers, regional production patterns, weather conditions and environmental concerns. we need diesel fuel to run a significant portion of our collection and transfer trucks and our equipment used in our landfill operations. supply shortages could substantially increase our operating expenses. additionally, if fuel prices increase, our direct operating expenses increase and many of our vendors raise their prices as a means to offset their own rising costs. we have in place a fuel surcharge program, designed to offset increased fuel expenses; however, we may not be able to pass through all of our increased costs and some customers contracts prohibit any pass-through of the increased costs. additionally, we have recently settled cases that pertained to our fuel and environmental charges included on our invoices, and we continue to face similar claims. see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for more information. regardless of any offsetting surcharge programs, increased operating costs due to higher diesel fuel prices will decrease our income from operations margins.
we have an extensive natural gas truck fleet, which makes us partially dependent on the availability of natural gas and fueling infrastructure and vulnerable to natural gas prices.
we operate a large fleet of natural gas vehicles, and we plan to continue to invest in these assets for our collection fleet. however, natural gas fueling infrastructure is not yet broadly available in north america; as a result, we have constructed and operate natural gas fueling stations, some of which also serve the public or pre-approved third parties. it will remain necessary for us to invest capital in fueling infrastructure in order to power our natural gas fleet. concerns have been raised about the potential for emissions from fueling infrastructure that serve natural gas-fueled vehicles. new regulation of, or restrictions on, natural gas fueling infrastructure or reductions in associated tax incentives could increase our operating costs. additionally, fluctuations in the price
index to financial statements and supply of natural gas could substantially increase our operating expenses, and a reduction in the existing cost differential between natural gas and diesel fuel could materially reduce the benefits we anticipate from our investment in natural gas vehicles. further, our fuel surcharge program is currently indexed to diesel fuel prices, and price fluctuations for natural gas may not effectively be recovered by this program.
we may experience problems with the operation of our current information technology systems or the technology systems of third parties on which we rely, as well as the development and deployment of new information technology systems, that could adversely affect, or even temporarily disrupt, all or a portion of our operations until resolved. inabilities and delays in implementing new systems can also affect our ability to realize projected or expected cost savings. additionally, any systems failures could impede our ability to timely collect and report financial results in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.
a cybersecurity incident could negatively impact our business and our relationships with customers and expose us to litigation risk.
we use computers in substantially all aspects of our business operations. we also use mobile devices, social networking and other online activities to connect with our employees and our customers. such uses give rise to cybersecurity risks, including security breach, espionage, system disruption, theft and inadvertent release of information. our business involves the storage and transmission of numerous classes of sensitive and/or confidential information and intellectual property, including customers personal information, private information about employees, and financial and strategic information about the company and its business partners. we also rely on a payment card industry compliant third party to protect our customers credit card information. further, as the company pursues its strategy to grow through acquisitions and to pursue new initiatives that improve our operations and cost structure, the company is also expanding and improving its information technologies, resulting in a larger technological presence and corresponding exposure to cybersecurity risk. if we fail to assess and identify cybersecurity risks associated with acquisitions and new initiatives, we may become increasingly vulnerable to such risks. additionally, while we have implemented measures to prevent security breaches and cyber incidents, our preventative measures and incident response efforts may not be entirely effective. the theft, destruction, loss, misappropriation, or release of sensitive and/or confidential information or intellectual property, or interference with our information technology systems or the technology systems of third parties on which we rely, could result in business disruption, negative publicity, brand damage, violation of privacy laws, loss of customers, potential litigation and liability and competitive disadvantage.
labor unions continually attempt to organize our employees, and these efforts will likely continue in the future. certain groups of our employees are currently represented by unions, and we have negotiated collective bargaining agreements with these unions. additional groups of employees may seek union representation in the future, and, if successful, the negotiation of collective bargaining agreements could divert management attention and result in increased operating expenses and lower net income. if we are unable to negotiate acceptable collective bargaining agreements, our operating expenses could increase significantly as a result of work stoppages, including strikes. any of these matters could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
we could face significant liabilities for withdrawal from multiemployer pension plans.
we are a participating employer in a number of trustee-managed multiemployer defined benefit pension plans (multiemployer pension plans) for employees who are covered by collective bargaining agreements. in
index to financial statements the event of our withdrawal from a multiemployer pension plan, we may incur expenses associated with our obligations for unfunded vested benefits at the time of the withdrawal. depending on various factors, future withdrawals could have a material adverse effect on results of operations or cash flows for a particular reporting period. we have previously withdrawn several employee bargaining units from underfunded multiemployer pension plans, and we recognized related expenses of $51 million in 2015 and $4 million in 2014. see notes 10 and 11 to the consolidated financial statements for more information related to our participation in multiemployer pension plans.
providing environmental and waste management services, including constructing and operating landfills, involves risks such as truck accidents, equipment defects, malfunctions and failures. additionally, we closely monitor and manage landfills to minimize the risk of waste mass instability, releases of hazardous materials, and odors that could be triggered by weather or natural disasters. there may also be risks presented by the potential for subsurface heat reactions causing elevated landfill temperatures and increased production of leachate, landfill gas and odors. we also build and operate natural gas fueling stations, some of which also serve the public or third parties. operation of fueling stations and landfill gas collection and control systems involves additional risks of fire and explosion. any of these risks could potentially result in injury or death of employees and others, a need to shut down or reduce operation of facilities, increased operating expense and exposure to liability for pollution and other environmental damage, and property damage or destruction.
while we seek to minimize our exposure to such risks through comprehensive training, compliance and response and recovery programs, as well as vehicle and equipment maintenance programs, if we were to incur substantial liabilities in excess of any applicable insurance, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. any such incidents could also tarnish our reputation and reduce the value of our brand. additionally, a major operational failure, even if suffered by a competitor, may bring enhanced scrutiny and regulation of our industry, with a corresponding increase in operating expense.
we have substantial financial assurance and insurance requirements, and increases in the costs of obtaining adequate financial assurance, or the inadequacy of our insurance coverages, could negatively impact our liquidity and increase our liabilities.
the amount of insurance we are required to maintain for environmental liability is governed by statutory requirements. we believe that the cost for such insurance is high relative to the coverage it would provide and, therefore, our coverages are generally maintained at the minimum statutorily-required levels. we face the risk of incurring additional costs for environmental damage if our insurance coverage is ultimately inadequate to cover those damages. we also carry a broad range of other insurance coverages that are customary for a company our size. we use these programs to mitigate risk of loss, thereby enabling us to manage our self-insurance exposure associated with claims. the inability of our insurers to meet their commitments in a timely manner and the effect of significant claims or litigation against insurance companies may subject us to additional risks. to the extent our insurers are unable to meet their obligations, or our own obligations for claims are more than we estimated, there could be a material adverse effect to our financial results.
in addition, to fulfill our financial assurance obligations with respect to variable-rate tax-exempt debt, final capping, closure, post-closure and environmental remediation obligations, we generally obtain letters of credit or surety bonds, rely on insurance, including captive insurance, fund trust and escrow accounts or rely upon wm financial guarantees. we currently have in place all financial assurance instruments necessary for our operations. our financial position, which can be negatively affected by asset impairments, our credit profile and general economic factors, may adversely affect the cost of our current financial assurance instruments, and changes in regulations may impose stricter requirements on the types of financial assurance that will be accepted. additionally, in the event we are unable to obtain sufficient surety bonding, letters of credit or third-party
index to financial statements insurance coverage at reasonable cost, or one or more states cease to view captive insurance as adequate coverage, we would need to rely on other forms of financial assurance. it is possible that we could be forced to deposit cash to collateralize our obligations. other forms of financial assurance could be more expensive to obtain, and any requirements to use cash to support our obligations would negatively impact our liquidity and capital resources and could affect our ability to meet our obligations as they become due.
in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles, we capitalize certain expenditures and advances relating to disposal site development, expansion projects, acquisitions, software development costs and other projects. events that could, in some circumstances, lead to an impairment include, but are not limited to, shutting down a facility or operation or abandoning a development project or the denial of an expansion permit. additionally, declining waste volumes and development of, and customer preference for, alternatives to traditional waste disposal could warrant asset impairments. if we determine an asset or expansion project is impaired, we will charge against earnings any unamortized capitalized expenditures and advances relating to such asset or project reduced by any portion of the capitalized costs that we estimate will be recoverable, through sale or otherwise. we also carry a significant amount of goodwill on our consolidated balance sheet, which is required to be assessed for impairment annually, and more frequently in the case of certain triggering events. we may be required to incur charges against earnings if such impairment tests indicate that the fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying value. any such charges could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
our capital requirements and our business strategy could increase our expenses, cause us to change our growth and development plans, or result in an inability to maintain our desired credit profile.
if economic conditions or other risks and uncertainties cause a significant reduction in our cash flows from operations, we may reduce or suspend capital expenditures, growth and acquisition activity, implementation of our business strategy, dividend declarations or share repurchases. we may choose to incur indebtedness to pay for these activities, although our access to capital markets is not assured and we may not be able to incur indebtedness at a cost that is consistent with current borrowing rates. we also may need to incur indebtedness to refinance scheduled debt maturities, and it is possible that the cost of financing could increase significantly, thereby increasing our expenses and decreasing our net income. further, our ability to execute our financial strategy and our ability to incur indebtedness is somewhat dependent upon our ability to maintain investment grade credit ratings on our senior debt. the credit rating process is contingent upon our credit profile, as well as a number of other factors, many of which are beyond our control, including methodologies established and interpreted by third-party rating agencies. if we were unable to maintain our investment grade credit ratings in the future, our interest expense would increase and our ability to obtain financing on favorable terms could be adversely affected.
additionally, we have $1.6 billion of debt as of december 31, 2016 that is exposed to changes in market interest rates within the next 12 months because of the combined impact of our tax-exempt bonds and borrowings outstanding under our $2.25 billion revolving credit facility and canadian term loan. if interest rates increase, our interest expense would also increase, lowering our net income and decreasing our cash flow.
we may use our $2.25 billion revolving credit facility and our c$50 million canadian revolving credit facility to meet our cash needs, to the extent available, until maturity in july 2020 and march 2019, respectively. at december 31, 2016, we had $426 million of outstanding borrowings and $789 million of letters of credit issued and supported by the $2.25 billion revolving credit facility, leaving unused and available credit capacity of $1,035 million, and we had no outstanding borrowings under the canadian revolving credit facility. in the event of a default under our credit facilities, we could be required to immediately repay all outstanding borrowings and make cash deposits as collateral for all obligations the facility supports, which we may not be able to do.
index to financial statements additionally, any such default could cause a default under many of our other credit agreements and debt instruments. without waivers from lenders party to those agreements, any such default would have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue to operate.
our landfill operations emit methane, identified as a ghg. there are a number of legislative and regulatory efforts at the state, regional and federal levels to curtail the emission of ghgs to ameliorate the effect of climate change. should comprehensive federal climate change legislation be enacted, we expect it could impose costs on our operations that might not be offset by the revenue increases associated with our lower-carbon service options, the materiality of which we cannot predict. in 2010, the epa published a prevention of significant deterioration and title v greenhouse gas tailoring rule, which expanded the epas federal air permitting authority to include the six ghgs. the rule sets new thresholds for ghg emissions that define when clean air act permits are required. the current requirements of these rules have not significantly affected our operations or cash flows, due to the tailored thresholds and exclusions of certain emissions from regulation. however, if certain changes to these regulations were enacted, such as lowering the thresholds or the inclusion of biogenic emissions, then the amendments could have an adverse effect on our operating costs.
our operating revenues tend to be somewhat higher in summer months, primarily due to the higher volume of construction and demolition waste. the volumes of industrial and residential waste in certain regions where we operate also tend to increase during the summer months. our second and third quarter revenues and results of operations typically reflect these seasonal trends.
service disruptions caused by severe storms, extended periods of inclement weather or climate extremes resulting from climate change can significantly affect the operating results of the affected areas. on the other hand, certain destructive weather conditions that tend to occur during the second half of the year, such as the hurricanes that most often impact our operations in the southern and eastern united states, can increase our revenues in the areas affected. while weather-related and other unusual event occurrences can boost revenues through additional work for a limited time, as a result of significant start-up costs and other factors, such revenue can generate earnings at comparatively lower margins.
we could be subject to significant fines and penalties, and our reputation could be adversely affected, if our businesses, or third parties with whom we have a relationship, were to fail to comply with united states or foreign laws or regulations.
some of our projects and new business may be conducted in countries where corruption has historically been prevalent. it is our policy to comply with all applicable anti-bribery laws, such as the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act, and with applicable local laws of the foreign countries in which we operate, and we monitor our local partners compliance with such laws as well. our reputation may be adversely affected if we were reported to be associated with corrupt practices or if we or our local partners failed to comply with such laws. such damage to our reputation could adversely affect our ability to grow our business. additionally, violations of such laws could subject us to significant fines and penalties.
index to financial statements currently pending or future litigation or governmental proceedings could result in material adverse consequences, including judgments or settlements.
from time to time we are involved in governmental proceedings relating to the conduct of our business. we are also party to civil litigation. as a large company with operations across the united states and canada, we are subject to various proceedings, lawsuits, disputes and claims arising in the ordinary course of our business. actions that have been filed against us, and that may be filed against us in the future, include personal injury, property damage, commercial, customer, and employment-related claims, including purported state and national class action lawsuits related to:
the timing of the final resolutions to these types of matters is often uncertain. additionally, the possible outcomes or resolutions to these matters could include adverse judgments or settlements, either of which could require substantial payments, adversely affecting our liquidity.
our implementation of and compliance with changes in accounting rules, including new accounting rules and interpretations, could adversely affect our reported financial position or operating results or cause unanticipated fluctuations in our reported operating results in future periods.
item 7.   managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.
this section includes a discussion of our results of operations for the three years ended december 31, 2016. this discussion may contain forward-looking statements that anticipate results based on managements plans that are subject to uncertainty. we discuss in more detail various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations in item 1a. risk factors. the following discussion should be read considering those disclosures and together with the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto.
overview our companys goals are targeted at serving our customers, our employees, the environment, the communities in which we work and our stockholders. increasingly, customers want more of their waste materials recovered, while waste streams are becoming more complex, and our aim is to address the current needs, while anticipating the expanding and evolving needs, of our customers. we believe we are uniquely equipped to meet the challenges of the changing waste industry and our customers waste management needs, both today and as we work together to envision and create a more sustainable future. as the waste industry leader, we have the expertise necessary to collect and handle our customers waste efficiently and responsibly by delivering environmental performance  maximizing resource value, while minimizing environmental impact  so that both our economy and our environment can thrive.
our fundamental strategy has not changed; we remain dedicated to providing long-term value to our stockholders by successfully executing our core strategy of focused differentiation and continuous improvement, with the current state of our strategy taking into account economic conditions, the regulatory environment, asset and resource availability and current technology. we believe that focused differentiation in our industry, driven by capitalizing on our extensive, well-placed network of assets, will deliver profitable growth and competitive advantages. simultaneously, we believe the combination of cost control, process improvement and operational efficiency will deliver on the companys strategy of continuous improvement and yield an attractive total cost structure and enhanced service quality. while we will continue to monitor emerging diversion technologies that may generate additional value and related market dynamics, our current attention will be on improving existing diversion technologies, such as our recycling operations.
notable items of our 2016 financial results include:
                    revenues of $13,609 million in 2016 compared with $12,961 million in 2015, an increase of $648 million. this increase in revenues is primarily attributable to (i) the combined impact of yield and volume growth, which contributed $437 million of additional revenues, primarily in our collection and disposal and recycling operations and (ii) acquisitions, net of divestitures, which contributed $238 million of revenue growth, primarily due to the acquisition of certain operations and business assets of sws in january 2016. these increases were partially offset by foreign currency translation related to our canadian operations;
                      operating expenses of $8,486 million in 2016, or 62.4% of revenues, compared with $8,231 million, or 63.5% of revenues, in 2015. this increase of $255 million is primarily attributable to
(i) incremental costs attributable to acquired businesses, net of divestitures, of approximately $143 million; (ii) increased landfill operating costs of $97 million, primarily landfill leachate management costs;
(iii) increased cost of goods sold of $60 million, primarily related to higher recycling commodity prices and (iv) costs associated with higher volumes, estimated at $60 million. these increases were partially offset by lower fuel costs of $66 million, primarily due to lower year-over-year average fuel prices;
                                                    selling, general and administrative expenses of $1,410 million in 2016, compared with $1,343 million in
2015, or 10.4% of revenues for both periods. this increase of $67 million is primarily attributable to higher labor and related benefits of $94 million, primarily due to increased incentive compensation
index to financial statements costs, merit increases and higher severance costs. these increases were partially offset by reduced legal fees, lower bank charges and favorable litigation settlements;
   income from operations of $2,296 million, or 16.9% of revenues, in 2016 compared with $2,045 million, or 15.8% of revenues, in 2015, an increase of $251 million. in addition to the items discussed above, the comparability was also affected by asset impairments and unusual items in both periods, as discussed below;
   net income attributable to waste management, inc. of $1,182 million, or $2.65 per diluted share, for 2016, as compared with $753 million, or $1.65 per diluted share, for 2015. the increase was primarily driven by the earnings growth of our core operations discussed above as well as the 2015 loss on early extinguishment of debt discussed below; and
   in 2016, we returned $1,451 million to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases compared with $1,295 million in 2015.
the company had a very successful 2016, exceeding expectations and carrying forward our momentum from 2015 by generating strong earnings and cash flow. our commitment to executing on our strategies of disciplined profitable volume growth and controlling costs, through focused differentiation and continuous improvement, drove these impressive results in 2016 and have built a strong foundation to produce solid earnings and generate further growth in 2017. this growth, combined with our commitment to maintain a strong balance sheet, supports the companys continued focus on investing in our business, paying dividends, pursuing attractive opportunities for strategic growth through acquisitions and considering the market for share repurchases.
the following explanations of certain items that affected the comparability of the years presented has been provided to support investors understanding of our performance. our 2016 results were affected by the following:
                                                                                                   the recognition of pre-tax charges aggregating to $151 million, primarily related to (i) a $43 million impairment charge due to a loss of expected volumes for a landfill; (ii) a $42 million charge to adjust our subsidiarys estimated environmental remediation liability related to a closed site in harris county, texas; (iii) $41 million of impairment charges related to minority-owned, cost method investments in waste diversion technology companies; (iv) a $10 million goodwill impairment charge related to our lamptracker® reporting unit and (v) an $8 million loss on the sale of a majority-owned organics company. these charges had a negative impact of $0.26 on our diluted earnings per share.
   the recognition of a pre-tax loss of $555 million, primarily related to the early extinguishment of almost $2 billion of our high-coupon senior notes through make-whole redemption and cash tender offers. these charges had a negative impact of $0.75 on our diluted earnings per share;
   pre-tax charges of $51 million associated with the withdrawal from certain underfunded multiemployer pension plans had a negative impact of $0.07 on our diluted earnings per share; and
   net pre-tax charges of $102 million resulting from impairments, restructuring and divestitures, of which $66 million related to the impairment of our oil and gas producing properties. these items had a negative impact of $0.14 on our diluted earnings per share.
free cash flow as is our practice, we are presenting free cash flow, which is a non-gaap measure of liquidity, in our disclosures because we use this measure in the evaluation and management of our business. we define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities, less capital expenditures, plus proceeds from divestitures of businesses and other assets (net of cash divested). we believe it is indicative of our ability to pay our quarterly dividends, repurchase common stock, fund acquisitions and other investments and, in the absence of
index to financial statements refinancings, to repay our debt obligations. free cash flow is not intended to replace net cash provided by operating activities, which is the most comparable gaap measure. however, we believe free cash flow gives investors useful insight into how we view our liquidity. nonetheless, the use of free cash flow as a liquidity measure has material limitations because it excludes certain expenditures that are required or that we have committed to, such as declared dividend payments and debt service requirements.
our calculation of free cash flow and reconciliation to net cash provided by operating activities is shown in the table below (in millions), and may not be calculated the same as similarly-titled measures presented by other companies:
net cash provided by operating activities                                                    $2,960                   $2,498                   $2,331
capital expenditures                                                                         (1,339   )               (1,233   )               (1,151   )
proceeds from divestitures of businesses and other assets (net of cash divested)                 43                      145                    2,253
when comparing our cash flows from operating activities for the year ended december 31, 2016 to the comparable period in 2015, the increase of $462 million is primarily related to (i) higher earnings from our traditional solid waste business; (ii) cash proceeds of $67 million from the termination of our cross-currency swaps in the first quarter of 2016; (iii) trustee-managed multiemployer defined benefit pension plan (multiemployer pension plan) settlement payments of approximately $60 million in 2015 and (iv) lower annual incentive plan cash payments of $46 million in the current year; partially offset, by higher income tax payments, net of excess tax benefits associated with equity-based transactions, of $36 million in the current year. additionally, we experienced net favorable changes in our assets and liabilities, net of effects of acquisitions and divestitures, particularly non-trade related items including payroll and incentive accruals.
when comparing our cash flows from operating activities for the year ended december 31, 2015 to 2014, the increase of $167 million is primarily related to (i) lower income tax payments, net of excess tax benefits associated with equity-based transactions, of $329 million in 2015; (ii) lower interest paid of $77 million in 2015 and (iii) the settlement of forward-starting swap liabilities of $36 million in 2014. these increases were partially offset by (i) a decrease in cash earnings due to the sale of our wheelabrator business in 2014; (ii) multiemployer pension plan settlement payments of approximately $60 million in 2015 and (iii) higher year-over-year annual incentive plan payments of approximately $65 million in 2015. finally, we experienced net unfavorable changes in our assets and liabilities, net of effects of acquisitions and divestitures, particularly non-trade related items including payroll and incentive accruals.
capital expenditures increased by $106 million in 2016 compared to 2015 and by $82 million in 2015 compared to 2014. the increase in our capital expenditures in both years is generally the result of additional spending on new business opportunities and acquisitions, growth in our existing business and asset replacement timing. in addition, the construction of a waste-water treatment facility at one of our landfills also contributed to the increase in 2016. although we experienced capital expenditure increases in both 2016 and 2015, the company continues to maintain a disciplined focus on capital management.
the significantly higher proceeds from divestitures of businesses and other assets (net of cash divested) for the year ended december 31, 2014 compared to the years ended december 31, 2016 and 2015 is largely driven by the 2014 sales of (i) our wheelabrator business for $1.95 billion; (ii) our investment in shanghai environment group, which was part of our wheelabrator business, for $155 million and (iii) our puerto rico operations for consideration of $80 million, including $65 million in cash.
index to financial statements acquisitions southern waste systems/sun recycling (sws)  on january 8, 2016, waste management inc. of florida, a wholly-owned subsidiary of wm, acquired certain operations and business assets of sws in southern florida for total consideration of $525 million. the acquired business assets include residential, commercial, and industrial solid waste collection, processing/recycling and transfer operations, equipment, vehicles, real estate and customer agreements.
deffenbaugh disposal, inc. (deffenbaugh)  on march 26, 2015, we acquired deffenbaugh, one of the largest privately owned collection and disposal firms in the midwest, for total consideration, net of cash acquired, of $400 million. deffenbaughs assets include collection operations, transfer stations, recycling facilities and landfills.
divestitures wheelabrator business  on december 19, 2014, we sold our wheelabrator business to an affiliate of energy capital partners and received cash proceeds of $1.95 billion, net of cash divested, subject to certain post-closing adjustments. we recognized a gain of $519 million on this sale, which is included within (income) expense from divestitures, asset impairments and unusual items in the consolidated statement of operations. for the year ended december 31, 2015, net adjustments to this gain were immaterial on a pre-tax basis. in conjunction with the sale, the company entered into several agreements to dispose of a minimum number of tons of waste at certain wheelabrator facilities. see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of these agreements.
other  in addition to the divestiture of our wheelabrator business, we also divested our puerto rico operations, as well as certain landfill and collection operations in our eastern canada area in 2014.
adoption of new accounting standards debt issuance costs  in april 2015, and as subsequently amended, the financial accounting standards board (fasb) issued amended authoritative guidance associated with debt issuance costs which were previously presented as assets related to recognized debt liabilities. the amended guidance requires that debt issuance costs, other than those costs related to line of credit arrangements, be presented on the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the related debt liability, which is similar to the presentation for debt discounts and premiums. this guidance was effective for the company on january 1, 2016. the companys adoption of this guidance was applied retrospectively and resulted in a reclassification of $52 million of such costs in our consolidated balance sheet at december 31, 2015.
consolidation  in february 2015, the fasb issued amended authoritative guidance associated with consolidation. the amended guidance makes changes to existing consolidation requirements associated with the analysis a reporting entity must perform to determine whether it should consolidate certain types of legal entities, including limited partnerships and variable interest entities. the guidance was effective for the company on january 1, 2016. the companys adoption of this guidance did not impact our consolidated financial statements.
critical accounting estimates and assumptions in preparing our financial statements, we make numerous estimates and assumptions that affect the accounting for and recognition and disclosure of assets, liabilities, equity, revenues and expenses. we must make these estimates and assumptions because certain information that we use is dependent on future events, cannot be calculated with precision from available data or simply cannot be calculated. in some cases, these estimates are difficult to determine, and we must exercise significant judgment. in preparing our financial statements, the most difficult, subjective and complex estimates and the assumptions that present the greatest amount of uncertainty
index to financial statements relate to our accounting for landfills, environmental remediation liabilities, long-lived asset impairments, deferred income taxes and reserves associated with our insured and self-insured claims. each of these items is discussed in additional detail below. actual results could differ materially from the estimates and assumptions that we use in the preparation of our financial statements.
landfills accounting for landfills requires that significant estimates and assumptions be made regarding (i) the cost to construct and develop each landfill asset; (ii) the estimated fair value of final capping, closure and post-closure asset retirement obligations, which must consider both the expected cost and timing of these activities; (iii) the determination of each landfills remaining permitted and expansion airspace and (iv) the airspace associated with each final capping event.
landfill costs  we estimate the total cost to develop each of our landfill sites to its remaining permitted and expansion capacity. this estimate includes such costs as landfill liner material and installation, excavation for airspace, landfill leachate collection systems, landfill gas collection systems, environmental monitoring equipment for groundwater and landfill gas, directly related engineering, capitalized interest, on-site road construction and other capital infrastructure costs. additionally, landfill development includes all land purchases for the landfill footprint and required landfill buffer property. the projection of these landfill costs is dependent, in part, on future events. the remaining amortizable basis of each landfill includes costs to develop a site to its remaining permitted and expansion capacity and includes amounts previously expended and capitalized, net of accumulated airspace amortization, and projections of future purchase and development costs.
final capping costs  we estimate the cost for each final capping event based on the area to be capped and the capping materials and activities required. the estimates also consider when these costs are anticipated to be paid and factor in inflation and discount rates. our engineering personnel allocate landfill final capping costs to specific final capping events. the landfill capacity associated with each final capping event is then quantified and the final capping costs for each event are amortized over the related capacity associated with the event as waste is disposed of at the landfill. we review these costs annually, or more often if significant facts change. changes in estimates, such as timing or cost of construction, for final capping events immediately impact the required liability and the corresponding asset. when the change in estimate relates to a fully consumed asset, the adjustment to the asset must be amortized immediately through expense. when the change in estimate relates to a final capping event that has not been fully consumed, the adjustment to the asset is recognized in income prospectively as a component of landfill airspace amortization.
closure and post-closure costs  we base our estimates for closure and post-closure costs on our interpretations of permit and regulatory requirements for closure and post-closure monitoring and maintenance. the estimates for landfill closure and post-closure costs also consider when the costs are anticipated to be paid and factor in inflation and discount rates. the possibility of changing legal and regulatory requirements and the forward-looking nature of these types of costs make any estimation or assumption less certain. changes in estimates for closure and post-closure events immediately impact the required liability and the corresponding asset. when the change in estimate relates to a fully consumed asset, the adjustment to the asset must be amortized immediately through expense. when the change in estimate relates to a landfill asset that has not been fully consumed, the adjustment to the asset is recognized in income prospectively as a component of landfill airspace amortization.
remaining permitted airspace  our engineers, in consultation with third-party engineering consultants and surveyors, are responsible for determining remaining permitted airspace at our landfills. the remaining permitted airspace is determined by an annual survey, which is used to compare the existing landfill topography to the expected final landfill topography.
expansion airspace  we also include currently unpermitted expansion airspace in our estimate of remaining permitted and expansion airspace in certain circumstances. first, to include airspace associated with an
index to financial statements expansion effort, we must generally expect the initial expansion permit application to be submitted within one year, and the final expansion permit to be received within five years. second, we must believe that obtaining the expansion permit is likely, considering the following criteria:
   there are no significant known technical, legal, community, business, or political restrictions or similar issues that could negatively affect the success of such expansion; and
   financial analysis has been completed based on conceptual design, and the results demonstrate that the expansion meets company criteria for investment.
for unpermitted airspace to be initially included in our estimate of remaining permitted and expansion airspace, the expansion effort must meet all of the criteria listed above. these criteria are evaluated by our field-based engineers, accountants, managers and others to identify potential obstacles to obtaining the permits. once the unpermitted airspace is included, our policy provides that airspace may continue to be included in remaining permitted and expansion airspace even if certain of these criteria are no longer met as long as we continue to believe we will ultimately obtain the permit, based on the facts and circumstances of a specific landfill. in these circumstances, continued inclusion must be approved through a landfill-specific review process that includes approval by our chief financial officer and a review by the audit committee of our board of directors on a quarterly basis. of the 16 landfill sites with expansions included at december 31, 2016, three landfills required the chief financial officer to approve the inclusion of the unpermitted airspace because the permit application process did not meet the one- or five-year requirements.
when we include the expansion airspace in our calculations of remaining permitted and expansion airspace, we also include the projected costs for development, as well as the projected asset retirement costs related to final capping, closure and post-closure of the expansion in the amortization basis of the landfill.
once the remaining permitted and expansion airspace is determined in cubic yards, an airspace utilization factor (auf) is established to calculate the remaining permitted and expansion capacity in tons. the auf is established using the measured density obtained from previous annual surveys and is then adjusted to account for future settlement. the amount of settlement that is forecasted will take into account several site-specific factors including current and projected mix of waste type, initial and projected waste density, estimated number of years of life remaining, depth of underlying waste, anticipated access to moisture through precipitation or recirculation of landfill leachate and operating practices. in addition, the initial selection of the auf is subject to a subsequent multi-level review by our engineering group and the auf used is reviewed on a periodic basis and revised as necessary. our historical experience generally indicates that the impact of settlement at a landfill is greater later in the life of the landfill when the waste placed at the landfill approaches its highest point under the permit requirements.
after determining the costs and remaining permitted and expansion capacity at each of our landfills, we determine the per ton rates that will be expensed as waste is received and deposited at the landfill by dividing the costs by the corresponding number of tons. we calculate per ton amortization rates for each landfill for assets associated with each final capping event, for assets related to closure and post-closure activities and for all other costs capitalized or to be capitalized in the future. these rates per ton are updated annually, or more often, as significant facts change.
it is possible that actual results, including the amount of costs incurred, the timing of final capping, closure and post-closure activities, our airspace utilization or the success of our expansion efforts could ultimately turn out to be significantly different from our estimates and assumptions. to the extent that such estimates, or related assumptions, prove to be significantly different than actual results, lower profitability may be experienced due to
index to financial statements higher amortization rates or higher expenses; or higher profitability may result if the opposite occurs. most significantly, if it is determined that expansion capacity should no longer be considered in calculating the recoverability of a landfill asset, we may be required to recognize an asset impairment or incur significantly higher amortization expense. if at any time management makes the decision to abandon the expansion effort, the capitalized costs related to the expansion effort are expensed immediately.
environmental remediation liabilities we are subject to an array of laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment. under current laws and regulations, we may have liabilities for environmental damage caused by operations, or for damage caused by conditions that existed before we acquired a site. these liabilities include potentially responsible party (prp) investigations, settlements, and certain legal and consultant fees, as well as costs directly associated with site investigation and clean up, such as materials, external contractor costs and incremental internal costs directly related to the remedy. we provide for expenses associated with environmental remediation obligations when such amounts are probable and can be reasonably estimated. we routinely review and evaluate sites that require remediation and determine our estimated cost for the likely remedy based on a number of estimates and assumptions.
where it is probable that a liability has been incurred, we estimate costs required to remediate sites based on site-specific facts and circumstances. we routinely review and evaluate sites that require remediation, considering whether we were an owner, operator, transporter, or generator at the site, the amount and type of waste hauled to the site and the number of years we were associated with the site. next, we review the same type of information with respect to other named and unnamed prps. estimates of the costs for the likely remedy are then either developed using our internal resources or by third-party environmental engineers or other service providers. internally developed estimates are based on:
   managements judgment and experience in remediating our own and unrelated parties sites;
   the number, financial resources and relative degree of responsibility of other prps who may be liable for remediation of a specific site; and
long-lived asset impairments we assess our long-lived assets for impairment as required under the applicable accounting standards. if necessary, impairments are recorded in the (income) expense from divestitures, asset impairments and unusual items line item in our consolidated statement of operations.
property and equipment, including landfills and definite-lived intangible assets  we monitor the carrying value of our long-lived assets for potential impairment on an ongoing basis and test the recoverability of such assets generally using significant unobservable (level 3) inputs whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. these events or changes in circumstances, including management decisions pertaining to such assets, are referred to as impairment indicators. if an impairment indicator occurs, we perform a test of recoverability by comparing the carrying value of the asset or asset group to its undiscounted expected future cash flows. if cash flows cannot be separately and independently identified for a single asset, we will determine whether an impairment has occurred for the group of assets for which we can identify the projected cash flows. if the carrying values are in excess of undiscounted expected future cash flows, we measure any impairment by comparing the fair value of the asset or asset group to its carrying value. fair value is generally determined by considering (i) internally developed discounted projected cash flow analysis of the asset or asset group; (ii) actual third-party valuations and/or (iii) information available regarding the current market for similar assets. if the fair value of an asset or asset group is determined to be less
index to financial statements than the carrying amount of the asset or asset group, an impairment in the amount of the difference is recorded in the period that the impairment indicator occurs. estimating future cash flows requires significant judgment and projections may vary from the cash flows eventually realized, which could impact our ability to accurately assess whether an asset has been impaired.
the assessment of impairment indicators and the recoverability of our capitalized costs associated with landfills and related expansion projects require significant judgment due to the unique nature of the waste industry, the highly regulated permitting process and the sensitive estimates involved. during the review of a landfill expansion application, a regulator may initially deny the expansion application although the expansion permit is ultimately granted. in addition, management may periodically divert waste from one landfill to another to conserve remaining permitted landfill airspace, or a landfill may be required to cease accepting waste, prior to receipt of the expansion permit. however, such events occur in the ordinary course of business in the waste industry and do not necessarily result in impairment of our landfill assets because, after consideration of all facts, such events may not affect our belief that we will ultimately obtain the expansion permit. as a result, our tests of recoverability, which generally make use of a probability-weighted cash flow estimation approach, may indicate that no impairment loss should be recorded. see item 7. managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  critical accounting estimates and assumptions  expansion airspace above for discussion of criteria involved in assessing our likelihood of obtaining an expansion permit.
goodwill  at least annually, and more frequently if warranted, we assess the goodwill of our reporting units for impairment using level 3 inputs.
we assess whether a goodwill impairment exists using both qualitative and quantitative assessments. our qualitative assessment involves determining whether events or circumstances exist that indicate it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill. if based on this qualitative assessment we determine it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, we will not perform a quantitative assessment.
if the qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount or if we elect not to perform a qualitative assessment, we perform a quantitative assessment, or two-step impairment test, to determine whether a goodwill impairment exists at the reporting unit. the first step in our quantitative assessment identifies potential impairments by comparing the estimated fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. if the carrying value exceeds estimated fair value, there is an indication of potential impairment and the second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment. fair value is typically estimated using an income approach. however, when appropriate, we may also use a market approach. the income approach is based on the long-term projected future cash flows of the reporting units. we discount the estimated cash flows to present value using a weighted average cost of capital that considers factors such as market assumptions, the timing of the cash flows and the risks inherent in those cash flows. we believe that this approach is appropriate because it provides a fair value estimate based upon the reporting units expected long-term performance considering the economic and market conditions that generally affect our business. the market approach estimates fair value by measuring the aggregate market value of publicly-traded companies with similar characteristics to our business as a multiple of their reported earnings. we then apply that multiple to the reporting units earnings to estimate their fair values. we believe that this approach may also be appropriate in certain circumstances because it provides a fair value estimate using valuation inputs from entities with operations and economic characteristics comparable to our reporting units.
fair value is computed using several factors, including projected future operating results, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows, comparable marketplace data and the cost of capital. there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and to our judgment in applying them in our analysis. however, we believe our methodology for estimating the fair value of our reporting units is reasonable.
index to financial statements see item 7. managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  (income) expense from divestitures, asset impairments and unusual items and note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for information related to goodwill impairments recognized during the reported periods.
indefinite-lived intangible assets other than goodwill  at least annually, and more frequently if warranted, we assess indefinite-lived intangible assets other than goodwill for impairment.
when performing the impairment test for indefinite-lived intangible assets, we generally first conduct a qualitative analysis to determine whether we believe it is more likely than not that an asset has been impaired. if it is more likely than not that an asset has been impaired, we then evaluate for impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of the asset to its carrying value. an impairment charge is recognized if the assets estimated fair value is less than its carrying value.

deferred income taxes deferred income taxes are based on the difference between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities. the deferred income tax provision represents the change during the reporting period in the deferred tax assets and liabilities, net of the effect of acquisitions and dispositions. deferred tax assets include tax loss and credit carry-forwards and are reduced by a valuation allowance if, based on available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. significant judgment is required in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items. we establish reserves for uncertain tax positions when, despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable, we believe that certain positions may be challenged and potentially disallowed. when facts and circumstances change, we adjust these reserves through our provision for income taxes. should interest and penalties be assessed by taxing authorities on any underpayment of income tax, such amounts would be accrued and classified as a component of provision for income taxes in our consolidated statements of operations.
insured and self-insured claims we have retained a significant portion of the risks related to our health and welfare, automobile, general liability and workers compensation claims programs. the exposure for unpaid claims and associated expenses, including incurred but not reported losses, are based on an actuarial valuations and internal estimates. the accruals for these liabilities could be revised if future occurrences or loss developments significantly differ from our assumptions used. estimated recoveries associated with our insured claims are recorded as assets when we believe that the receipt of such amounts is probable.
results of operations operating revenues our operating revenues set forth below are primarily generated from fees charged for our collection, transfer, disposal, and recycling and resource recovery services, and from sales of commodities by our recycling
index to financial statements and landfill gas-to-energy operations. revenues from our collection operations are influenced by factors such as collection frequency, type of collection equipment furnished, type and volume or weight of the waste collected, distance to the disposal facility or mrf and our disposal costs. revenues from our landfill operations consist of tipping fees, which are generally based on the type and weight or volume of waste being disposed of at our disposal facilities. fees charged at transfer stations are generally based on the weight or volume of waste deposited, taking into account our cost of loading, transporting and disposing of the solid waste at a disposal site. recycling revenues generally consist of tipping fees and the sale of recyclable commodities to third parties. the fees we charge for our collection, disposal, transfer and recycling services generally include fuel surcharges, which are indexed to current market costs for diesel fuel. we also provide additional services that are not managed through our solid waste business, including both our strategic business solutions (wmsbs) and energy and environmental services organizations, recycling brokerage services, landfill gas-to-energy services and expanded service offerings and solutions. we also offer portable self-storage and long distance moving services; fluorescent bulb and universal waste mail-back through our lamptracker® program; portable restroom servicing under the name port-o-let®; and street and parking lot sweeping services. in addition, we hold interests in oil and gas producing properties. these operations are presented as other in the table below. our wheelabrator business, divested in december 2014, provides waste-to-energy services and manages waste-to-energy facilities and independent power production plants. the following table summarizes revenues during the years ended december 31 (in millions):

(b)   the amounts reported herein represent the changes in our revenue attributable to average yield for the total company. we also analyze the changes in average yield in terms of related business revenues in order to differentiate the changes in yield attributable to our pricing strategies from the changes that are caused by market-driven price changes in commodities. the following table summarizes changes in revenues from average yield on a related business basis (dollars in millions):
recycling commodities                      51                       4.6             (138   )                 (10.4   )
(i)   calculated by dividing the increase or decrease for the current year by the prior years related business revenue, adjusted to exclude the impacts of divestitures for the current year.
our revenues increased $648 million, or 5.0%, for the year ended december 31, 2016 as compared to the prior year, driven by (i) acquisitions, primarily the acquired operations of sws in january 2016; (ii) revenue growth from yield on our collection and disposal operations; (iii) higher volumes and (iv) higher market prices for the recycling commodities we sell. partially offsetting these revenue increases were (i) lower revenues from our fuel surcharges program due to lower year-over-year diesel fuel prices; (ii) divestitures and (iii) foreign currency translation which affects revenues from our canadian operations.
our revenues decreased $1,035 million, or 7.4%, for the year ended december 31, 2015 as compared to the prior year, driven by (i) divestitures in 2014, principally our wheelabrator business, our puerto rico operations, and certain landfill and collection operations in our eastern canada area; (ii) lower volumes; (iii) lower revenues from our fuel surcharge program due to declining diesel fuel prices; (iv) lower market prices for the recycling commodities we sell and (v) foreign currency translation. partially offsetting these revenue declines were
average yield collection and disposal average yield  this measure reflects the effect on our revenue from the pricing activities of our collection, transfer and landfill operations, exclusive of volume changes. revenue growth from collection and disposal average yield includes not only base rate changes and environmental and service fee increases, but also (i) certain average price changes related to the overall mix of services, which are due to the types of services provided; (ii) changes in average price from new and lost business and (iii) price decreases to retain customers.
recycling commodities  our revenues increased $51 million for the year ended december 31, 2016 as compared with the prior year period due to a 7% year-over-year increase in the market prices for the recycling commodities we sell at our recycling facilities and through our recycling brokerage services. during 2015, revenues declined by $138 million as compared with the prior year due to a 12% year-over-year decline in recycling commodities prices.
fuel surcharges and mandated fees  these revenues, which are predominantly generated by our fuel surcharge program, decreased $67 million and $171 million for the years ended december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. these revenues fluctuate in response to changes in the national average prices for diesel fuel on which our surcharge is based. market prices for diesel fuel decreased approximately 14% in 2016 and 30% in 2015, which caused the decline in fuel surcharge revenues in 2016 and 2015. the mandated fees included in this line item are primarily related to pass-through fees and taxes assessed by various state, county and municipal government agencies at our landfills and transfer stations. these fees did not have a significant impact on the comparability of the periods presented.
index to financial statements volume our revenues increased $186 million, or 1.4%, for the year ended december 31, 2016 as compared with the prior year due to higher volumes. the year-over-year comparison does not include volumes from acquisitions, as discussed below. we experienced higher volumes in all of our collection and disposal lines of business, with the exception of our residential line of business, as a result of (i) improving market conditions; (ii) reduced customer churn and improved sales performance supported by our focus on disciplined growth and (iii) an additional workday in 2016.
additional drivers affecting the comparability of volumes for 2016 to 2015 are as follows:
   due to our focus on renegotiating existing contracts and winning new contracts with reasonable returns, we continue to see revenue declines in our residential line of business; and
   in our ancillary service businesses, we experienced higher volumes in 2016 as compared with the prior year resulting from our energy and environmental services organization, particularly our remediation and construction services, wm renewable energy and our portable self-storage businesses. these volume increases were partially offset by lower volumes resulting from lower oil prices, which negatively affected both our oil and gas producing properties and our oilfield services business.
declines in our volumes caused our revenue to decrease $215 million, or 1.6%, for the year ended december 31, 2015, as compared with the prior year. we experienced lower volumes in (i) our collection line of business, primarily due to competition and our pricing strategies; (ii) our mrfs, primarily driven by the rationalization of our underperforming assets and our strategy to not renew municipal contracts that did not reflect current market conditions and (iii) our ancillary services businesses, primarily due to the loss of certain large accounts in our wmsbs organization and lower oil prices, which negatively affected both our oil and gas producing properties and our oilfield services business. these decreases in volumes were partially offset by increases in the municipal solid waste business driven by new business and improving market conditions that favorably affected our landfill and transfer lines of business.
acquisitions and divestitures revenues increased $268 million and $174 million for the years ended december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, as compared with the prior year periods, due to acquisitions. the increase in revenues in 2016 was principally due to the acquired operations of sws in january 2016. the revenue increase in 2015 was principally due to the acquired operations of deffenbaugh in march 2015.
these revenues were offset by revenue decreases of $30 million and $762 million for the years ended december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, as compared with the prior year periods, due to divestitures. the decrease in revenues in 2015 was primarily driven by the divestitures in 2014 of our wheelabrator business, our puerto rico operations and certain landfill and collection operations in our eastern canada area.
operating expenses our operating expenses are comprised of (i) labor and related benefits (excluding labor costs associated with maintenance and repairs discussed below), which include salaries and wages, bonuses, related payroll taxes, insurance and benefits costs and the costs associated with contract labor; (ii) transfer and disposal costs, which include tipping fees paid to third-party disposal facilities and transfer stations; (iii) maintenance and repairs relating to equipment, vehicles and facilities and related labor costs; (iv) subcontractor costs, which include the costs of independent haulers who transport waste collected by us to disposal facilities and are affected by variables such as volumes, distance and fuel prices; (v) costs of goods sold, which includes the cost to purchase recycling materials for our recycling business, including rebates paid to suppliers; (vi) fuel costs, which represent the costs of fuel and oil to operate our truck fleet and landfill operating equipment; (vii) disposal and franchise fees and taxes, which include landfill taxes, municipal franchise fees, host community fees, contingent landfill
index to financial statements lease payments and royalties; (viii) landfill operating costs, which include interest accretion on landfill liabilities, interest accretion on and discount rate adjustments to environmental remediation liabilities and recovery assets, leachate and methane collection and treatment, landfill remediation costs and other landfill site costs; (ix) risk management costs, which include general liability, automobile liability, workers compensation and insurance and claim costs and (x) other operating costs, which include telecommunications, equipment and facility rent, property taxes, utilities and supplies.
our operating expenses increased $255 million, or 3.1%, when comparing 2016 with 2015 and decreased $771 million, or 8.6%, when comparing 2015 with 2014. operating expenses as a percentage of revenues were 62.4% in 2016, 63.5% in 2015, and 64.3% in 2014.

significant items affecting the comparison of operating expenses between periods reported include:
labor and related benefits  the increase in labor and related benefits in 2016 as compared with 2015 was due to (i) higher wages due to merit increases; (ii) additional costs associated with the acquired operations of sws in january 2016; (iii) health and welfare cost increases; (iv) an additional workday in 2016 and (v) higher incentive compensation costs. these cost increases were partially offset by (i) $51 million of charges in 2015 associated with the withdrawal from certain underfunded multiemployer pension plans and (ii) lower headcount and contract labor costs in 2016 due to operating efficiencies in our recycling line of business.
the decrease in labor and related benefits in 2015 as compared with 2014 was due to (i) reduced costs of $88 million due to the divestitures in 2014 of our wheelabrator business, our puerto rico operations, and certain landfill and collection operations in our eastern canada area; (ii) lower headcount and contract labor costs due to operating efficiencies in our recycling line of business and lower volumes in our collection line of business and (iii) lower health and welfare costs. these cost decreases were partially offset by (i) $51 million of charges in 2015 associated with the withdrawal from certain underfunded multiemployer pension plans; (ii) higher wages due to merit increases and (iii) additional costs associated with the acquired operations of deffenbaugh in march 2015.
transfer and disposal costs  the increase in transfer and disposal costs in 2016 compared to 2015 was driven by acquisitions, primarily sws, and our overall increase in volumes. the increase in costs in 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily due to incurring third-party costs for services previously provided on an intercompany basis prior to the divestiture of our wheelabrator business in december 2014. these cost increases were partially offset by $53 million in reduced costs due to the divestitures in 2014.
index to financial statements maintenance and repairs  the increase in maintenance and repairs in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily driven by (i) higher labor and parts and supplies costs and (ii) acquisitions, primarily the acquired operations of sws. the decrease in costs in 2015 compared to 2014 was largely driven by a $177 million decrease due to the divestitures in 2014, which was partially offset by increased costs related to the acquired operations of deffenbaugh.
subcontractor costs  the increase in subcontractor cost in 2016 compared to 2015 was driven by (i) acquisitions and (ii) higher volumes in our wmsbs organization. these increases were partially offset by a decrease in subcontracted remediation services to industrial customers. the decrease in costs in 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily driven by (i) volume decreases in our wmsbs organization and (ii) lower landfill and recycling costs. these decreases were partially offset by an increase in subcontracted remediation services to industrial customers.
cost of goods sold  the increase in cost of goods sold in 2016 compared to 2015 was due to (i) higher market prices for recycling commodities and (ii) increased costs in our remediation services business, partially offset by lower costs due to continued efforts to restructure recycling rebates paid to customers. the decrease in costs in 2015 compared to 2014 was due to (i) lower market prices for recycling commodities; (ii) lower costs of $81 million due to the 2014 divestitures; (iii) increased efforts to restructure recycling rebates paid to customers and (iv) ongoing recycling business improvement efforts around inbound quality control.
fuel  the decrease in fuel costs in 2016 and 2015 when compared to the prior year periods was driven by (i) lower fuel prices; (ii) lower costs resulting from the continued conversion of our fleet to natural gas vehicles; (iii) year-over-year increases in natural gas fuel excise credits and (iv) reduced fuel consumption due to efficiency gains in the routing of our fleet. the increase in collection volumes in 2016 partially offset these decreases.
disposal and franchise fees and taxes  the increase in disposal and franchise fees and taxes in 2016 compared to 2015 is primarily due to (i) higher landfill volumes and (ii) increased municipal franchise fees and subcontracted remediation services to industrial customers. the decrease when comparing 2015 to 2014 is primarily driven by the divestitures in 2014.
landfill operating costs  the increase in landfill operating costs when comparing 2016 to 2015 is primarily due to higher leachate management costs. leachate management costs have increased because, in certain parts of the country, we are transporting leachate further in order to reach treatment facilities, the third-party fees charged for treatment of waste water have increased and the volume of leachate being disposed has increased.
higher leachate transportation and disposal costs also affected the comparison of our landfill operating costs for 2015 and 2014, though the increased costs were more than offset by the impact of 2014 divestitures and discount rate adjustments. as discussed in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, we record adjustments to our landfill operating costs for changes in u.s. treasury rates used to discount the present value of our environmental remediation liabilities and recovery assets.
other  the decrease in costs in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily related to lower rental costs and favorable adjustments to our contingent consideration liabilities associated with certain acquisitions. the decrease in costs in 2015 compared to 2014 was principally driven by a decrease of $63 million due to the divestitures in 2014.
selling, general and administrative expenses our selling, general and administrative expenses consist of (i) labor and related benefits which include salaries, bonuses, related insurance and benefits, contract labor, payroll taxes and equity-based compensation;
(ii) professional fees, which include fees for consulting, legal, audit and tax services; (iii) provision for bad debts, which includes allowances for uncollectible customer accounts and collection fees and (iv) other selling, general and administrative expenses, which include, among other costs, facility-related expenses, voice and data telecommunication, advertising, bank charges, computer costs, travel and entertainment, rentals, postage and printing. in addition, the financial impacts of litigation settlements generally are included in our other selling, general and administrative expenses.
our selling, general and administrative expenses increased $67 million, or 5.0%, when comparing 2016 with 2015 and decreased $138 million, or 9.3%, when comparing 2015 with 2014. our selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues were 10.4% in 2016, 10.4% in 2015 and 10.6% in 2014.

labor and related benefits  the increase in labor and related benefits was primarily due to (i) higher incentive compensation costs; (ii) merit increases; (iii) higher severance costs and (iv) acquisitions.
other  the decrease in other expenses was principally driven by favorable litigation settlements and lower bank charges.
the divestitures in 2014, primarily the sale of our wheelabrator business in december 2014, favorably affected all cost categories when comparing expenses in 2015 to 2014. in addition to the impact of divestitures, other significant factors affecting our expense in 2015 as compared to 2014 include:
labor and related benefits  the decrease in labor and related benefits was due to (i) cost savings from our august 2014 reorganization and (ii) lower incentive compensation costs, which were partially offset by merit increases.
other  the decrease in other expenses was principally driven by lower litigation settlement costs and our continued focus on controlling costs.
depreciation and amortization expenses depreciation and amortization expenses include (i) depreciation of property and equipment, including assets recorded for capital leases, on a straight-line basis from three to 40 years; (ii) amortization of landfill costs, including those incurred and all estimated future costs for landfill development, construction and asset retirement costs arising from closure and post-closure, on a units-of-consumption method as landfill airspace is consumed over the total estimated remaining capacity of a site, which includes both permitted capacity and expansion capacity that meets our company-specific criteria for amortization purposes; (iii) amortization of landfill asset retirement costs arising from final capping obligations on a units-of-consumption method as airspace is
index to financial statements consumed over the estimated capacity associated with each final capping event and (iv) amortization of intangible assets with a definite life, using either a 150% declining balance approach or a straight-line basis over the definitive terms of the related agreements, which are generally from two to 15 years depending on the type of asset.
the decrease in depreciation of tangible property and equipment during 2015 as compared to the prior year is primarily due to the december 2014 sale of our wheelabrator business as discussed further in note 19 to the consolidated financial statements. the increase in amortization of landfill airspace during 2015 as compared to the prior year is primarily due to increased volumes, a portion of which relates to the acquisition of deffenbaugh in march 2015. this increase was partially offset by favorable adjustments resulting from changes in landfill estimates.
restructuring costs during the year ended december 31, 2016, we recognized $4 million of pre-tax restructuring charges, of which $2 million was related to employee severance and benefit costs. the remaining charges were primarily related to operating lease obligations for property that will no longer be utilized.
during the year ended december 31, 2015, we recognized $15 million of pre-tax restructuring charges, of which $10 million was related to employee severance and benefit costs, including costs associated with the loss of a municipal contract in our eastern canada area and our acquisition of deffenbaugh. the remaining charges were primarily related to operating lease obligations for property that will no longer be utilized.
in august 2014, we announced a consolidation and realignment of several corporate functions to better support achievement of the companys strategic goals, including cost reduction. voluntary separation arrangements were offered to all salaried employees within these organizations. approximately 650 employees separated from our corporate and recycling organizations in connection with this restructuring. during the year ended december 31, 2014, we recognized a total of $82 million of pre-tax restructuring charges, of which $70 million was related to employee severance and benefit costs. the remaining charges were primarily related to operating lease obligations for property that will no longer be utilized.
(income) expense from divestitures, asset impairments and unusual items the following table summarizes the major components of (income) expense from divestitures, asset impairments and unusual items for the years ended december 31 (in millions):
(income) expense from divestitures            $9         $(7   )       $(515     )
during the year ended december 31, 2016, we recognized net charges of $112 million, primarily related to (i) $44 million of charges to adjust our subsidiarys estimated environmental remediation liability related to a closed site in harris county, texas, as further discussed in note 11 to the consolidated financial statements; (ii) a $43 million charge to impair a landfill in western pennsylvania due to a loss of expected volumes; (iii) $12 million of goodwill impairment charges primarily related to our lamptracker® reporting unit and (iv) an $8 million loss on the sale of a majority-owned organics company.
during the year ended december 31, 2015, we recognized net charges of $82 million, primarily related to (i) $66 million of charges to impair certain of our oil and gas producing properties as a result of the continued decline in oil and gas prices; (ii) $18 million of charges to write down or divest certain assets in our recycling operations and (iii) a $5 million impairment of a landfill in our western canada area due to revised post-closure cost estimates. partially offsetting these charges was $7 million in net gains from divestitures, including a $6 million gain on the sale of an oil and gas producing property in 2015.
                              divestitures  we recognized net gains of $515 million, primarily as a result of a $519 million gain on the sale of our wheelabrator business and an $18 million gain on the sale of certain landfill and collection operations in our eastern canada area. partially offsetting these gains was a $25 million loss on the divestiture of our puerto rico operations. refer to note 19 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information related to our divestitures.
   goodwill impairments  we recognized $10 million of goodwill impairment charges related to our recycling reporting unit.
   other impairments  we recognized additional impairment charges of $73 million to write down assets in our waste diversion technology, renewable energy, recycling and medical waste operations.
see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information related to the accounting policy and analysis involved in identifying and calculating impairments.
solid waste  the most significant items affecting the results of operations of our solid waste business during the three years ended december 31, 2016 are summarized below:
   our traditional solid waste business benefited from internal revenue growth; and
   we recognized $51 million of charges associated with the withdrawal from certain underfunded multiemployer pension plans in 2015 impacting all three tiers.
in addition, the following items affected the comparability of 2016 to 2015:
   our recycling business was favorable in 2016 compared to 2015 principally due to (i) continued cost reductions; (ii) higher market prices for recycling commodities and (iii) the impairment of various recycling assets in 2015;
   higher labor and related benefit costs in 2016 due to merit increases, higher incentive compensation costs and increases in health and welfare costs; and
in addition, the following items affected the comparability of 2015 to 2014:
   the unfavorable impact on our oilfield services business, primarily in tier 2, of reduced drilling and auxiliary activities as a result of declining oil and gas prices in 2015;
   our recycling business was unfavorable in 2015 compared to 2014 principally due to (i) lower market prices for recycling commodities and (ii) the impairment of various recycling assets in 2015. these unfavorable amounts were partially offset by continued cost reductions.
index to financial statements other  our other income from operations includes (i) our wmsbs organization; (ii) those elements of our landfill gas-to-energy operations and third-party subcontract and administration revenues managed by our energy and environmental services and wm renewable energy organizations that are not included with the operations of our reportable segments; (iii) our recycling brokerage services and (iv) our expanded service offerings and solutions, such as portable self-storage and long distance moving services, fluorescent lamp recycling, and interests we hold in oil and gas producing properties. in addition, our other income from operations reflects the results of non-operating entities that provide financial assurance and self-insurance support for our solid waste business.
the following items affected comparability of 2016 to 2015:
   increased expenses in 2016 from divestitures, asset impairments and unusual items related to a loss on the sale of a majority-owned organics company and goodwill impairments, primarily related to our lamptracker® reporting unit.
the following items affected comparability of 2015 to 2014:
corporate and other the following items affected comparability of 2016 to 2015:
   higher labor and related benefit costs in 2016 due to higher incentive compensation costs, severance costs, health and welfare costs and merit increases;
   an increase in a subsidiarys estimated environmental remediation liability related to a closed site in harris county, texas in 2016;
the following items affected comparability of 2015 to 2014:
   restructuring costs related to our august 2014 reorganization and subsequent benefits resulting from our restructuring efforts;
   unfavorable adjustments in 2014 related to changes in u.s. treasury rates used to discount our environmental remediation liabilities and recovery assets to present value; and
   increased risk management costs in 2015 primarily related to certain higher than anticipated general liability claim settlements and a favorable risk management allocation in 2014.
wheelabrator  the most significant item affecting the results of operations of our wheelabrator business in 2014 was a $519 million gain on sale of this business in december 2014.
interest expense, net our interest expense, net was $376 million in 2016, $385 million in 2015 and $466 million in 2014. during 2016, the decrease in interest expense was primarily attributable to the impacts of lower market interest rates on certain of our tax-exempt bonds, partially offset by increased borrowings under our $2.25 billion revolving credit facility. during 2015, the decrease in interest expense was primarily attributable to the refinancing of a significant portion of our high-coupon senior notes. as a result of the combination of make-whole redemptions of certain senior notes, cash tender offers to purchase certain senior notes and the issuance of $1.8 billion of new senior notes, we reduced the weighted average interest rate of our senior note portfolio by 1%.
loss on early extinguishment of debt loss on early extinguishment of debt was $4 million and $555 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively. the amount for 2015 was primarily associated with the early extinguishment of almost $2 billion of our high-coupon senior notes through make-whole redemption and cash tender offers. we replaced substantially all of the debt extinguished with new senior notes at significantly lower coupon interest rates and extended the weighted average duration of these debt obligations. the loss on early extinguishment of debt reflected in our consolidated statement of operations for 2015 includes $122 million of charges related to make-whole redemptions and $430 million of charges related to cash tender offers.
equity in net losses of unconsolidated entities we recognized equity in net losses of unconsolidated entities of $44 million, $38 million and $53 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. these losses are primarily related to our noncontrolling interests in entities established to invest in and manage low-income housing properties and a refined coal facility. the tax impacts realized as a result of our investments in low-income housing properties and the refined coal facility are discussed below in provision for income taxes. refer to notes 9 and 20 to the consolidated financial statements for more information related to these investments. the amount in 2014 includes charges of $11 million primarily to write down equity method investments in waste diversion technology companies to their fair value.
other, net we recognized other, net expense of $50 million, $7 million and $29 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. the expenses for 2016, 2015 and 2014 were impacted by impairment charges of $42 million, $5 million and $22 million, respectively, related to other-than-temporary declines in the value of minority-owned, cost method investments in waste diversion technology companies. in addition, we recognized $8 million of expense during the first quarter of 2016 associated with the termination of our cross-currency swaps, which is discussed further in note 8 to the consolidated financial statements.
index to financial statements years ended 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. the comparability of our reported income taxes for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 is primarily affected by (i) variations in our income before income taxes, as discussed above; (ii) federal tax credits; (iii) tax audit settlements; (iv) the realization of state net operating losses and credits; (v) adjustments to our accruals and related deferred taxes and (vi) the tax implications of impairments and divestitures. the impacts of these items are summarized below:
                                       investments qualifying for federal tax credits  our low-income housing properties and refined coal facility investments reduced our provision for income taxes by $55 million, $57 million and $58 million, primarily as a result of the tax credits realized from these investments for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. refer to note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for more information related to these investments.
   other federal tax credits  during 2016, 2015 and 2014, we recognized federal tax credits in addition to the tax credits realized from our investments in low-income housing properties and the refined coal facility, resulting in a reduction to our provision for income taxes of $14 million, $15 million and $13 million, respectively.
   tax audit settlements  the settlement of various tax audits resulted in a reduction to our provision for income taxes of $11 million, $10 million and $12 million for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
   state net operating losses and credits  during 2016, 2015 and 2014, we recognized state net operating losses and credits resulting in a reduction to our provision for income taxes of $10 million,
                     tax implications of divestitures  during 2014, the company recorded a net gain of $515 million primarily related to the divestiture of our wheelabrator business, our puerto rico operations and certain landfill and collection operations in our eastern canada area. had this net gain been fully taxable, our provision for income taxes would have increased by $138 million. during 2015, the company recorded an additional $10 million net gain primarily related to post-closing adjustments on the wheelabrator divestiture and had this gain been fully taxable, our provision for income taxes would have increased by $4 million. during 2016, the company recorded a loss of $9 million related to the divestiture of certain assets and had the associated tax loss been fully deductible, our provision for income taxes would have decreased by $5 million. refer to note 19 to the consolidated financial statements for more information related to our divestitures.
based on current tax laws and regulations, we expect our 2017 recurring effective tax rate will be approximately 36.5% based on projected income before income taxes, federal tax credits and other permanent items.
noncontrolling interests net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests was $2 million in 2016 and $1 million in 2015 and net income attributable to noncontrolling interests was $40 million in 2014. the income for 2014 was principally related to third-parties equity interests in two limited liability companies (llcs) that owned three waste-to-
index to financial statements energy facilities operated by our wheelabrator business. in december 2014, we purchased the noncontrolling interests in the llcs from the third parties. the llcs were then subsequently sold as part of the divestiture of our wheelabrator business. refer to notes 19 and 20 to the consolidated financial statements for information related to the sale of our wheelabrator business and the consolidation of these variable interest entities, respectively.
landfill and environmental remediation discussion and analysis we owned or operated 243 solid waste and five secure hazardous waste landfills at december 31, 2016 and 244 solid waste and five secure hazardous waste landfills at december 31, 2015. for these landfills, the following table reflects changes in capacity, as measured in tons of waste, for the years ended december 31 and remaining capacity, measured in cubic yards of waste, at december 31 (in millions):

(a)   amounts reflected here relate to the combined impacts of (i) new expansions pursued; (ii) increases or decreases in the airspace being pursued for ongoing expansion efforts; (iii) adjustments for differences between the airspace being pursued and airspace granted and (iv) decreases due to decisions to no longer pursue expansion permits, if any.
(b)   we received expansion permits at 13 of our landfills during 2016 and six of our landfills during 2015, demonstrating our continued success in working with municipalities and regulatory agencies to expand the disposal capacity of our existing landfills.
(c)              changes in engineering estimates can result in changes to the estimated available remaining capacity of a landfill or changes in the utilization of such landfill capacity, affecting the number of tons that can be placed in the future. estimates of the amount of waste that can be placed in the future are reviewed annually by our engineers and are based on a number of factors, including standard engineering techniques and site-specific factors such as current and projected mix of waste type; initial and projected waste density; estimated number of years of life remaining; depth of underlying waste; anticipated access to moisture through precipitation or recirculation of landfill leachate and operating practices. we continually focus on improving the utilization of airspace through efforts that include recirculating landfill leachate where allowed by permit;
optimizing the placement of daily cover materials and increasing initial compaction through improved landfill equipment, operations and training.
# of                   total               tons per         # of               total               tons per sites                    tons                    day        sites                tons                    day solid waste landfills                                                                   243   (a)           104,913                    384          244              96,777                    355
(b)   these amounts include 1.2 million tons at both december 31, 2016 and 2015, that were received at our landfills but were used for beneficial purposes and generally were redirected from the permitted airspace to other areas of the landfill. waste types that are frequently identified for beneficial use include green waste for composting and clean dirt for on-site construction projects.
when a landfill we own or operate receives certification of closure from the applicable regulatory agency, we generally transfer the management of the site, including any remediation activities, to our closed sites management group. as of december 31, 2016, our closed sites management group managed 213 closed landfills.
based on remaining permitted airspace as of december 31, 2016 and projected annual disposal volumes, the weighted average remaining landfill life for all of our owned or operated landfills is approximately 45 years. many of our landfills have the potential for expanded disposal capacity beyond what is currently permitted. we monitor the availability of permitted disposal capacity at each of our landfills and evaluate whether to pursue an expansion at a given landfill based on estimated future waste volumes, disposal prices, construction and operating costs, remaining capacity and likelihood of obtaining an expansion permit. we are seeking expansion permits at 16 of our landfills that meet the expansion criteria outlined in the critical accounting estimates and assumptions  landfills section above. although no assurances can be made that all future expansions will be permitted or permitted as designed, the weighted average remaining landfill life for all owned or operated landfills is approximately 47 years when considering remaining permitted airspace, expansion airspace and projected annual disposal volume.
the number of landfills owned or operated as of december 31, 2016, segregated by their estimated operating lives based on remaining permitted and expansion capacity and projected annual disposal volume, was as follows:
index to financial statements as of december 31, 2016, we have 15 landfills which are not currently accepting waste. we performed tests of recoverability for eight of these landfills and during the year ended december 31, 2016, we recognized a $43 million charge to impair one of these landfills in western pennsylvania due to a loss of expected volumes. for the other seven landfills, with an aggregate net recorded capitalized landfill asset cost of $281 million, the undiscounted expected future cash flows resulting from our probability-weighted estimation approach exceeded the carrying values. we did not perform recoverability tests for the remaining seven landfills as the net recorded capitalized landfill asset cost was immaterial.
landfill assets  we capitalize various costs that we incur to prepare a landfill to accept waste. these costs generally include expenditures for land (including the landfill footprint and required landfill buffer property), permitting, excavation, liner material and installation, landfill leachate collection systems, landfill gas collection systems, environmental monitoring equipment for groundwater and landfill gas, directly related engineering, capitalized interest, and on-site road construction and other capital infrastructure costs. the cost basis of our landfill assets also includes estimates of future costs associated with landfill final capping, closure and post-closure activities, which are discussed further below.
capital additions                                                     488                                              488
asset retirement obligations incurred and capitalized                  55                                               55
as of december 31, 2016, we estimate that we will spend approximately $400 million in 2017, and approximately $900 million in 2018 and 2019 combined, for the construction and development of our landfill assets. the specific timing of landfill capital spending is dependent on future events and spending estimates are subject to change due to fluctuations in landfill waste volumes, changes in environmental requirements and other factors impacting landfill operations.
landfill and environmental remediation liabilities  as we accept waste at our landfills, we incur significant asset retirement obligations, which include liabilities associated with landfill final capping, closure and post-closure activities. these liabilities are accounted for in accordance with authoritative guidance on accounting for asset retirement obligations and are discussed in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements. we also have liabilities for the remediation of properties that have incurred environmental damage, which generally was caused by operations or for damage caused by conditions that existed before we acquired operations or a site. we recognize environmental remediation liabilities when we determine that the liability is probable and the estimated cost for the likely remedy can be reasonably estimated.
index to financial statements the changes to landfill and environmental remediation liabilities for the year ended december 31, 2016 are reflected in the table below (in millions):
obligations incurred and capitalized                            59                     
interest accretion on landfill liabilities                                                                 $91           $89           $88
interest accretion on and discount rate adjustments to environmental remediation liabilities and                          1            14
other landfill site costs                                                                                   70            64            71
(a)   leachate management costs have increased because, in certain parts of the country, we are transporting leachate further in order to reach treatment facilities, the third-party fees charged for treatment of waste water have increased and the volume of leachate being disposed has increased.
   the amortization of landfill capital costs, including (i) costs that have been incurred and capitalized and (ii) estimated future costs for landfill development and construction required to develop our landfills to their remaining permitted and expansion airspace; and
   the amortization of asset retirement costs arising from landfill final capping, closure and post-closure obligations, including (i) costs that have been incurred and capitalized and (ii) projected asset retirement costs.
amortization expense is recorded on a units-of-consumption basis, applying cost as a rate per ton. the rate per ton is calculated by dividing each component of the amortizable basis of a landfill by the number of tons needed to fill the corresponding assets airspace. landfill capital costs and closure and post-closure asset retirement costs are generally incurred to support the operation of the landfill over its entire operating life and are, therefore, amortized on a per-ton basis using a landfills total airspace capacity. final capping asset retirement costs are related to a specific final capping event and are, therefore, amortized on a per-ton basis using each discrete final capping events estimated airspace capacity. accordingly, each landfill has multiple per-ton amortization rates.
index to financial statements different per-ton amortization rates are applied at each of our 248 landfills, and per-ton amortization rates vary significantly from one landfill to another due to (i) inconsistencies that often exist in construction costs and provincial, state and local regulatory requirements for landfill development and landfill final capping, closure and post-closure activities and (ii) differences in the cost basis of landfills that we develop versus those that we acquire. accordingly, our landfill airspace amortization expense measured on a per-ton basis can fluctuate due to changes in the mix of volumes we receive across the company year-over-year.
liquidity and capital resources we continually monitor our actual and forecasted cash flows, our liquidity and our capital resources, enabling us to plan for our present needs and fund unbudgeted business activities that may arise during the year as a result of changing business conditions or new opportunities. in addition to our working capital needs for the general and administrative costs of our ongoing operations, we have cash requirements for: (i) the construction and expansion of our landfills; (ii) additions to and maintenance of our trucking fleet and landfill equipment; (iii) construction, refurbishments and improvements at materials recovery facilities; (iv) the container and equipment needs of our operations; (v) final capping, closure and post-closure activities at our landfills; (vi) the repayment of debt, payment of interest and discharging of other obligations and (vii) capital expenditures, acquisitions and investments in support of our strategic growth plans. we also are committed to providing our shareholders with a return on their investment through dividend payments and our common stock repurchase program.
we use long-term borrowings in addition to the cash we generate from operations as part of our overall financial strategy to support and grow our business. we primarily use senior notes and tax-exempt bonds to borrow on a long-term basis, but we also use other instruments and facilities, when appropriate. the components of our borrowings as of december 31, 2016 are described in note 7 to the consolidated financial statements.
as of december 31, 2016, the current portion of our long-term debt balance of $417 million includes (i) $230 million of short-term borrowings under our long-term $2.25 billion revolving credit facility and (ii)
$187 million of other debt with scheduled maturities within the next 12 months, including $126 million of tax-exempt bonds.
as of december 31, 2016, we have classified $196 million of borrowings outstanding under our $2.25 billion revolving credit facility as long-term because we intend and have the ability to refinance or maintain these borrowings on a long-term basis. we generally use available cash to repay borrowings outstanding under our $2.25 billion revolving credit facility and any remaining balances are maintained by extending the maturities of the borrowings. our current projections indicate that we will maintain $196 million of the $426 million of borrowings outstanding for the next 12 months. the remaining $230 million of borrowings outstanding under our $2.25 billion revolving credit facility is classified as current in our consolidated balance sheet at december 31, 2016.
as of december 31, 2016, we also have $473 million of tax-exempt bonds with term interest rate periods that expire within the next 12 months and an additional $491 million of variable-rate tax-exempt bonds that are supported by letters of credit. the interest rates on our variable-rate tax-exempt bonds are generally reset on either a daily or weekly basis through a remarketing process. all recent tax-exempt bond remarketings have successfully placed company bonds with investors at market-driven rates and we currently expect future remarketings to be successful. however, if the remarketing agent is unable to remarket our bonds, the remarketing agent can put the bonds to us. in the event of a failed remarketing, we have the intent and ability to use availability under our $2.25 billion revolving credit facility to fund the debt obligations until they can be remarketed successfully. accordingly, we classified these borrowings as long-term in our consolidated balance sheet at december 31, 2016.
we have credit facilities in place to support our liquidity and financial assurance needs. the following table summarizes our outstanding letters of credit, categorized by type of facility at december 31 (in millions):
$2.25 billion revolving credit facility(a)            $789            $831
other letter of credit facilities(b)                   492             466
(a)   in july 2015, we amended and restated our $2.25 billion revolving credit facility extending the term through july 2020. at december 31, 2016, we had $426 million of outstanding borrowings and $789 million of letters of credit issued and supported by the facility, leaving an unused and available credit capacity of $1,035 million.
(b)   as of december 31, 2016, we had utilized $492 million of other letter of credit facilities, which are both committed and uncommitted, with terms extending through december 2018.
summary of cash flow activity the following is a summary of our cash flows for the years ended december 31 (in millions):
net cash provided by operating activities                 $2,960              $2,498                 $2,331
net cash provided by (used in) investing activities       $(1,932     )       $(1,608     )            $995
net cash used in financing activities                     $(1,035     )       $(2,155     )         $(2,072   )
net cash provided by operating activities  the most significant items affecting the comparison of our operating cash flows in 2016 as compared to 2015 are summarized below:
    increase in earnings  our income from operations, excluding depreciation and amortization and asset impairments and unusual items, increased by $337 million on a year-over-year basis, principally driven
index to financial statements by earnings from our traditional solid waste business. our 2015 results included $51 million of charges associated with the withdrawal from certain underfunded multiemployer pension plans, of which payments of approximately $60 million were made in 2015.
                   cross-currency swaps  during the first quarter of 2016, we terminated our cross-currency swaps associated with the anticipated cash flows of intercompany loans between wm holdings and its wholly-owned canadian subsidiaries, as discussed further in note 8 to the consolidated financial statements. in connection with the termination, we received cash proceeds of $67 million, which were classified as a change in other current assets
   decrease in annual incentive plan cash payments  payments for our annual incentive plans are typically made in the first quarter of the year based on prior year performance. our cash flow from operating activities was favorably impacted by $46 million on a year-over-year basis, as the annual incentive cash payments made in 2016 were lower than the cash payments made in 2015.
   increase in income tax payments  cash paid for income taxes, net of excess tax benefits associated with equity-based transactions, was $36 million higher on a year-over-year basis largely driven by higher pre-tax earnings in the current year.
             changes in assets and liabilities, net of effects from business acquisitions and divestitures  our cash flows from operating activities were favorably impacted on a year-over-year basis due to net changes in our assets and liabilities, exclusive of the items noted above, particularly non-trade related items including payroll and incentive accruals.
the most significant items affecting the comparison of our operating cash flows in 2015 as compared with 2014 are summarized below:
   increased earnings from our traditional solid waste business  in 2015, we saw an increase in earnings from our traditional solid waste business, which was enhanced by acquisitions and corporate overhead cost reductions. these cash flow improvements were slightly offset by a decrease in earnings from our recycling operations.
   cash flow of divested businesses  the divestiture of wheelabrator in december 2014 coupled with the sale of other solid waste businesses throughout 2014 negatively affected the year-over-year comparison by approximately $140 million.
   decrease in income tax payments  cash paid for income taxes, net of excess tax benefits associated with equity-based transactions, was approximately $329 million lower on a year-over-year basis, largely driven by (i) lower year-over-year pre-tax earnings primarily due to the loss on early extinguishment of debt in 2015 and (ii) the income tax implications and related impacts of divestitures and impairment charges.
   multiemployer pension plan settlements  in 2015, we paid approximately $60 million for the withdrawal from certain underfunded multiemployer pension plans. see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
                                     forward-starting swaps  during the first quarter of 2014, the forward-starting interest rate swaps associated with the anticipated issuance of senior notes in 2014 matured and we paid cash of
$36 million to settle the liabilities related to these swaps, as discussed further in note 8 to the consolidated financial statements. this cash payment was classified as a change in
accounts payable and accrued liabilities.
           changes in assets and liabilities, net of effects from business acquisitions and divestitures  our cash flow from operating activities was unfavorably impacted on a year-over-year basis by net changes in our assets and liabilities, exclusive of the items noted above, particularly non-trade related items including payroll and incentive accruals.
net cash provided by (used in) investing activities  the most significant items affecting the comparison of our investing cash flows for the periods presented are summarized below:
                                        capital expenditures  we used $1,339 million during 2016 for capital expenditures, compared with $1,233 million in 2015 and $1,151 million in 2014. the increase in our capital expenditures in both years is generally the result of additional spending on new business opportunities and acquisitions, growth in our existing business and asset replacement timing. in addition, the construction of a waste-water treatment facility at one of our landfills also contributed to the increase in 2016. although, we experienced capital expenditure increases in both 2016 and 2015, the company continues to maintain a disciplined focus on capital management.
                                 proceeds from divestitures  proceeds from divestitures of businesses and other assets (net of cash divested) were $43 million in 2016, $145 million in 2015 and $2,253 million in 2014.
in 2016 and 2015, $2 million and $79 million of these divestitures, respectively, were made as part of our continuous focus on improving or divesting certain non-strategic or underperforming operations, with the remaining amounts generally related to the sale of fixed assets. in 2014, our proceeds from divestitures were primarily related to the sale of our wheelabrator business for $1.95 billion and, to a lesser extent, the sale of our puerto rico operations and certain landfill and collection operations in our eastern canada area.

   net receipts from restricted funds  net cash received from our restricted trust and escrow accounts contributed $51 million and $19 million to our investing activities in 2015 and 2014, respectively. in 2015, these activities were largely related to our replacement of funded trust and escrow accounts with alternative forms of financial assurance.

$125 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. the amount for 2014 is primarily attributable to the purchase of the noncontrolling interests in the llcs related to our waste-to-energy facilities in december 2014 for $91 million. the llcs were then subsequently sold as part of the wheelabrator divestiture, also in december 2014. see note 20 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of these llcs.
index to financial statements summary of contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december 31, 2016 and the anticipated effect of these obligations on our liquidity in future years (in millions):
expected environmental liabilities:(a)
estimated unconditional purchase obligations(g)                  179             149             112              92              88             336           956
anticipated liquidity impact as of december 31, 2016          $1,381          $1,502          $1,045          $1,381          $1,043         $11,431       $17,783
(a)   environmental liabilities include final capping, closure, post-closure and environmental remediation costs recorded in our consolidated balance sheet as of december 31, 2016, without the impact of discounting and inflation. our recorded environmental liabilities for final capping, closure and post-closure will increase as we continue to place additional tons within the permitted airspace at our landfills.
(c)                                     our debt obligations as of december 31, 2016 include $473 million of tax-exempt bonds with term interest rate periods scheduled to expire within the next 12 months. if the re-offerings of the bonds are unsuccessful, then the bonds can be put to us, requiring immediate repayment. we have classified the anticipated cash flows for these contractual obligations based on the scheduled maturity of the borrowings for purposes of this disclosure. for additional information regarding the classification of these borrowings in our consolidated balance sheet as of december 31, 2016, refer to note 7 to the consolidated financial statements.
(d)   our recorded debt obligations include non-cash adjustments associated with discounts, premiums, deferred loan costs and fair value adjustments for interest rate hedging activities. these amounts have been excluded as they will not impact our liquidity in future periods.
(e)   our unrecorded obligations represent operating lease obligations and purchase commitments from which we expect to realize an economic benefit in future periods and interest payable on our debt. we have also made certain guarantees, as discussed in note 11 to the consolidated financial statements, that we do not expect to materially affect our current or future financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
(f)                               interest on our fixed-rate debt was calculated based on contractual rates and interest on our variable-rate debt was calculated based on interest rates at december 31, 2016. for debt balances outstanding under our $2.25 billion revolving credit facility, we have reflected limited interest amounts due to the short-term nature of the borrowings. for debt balances outstanding under our canadian term loan, we have reflected interest based on the current outstanding principal assuming the amount remains unchanged through maturity. as of december 31, 2016, we had $88 million of accrued interest related to our debt obligations.
(g)                  our unconditional purchase obligations are for various contractual obligations that we generally incur in the ordinary course of our business. certain of our obligations are quantity driven. for contracts that require us to purchase minimum quantities of goods or services, we have estimated our future minimum obligations based on the current market values of the underlying products or services. accordingly, the amounts reported in the table are subject to change and actual cash flow obligations in the near future may be different. see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for discussion of the nature and terms of our unconditional purchase obligations.
index to financial statements off-balance sheet arrangements we have financial interests in unconsolidated variable interest entities as discussed in note 20 to the consolidated financial statements. additionally, we are party to guarantee arrangements with unconsolidated entities as discussed in the guarantees section of note 11 to the consolidated financial statements. these arrangements have not materially affected our financial position, results of operations or liquidity during the year ended december 31, 2016, nor are they expected to have a material impact on our future financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
new accounting standards pending adoption income taxes  in october 2016, the fasb issued amended authoritative guidance associated with the timing of recognition of income taxes for intra-entity transfers of assets other than inventory. the amended guidance requires the recognition of income taxes when the transfer of the asset occurs, which replaces current u.s. generally accepted accounting principles (gaap) that defers the recognition of income taxes until the transferred asset is sold to a third party or otherwise recovered through use. the amended guidance is effective for the company on january 1, 2018, with early adoption permitted. we are in the process of assessing the provisions of this amended guidance; however, we currently do not expect that the adoption of this amended guidance will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
statement of cash flows  in august 2016, the fasb issued amended authoritative guidance associated with the classification of certain cash receipts and cash payments in the statement of cash flows. in november 2016, the fasb issued additional guidance on the presentation of restricted cash and cash equivalents in the statement of cash flows. the objective of both amendments was to reduce existing diversity in practice. the amended guidance is effective for the company on january 1, 2018, with early adoption permitted. we are in the process of assessing the provisions of this amended guidance; however, we currently do not expect that the adoption of this amended guidance will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
financial instrument credit losses  in june 2016, the fasb issued amended authoritative guidance associated with the measurement of credit losses on financial instruments. the amended guidance replaces the current incurred loss impairment methodology of recognizing credit losses when a loss is probable, with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to assess credit loss estimates. the amended guidance is effective for the company on january 1, 2020, with early adoption permitted beginning january 1, 2019. we are assessing the provisions of the amended guidance and evaluating the timing and impact on our consolidated financial statements.
stock compensation  in march 2016, the fasb issued amended authoritative guidance associated with stock-based compensation as part of its simplification initiative to reduce the cost and complexity of compliance with gaap, while maintaining or improving the usefulness of the information provided. the amended guidance changes both the accounting and financial reporting for certain income tax impacts of stock-based compensation. all excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies will be required to be recognized as an income tax benefit or provision rather than as a component of equity. the guidance also provides for changes in the calculation of forfeitures related to the expense of stock-based compensation. the amended guidance is effective for the company on january 1, 2017. the adoption of this amended guidance will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
leases  in february 2016, the fasb issued amended authoritative guidance associated with lease accounting. the amended guidance requires the recognition of lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet for those leases with terms in excess of 12 months and currently classified as operating leases. the disclosure of key information about leasing arrangements will also be required. the amended guidance is effective for the company on january 1, 2019, with early adoption permitted. we are assessing the provisions of the amended guidance and evaluating the timing and impact on our consolidated financial statements and disclosures.
index to financial statements financial instruments  in january 2016, the fasb issued amended authoritative guidance associated with the recognition and measurement of financial assets and liabilities. the amended guidance will require certain equity investments that are not consolidated to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income rather than as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. the amended guidance is effective for the company on january 1, 2018, with early adoption permitted. we are assessing the provisions of the amended guidance and evaluating the timing and impact on our consolidated financial statements.
revenue recognition  in may 2014, the fasb issued amended authoritative guidance associated with revenue recognition. the amended guidance requires companies to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. additionally, the amendments will require enhanced qualitative and quantitative disclosures regarding customer contracts. the amended guidance associated with revenue recognition is effective for the company on january 1, 2018. the amended guidance may be applied retrospectively for all periods presented (full retrospective method) or retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying the amended guidance recognized at the date of initial adoption (modified retrospective method).
to assess the impact of the standard, we utilized internal resources to lead the implementation effort and supplemented them with external resources. our internal resources read the amended guidance, attended trainings and consulted with non-authoritative groups to assist with interpretation of the amended guidance. surveys were sent to and returned by all operating segments to assess the potential impact of the amended guidance and to tailor specific procedures to evaluate the potential impact. based on the results of these surveys, we judgmentally selected a sample of contracts based on size and specifically identified contract traits that could be accounted for differently under the amended guidance. we also selected a representative sample of contracts to corroborate the survey results. we have completed our preliminary review of all contracts and are in the process of compiling and summarizing the results to determine whether additional review and analysis is necessary.
based on our work to date, we believe we have identified all material contract types and costs that may be impacted by this amended guidance. we expect to quantify and disclose the expected impact, if any, of adopting this amended guidance in the third quarter form 10-q. while we are still evaluating the impact of the amended guidance, we currently do not expect it to have a material impact on operating revenues.
upon adoption of the amended guidance, we anticipate recognizing an asset from the capitalization of sales incentives as contract acquisitions costs. under the amended guidance, sales incentives will be capitalized and amortized over the expected life of the customer relationship. currently, the company expenses approximately $65 million in sales incentives annually. as noted above, we are still evaluating other possible impacts on our consolidated financial statements, including potential changes in the classification of certain revenue streams currently reported on a gross basis and on our disclosures. the company is also currently planning to adopt the amended guidance using the modified retrospective method as of january 1, 2018.
inflation while inflationary increases in costs can affect our income from operations margins, we believe that inflation generally has not had, and in the near future is not expected to have, any material adverse effect on our results of operations. however, as of december 31, 2016, approximately 30% of our collection revenues are generated under long-term agreements with price adjustments based on various indices intended to measure inflation. additionally, managements estimates associated with inflation have had, and will continue to have, an impact on our accounting for landfill and environmental remediation liabilities.

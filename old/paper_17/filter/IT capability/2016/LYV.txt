item 1a.    risk factors you should carefully consider each of the following risks and all of the other information set forth in this annual report. the following risks relate principally to our business and operations, our leverage and our common stock. if any of the risks and uncertainties develop into actual events, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. in that case, the trading price of our common stock could decline.
risks relating to our business and operations our business is highly sensitive to public tastes and is dependent on our ability to secure popular artists and other live music events, and we and our ticketing clients may be unable to anticipate or respond to changes in consumer preferences, which may result in decreased demand for our services.
our business is highly sensitive to rapidly changing public tastes and is dependent on the availability of popular artists and events. our live entertainment business depends in part on our ability to anticipate the tastes of consumers and to offer events that appeal to them. since we rely on unrelated parties to create and perform at live music events, any unwillingness to tour or lack of availability of popular artists could limit our ability to generate revenue. in particular, there are a limited number of artists that can headline a major north american or global tour or who can sell out larger venues, including many of our amphitheaters. if those artists do not choose to tour, or if we are unable to secure the rights to their future tours, then our business would be adversely affected. our ticketing business relies on third parties to create and perform live entertainment, sporting and leisure events and to price tickets to such events. accordingly, our ticketing business' success depends, in part, upon the ability of these third parties to correctly anticipate public demand for particular events, as well as the availability of popular artists, entertainers and teams. our artist management business could be adversely affected if the artists it represents do not tour or perform as frequently as anticipated, or if such tours or performances are not as widely attended by fans as anticipated due to changing tastes, general economic conditions or otherwise.
in addition, our live entertainment business typically books our live music tours two to nine months in advance of the beginning of the tour and often agrees to pay an artist a fixed guaranteed amount prior to our receiving any revenue. therefore, if the public is not receptive to the tour, or we or an artist cancel the tour, we may incur a loss for the tour depending on the amount of the fixed guarantee or incurred costs relative to any revenue earned, as well as revenue we could have earned at booked venues. we have cancellation insurance policies in place to cover a portion of our losses if an artist cancels a tour but such policies may not be sufficient and are subject to deductibles. furthermore, consumer preferences change from time to time, and our failure to anticipate, identify or react to these changes could result in reduced demand for our services, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
our business depends on relationships between key promoters, executives, agents, managers, artists and clients and any adverse changes in these relationships could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
the live music business is uniquely dependent upon personal relationships, as promoters and executives within live music companies such as ours leverage their existing network of relationships with artists, agents and managers in order to secure the rights to the live music tours and events which are critical to our success. due to the importance of those industry contacts to our business, the loss of any of our promoters, officers or other key personnel could adversely affect our business. similarly, the artist management business is dependent upon the highly personalized relationship between a manager and an artist, and the loss of a manager may also result in a loss of the artist represented by the manager, which could adversely affect our business. although we have entered into long-term agreements with many of those individuals described above to protect our interests in those relationships, we can give no assurance that all or any of these key employees or managers will remain with us or will retain their associations with key business contacts, including music artists.
the success of our ticketing business depends, in significant part, on our ability to maintain and renew relationships with existing clients and to establish new client relationships. we anticipate that, for the foreseeable future, the substantial majority of our ticketing segment revenue will be derived from both online and mobile as well as direct sales of tickets. we also expect that revenue from primary ticketing services, which consist primarily of per ticket convenience charges and per order service fees, will continue to comprise the substantial majority of our ticketing segment revenue. we cannot provide assurances that we will be able to maintain existing client contracts, or enter into or maintain new client contracts, on acceptable terms, if at all, and the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
another important component of our success is our ability to maintain existing and to build new relationships with third-party distribution channels, advertisers, sponsors and service providers. any adverse change in these relationships, including the inability of these parties to fulfill their obligations to our businesses for any reason, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
we face intense competition in the live music, ticketing and artist management industries, and we may not be able to maintain or increase our current revenue, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
our businesses are in highly competitive industries, and we may not be able to maintain or increase our current revenue due to such competition. the live music industry competes with other forms of entertainment for consumers' discretionary spending and within this industry we compete with other venues to book artists, and, in the markets in which we promote music concerts, we face competition from other promoters and venue operators. our competitors compete with us for key employees who have relationships with popular music artists and who have a history of being able to book such artists for concerts and
tours. these competitors may engage in more extensive development efforts, undertake more far-reaching marketing campaigns, adopt more aggressive pricing policies and make more attractive offers to existing and potential artists. due to increasing artist influence and competition to attract and maintain artist clients, we may enter into agreements on terms that are less favorable to us, which could negatively impact our financial results. our competitors may develop services, advertising options or music venues that are equal or superior to those we provide or that achieve greater market acceptance and brand recognition than we achieve. it is possible that new competitors may emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share.
our ticketing business faces significant competition from other national, regional and local primary ticketing service providers to secure new and retain existing clients on a continuous basis. additionally, we face significant and increasing challenges from companies that sell self-ticketing systems and from clients who choose to self-ticket, through the integration of such systems into their existing operations or the acquisition of primary ticket services providers or by increasing sales through venue box offices and season and subscription sales. we also face competition in the resale of tickets from online auction websites and resale marketplaces and from other ticket resellers with online distribution capabilities. the advent of new technology, particularly as it relates to online ticketing, has amplified this competition. the intense competition that we face in the ticketing industry could cause the volume of our ticketing services business to decline. as we are also a content provider and venue operator we may face direct competition with our prospective or current primary ticketing clients, who primarily include live event content providers. this direct competition with our prospective or current primary ticketing clients could result in a decline in the number of ticketing clients we have and a decline in the volume of our ticketing business, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
in the secondary ticket sales market, we have restrictions on our business that are not faced by our competitors, which restrictions include those that are self-imposed, imposed as a result of agreements entered into with the federal trade commission ("ftc") and the attorneys general of several individual states, and statutory. these restrictions include: restrictions on linking from our page on the www.ticketmaster.com website that informs consumers that no tickets were found in response to their ticket request to our resale ticketing options without first obtaining approval from the state of new jersey as to any material changes to our current linking practices; a restriction on using or allowing our affiliates to use domain names that, among other things, contain the unique names of venues, sports teams or performers, or contain names that are substantially similar to or are misspelled versions of same; a requirement to clearly and conspicuously disclose on any resale website owned by us or on any primary ticketing website where a link or redirect to such a resale website is posted that it is a resale website and ticket prices often exceed the ticket's original price; and a requirement to make certain clear and conspicuous disclosures and in certain instances to create separate listings when a ticket being offered for resale is not "in-hand" as well as a requirement to monitor and enforce the compliance of third parties offering tickets on our websites with such disclosure requirements. our competitors in the secondary ticket sales market are not, to our knowledge, bound by similar restrictions. as a result, our ability to effectively compete in the secondary ticket sales market may be adversely affected, which could in turn adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
the artist management industry is also a highly competitive industry, with numerous other artist management companies and individual managers in the united states alone. we compete with these companies and individuals to discover new and emerging artists and to represent established artists. in addition, certain of our arrangements with clients of our artist management business are terminable at will by either party, leading to competition to retain those artists as clients. competition is intense and may contribute to a decline in the volume of our artist management business, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
in connection with our merger with ticketmaster, we became subject to both a court-imposed final judgment in the united states and a consent agreement with canadian authorities, pursuant to which we have agreed to abide by certain behavioral remedies that prevent us from engaging in retaliatory business tactics or improper tying arrangements. in addition, we are restricted from engaging in certain business activities that would be lawful for us to undertake absent the final judgment and the consent agreement. our inability to undertake these business strategies could disadvantage us when we compete against firms that are not restricted by any such order, and we therefore face certain unquantifiable business risks as a result of compliance.
other variables that could adversely affect our financial performance by, among other things, leading to decreases in overall revenue, the number of sponsors, event attendance, ticket prices and fees or profit margins include:
•   an increased level of competition for advertising dollars, which may lead to lower sponsorships as we attempt to retain advertisers or which may cause us to lose advertisers to our competitors offering better programs that we are unable or unwilling to match;
•   unfavorable fluctuations in operating costs, including increased guarantees to artists, which we may be unwilling or unable to pass through to our customers via ticket prices;
•   inability to fund the significant up-front cash requirements associated with our touring and ticketing businesses due to insufficient cash on hand or capacity under our senior secured credit facility, which could result in the loss of key tours to competitors or the inability to secure and retain ticketing clients;
•   competitors' offerings that may include more favorable terms than we do in order to obtain agreements for new venues or ticketing arrangements or to obtain events for the venues they operate;
•   technological changes and innovations that we are unable to adopt or are late in adopting that offer more attractive entertainment alternatives than we or other live entertainment providers currently offer, which may lead to a reduction in attendance at live events, a loss of ticket sales or lower ticket fees; and
•   other entertainment options available to our audiences that we do not offer.
the success of our ticketing business and other operations depends, in part, on the integrity of our systems and infrastructures, as well as affiliate and third-party computer systems, wifi and other communication systems. system interruption and the lack of integration and redundancy in these systems and infrastructures may have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
system interruption and the lack of integration and redundancy in the information systems and infrastructures, both of our own ticketing systems and other computer systems and of affiliate and third-party software, wifi and other communications systems service providers on which we rely, may adversely affect our ability to operate websites, process and fulfill transactions, respond to customer inquiries and generally maintain cost-efficient operations. such interruptions could occur by virtue of natural disaster, malicious actions such as hacking or acts of terrorism or war, or human error. in addition, the loss of some or all of certain key personnel could require us to expend additional resources to continue to maintain our software and systems and could subject us to systems interruptions.
while we have backup systems for certain aspects of our operations, disaster recovery planning by its nature cannot be sufficient for all eventualities. in addition, we may not have adequate insurance coverage to compensate for losses from a major interruption. if any of these adverse events were to occur, it could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
data loss or other breaches of our network security could materially harm our business and results of operations, and the processing, storage, use and disclosure of personal data could give rise to liabilities and additional costs as a result of governmental regulation, litigation and conflicting legal requirements relating to personal privacy rights.
we process, store, use and disclose certain personal information about our customers. penetration of our network or other misappropriation or misuse of personal information and data, including credit card information, could cause interruptions in our operations and subject us to increased costs, litigation, inquiries and actions from governmental authorities, and financial and other liabilities. in addition, security breaches or the inability to protect our data could lead to increased incidents of ticketing fraud and counterfeit tickets. security breaches could also significantly damage our reputation with consumers, ticketing clients and other third parties, and impose significant costs related to remediation efforts, such as credit or identity theft monitoring. although we have developed systems and processes that are designed to protect customer information and prevent data loss and other security breaches, such measures cannot provide absolute security or certainty. it is possible that advances in computer and hacker capabilities, new variants of malware, the development of new penetration methods and tools, inadvertent violations of company policies or procedures or other developments could result in a compromise of information or a breach of the technology and security processes that are used to protect customer information. we have expended significant capital and other resources to protect against and remedy such potential security breaches and their consequences, including the establishment of a dedicated cybersecurity organization within our larger technology environment, and will continue to do so in the future. we also face risks associated with security breaches affecting third parties with which we are affiliated or with which we otherwise conduct business. consumers are generally concerned with security and privacy of the internet, and any publicized security problems affecting our businesses and/or those of third parties may discourage consumers from doing business with us, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
in addition to the above concerns related to network and data security, the sharing, use, disclosure and protection of personally identifiable information and other user data are governed by existing and evolving federal, state and international laws. we could be adversely affected if legislation or regulations are expanded to require changes in business practices or privacy policies, or if governing jurisdictions interpret or implement their legislation or regulations in ways that negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. as we expand our operations into new jurisdictions worldwide, the costs associated with compliance with these regulations increases. it is possible that government or industry regulation in these markets will require us to deviate from our standard processes, which will increase operational cost and risk.
more specifically, the european union general data protection regulation ("gdpr") will become effective for european union ("e.u.") member states beginning in may 2018. this comprehensive legislation will harmonize data protection regulations across e.u. member states, while placing many restrictions and burdens on data controllers and
processors located both within and outside of the e.u. whose activities involve the personal information of residents of the e.u. among other requirements applicable to data controllers, the gdpr contains provisions related to accountability obligations to implement, document and demonstrate data protection compliance, the appointment of a data protection officer, consent/withdrawal of consent by data subjects, transparency of information provided to data subjects, data breach notifications to data subjects, and international transfers of data, while providing for fines that can be up to the higher of 4% of a company's worldwide total revenue or €20 million. we have committed significant capital and personnel resources to ensure that we are in compliance with the gdpr by the time it becomes effective; however, there can be no assurances that we will be successful in these efforts, or that violations will not occur, particularly given the complexity of both the gdpr and our business, as well as the uncertainties that accompany new, comprehensive legislation.
our failure or the failure of the various third-party vendors and service providers with which we do business to comply with applicable privacy policies or federal, state or international laws and regulations or any compromise of security that results in the unauthorized release of personally identifiable information or other user data could damage our reputation, discourage potential users from trying our products and services and/or result in fines and/or proceedings by governmental agencies and/or consumers, one or all of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
we operate in international markets which subject us to risks associated with the legislative, judicial, accounting, regulatory, political and economic risks and conditions specific to such markets, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
we provide services in various jurisdictions abroad through a number of brands and businesses that we own and operate, as well as through joint ventures, and we expect to continue to expand our international presence. we face, and expect to continue to face, additional risks in the case of our existing and future international operations, including:
•   political instability, adverse changes in diplomatic relations and unfavorable economic and business conditions in the markets in which we currently have international operations or into which we may expand, particularly in the case of emerging markets;
•   more restrictive or otherwise unfavorable government regulation of the live entertainment and ticketing industries, which could result in increased compliance costs and/or otherwise restrict the manner in which we provide services and the amount of related fees charged for such services;
•   limitations on the enforcement of intellectual property rights;
•   limitations on the ability of foreign subsidiaries to repatriate profits or otherwise remit earnings;
•   adverse tax consequences due both to the complexity of operating across multiple tax regimes as well as changes in, or new interpretations of, international tax treaties and structures;
•   expropriations of property and risks of renegotiation or modification of existing agreements with governmental authorities;
•   diminished ability to legally enforce our contractual rights in foreign countries;
•   limitations on technology infrastructure, which could limit our ability to migrate international operations to a common ticketing system;
•   variability in venue security standards and accepted practices;
•   lower levels of internet usage, credit card usage and consumer spending in comparison to those in the united states; and
•   difficulties in managing operations and adapting to consumer desires due to distance, language and cultural differences, including issues associated with (i) business practices and customs that are common in certain foreign countries but might be prohibited by united states law and our internal policies and procedures, and (ii) management and operational systems and infrastructures, including internal financial control and reporting systems and functions, staffing and managing of foreign operations, which we might not be able to do effectively or cost-efficiently.
our ability to expand our international operations into new jurisdictions, or further into existing jurisdictions will depend, in significant part, on our ability to identify potential acquisition candidates, joint venture or other partners, and enter into arrangements with these parties on favorable terms, as well as our ability to make continued investments to maintain and grow existing international operations. if the revenue generated by international operations is insufficient to offset expenses incurred in connection with the maintenance and growth of these operations, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. in addition, in an effort to make international operations in one or more given
jurisdictions profitable over the long term, significant additional investments that are not profitable over the short term could be required over a prolonged period.
in foreign countries in which we operate, a risk exists that our employees, contractors or agents could, in contravention of our policies, engage in business practices prohibited by applicable united states laws and regulations, such as the united states foreign corrupt practices act, as well as the laws and regulations of other countries prohibiting corrupt payments to government officials such as the united kingdom bribery act 2010. we maintain policies prohibiting such business practices and have in place global anti-corruption compliance and training programs designed to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations. nevertheless, the risk remains that one or more of our employees, contractors or agents, including those based in or from countries where practices that violate such united states laws and regulations or the laws and regulations of other countries may be customary, as well as those associated with newly-acquired businesses, will engage in business practices that are prohibited by our policies, circumvent our compliance programs and, by doing so, violate such laws and regulations. any such violations, even if prohibited by our internal policies, could result in fines, criminal sanctions against us and/or our employees, prohibitions on the conduct of our business and damage to our reputation, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
in addition, given our substantial operations in the united kingdom (the "u.k.") and the e.u., we face risks and uncertainties due to the recent referendum and approval by voters in the u.k. of an exit from the e.u., commonly referred to as "brexit." these risks and uncertainties include potential deterioration in the macroeconomic environment that could lead to less demand for concerts and other live entertainment in the u.k. and the e.u., potential legal and regulatory changes that could, among other things, impact the ease of movement between the u.k. and the e.u. for artists and touring personnel, and exchange rate risks such as the ten percent drop in the u.k. pound sterling against the u.s. dollar that occurred the day after the brexit referendum, which resulted in higher artist fees in pound sterling terms (see the risk factor captioned "exchange rates may cause fluctuations in our results of operations that are not related to our operations" below for more discussion of the impact of currency fluctuations on our business). while the full parameters and implications of brexit are currently unknown, these and other factors, if realized, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
we are subject to extensive governmental regulation, and our failure to comply with these regulations could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
our operations are subject to federal, state and local statutes, rules, regulations, policies and procedures, both domestically and internationally, which are subject to change at any time, governing matters such as:
•   licensing, permitting and zoning, including noise ordinances;
•   human health, safety and sanitation requirements;
•   working conditions, labor, minimum wage and hour, citizenship and employment laws;
•   compliance with the ada and the dda;
•   compliance with the united states foreign corrupt practices act, the united kingdom bribery act 2010 and similar regulations in other countries, as more particularly described above under the risk factor related to our international operations;
•   hazardous and non-hazardous waste and other environmental protection laws;
•   sales and other taxes and withholding of taxes;
•   privacy laws and protection of personally identifiable information;
•   marketing activities via the telephone and online; and
our failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in fines and/or proceedings against us by governmental agencies and/or consumers, which if material, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. while we attempt to conduct our business and operations in a manner that we believe to be in compliance with such laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that a law or regulation will not be interpreted or enforced in a manner contrary to our current understanding of the law or regulation. in addition, the promulgation of new laws, rules and regulations could restrict or unfavorably impact our business, which could decrease demand for services, reduce revenue, increase costs and/or subject us to additional liabilities. for example, some legislatures have proposed laws in the past that would impose potential liability on us
and other promoters and producers of live music events for entertainment taxes and for incidents that occur at our events, particularly relating to drugs and alcohol. new legislation could be passed that may negatively impact our business, such as provisions that have recently been proposed in various jurisdictions that would restrict ticketing methods, mandate ticket inventory disclosure and attack current policies governing season tickets for sports teams. additionally, governmental actions such as the current sanctions by the u.s. department of the treasury's office of foreign assets control and european regulators on certain russian individuals and entities could restrict or limit our business activities in certain areas or subject us to sanction for noncompliance, even if inadvertent.
from time to time, federal, state and local authorities and/or consumers commence investigations, inquiries or litigation with respect to our compliance with applicable consumer protection, advertising, unfair business practice, antitrust (and similar or related laws) and other laws. our businesses have historically cooperated with authorities in connection with these investigations and have satisfactorily resolved each such material investigation, inquiry or litigation. we are currently subject to agreements with the states of new jersey, maryland and illinois and the ftc which govern, and in certain cases place limitations on, our ticketing resale practices. our competitors in the secondary ticket sales market are not, to our knowledge, bound by such limitations and as a result, we may be at a competitive disadvantage. other states and canadian provinces have commenced investigations or inquiries regarding the relationship between us and certain of our subsidiaries and other aspects of our ticketing business. we have incurred significant legal expenses in connection with the defense of governmental investigations and litigation in the past and may be required to incur additional expenses in the future regarding such investigations and litigation. in the case of antitrust (and similar or related) matters, any adverse outcome could limit or prevent us from engaging in the ticketing business generally (or in a particular market thereof) or subject us to potential damage assessments, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
unfavorable outcomes in legal proceedings may adversely affect our business and operating results.
our results may be affected by the outcome of pending and future litigation. unfavorable rulings in our legal proceedings may have a negative impact on us that may be greater or smaller depending on the nature of the rulings. in addition, we are currently, and from time to time in the future may be, subject to various other claims, investigations, legal and administrative cases and proceedings (whether civil or criminal) or lawsuits by governmental agencies or private parties, as further described in the immediately preceding risk factor. if the results of these investigations, proceedings or suits are unfavorable to us or if we are unable to successfully defend against third-party lawsuits, we may be required to pay monetary damages or may be subject to fines, penalties, injunctions or other censure that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. even if we adequately address the issues raised by an investigation or proceeding or successfully defend a third-party lawsuit or counterclaim, we may have to devote significant financial and management resources to address these issues, which could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.
our success depends, in significant part, on entertainment, sporting and leisure events and economic and other factors adversely affecting such events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
a decline in attendance at or reduction in the number of live entertainment, sporting and leisure events may have an adverse effect on our revenue and operating income. in addition, during periods of economic slowdown and recession, many consumers have historically reduced their discretionary spending and advertisers have reduced their advertising expenditures. the impact of economic slowdowns on our business is difficult to predict, but they may result in reductions in ticket sales, sponsorship opportunities and our ability to generate revenue. the risks associated with our businesses may become more acute in periods of a slowing economy or recession, which may be accompanied by a decrease in attendance at live entertainment, sporting and leisure events. many of the factors affecting the number and availability of live entertainment, sporting and leisure events are beyond our control. for instance, certain sports leagues have experienced labor disputes leading to threatened or actual player lockouts. any such lockouts that result in shortened or canceled seasons would adversely impact our business to the extent that we provide ticketing services to the affected teams both due to the loss of games and ticketing opportunities as well as the possibility of decreased attendance following such a lockout due to adverse fan reaction.
our business depends on discretionary consumer and corporate spending. many factors related to corporate spending and discretionary consumer spending, including economic conditions affecting disposable consumer income such as employment, fuel prices, interest and tax rates and inflation can significantly impact our operating results. business conditions, as well as various industry conditions, including corporate marketing and promotional spending and interest levels, can also significantly impact our operating results. these factors can affect attendance at our events, premium seat sales, sponsorship, advertising and hospitality spending, concession and merchandise sales, as well as the financial results of sponsors of our venues, events and the industry. negative factors such as challenging economic conditions, public concerns over terrorism and security incidents, particularly when combined, can impact corporate and consumer spending, and one negative factor can impact our results more than another. there can be no assurance that consumer and corporate spending will not be adversely impacted by current economic conditions, or by any future deterioration in economic conditions, thereby possibly impacting our operating results and growth.
exchange rates may cause fluctuations in our results of operations that are not related to our operations.
because we own assets overseas and derive revenue from our international operations, we may incur currency translation losses or gains due to changes in the values of foreign currencies relative to the united states dollar. we cannot predict the effect of exchange rate fluctuations upon future operating results. for the year ended december 31, 2016, our international operations accounted for approximately 31% of our revenue. we cannot predict the future relationship between the united states dollar and the currencies used by our international businesses, principally the british pound, euro, australian dollar and canadian dollar. we experienced foreign exchange rate operating income of $2.1 million for the year ended december 31, 2016, and foreign exchange rate operating losses of $24.5 million and $6.2 million for the years ended december 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, which impacted our operating income. see item 7a.-quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk.
we may enter into future acquisitions and take certain actions in connection with such transactions, including actions taken to comply with antitrust, competition and other regulations, that could affect our business and results of operations; if we are unsuccessful in our future acquisition endeavors, our business could be adversely impacted.
our future growth rate depends in part on our selective acquisition of additional businesses. a portion of our growth has been attributable to acquisitions. we may be unable to identify other suitable targets for further acquisition or make further acquisitions at favorable prices. if we identify a suitable acquisition candidate, our ability to successfully complete the acquisition would depend on a variety of factors, and may include our ability to obtain financing on acceptable terms and requisite government approvals. in addition, the credit agreement for our senior secured credit facility restricts our ability to make certain acquisitions. in connection with future acquisitions, we could take certain actions that could adversely affect our business, including:
•   issuing equity securities, which would dilute current stockholders' percentage ownership;
•   incurring or assuming contingent liabilities, known or unknown;
•   incurring large accounting write-offs or impairments.
in addition, acquisitions involve inherent risks which, if realized, could adversely affect our business and results of operations, including those associated with:
•   integrating the operations, financial reporting, technologies and personnel of acquired companies, including establishing and maintaining a system of internal controls appropriate for a public company environment;
•   the diversion of management's attention from other business concerns;
•   the inherent risks in entering markets or lines of business in which we have either limited or no direct experience; and
•   the potential loss of key employees, customers and strategic partners of acquired companies.
we are also subject to laws and regulations, including those relating to antitrust at the state, federal and international levels, that could significantly affect our ability to expand our business through acquisitions. for example, the ftc and the antitrust division of the united states department of justice with respect to our domestic acquisitions, and the european commission (the antitrust regulator of the european union) and the united kingdom competition commission with respect to our european acquisitions, have the authority to challenge our acquisitions on antitrust grounds before or after the acquisitions are completed. our failure or inability to complete future acquisitions as a result of such laws and regulations, or the imposition of unfavorable terms as a condition to the completion of an acquisition, could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
the occurrence and threat of extraordinary events, such as terrorist attacks, intentional or unintentional mass-casualty incidents, public health concerns such as contagious disease outbreaks, natural disasters or similar events, may deter artists from touring and/or substantially decrease the use of and demand for our services and the attendance at live music events, which may decrease our revenue or expose us to substantial liability. the terrorism and security incidents in the past, military actions in foreign locations and periodic elevated terrorism alerts have raised numerous challenging operating factors, including
public concerns regarding air travel, military actions and additional national or local catastrophic incidents, causing a nationwide disruption of commercial and leisure activities.
in the event of actual or threatened terrorism events, some artists may refuse to travel or book tours, which could adversely affect our business. attendance at events may decline due to fears over terrorism and contagious disease outbreaks, which could adversely impact our operating results. the occurrence or threat of future terrorist attacks, military actions by the united states or others, contagious disease outbreaks, natural disasters such as earthquakes and severe floods or similar events cannot be predicted, and their occurrence can be expected to negatively affect the economies of the united states and other foreign countries where we do business, as well as our operating results.
we are dependent upon our ability to lease, acquire and develop live music venues, and if we are unable to do so on acceptable terms, or at all, our results of operations could be adversely affected.
our concerts and sponsorship & advertising segments require access to venues to generate revenue from live music events. for these events, we use venues that we own, but we also operate a number of our live music venues under various agreements which include leases with third parties, ownership through an equity interest or booking agreements, which are agreements where we contract to book the events at a venue for a specific period of time. our long-term success in the live music business will depend in part on the availability of venues, our ability to lease these venues and our ability to enter into booking agreements upon their expiration. as many of these agreements are with third parties over whom we have little or no control, we may be unable to renew these agreements or enter into new agreements on acceptable terms or at all, and may be unable to obtain favorable agreements with venues. our ability to renew these agreements or obtain new agreements on favorable terms depends on a number of other factors, many of which are also beyond our control, such as national and local business conditions and competition from other promoters. if the cost of renewing these agreements is too high or the terms of any new agreement with a new venue are unacceptable or incompatible with our existing operations, we may decide to forego these opportunities. there can be no assurance that we will be able to renew these agreements on acceptable terms or at all, or that we will be able to obtain attractive agreements with substitute venues, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
we may continue to expand our operations through the development of live music venues and the expansion of existing live music venues, which poses a number of risks, including:
•   desirable sites for live music venues may be unavailable or costly; and
growth or maintenance of our existing revenue depends in part on consistent investment in our venues. therefore, we expect to continue to make substantial capital improvements to meet long-term increasing demand, improve value and grow revenue. we frequently have a number of significant capital projects underway. numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control, may influence the ultimate costs and timing of various capital improvements.
the amount of capital expenditures can vary significantly from year to year. in addition, actual costs could vary materially from our estimates if our assumptions about the quality of materials, equipment or workmanship required or the cost of financing such expenditures were to change. construction is also subject to governmental permitting processes which, if changed, could materially affect the ultimate cost.
additionally, the market potential of live music venue sites cannot be precisely determined, and our live music venues may face competition in markets from unexpected sources. newly constructed live music venues may not perform up to our expectations. we face significant competition for potential live music venue locations and for opportunities to acquire existing live music venues. because of this competition, we may be unable to add to or maintain the number of our live music venues on terms we consider acceptable.
our operations are seasonal and our results of operations vary from quarter to quarter and year over year, so our financial performance in certain financial quarters or years may not be indicative of, or comparable to, our financial performance in subsequent financial quarters or years.
we believe our financial results and cash needs will vary greatly from quarter to quarter and year to year depending on, among other things, the timing of tours, tour cancellations, event ticket on-sales, capital expenditures, seasonal and other fluctuations in our operating results, the timing of guaranteed payments and receipt of ticket sales and fees, financing activities, acquisitions and investments and receivables management. because our results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year, our financial results for one quarter or year cannot necessarily be compared to another quarter or year and may not be indicative of our future financial performance in subsequent quarters or years. typically, we experience our lowest financial performance in the first and fourth quarters of the calendar year as our outdoor venues are primarily used, and our festivals primarily occur, during may through october. in addition, the timing of tours of top grossing acts can impact
comparability of quarterly results year over year and potentially annual results. the timing of event on-sales by our ticketing clients can also impact this comparability. in addition, the seasonality of our businesses could create cash flow management risks if we do not adequately anticipate and plan for periods of decreased activity, which could negatively impact our ability to execute on our strategy, which in turn could harm our results of operations.
the following table sets forth our operating income (loss) for the last eight fiscal quarters:
there is the risk of personal injuries and accidents in connection with our live music events, which could subject us to personal injury or other claims and increase our expenses, as well as reduce attendance at our live music events, causing a decrease in our revenue.
there are inherent risks involved with producing live music events. as a result, personal injuries and accidents have, and may, occur from time to time, which could subject us to claims and liabilities for personal injuries. incidents in connection with our live music events at any of our venues or festival sites that we own or rent could also result in claims, reducing operating income or reducing attendance at our events, which could cause a decrease in our revenue. we have been subject to wrongful death claims and are currently subject to other litigation. in addition, while we have security protocols in place at our events, illegal drug use or alcohol consumption at our events could result in negative publicity, adverse consequences (including illness, injury or death) to the persons engaged in such activities or others, and litigation against us. while we maintain insurance policies that provide coverage within limits that are sufficient, in management's judgment, to protect us from material financial loss for personal injuries sustained by persons at our venues or events or accidents in the ordinary course of business, there can be no assurance that such insurance will be adequate at all times and in all circumstances.
we regard our intellectual property rights, including patents, service marks, trademarks and domain names, copyrights, trade secrets and similar intellectual property (as applicable) as critical to our success. we also rely heavily upon software codes, informational databases and other components that make up our products and services.
we also have been granted patents and/or have patent applications pending with the united states patent and trademark office and/or various foreign patent authorities for various proprietary technologies and other inventions.  any patent application filed may not result in a patent being issued, or existing or future patents may not be adjudicated valid by a court or be afforded adequate protection against competitors with similar technology. likewise, the issuance of a patent to us does not mean that its processes or inventions will not be found to infringe upon patents or other rights previously issued to third parties. we rely on a combination of laws and contractual restrictions with employees, customers, suppliers, affiliates and others to establish and protect these proprietary rights. despite these precautions, it may be possible for a third party to copy or otherwise obtain and use trade secrets or copyrighted intellectual property without authorization which, if discovered, might require legal action to correct. in addition, third parties may independently and lawfully develop substantially similar intellectual properties.
from time to time, we are subject to legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of business, including claims of alleged infringement of the intellectual property rights of third parties. our failure to protect our intellectual property rights in a meaningful manner or challenges to related contractual rights could result in erosion of brand names and could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. therefore, litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights, protect trade secrets or determine the validity and scope of proprietary rights claimed by others. any litigation of this nature, regardless of outcome or merit, could result in substantial costs and diversion of management and technical resources, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
costs associated with, and our ability to obtain, adequate insurance could adversely affect our profitability and financial condition.
we currently secure insurance programs to address our various risks with terms, conditions and costs that are appropriate for our business. however, heightened concerns and challenges regarding property, casualty, liability, business interruption and other insurance coverage have resulted from terrorist and related security incidents along with varying weather-related conditions and incidents. as a result, we may experience increased difficulty obtaining high policy limits of coverage at a reasonable cost, including coverage for acts of terrorism, cyber attacks, weather-related damage and other perils associated with our operations. we have a material investment in property and equipment at each of our venues, which are generally located near major cities and which hold events typically attended by a large number of fans. we also have a significant investment in technology including our ticketing systems. at december 31, 2016, we had property and equipment with a net book value of $751.5 million.
damage and/or disruption to operational, geographical and situational factors, among others, may result in significant increases in insurance premium costs and difficulties obtaining sufficiently high policy limits with premiums and deductibles that we believe to be reasonable. we cannot guarantee that future increases in insurance costs and difficulties obtaining high policy limits will not adversely impact our profitability, thereby possibly impacting our operating results and growth.
in addition, we enter into various agreements with artists from time to time, including long-term artist rights arrangements. the profitability of those arrangements depends upon those artists' willingness and ability to continue performing, and we may not be able to obtain sufficient insurance coverage at a reasonable cost to adequately protect us against the death, disability or other failure of such artists to continue engaging in revenue-generating activities under those agreements.
we cannot provide assurance that our insurance policy coverage limits, including insurance coverage for property, casualty, liability, artists and business interruption losses and acts of terrorism, would be adequate under the circumstances should one or multiple events occur at or near any of our business locations, or that our insurers would have adequate financial resources to sufficiently or fully pay our related claims or damages. we cannot guarantee that adequate coverage limits will be available, offered at a reasonable cost, or offered by insurers with sufficient financial soundness. the occurrence of such an incident or incidents affecting any one or more of our business facilities could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and future results of operations if asset damage and/or company liability were to exceed insurance coverage limits or if an insurer were unable to sufficiently or fully pay our related claims or damages.
we depend upon unionized labor for the provision of some of our services and any work stoppages or labor disturbances could disrupt our business; potential union pension obligations could cause us to incur unplanned liabilities.
the stagehands at some of our venues and other employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements. our union agreements typically have a term of three years and thus regularly expire and require negotiation in the ordinary course of our business. upon the expiration of any of our collective bargaining agreements, however, we may be unable to negotiate new collective bargaining agreements on terms favorable to us, and our business operations may be interrupted as a result of labor disputes or difficulties and delays in the process of renegotiating our collective bargaining agreements. in addition, our business operations at one or more of our facilities may also be interrupted as a result of labor disputes by outside unions attempting to unionize a venue even though we do not have unionized labor at that venue currently. a work stoppage at one or more of our owned or operated venues or at our promoted events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. we cannot predict the effect that a potential work stoppage would have on our business.
we participate in, and make recurrent contributions to, various multiemployer pension plans that cover many of our current and former union employees. our required recurrent contributions to these plans could unexpectedly increase during the term of a collective bargaining agreement due to erisa laws that require additional contributions to be made when a pension fund enters into critical status, which may occur for reasons that are beyond our control. in addition, we may be required by law to fulfill our pension withdrawal liability with respect to any multiemployer pension plans from which we may withdraw or partially withdraw. our potential withdrawal liability will increase if a multiemployer pension plan in which we participate has significant underfunded liabilities. any unplanned multiemployer pension liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
poor weather adversely affects attendance at our live music events, which could negatively impact our financial performance from period to period.
we promote and/or ticket many live music events. weather conditions surrounding these events affect sales of tickets, concessions and merchandise, among other things. poor weather conditions can have a material effect on our results of operations particularly because we promote and/or ticket a finite number of events. due to weather conditions, we may be required to cancel or reschedule an event to another available day or a different venue, which would increase our costs for the
risks relating to our leverage we have a large amount of debt and lease obligations that could restrict our operations and impair our financial condition. the agreements governing our senior secured credit facility and certain of our other indebtedness impose restrictions on us that limit the discretion of management in operating our business and that, in turn, could impair our ability to meet our obligations under our debt.
the agreements governing our senior secured credit facility and certain of our other indebtedness include restrictive covenants that, among other things, restrict our ability to:
•   incur additional debt;
•   make certain investments;
•   enter into transactions with affiliates;
•   modify the nature of our business;
•   enter into sale-leaseback transactions;
•   transfer and sell material assets; and
in addition, our senior secured credit facility includes other restrictions, including requirements to maintain certain financial ratios. our failure to comply with the terms and covenants of our indebtedness could lead to a default under the terms of the governing documents, which would entitle the lenders to accelerate the indebtedness and declare all amounts owed due and payable.
as of december 31, 2016, our total indebtedness, excluding unamortized debt discounts and debt issuance costs of $51.5 million was $2.4 billion. our available borrowing capacity under the revolving portion of our senior secured credit facility at that date was $279.7 million, with outstanding letters of credit of $85.3 million. we may also incur significant additional indebtedness in the future.
•   making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations;
•   increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic, regulatory and industry conditions;
•   limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for future working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other purposes;
•   requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to fund payments on our debt, thereby reducing funds available for operations and other purposes;
•   limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;
•   placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt.
to service our debt and lease obligations and to fund potential acquisitions, artist and ticketing advances and capital expenditures, we will require a significant amount of cash, which depends on many factors beyond our control.
as of december 31, 2016, $53.3 million of our total indebtedness (excluding interest and unamortized debt discount and debt issuance costs) is due in 2017, $362.9 million is due in the aggregate in 2018 and 2019, $194.5 million is due in the aggregate in 2020 and 2021 and $1.8 billion is due thereafter. in addition, as of december 31, 2016, we had $2.0 billion in operating lease commitments, of which $163.1 million is due in 2017 and $156.0 million is due in 2018. all long-term debt without a stated maturity date is considered current and is reflected here as due in 2017. see the table in item 7.-management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations-contractual obligations and commitments-firm commitments.
our ability to service our debt and lease obligations and to fund potential acquisitions, artist and ticketing advances and capital expenditures will require a significant amount of cash, which depends on many factors beyond our control. our ability to make payments on and to refinance our debt will also depend on our ability to generate cash in the future. this is, to an extent, subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control.
we cannot provide assurance that our business will generate sufficient cash flow or that future borrowings will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debt or to fund our other liquidity needs. if our future cash flow from operations and other capital resources is insufficient to pay our obligations as they mature or to fund our liquidity needs, we may be forced to reduce or delay our business activities and capital expenditures, sell assets, obtain additional equity capital or restructure or refinance all or a portion of our debt on or before maturity. in addition, the terms of our existing debt, including our senior secured credit facility, and other future debt may limit our ability to pursue any of these alternatives.
these measures might also be unsuccessful or inadequate in permitting us to meet scheduled debt service or lease obligations. we may be unable to restructure or refinance our obligations and obtain additional debt or equity financing or sell assets on satisfactory terms or at all. capital markets have been volatile in the recent past; a downturn could negatively impact our ability to access capital should the need arise. as a result, the inability to meet our debt or lease obligations could cause us to default on those obligations. any such defaults could materially harm our financial condition and liquidity.
we rely on distributions and loans from our subsidiaries to meet our payment requirements under our obligations. if our subsidiaries are unable to pay dividends or otherwise make payments to us, we may not be able to make debt service payments on our obligations. we conduct substantially all of our operations through our subsidiaries. our operating cash flows and consequently our ability to service our debt is therefore principally dependent upon our subsidiaries' earnings and their distributions of those earnings to us and may also be dependent upon loans or other payments of funds to us by those subsidiaries. our subsidiaries are separate legal entities and may have no obligation, contingent or otherwise, to pay any amount due pursuant to our obligations or to make any funds available for that purpose. our foreign subsidiaries generate a portion of our operating cash flows. although we do not intend to repatriate these funds from our foreign subsidiaries in order to satisfy payment requirements in the united states, we would be required to accrue and pay united states federal and state income taxes on any future repatriations, net of applicable foreign tax credits. these taxes could be substantial and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. in addition, the ability of our subsidiaries to provide funds to us may be subject to restrictions under our senior secured credit facility and may be subject to the terms of such subsidiaries' future indebtedness, as well as the availability of sufficient surplus funds under applicable law.
risks relating to our common stock our corporate governance documents, rights agreement and delaware law may delay, deter or prevent an acquisition of us that stockholders may consider favorable, which could decrease the value of our common stock.
our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws and delaware law contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us without the consent of the board of directors. these provisions include supermajority voting requirements for stockholders to amend our organizational documents and to remove directors as well as limitations on action by our stockholders by written consent. in addition, the board of directors has the right to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval, which could be used to dilute the stock ownership of a potential hostile acquirer. delaware law, for instance, also imposes some restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between any holder of 15% or more of our outstanding common stock and us. although we believe these provisions protect our stockholders from coercive or otherwise unfair takeover tactics and thereby provide for an opportunity to receive a higher bid by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with the board of directors, these provisions apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders.
we have also adopted a stockholder rights plan intended to deter hostile or coercive attempts to acquire us. under the plan, if any person or group acquires, or begins a tender or exchange offer that could result in such person acquiring, 15% or more of our common stock, and in the case of certain schedule 13g filers, 20% or more of our common stock, and in the case of liberty media and certain of its affiliates, more than 35% of our common stock, without approval of the board of directors under specified circumstances, our other stockholders have the right to purchase shares of our common stock, or shares of the acquiring company, at a substantial discount to the public market price. therefore, the plan makes an acquisition much more costly to a potential acquirer.
in addition, the terms of our senior secured credit facility provide that the lenders can require us to repay all outstanding indebtedness upon a change of control. these provisions make an acquisition more costly to a potential acquirer. see item 7.- management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations-liquidity and capital resources.
we have no plans to pay dividends on our common stock, which could affect its market price.
we currently intend to retain any future earnings to finance the growth, development and expansion of our business and/or to repay existing indebtedness. accordingly, we do not intend to declare or pay any dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future. the declaration, payment and amount of future dividends, if any, will be at the sole discretion of the board of directors after taking into account various factors, including our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow from operations, current and anticipated capital requirements and expansion plans, the income tax laws then in effect and the requirements of delaware law. in addition, the agreement governing our senior secured credit facility includes restrictions on our ability to pay cash dividends without meeting certain financial ratios and obtaining the consent of the lenders. accordingly, holders of common stock will not receive cash payments on their investment and the market price may be adversely affected.
the issuance of shares of our common stock upon conversion of our convertible notes may dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders. issuances of stock on conversion may also affect our per share results of operations. any sales in the public market of our common stock issuable upon such conversion could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock.
we can issue preferred stock without stockholder approval, which could materially adversely affect the rights of common stockholders.
our certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue "blank check" preferred stock, the designation, number, voting powers, preferences and rights of which may be fixed or altered from time to time by the board of directors. our subsidiaries may also issue additional shares of preferred stock. accordingly, the board of directors has the authority, without stockholder approval, to issue preferred stock with rights that could materially adversely affect the voting power or other rights of the common stockholders or the market value of the common stock.
item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations together with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes to the financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report. this discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. the forward-looking statements are not historical facts, but rather are based on current expectations, estimates, assumptions and projections about our industry, business and future financial results. our actual results could differ materially from the results contemplated by these forward-looking statements due to a number of factors, including those discussed under 1a.-risk factors and other sections in this annual report.
executive overview live nation had another exceptional year in 2016, a year of market and product expansion while achieving new levels in our key financial and operational metrics. our total revenue for the year was $8.4 billion, making this our eleventh consecutive year of revenue growth, so once again, live nation delivered its highest revenue ever this year. our concerts, sponsorship & advertising and ticketing segments all reported revenue growth for the sixth consecutive year as a result of both our highest level of attendance at our concerts and record ticket sales in our ticketing business. more than ever, we are seeing the unique power of the live concert experience and the importance of technology to enable fans around the world to connect with artists and each other. our overall revenue in 2016 increased by $1.1 billion on a reported basis as compared to last year, or $1.2
billion, a 17% increase, without the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates. the increase was largely driven by growth in our concerts segment with an increase in the number of events, fans, and the revenue we are generating onsite at the events. ticketing increased as well, with strong growth in concert event sales both in the united states and our international markets as well as the continued expansion of our resale business. additionally, sponsorship & advertising again delivered strong growth over 2015 due to a number of new strategic multi-year deals and continued growth of our festival sales. as the leading global live event and ticketing company, we believe that we are well-positioned to provide the best service to artists, teams, fans and venues and therefore drive growth across all our businesses. we believe that by leveraging our leadership position in the entertainment industry to reach fans through the live concert experience, we will sell more tickets and uniquely engage more advertising partners. by advancing innovation in ticketing technology, we will continue to improve the fan experience by offering increased and more diversified choices in an expanded ticketing marketplace. this gives us a compelling opportunity to grow our fan base and our results.
our concerts segment was the largest contributor to our overall revenue growth, with an increase of $909.1 million on a reported basis as compared to last year, or $1.0 billion, a 20% increase, without the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates. this higher revenue was partially due to additional stadium and arena shows both in the united states and internationally, including tours by beyoncé, rihanna, coldplay and guns n' roses. we continued to expand our global festival portfolio in 2016, adding brands like governors ball to our leading roster and growing total festival attendance by 15%. nearly 17 million fans attended our amphitheater shows throughout the year, a record for live nation, with florida georgia line, dave matthews band and luke bryan all playing to sold out audiences over the summer. the results of our amphitheater onsite business accelerated in 2016 with the introduction of higher-end beer and wine options, premium brand-name food kiosks and restaurants, and "grab and go" options. these programs helped grow our ancillary revenue per fan by over 9% in 2016. in our international business, our new promotions business in germany had an outstanding first year, adding three quarters of a million new fans. we also launched 20 festival apps in europe and saw our festival attendance grow by 18% year-over-year internationally. our operating income for the year improved over 2015 largely due to the impact of these business improvements and strategic initiatives mentioned above. we will continue to look for expansion opportunities, both domestically and internationally, as well as ways to market our events more effectively, in order to continue to expand our fan base and geographic reach and to sell more tickets and onsite products.
our sponsorship & advertising segment revenue for the year was up $43.9 million on a reported basis as compared to last year, or $50.7 million, a 15% increase, without the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates. higher revenue resulted from new clients and increased festival sponsorships. in 2016, we extended agreements with several major clients for multi-year deals that utilize our venue, media and ticketing assets, providing our clients with a unique opportunity to advertise their brands and reward their customers with the rich diversity of live music. we believe this was driven in part by our focus on introducing new amphitheater and festival products as well as adding new sales categories. operating income for the year improved by 4% on a reported basis which was driven by higher revenue, partially offset by the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates. we believe that our extensive onsite and online reach, global venue distribution network, artist relationships, ticketing operations and live entertainment content are the key to securing long-term sponsorship agreements with major brands, and we plan to expand these assets while extending further into new markets internationally.
our ticketing segment revenue for the year increased by $188.4 million on a reported basis as compared to last year, or $212.0 million, a 13% increase, without the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates. this increase was largely due to a 7% growth in primary ticket sales globally, largely driven by increased sales for concert events in north america as well as europe. as we continued to improve our platform and provide consumers with a broader range of secure ticketing options, visits to our websites increased by 9% in 2016 with 63% of these visits occurring on mobile devices. our resale business also grew during the year in north america, europe and australia, with gross transaction value, or gtv, improving by 24% on a reported basis year-over-year. on the mobile front, 27% of our total tickets were sold via mobile and tablet devices compared to 21% in 2015. our total mobile ticket sales increased by 36% year-over-year driven, at least in part, by several major improvements we made to our apps and mobile web experience in the year. in 2016, we continued to invest and innovate our ticketing portfolio, opening our platform to new distribution partners and providing clients with new tools. operating results for the year increased over 2015, largely as a result of strong primary ticket sales as well as our growing resale ticketing business. we will continue to implement new features to drive further expansion of mobile ticket transactions and invest in initiatives aimed at improving the ticket search, purchase and transfer process. as a result, we expect to continue to attract more ticket buyers and enhance the overall fan and venue client experience.
our artist nation segment revenue for the year decreased by $12.5 million on a reported basis as compared to last year, or $7.6 million, a 2% decrease, without the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates, largely driven by the timing of event activity. artist nation's operating results were lower than 2015, again driven by lower event activity. our artist nation segment is focused on managing its existing clients as well as developing new relationships with top artists and extending the various services it provides.
we continue to be optimistic about the long-term potential of our company and are focused on the key elements of our business model: expand our concert platform, sell more tickets and invest in product improvements, grow resale ticket volume and expand sponsorship and advertising results.
segment overview our reportable segments are concerts, sponsorship & advertising, ticketing and artist nation.
concerts our concerts segment principally involves the global promotion of live music events in our owned or operated venues and in rented third-party venues, the operation and management of music venues, the production of music festivals across the world and the creation of associated content. while our concerts segment operates year-round, we experience higher revenue during the second and third quarters due to the seasonal nature of shows at our outdoor amphitheaters and festivals, which primarily occur from may through october. revenue and related costs for events are generally deferred and recognized when the event occurs. all advertising costs incurred during the year for shows in future years are expensed at the end of the year.
concerts direct operating expenses include artist fees, event production costs, show-related marketing and advertising expenses, along with other costs.
to judge the health of our concerts segment, we primarily monitor the number of confirmed events in our network of owned or operated and third-party venues, talent fees, average paid attendance and advance ticket sales. in addition, at our owned or operated venues and festivals, we monitor ancillary revenue per fan and premium ticket sales. for business that is conducted in foreign markets, we also compare the operating results from our foreign operations to prior periods without the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates.
sponsorship & advertising our sponsorship & advertising segment employs a sales force that creates and maintains relationships with sponsors through a combination of strategic, international, national and local opportunities that allow businesses to reach customers through our concerts, venue, artist relationship and ticketing assets, including advertising on our websites. we drive increased advertising scale to further monetize our concerts platform through rich media offerings including advertising associated with live streaming and music-related content. we work with our corporate clients to help create marketing programs that drive their business goals and connect their brands directly with fans and artists. we also develop, book and produce custom events or programs for our clients' specific brands which are typically experienced exclusively by the clients' consumers. these custom events can involve live music events with talent and media, using both online and traditional outlets. we typically experience higher revenue in the second and third quarters, as a large portion of sponsorships are associated with shows at our outdoor amphitheaters and festivals which primarily occur from may through october.
to judge the health of our sponsorship & advertising segment, we primarily review the revenue generated through sponsorship arrangements, the percentage of expected revenue under contract and online advertising revenue through our websites. for business that is conducted in foreign markets, we also compare the operating results from our foreign operations to prior periods without the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates.
ticketing our ticketing segment is primarily an agency business that sells tickets for events on behalf of our clients and retains a portion of the service charge for these services. we sell tickets through websites, mobile apps, ticket outlets and telephone call centers. our ticketing sales are impacted by fluctuations in the availability of events for sale to the public, which may vary depending upon scheduling by our clients. we also offer ticket resale services, sometimes referred to as secondary ticketing, primarily through our integrated inventory platform, league/team platforms and other platforms internationally. our ticketing segment also manages our online activities including enhancements to our websites and product offerings. through our websites, we sell tickets to our own events as well as tickets for our clients and provide event information. revenue related to ticketing service charges is recognized when the ticket is sold except for our own events where our concert promoters control ticketing and then the revenue is deferred and recognized as the event occurs.
to judge the health of our ticketing segment, we primarily review the gross transaction value and the number of tickets sold through our primary and secondary ticketing operations, the number of clients renewed or added and the average royalty rate paid to clients who use our ticketing services. in addition, we review the number of visits to our websites, the overall number of customers in our database, the number and percentage of tickets sold via mobile, the number of app installs and gross transaction value and fees related to secondary ticket sales. for business that is conducted in foreign markets, we also compare the operating results from our foreign operations to prior periods without the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates.
artist nation our artist nation segment primarily provides management services to music artists and other clients in exchange for a commission on the earnings of these artists. revenue earned from our artist nation segment is impacted to a large degree by the touring schedules of the artists we represent and generally we experience higher revenue during the second and third quarters as the period from may through october tends to be a popular time for touring events.
to judge the health of our artist nation segment, we primarily review the number of major clients represented. for business that is conducted in foreign markets, we also compare the operating results from our foreign operations to prior periods without the impact of foreign exchange rates.
key operating metrics year ended december 31,
(1)   events generally represent a single performance by an artist. fans generally represent the number of people who attend an event. festivals are counted as one event in the quarter in which the festival begins, but the number of fans is based on the days the fans were present at the festival and thus can be reported across multiple quarters. events and fan attendance metrics are estimated each quarter.
(2)   the number of fee-bearing tickets sold includes primary and secondary tickets that are sold using our ticketmaster systems or that we issue through affiliates. this metric includes primary tickets sold during the year regardless of event timing except for our own events where our concert promoters control ticketing which are reported as the events occur. the non-fee-bearing tickets sold reported above includes primary tickets sold using our ticketmaster systems, through season seat packages and our venue clients' box offices, along with tickets sold on our 'do it yourself' platform.
aoi is a non-gaap financial measure that we define as operating income (loss) before acquisition expenses (including transaction costs, changes in the fair value of accrued acquisition-related contingent consideration obligations, and acquisition-related severance and compensation), depreciation and amortization (including goodwill impairment), loss (gain) on disposal of operating assets and certain stock-based compensation expense. we use aoi to evaluate the performance of our operating segments. we believe that information about aoi assists investors by allowing them to evaluate changes in the operating results of our portfolio of businesses separate from non-operational factors that affect net income, thus providing insights into both operations and the other factors that affect reported results. aoi is not calculated or presented in accordance with gaap. a limitation of the use of aoi as a performance measure is that it does not reflect the periodic costs of certain amortizing assets used in generating revenue in our business. accordingly, aoi should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, operating income (loss), net income (loss), and other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with gaap. furthermore, this measure may vary among other companies; thus, aoi as presented herein may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.
the following table sets forth the reconciliation of aoi to operating income (loss):

constant currency constant currency is a non-gaap financial measure. we calculate currency impacts as the difference between current period activity translated using the current period's currency exchange rates and the comparable prior period's currency exchange rates. we present constant currency information to provide a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses performed excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations.

revenue concerts revenue increased $909.1 million, or 18%, during the year ended december 31, 2016 as compared to the prior year. excluding the decrease of $87.8 million related to currency impacts, revenue increased $996.9 million, or 20%, primarily due to more shows and higher average ticket prices in our worldwide stadium, arena and theater and club events and our north america amphitheaters, increased festival activity globally and higher vip package sales. additionally, ancillary onsite revenue for our north america amphitheaters increased due to higher attendance and enhanced concession offerings. concerts had incremental revenue of $204.3 million from the acquisitions of various concert and festival promotion businesses.
operating results the improved operating results for concerts for the year ended december 31, 2016 was primarily driven by strong operating results for our worldwide stadium events and north america amphitheaters and festivals partially offset by higher compensation costs associated with annual salary increases and incentive compensation as a result of the increased operating results, and loss of certain rent credits received in 2015.
revenue concerts revenue increased $238.1 million, or 5%, during the year ended december 31, 2015 as compared to the prior year. excluding the decrease of $260.6 million related to currency impacts, revenue increased $498.7 million, or 11%, primarily due to more shows in our north america arenas and amphitheaters, touring events in asia and australia, and incremental revenue of $203.3 million from the acquisitions of various festival and concert promoters. these increases were partially offset by fewer shows in north america stadiums.
operating results the improved operating results for concerts for the year ended december 31, 2015 was primarily driven by a goodwill impairment of $117.0 million related to our international concerts business that was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2014 in connection with our annual impairment test. this was partially offset by higher amortization associated with certain revenue generating contracts due to the timing of artists touring, acceleration of depreciation and amortization associated with a change in the estimated useful lives of certain intangible assets and leasehold improvements along with increased compensation costs associated with annual salary increases and headcount growth and higher valuation allowances.

***   in accounting for the merger between live nation and ticketmaster in january 2010, the nonrecoupable ticketing contract advances that existed at the date of the merger were written off in acquisition accounting in accordance with gaap. had we continued amortizing the net book value of these nonrecoupable ticketing contract advances, the amortization above would have been $1.3 million, $1.7 million and $7.5 million higher for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
corporate corporate expenses increased $17.1 million, or 16%, during the year ended december 31, 2016 as compared to the prior year primarily due to costs incurred during 2016 associated with the relocation of an office and higher compensation costs driven by higher headcount.
loss on extinguishment of debt we recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of $14.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2016 in connection with the refinancing of the term loans under our senior secured credit facility and the redemption of our 7.0% senior notes in october 2016. these obligations were paid with proceeds from the amended senior secured credit facility and the issuance of 4.875% senior notes due 2024. there were no significant gains or losses on extinguishment of debt recorded in 2015 and 2014.
equity in losses (earnings) of nonconsolidated affiliates equity in losses (earnings) of nonconsolidated affiliates for the year ended december 31, 2016 includes impairment charges of $16.5 million primarily related to investments in a digital content company and an online merchandise company both located in the united states.
other expense, net other expense, net was $10.8 million, $27.2 million and $8.3 million for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and includes net foreign exchange rate losses of $8.8 million, $35.3 million and $28.9 million, respectively, primarily from revaluation of certain foreign currency denominated net assets held internationally. the 2015 net loss was partially offset by remeasurement gains of $9.1 million recorded in connection with the consolidation of a festival promotion business, a ticketing company and an artist management business that were all previously accounted for as equity investments, due to the acquisition of additional interests in the companies. the 2014 net loss was partially offset by a remeasurement gain of $17.1 million recorded in connection with the consolidation of an artist management business that had been previously accounted for as an equity investment, due to a change in the governing agreements.
income taxes for the year ended december 31, 2016, we had a net tax expense of $28.0 million on income before income taxes of $48.3 million compared to a net tax expense of $22.1 million on income before income taxes of $6.4 million for 2015. in 2016, income tax expense consisted of $18.2 million related to foreign entities, $5.7 million related to united states federal income taxes and $4.1 million related to state and local income taxes. the net increase is due primarily to expense for valuation allowances established for certain foreign entities and a reduced benefit in 2016 for valuation allowance release in the united states related to acquired deferred tax liabilities.
for the year ended december 31, 2015, we had a net tax expense of $22.1 million on income before income taxes of $6.4 million compared to a net tax expense of $4.6 million on a loss before income taxes of $99.8 million for 2014. in 2015, income
tax expense consisted of $15.5 million related to tax expense for foreign entities and $6.4 million related to state and local income taxes. the net increase is due to an increase in earnings in our foreign tax jurisdictions along with lower reversals of valuation allowances in 2015.
net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests increased $30.4 million to income of $16.7 million during the year ended december 31, 2015 as compared to the prior year primarily due to improved operating results from certain festival businesses and the portion of a 2014 goodwill impairment attributable to noncontrolling interests, partially offset by the prospective consolidation of an artist management company that occurred in 2014.
liquidity and capital resources our working capital requirements and capital for our general corporate purposes, including acquisitions and capital expenditures, are funded from operations or from borrowings under our senior secured credit facility described below. our cash is centrally managed on a worldwide basis. our primary short-term liquidity needs are to fund general working capital requirements, capital expenditures and debt service requirements while our long-term liquidity needs are primarily related to acquisitions and debt repayment. our primary sources of funds for our short-term liquidity needs will be cash flows from operations and borrowings under our senior secured credit facility, while our long-term sources of funds will be from cash flows from operations, long-term bank borrowings and other debt or equity financings. we may from time to time engage in open market purchases of our outstanding debt securities or redeem or otherwise repay such debt.
our balance sheet reflects cash and cash equivalents of $1.5 billion at december 31, 2016 and $1.3 billion at december 31, 2015. included in the december 31, 2016 and 2015 cash and cash equivalents balance is $591.0 million and $549.0 million, respectively, of cash received that includes the face value of tickets sold on behalf of our ticketing clients and their share of service charges that we refer to as client cash. we generally do not utilize client cash for our own financing or investing activities as the amounts are payable to clients on a regular basis. our foreign subsidiaries held approximately $712.5 million in cash and cash equivalents, excluding client cash, at december 31, 2016. we do not intend to repatriate these funds, but if we did, we would need to accrue and pay united states federal and state income taxes on any future repatriations, net of applicable foreign tax credits. we may from time to time enter into borrowings under our revolving credit facility. if the original maturity of these borrowings is 90 days or less, we present the borrowings and subsequent repayments on a net basis in the statement of cash flows to better represent our financing activities. our balance sheet reflects total net debt of $2.3 billion and $2.0 billion at december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. our weighted-average cost of debt, excluding the unamortized debt discounts and debt issuance costs on our term loans and notes, was 3.8% at december 31, 2016.
our cash and cash equivalents are held in accounts managed by third-party financial institutions and consist of cash in our operating accounts and invested cash. cash held in interest-bearing operating accounts in many cases exceeds the federal deposit insurance corporation insurance limits. the invested cash is in interest-bearing funds consisting primarily of bank deposits and money market funds. while we monitor cash and cash equivalent balances in our operating accounts on a regular basis and adjust the balances as appropriate, these balances could be impacted if the underlying financial institutions fail. to date, we have experienced no loss or lack of access to our cash and cash equivalents; however, we can provide no assurances that access to our cash and cash equivalents will not be impacted by adverse conditions in the financial markets.
for our concerts segment, we generally receive cash related to ticket revenue at our owned or operated venues and festivals in advance of the event, which is recorded in deferred revenue until the event occurs. with the exception of some upfront costs and artist deposits, which are recorded in prepaid expenses until the event occurs, we pay the majority of event-related expenses at or after the event.
we view our available cash as cash and cash equivalents, less ticketing-related client cash, less event-related deferred revenue, less accrued expenses due to artists and cash collected on behalf of others, plus event-related prepaid expenses. this is essentially our cash available to, among other things, repay debt balances, make acquisitions and finance capital expenditures.
our intra-year cash fluctuations are impacted by the seasonality of our various businesses. examples of seasonal effects include our concerts and artist nation segments, which report the majority of their revenue in the second and third quarters. cash inflows and outflows depend on the timing of event-related payments but the majority of the inflows generally occur prior to the event. see "-seasonality" below. we believe that we have sufficient financial flexibility to fund these fluctuations and to access the global capital markets on satisfactory terms and in adequate amounts, although there can be no assurance that this will be the case, and capital could be less accessible and/or more costly depending on economic conditions at the time. we expect cash flows from operations and borrowings under our senior secured credit facility, along with other financing alternatives, to satisfy working capital requirements, capital expenditures and debt service requirements for at least the succeeding year.
we may need to incur additional debt or issue equity to make other strategic acquisitions or investments. there can be no assurance that such financing will be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. we may make significant acquisitions in the near term, subject to limitations imposed by our financing agreements and market conditions.
the lenders under our revolving loans and counterparties to our interest rate hedge agreements consist of banks and other third-party financial institutions. while we currently have no indications or expectations that such lenders and counterparties will be unable to fund their commitments as required, we can provide no assurances that future funding availability will not be impacted by adverse conditions in the financial markets. should an individual lender default on its obligations, the remaining lenders would not be required to fund the shortfall, resulting in a reduction in the total amount available to us for future borrowings, but would remain obligated to fund their own commitments. should any counterparty to our interest rate hedge agreements default on its obligations, we could experience higher interest rate volatility during the period of any such default.
sources of cash senior secured credit facility in october 2016, we amended our senior secured credit facility. the amended senior secured credit facility provides for (i) a $190 million term loan a, (ii) a $975 million term loan b and (iii) a $365 million revolving credit facility. subject to certain conditions, we have the right to increase the facility by an amount equal to the sum of $625 million and the aggregate principal amount of voluntary prepayments of the term b loans and permanent reductions of the revolving credit facility commitments, in each case, other than from proceeds of long-term indebtedness, and additional amounts so long as the senior secured leverage ratio calculated on a pro-forma basis (as defined in the credit agreement) is no greater than 3.25x. the revolving credit facility provides for borrowings up to the amount of the facility with sublimits of up to (i) $150 million for the issuance of letters of credit, (ii) $50 million for swingline loans, (iii) $200 million for borrowings in euros or british pounds and (iv) $50 million for borrowings in one or more other approved currencies. the senior secured credit facility is secured by (i) a first priority lien on substantially all of the tangible and intangible personal property of our domestic subsidiaries that are guarantors and (ii) a pledge of substantially all of the shares of stock, partnership interests and limited liability company interests of our direct and indirect domestic subsidiaries and 65% of each class of capital stock of any first-tier foreign subsidiaries, subject to certain exceptions.
the interest rates per annum applicable to revolving credit facility loans and term loan a under the senior secured credit facility are, at our option, equal to either libor plus 2.25% or a base rate plus 1.25%, subject to stepdowns based on our net leverage ratio. the interest rates per annum applicable to the term loan b are, at our option, equal to either libor plus 2.50% or a base rate plus 1.50%. we are required to pay a commitment fee of 0.5% per year on the undrawn portion available under the revolving credit facility, subject to a stepdown based on our net leverage ratio, and variable fees on outstanding letters of credit.
for the term loan a, we are required to make quarterly payments increasing over time from $2.4 million to $28.5 million with the balance due at maturity in october 2021. for the term loan b, we are required to make quarterly payments of $2.4 million with the balance due at maturity in october 2023. the revolving credit facility matures in october 2021. we are also required to make mandatory prepayments of the loans under the credit agreement, subject to specified exceptions, from excess cash flow, and with the proceeds of asset sales, debt issuances and specified other events.
during the year ended december 31, 2016, we made principal payments totaling $123.3 million primarily to lenders electing not to convert their outstanding term loans in connection with the october 2016 amendment. at december 31, 2016, the outstanding balances on these term loans, excluding discounts and debt issuance costs, were $1.2 billion. there were no borrowings under the revolving credit facility as of december 31, 2016. based on our letters of credit of $85.3 million, $279.7 million was available for future borrowings.
4.875% senior notes in october 2016, we issued $575 million of 4.875% senior notes due 2024. interest on the notes is payable semi-annually in cash in arrears on may 1 and november 1 of each year beginning on may 1, 2017, and will mature in november 2024. we may redeem some or all of the notes, at any time prior to november 1, 2019, at a price equal to 100% of the aggregate principal amount, plus any accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption, plus a 'make-whole' premium. we may redeem up to 35% of the aggregate principal amount of the notes from the proceeds of certain equity offerings prior to november 1, 2019, at a price equal to 104.875% of the aggregate principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon, if any, to the date of redemption. in addition, on or after november 1, 2019, we may redeem some or all of the notes at any time at the redemption prices that start at 103.656% of their principal amount, plus any accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption. we must make an offer to redeem the notes at 101% of their aggregate principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the repurchase date, if we experience certain defined changes of control.
5.375% senior notes in may 2014, we issued $250 million of 5.375% senior notes due 2022. interest on the notes is payable semiannually in arrears on june 15 and december 15, and the notes will mature in june 2022. we may redeem some or all of the notes at any time prior to june 15, 2017 at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount, plus any accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption, plus a 'make-whole' premium. we may also redeem up to 35% of the aggregate principal amount of the notes from the proceeds of certain equity offerings prior to june 15, 2017, at a price equal to 105.375% of the principal amount, plus any accrued and unpaid interest. in addition, on or after june 15, 2017, we may redeem at our option some or all of the notes at redemption prices that start at 104.0313% of their principal amount, plus any accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption. we must make an offer to redeem the notes at 101% of the aggregate principal amount, plus any accrued and unpaid interest to the repurchase date, if we experience certain defined changes of control.
2.5% convertible senior notes in may 2014, we issued $275 million of convertible senior notes due 2019. the notes pay interest semiannually in arrears on may 15 and november 15 at a rate of 2.5% per annum. the notes will mature in may 2019 and may not be redeemed by us prior to the maturity date. the notes will be convertible, under certain circumstances, until november 15, 2018, and on or after such date without condition, at an initial conversion rate of 28.8363 shares of our common stock per $1,000 principal amount of notes, subject to adjustment, which represents a 52.5% conversion premium based on the last reported sale price for our common stock of $22.74 on may 19, 2014. upon conversion, the notes may be settled in shares of common stock or, at our election, cash or a combination of cash and shares of common stock. assuming we fully settled the notes in shares, the maximum number of shares that could be issued to satisfy the conversion is currently 7.9 million.
if we experience a fundamental change, as defined in the indenture governing the notes, the holders of the 2.5% convertible senior notes may require us to purchase for cash all or a portion of their notes, subject to specified exceptions, at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any.
extinguishment of debt in connection with our debt refinancing in october 2016, we issued $575 million of 4.875% senior notes due 2024 and amended our senior secured credit facility. the amendment to the senior secured credit facility provided the existing term loan a and term loan b lenders with an option to convert their outstanding principal amounts into the new term loans. excluding the outstanding principal amounts for lenders who elected to convert their outstanding term loans, total proceeds of $858.5 million were used to repay $123.3 million outstanding principal amount of our borrowings under the senior secured credit facility, to repay the entire $425 million principal amount of our 7% senior notes due 2020 and to pay the related redemption premium of $14.9 million on the 7% senior notes and accrued interest and fees of $38.4 million, leaving $256.9 million in additional cash available for general corporate purposes. we recorded $14.0 million as a loss on extinguishment of debt related to this refinancing in 2016.
debt covenants our senior secured credit facility contains a number of restrictions that, among other things, require us to satisfy a financial covenant and restrict our and our subsidiaries' ability to incur additional debt, make certain investments and acquisitions, repurchase our stock and prepay certain indebtedness, create liens, enter into agreements with affiliates, modify the nature of our business, enter into sale-leaseback transactions, transfer and sell material assets, merge or consolidate, and pay dividends and make distributions (with the exception of subsidiary dividends or distributions to the parent company or other subsidiaries on at least a pro-rata basis with any noncontrolling interest partners). non-compliance with one or more of the covenants and restrictions could result in the full or partial principal balance of the credit facility becoming immediately due and payable. the senior secured credit facility agreement has one covenant, measured quarterly, that relates to total leverage. the consolidated total leverage covenant requires us to maintain a ratio of consolidated total funded debt to consolidated ebitda (both as defined in the credit agreement) of 5.50x over the trailing four consecutive quarters through september 30, 2017. the consolidated total leverage ratio will reduce to 5.25x on december 31, 2017, 5.0x on december 31, 2018, 4.75x on december 31, 2019 and 4.50x on december 31, 2020.
the indentures governing our 4.875% senior notes and 5.375% senior notes contain covenants that limit, among other things, our ability and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to incur certain additional indebtedness and issue preferred stock, make certain distributions, investments and other restricted payments, sell certain assets, agree to any restrictions on the ability of restricted subsidiaries to make payments to us, merge, consolidate or sell all of our assets, create certain liens, and engage in transactions with affiliates on terms that are not on an arms-length basis. certain covenants, including those pertaining to incurrence of indebtedness, restricted payments, asset sales, mergers, and transactions with affiliates will be suspended during any period in which the notes are rated investment grade by both rating agencies and no default or event of default under the indenture has occurred and is continuing. the 4.875% senior notes and the 5.375% senior notes contain two incurrence-based
financial covenants, as defined, requiring a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of 2.0x and a maximum secured indebtedness leverage ratio of 3.50x.
some of our other subsidiary indebtedness includes restrictions on entering into various transactions, such as acquisitions and disposals, and prohibits payment of ordinary dividends. they also have financial covenants including minimum consolidated ebitda to consolidated net interest payable, minimum consolidated cash flow to consolidated debt service and maximum consolidated debt to consolidated ebitda, all as defined in the applicable debt agreements.
as of december 31, 2016, we believe we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants. we expect to remain in compliance with all of our debt covenants throughout 2017.
stock option exercises during 2016, 2015 and 2014 we received $20.3 million, $16.3 million and $21.8 million, respectively, of proceeds from the exercise of stock options.
uses of cash acquisitions when we make acquisitions, the acquired entity may have cash at the time of acquisition. all amounts related to the use of cash for acquisitions discussed in this section are presented net of any cash acquired. during 2016, we used $211.6 million of cash primarily for the acquisitions of a concert promoter in germany, controlling interests in festival and concert promoters in the united kingdom, united states and sweden and an artist management business with locations in the united states and canada. these businesses had a total of $39.0 million of cash on their balance sheets primarily related to deferred revenue for future events.
during 2015, we used $89.8 million of cash primarily for the acquisitions of all or part of festival promoters located in the united states, the united kingdom, and sweden and a ticketing business located in canada. as of the date of acquisition, these businesses had a total of $114.6 million of cash on their balance sheets primarily related to deferred revenue for future events.
during 2014, we used $210.2 million of cash primarily for acquisitions of a controlling interest in a festival and concert promoter located in the united states and acquisitions of artist management businesses located in the united states. as of the date of acquisition, these businesses had a total of $34.6 million of cash on their balance sheets, primarily related to deferred revenue for future events.
purchases and sales of noncontrolling interests, net in 2016, we used $69.1 million of cash primarily for the acquisition of all or additional equity interests in two artist management businesses located in the united states and a festival and concert promoter located in australia.
capital expenditures venue and ticketing operations are capital intensive businesses, requiring continual investment in our existing venues and ticketing systems in order to address audience and artist expectations, technological industry advances and various federal, state and/or local regulations.
we categorize capital outlays between maintenance capital expenditures and revenue generating capital expenditures. maintenance capital expenditures are associated with the renewal and improvement of existing venues and technology systems, web development and administrative offices. revenue generating capital expenditures generally relate to the construction of new venues, major renovations to existing buildings or buildings that are being added to our venue network, the development of new ticketing tools and technology enhancements. revenue generating capital expenditures can also include smaller projects whose purpose is to increase revenue and/or improve operating income. capital expenditures typically increase during periods when our venues are not in operation since that is the time that such improvements can be completed.
our capital expenditures, including accruals but excluding expenditures funded by outside parties such as landlords or replacements funded by insurance proceeds, consisted of the following:
maintenance capital expenditures              $92,125                 $79,008                 $60,320
revenue generating capital expenditures        94,702                  65,726                  73,476
total capital expenditures                   $186,827                $144,734                $133,796
maintenance capital expenditures for 2016 increased from the prior year primarily associated with technology system enhancements and venue-related projects.
revenue generating capital expenditures for 2016 increased from the prior year primarily due to development and enhancement of certain venues.
maintenance capital expenditures for 2015 increased from the prior year primarily due to technology product enhancements.
revenue generating capital expenditures for 2015 decreased from the prior year primarily due to lower expenditures related to the re-platforming of our ticketing system and development of our integrated resale and primary product.
for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, $2.8 million, $0.4 million and $4.4 million, respectively, of insurance proceeds and landlord reimbursements have been excluded from capital expenditures in the table above.
we currently expect capital expenditures to be approximately $220 million for the year ending december 31, 2017.
contractual obligations and commitments firm commitments in addition to the scheduled maturities on our debt, we have future cash obligations under various types of contracts. we lease office space, certain equipment and many of the venues used in our concert operations under long-term operating leases. some of our lease agreements contain renewal options and annual rental escalation clauses (generally tied to the consumer price index), as well as provisions for our payment of utilities and maintenance. we also have minimum payments associated with non-cancelable contracts related to our operations such as artist guarantee contracts and client ticketing agreements. as part of our ongoing capital projects, we will enter into construction-related commitments for future capital expenditure work. the scheduled maturities discussed below represent contractual obligations as of december 31, 2016 and thus do not represent all expected expenditures for those periods.
the scheduled maturities of our outstanding long-term debt (excluding unamortized debt discounts and issuance costs), future minimum rental commitments under non-cancelable operating lease agreements, minimum payments under other non-cancelable contracts, capital expenditure commitments and expected payments of contingent and deferred consideration liabilities as of december 31, 2016 are as follows:
long-term debt obligations, including current maturities:
term loans and revolving credit facility                        $1,160,188                              $21,625                 $59,875                $154,875                    $923,813
capital expenditures                                                62,624                               34,179                   2,600                   1,769                      24,076
uncertain income tax positions (4)                                       -                                    -                       -                       -                           -
(2) does not include interest on the revolving credit facility as the balance was zero as of december 31, 2016.
(3)  commitment amounts for non-cancelable operating leases and non-cancelable contracts which stipulate an increase in the commitment amount based on an inflationary index have been estimated using an inflation factor of 1.9% for north america, 3.0% for the united kingdom, 1.8% for denmark and 1.7% for the netherlands.
(4) does not include $8.3 million of uncertain tax positions due to the unpredictable timing of the future payments.
during 2006, in connection with our acquisition of a theatrical business, we guaranteed obligations related to a lease agreement. in the event of default, we could be liable for obligations which have future lease payments (undiscounted) of approximately $16.9 million through the end of 2035 which are not reflected in the table above. the scheduled future minimum rentals for this lease for the years 2017 through 2021 are $1.6 million each year. the venues under the lease agreement were included in the sale of our north american theatrical business in 2008. the buyer assumed our obligations under the guaranty, however we remain contingently liable to the lessor. we believe that the likelihood of a material liability being triggered under this lease is remote, and no liability has been accrued for these contingent lease obligations as of december 31, 2016.
aggregate minimum rentals of $57.4 million to be paid to us in years 2017 through 2023 under non-cancelable subleases are excluded from the commitment amounts in the above table.
guarantees of third-party obligations as of december 31, 2016 and 2015, we guaranteed the debt of third parties of approximately $18.0 million and $13.4 million, respectively, primarily related to maximum credit limits on employee and tour-related credit cards and obligations under a venue management agreement.
operating activities          $597,490                $307,854                $292,166
investing activities          $(426,477     )         $(290,985     )         $(392,158     )
financing activities          $99,212                 $(44,121      )         $225,971
operating activities year ended 2016 compared to year ended 2015
cash provided by operating activities increased $289.6 million for the year ended december 31, 2016 as compared to the prior year. during 2016, our accounts payable and accrued liabilities increased based on the timing of payments, we delivered higher cash-related net income and received more cash for future events, increasing deferred revenue, partially offset by a larger increase in accounts receivable as compared to the prior year.
cash provided by operating activities increased $15.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2015 as compared to the prior year. during 2015, we made less advances to artists for future events, decreasing our prepaid expenses and other assets, partially offset by a larger increase in accounts receivable and a decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities based on the timing of payments as compared to the prior year.
investing activities year ended 2016 compared to year ended 2015
cash used in investing activities increased $135.5 million for the year ended december 31, 2016 as compared to the prior year due to higher acquisition activity and higher purchases of property, plant and equipment partially offset by lower advances of notes receivable. see "-uses of cash" above for further discussion.
cash used in investing activities decreased $101.2 million for the year ended december 31, 2015 as compared to the prior year primarily due to lower net acquisition expenditures in 2015 as compared to the prior year. see "-uses of cash" above for further discussion.
financing activities year ended 2016 compared to year ended 2015
cash provided by financing activities increased $143.3 million for the year ended december 31, 2016 as compared to the prior year primarily due to net proceeds of $267.3 million received in 2016 from the issuance of the 4.875% senior notes and increased term loan a and term loan b borrowings, after repayment of the 7% senior notes and related costs. the higher net proceeds from the debt issuance were partially offset by higher purchases of noncontrolling interests and distributions to noncontrolling interest partners along with higher payments for deferred and contingent consideration due to past acquisitions.
cash used in financing activities increased $270.1 million for the year ended december 31, 2015 as compared to the prior year primarily as a result of net proceeds of $293.8 million received in 2014 from the issuance of the 5.375% senior notes and 2.5% convertible senior notes after repayment of the 2.875% convertible senior notes.
seasonality our concerts, sponsorship & advertising and artist nation segments typically experience higher operating income in the second and third quarters as our outdoor venues and festivals are primarily used in or occur from may through october, and our artist touring activity is higher. in addition, the timing of when tickets are sold and the tours of top-grossing acts can impact comparability of quarterly results year over year, although annual results may not be impacted. our ticketing segment revenue is impacted by fluctuations in the availability of events for sale to the public, which vary depending upon scheduling by our clients.
cash flows from our concerts segment typically have a slightly different seasonality as payments are often made for artist performance fees and production costs for tours in advance of the date the related event tickets go on sale. these artist fees and production costs are expensed when the event occurs. once tickets for an event go on sale, we generally begin to receive payments from ticket sales at our owned or operated venues and festivals in advance of when the event occurs. we record these ticket sales as revenue when the event occurs.
we expect these trends to continue in the future. see item 1a.-risk factors-"our operations are seasonal and our results of operations vary from quarter to quarter and year over year, so our financial performance in certain financial quarters or years may not be indicative of, or comparable to, our financial performance in subsequent quarters or years."
market risk we are exposed to market risks arising from changes in market rates and prices, including movements in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates.
foreign currency risk we have operations in countries throughout the world. the financial results of our foreign operations are measured in their local currencies. our foreign subsidiaries also carry certain net assets or liabilities that are denominated in a currency other than that subsidiary's functional currency. as a result, our financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in the foreign markets in which we have operations. currently, we do not operate in any hyper-inflationary countries. our foreign operations reported operating income of $72.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2016. we estimate that a 10% change in the value of the united states dollar relative to foreign currencies would change our operating income for the year ended december 31, 2016 by $7.2 million. as of december 31, 2016, our most significant foreign exchange exposure included the euro, british pound, australian dollar and canadian dollar. this analysis does not consider the implication such currency fluctuations could have on the overall economic conditions of the united states or other foreign countries in which we operate or on the results of operations of our foreign entities. in addition, the reported carrying value of our assets and liabilities, including the total cash and cash equivalents held by our foreign operations, will also be affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates.
we primarily use forward currency contracts, in addition to options, to reduce our exposure to foreign currency risk associated with short-term artist fee commitments. we also may enter into forward currency contracts to minimize the risks and/or costs associated with changes in foreign currency rates on forecasted operating income. at december 31, 2016, we had forward currency contracts and options outstanding with a notional amount of $173.8 million.
interest rate risk our market risk is also affected by changes in interest rates. we had $2.4 billion of total debt, excluding unamortized debt discounts and issuance costs, outstanding as of december 31, 2016. of the total amount, taking into consideration existing interest rate hedges, we had $1.2 billion of fixed-rate debt and $1.2 billion of floating-rate debt.
based on the amount of our floating-rate debt as of december 31, 2016, each 25-basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would increase or decrease our annual interest expense and cash outlay by approximately $3.0 million when the floor rate is not applicable. this potential increase or decrease is based on the simplified assumption that the level of floating-rate debt remains constant with an immediate across-the-board increase or decrease as of december 31, 2016 with no subsequent change in rates for the remainder of the period.
we have one interest rate cap agreement with an aggregate notional amount of $6.3 million at december 31, 2016. the interest rate cap agreement ensures that a portion of our floating-rate debt does not exceed 4.25% and expires in june 2018. this agreement has not been designated as a hedging instrument. therefore, any change in fair value is recorded in earnings during the period of the change.
recent accounting pronouncements information regarding recent accounting pronouncements can be found in item 8.- financial statements and supplementary data-note 1-the company and summary of significant accounting policies.
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. on an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates that are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. the result of these evaluations forms the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the reported amount of revenue and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates, and such difference could be material. management believes that the following accounting estimates are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results, and they require management's most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. the following narrative describes these critical accounting estimates, the judgments and assumptions and the effect if actual results differ from these assumptions where applicable.
consolidation typically we consolidate entities in which we own more than 50% of the voting common stock and control operations and also vies for which we are the primary beneficiary. investments in nonconsolidated affiliates in which we own more than 20% of the voting common stock or otherwise exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies, but not control of the nonconsolidated affiliate, are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. investments in nonconsolidated affiliates in which we own less than 20% of the voting common stock are accounted for using the cost method of accounting. intercompany accounts among the consolidated businesses have been eliminated in consolidation. net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests is reflected in the statements of operations for consolidated affiliates.
business combinations we account for our business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting. identifiable assets acquired, liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree are recognized and measured as of the acquisition date at fair value. additionally, contingent consideration is recorded at fair value on the acquisition date and classified as a liability. goodwill is recognized to the extent by which the aggregate of the acquisition-date fair value of the consideration transferred and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree exceeds the recognized basis of the identifiable assets acquired, net of assumed liabilities. determining the fair value of assets acquired, liabilities assumed and noncontrolling interest requires management's judgment and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including assumptions with respect to future cash flows, discount rates and asset lives among other items.
property, plant and equipment we test for possible impairment of property, plant and equipment whenever events or circumstances change, such as a current period operating cash flow loss combined with a history of, or projected, operating cash flow losses or a significant adverse change in the manner in which the asset is intended to be used, which may indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. if indicators exist, we compare the estimated undiscounted future cash flows related to the assets to the carrying amount of those assets. if the carrying value is greater than the estimated undiscounted future cash flows, the cost basis of the asset is reduced to reflect the current fair value. we use various assumptions in determining the current fair value of these assets, including future expected cash flows and discount rates, as well as future salvage values and other fair value measures. our impairment loss calculations require us to apply judgment in estimating future cash flows, including forecasting useful lives of the assets and selecting the discount rate that reflects the risk inherent in future cash flows.
if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and judgments used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values, we may be exposed to future impairment losses that could be material to our results of operations.
intangibles we test for possible impairment of definite-lived intangible assets whenever events or circumstances change, such as a current period operating cash flow loss combined with a history of, or projected, operating cash flow losses or a significant adverse change in the manner in which the asset is intended to be used, which may indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. when specific assets are determined to be unrecoverable, the cost basis of the asset is reduced to reflect the current fair value.
we test for possible impairment of indefinite-lived intangible assets on at least an annual basis. based on facts and circumstances, we perform either a qualitative or a quantitative assessment for impairment. if a qualitative assessment is performed, and the existence of events and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired, we perform the quantitative impairment test by comparing the fair value with the carrying amount. when specific assets are determined to be impaired, the cost basis of the asset is reduced to reflect the current fair value.
when performing quantitative assessments for impairment, we use various assumptions in determining the current fair value of these definite-lived and indefinite-lived intangible assets, including future expected cash flows, discount rates and royalty rates as well as other fair value measures. for intangibles related to artist rights, we use assumptions about future revenue and operating income for the rights acquired. these projections are based on information about the artists' past results and expectations about future results. our impairment loss calculations require us to apply judgment in estimating future cash flows, including forecasting useful lives of the assets and selecting the discount rate that reflects the risk inherent in future cash flows.
if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and judgments used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values, we may be exposed to future impairment losses that could be material to our results of operations.
goodwill we currently have seven reporting units with goodwill balances: international concerts and north america concerts within the concerts segment; sponsorship & advertising; international ticketing and north america ticketing within the ticketing segment; and artist management and artist services (non-management) within the artist nation segment.
we review goodwill for impairment annually, as of october 1, using a three-step process. we also test goodwill for impairment in other periods if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount or when we change our operating segments or reporting units.
the first step is a qualitative evaluation as to whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of any of our reporting units is less than its carrying value using an assessment of relevant events and circumstances. examples of such events and circumstances include historical financial performance, industry and market conditions, macroeconomic conditions, reporting unit-specific events, historical results of goodwill impairment testing, and the timing of the last performance of a quantitative assessment. if any reporting units are concluded to be more likely than not impaired, or if that conclusion cannot be determined qualitatively, a second step is performed for that reporting unit. regardless, it is our policy that all reporting units undergo a second step at least once every five years. this second step, used to quantitatively screen for potential impairment, compares the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. the third step, employed for any reporting unit that fails the second step, is used to measure the amount of any potential impairment and compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill with the carrying amount of goodwill. if a reporting unit's carrying value is negative, we do not follow this three-step process. in this case, a qualitative evaluation is performed to determine whether it is more likely than not that the reporting unit's goodwill is impaired. if it is, the comparison of the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill with the carrying amount of goodwill described above is performed. in all three steps, discount rates, market multiples and sensitivity tests are derived and/or computed with the assistance of external valuation consultants. we perform sensitivity analyses when the most likely result is unclear in the first step and for both the second and third steps in our process. generally, we test for sensitivities to discount rate, revenue growth, market multiples and customer attrition, which are the most significant assumptions.
the second and third steps that we use to evaluate goodwill for impairment involve the determination of the fair value of our reporting units. inherent in such fair value determinations are certain judgments and estimates relating to future cash flows, including our interpretation of current economic indicators and market valuations, and assumptions about our strategic plans with regard to our operations. due to the uncertainties associated with such estimates, actual results could differ from such estimates.
in developing fair values for our reporting units, we may employ a market multiple or a discounted cash flow methodology, or a combination thereof. the market multiple methodology compares us to similar companies on the basis of risk characteristics to determine our risk profile relative to those companies as a group. this analysis generally focuses on both quantitative considerations, which include financial performance and other quantifiable data, and qualitative considerations, which include any factors which are expected to impact future financial performance. the most significant assumptions affecting the market multiple methodology are the market multiples and control premium. a control premium represents the additional value an investor would pay in order to obtain a controlling interest in the respective reporting unit.
the discounted cash flow methodology establishes fair value by estimating the present value of the projected future cash flows to be generated from the reporting unit less those cash flows attributable to noncontrolling interests. it is important to note that items such as depreciation, amortization and stock-based compensation expense are not part of cash flows which is
more akin to our aoi metric. the discount rate applied to the projected future cash flows to arrive at the present value is intended to reflect all risks of ownership and the associated risks of realizing the stream of projected future cash flows. the discounted cash flow methodology uses our estimates of future financial performance. the most significant assumptions used in the discounted cash flow methodology are the discount rate, the attrition rate and expected future revenue, which vary among reporting units.
if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and judgments used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values, we may be exposed to future impairment losses that could be material to our results of operations.
in 2016, all of our reporting units with goodwill were assessed under the first qualitative step. five of the reporting units did not advance to the second step. three of these five reporting units had improved discount rates and considerable excess of fair value over their carrying value in the most recent quantitative tests, while also having mixed results on market multiples and financial results when compared to recent financial expectations. two out of the five reporting units had varying financial results as compared to recent financial expectations for the current year with slight decreases in market multiples, but both had a significant excess of fair value over their carrying value in the most recent quantitative tests along with improved discount rates. any further review of these reporting units with sensitivity tests did not change our first step conclusions.
the artist management and artist services reporting units advanced to the second step and their excess of fair value over carrying value ranged from 20% to 31%. although both of these reporting units had lower financial results in the current year and mixed results on their market multiples, they had improvements on discount rates. sensitivity tests on the artist management reporting unit showed that a 300-basis point change in the discount rate, an 81% decline in the revenue growth rate, or a 235-basis point change in market multiples was needed to change the conclusion. sensitivity tests on the artist services reporting unit showed that a 220-basis point change in the discount rate, a 71% decline in the revenue growth rate, or a 306-basis point change in market multiples was needed to change the conclusion.
given the results of the tests performed, although we cannot predict future performance or market conditions, we do not currently believe any of our reporting units are at risk of failing the second step in the near future.
revenue recognition revenue from the promotion and production of an event is recognized after the show occurs. revenue related to larger global tours is also recognized after the show occurs; however, any profits related to these tours, primarily related to music tour production and tour management services, is recognized after minimum revenue thresholds, if any, have been achieved. revenue collected in advance of the event is recorded as deferred revenue until the event occurs. revenue collected from sponsorships and other revenue, which is not related to any single event, is classified as deferred revenue and generally recognized over the operating season or the term of the contract.
revenue from our ticketing operations primarily consists of convenience and order processing fees charged at the time a ticket for an event is sold and is recorded on a net basis (net of the face value of the ticket). for tickets sold for events at our owned or operated venues in the united states, and where we control the tickets internationally, revenue is recognized after the show occurs. revenue for these ticket service charges collected in advance of the event is recorded as deferred revenue until the event occurs and these service charges will be shared between our ticketing and concerts segments. for tickets sold for events at third-party venues, this revenue is recognized at the time of the sale and is recorded by our ticketing segment.
we account for taxes that are externally imposed on revenue producing transactions on a net basis, as a reduction of revenue.
litigation accruals we are currently involved in certain legal proceedings and, as required, have accrued our estimate of the probable costs for the resolution of these claims. management's estimates used have been developed in consultation with counsel and are based upon an analysis of potential results, assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies. it is possible, however, that future results of operations for any particular period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions or the effectiveness of our strategies related to these proceedings.
income taxes we account for income taxes using the liability method in accordance with the fasb guidance for income taxes. under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting bases and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the periods in which the deferred tax asset or liability is expected to be realized or settled. deferred tax assets are reduced by valuation allowances if we believe it is more likely than not that some portion or the entire asset will not be realized. as almost all earnings from our continuing foreign operations are permanently reinvested and not distributed, our income tax provision does not include additional united states taxes on those foreign operations. the amount of earnings at december 31, 2016 that has been earned over time, and permanently reinvested, was approximately $1.4 billion. it is not practical to determine the amount
of federal and state income taxes, if any, that might become due in the event that any remaining available cash associated with these earnings were distributed.
the fasb guidance for income taxes prescribes a recognition threshold and a measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. for those benefits to be recognized, a tax position must be more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities. the amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is more likely than not to be realized upon ultimate settlement.
*   for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, fixed charges exceeded earnings from continuing operations before income taxes and fixed charges by $104.0 million, $6.0 million and $142.1 million, respectively.
the ratio of earnings to fixed charges was computed on a total company basis. earnings represent income from continuing operations before income taxes less equity in undistributed net income (loss) of nonconsolidated affiliates plus fixed charges. fixed charges represent interest, amortization of debt discounts, debt issuance costs and premium and the estimated interest portion of rental charges. rental charges exclude variable rent expense for events in third-party venues.

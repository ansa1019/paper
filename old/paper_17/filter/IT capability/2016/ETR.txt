risk factors and the other information in this form 10-k. the risks that entergy faces are not limited to those in this section. there may be additional risks and uncertainties
(either currently unknown or not currently believed to be material) that could adversely affect entergy's financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity. see "
forward-looking information
utility regulatory risks
the terms and conditions of service, including electric and gas rates, of the utility operating companies and system energy are determined through regulatory approval proceedings that can be lengthy and subject to appeal that could result in delays in effecting rate changes and uncertainty as to ultimate results.
the rates that the utility operating companies and system energy charge reflect their capital expenditures, operations and maintenance costs, allowed rates of return, financing costs, and related costs of service. these rates significantly influence the financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity of entergy and each of the utility operating companies and system energy. these rates are determined in regulatory proceedings and are subject to periodic regulatory review and adjustment upon the initiative of a regulator or affected stakeholders.
in addition, regulators can initiate proceedings to investigate the prudence of costs in the utility operating companies' base rates and examine, among other things, the reasonableness or prudence of the companies' operation and maintenance practices, level of expenditures (including storm costs and costs associated with capital projects), allowed rates of return and rate base, proposed resource acquisitions, and previously incurred capital expenditures that the operating companies seek to place in rates. the regulators can disallow costs subject to their jurisdiction found not to have been prudently incurred or found not to have been incurred in compliance with applicable tariffs, creating some risk to the ultimate recovery of those costs. regulatory proceedings relating to rates and other matters typically involve multiple parties seeking to limit or reduce rates. traditional base rate proceedings, as opposed to formula rate plans, generally have long timelines, are primarily based on historical costs, and may or may not be limited in scope or duration by statute. the length of these base rate proceedings can cause the utility operating companies and system energy to experience regulatory lag in recovering costs through rates. decisions are typically subject to appeal, potentially leading to additional uncertainty associated with rate case proceedings.
the base rates of entergy texas are established in traditional base rate case proceedings. apart from base rate proceedings, entergy texas has also filed to use rate riders to recover the revenue requirements associated with certain authorized historical costs. specifically, entergy texas has recovered distribution-related capital investments through the distribution cost recovery factor rider mechanism, transmission-related capital investments and certain non-fuel miso charges through the transmission cost recovery factor rider mechanism, and miso fuel and energy-related costs through the fixed fuel factor mechanism. entergy texas is also required to make a filing every three years, at a minimum, reconciling its fuel and purchased power costs and fuel factor revenues. in the course of this reconciliation, the puct determines whether eligible fuel and fuel-related expenses and revenues are necessary and reasonable, and makes a prudence finding for each of the fuel-related contracts for the reconciliation period.
between base rate cases, entergy arkansas and entergy mississippi are able to adjust base rates annually through formula rate plans that utilize a forward test year (entergy arkansas) or forward-looking features (entergy mississippi). in response to entergy arkansas's application for a general change in rates in 2015, the apsc approved entergy arkansas's proposed formula rate plan rider pursuant to its election to have its rates regulated under a formula rate review mechanism pursuant to legislation enacted by the arkansas general assembly in early
2015. the apsc approved the formula rate plan tariff including its use of a projected year test period and an initial five-year term. the initial five-year term expires in 2021 unless entergy arkansas requests, and the apsc approves, the extension of the formula rate plan tariff for an additional five years through 2026. in the event that entergy arkansas' formula rate
table of contents part i item 1a & 1b entergy corporation, utility operating companies, and system energy plan is terminated or is not extended beyond the initial term, entergy arkansas could file an application for a general change in rates that may include a request for continued regulation under a formula rate review mechanism.
if entergy mississippi's formula rate plan is terminated, it would revert to the more traditional rate case environment or seek approval of a new formula rate plan. entergy arkansas and entergy mississippi recover fuel and purchased energy and certain non-fuel costs through other apsc-approved and mpsc-approved tariffs, respectively.
entergy louisiana sets electric base rates annually through a formula rate plan using an historic test year. the form of the formula rate plan, on a combined basis, was approved in connection with the business combination of entergy louisiana and entergy gulf states louisiana and largely followed the formula rate plans that were approved by the lpsc in connection with the full electric base rate cases filed by those companies in february 2013. the formula rate plan is approved for continued use through the test year 2016 filing. entergy louisiana's electric formula rate plan increases are capped at a cumulative total of $30 million through the formula rate plan cycle.
the lpsc also approved in the business combination entergy louisiana's continuation of a mechanism to recover non-
fuel miso-related costs, which are calculated separately from the formula rate plan requirements, but embedded in the formula rate plan factor applied on customer bills. this recovery mechanism expires following the 2015 test year, and entergy louisiana has filed an application seeking to extend that mechanism, which is subject to review and approval by the lpsc. miso fuel and energy-related costs are recoverable in entergy louisiana's fuel adjustment clause. the formula rate plan retains exceptions from the rate cap/restrictions and sharing requirements for certain large capital investment projects, including acquisition or construction of generating facilities, as well as purchase power agreements approved by the lpsc. in the event that the electric formula rate plans were terminated, or expired without renewal or extension, entergy louisiana would at that time revert to the more traditional rate case environment.
entergy new orleans previously operated under a formula rate plan that ended with the 2011 test year. currently, based on a settlement agreement approved by the city council, with limited exceptions, no action may be taken with respect to entergy new orleans' base rates until rates are implemented from a base rate case that must be filed for its electric and gas operations in 2018. the limited exceptions include implementation of the final year of a four-
year phased-in rate increase for its algiers operations in the fifteenth ward of the city of new orleans and certain exceptional cost increases or decreases in its base revenue requirement.
the utility operating companies and system energy, and the energy industry as a whole, have experienced a period of rising costs and investments, and an upward trend in spending, especially with respect to infrastructure investments, which is likely to continue in the foreseeable future and could result in more frequent rate cases and requests for, and the continuation of, cost recovery mechanisms. for information regarding rate case proceedings and formula rate plans applicable to the utility operating companies, see note 2 to the financial statements.
the utility operating companies recover fuel, purchased power, and associated costs through rate mechanisms that are subject to risks of delay or disallowance in regulatory proceedings.
the utility operating companies recover their fuel, purchased power, and associated costs from their customers through rate mechanisms subject to periodic regulatory review and adjustment. because regulatory review can result in the disallowance of incurred costs found not to have been prudently incurred, including the cost of replacement power purchased when generators experience outages, with the possibility of refunds to ratepayers, there exists some risk to the ultimate recovery of those costs. regulators can also initiate proceedings to investigate the continued usage or the adequacy and operation of the fuel and purchased power recovery clauses of the utility operating companies and, therefore, there can be no assurance that existing recovery mechanisms will remain unchanged or in effect at all.
the utility operating companies' cash flows can be negatively affected by the time delays between when gas, power, or other commodities are purchased and the ultimate recovery from customers of the costs in rates. on occasion, when the level of incurred costs for fuel and purchased power rises very dramatically, some of the utility operating companies may agree to defer recovery of a portion of that period's fuel and purchased power costs for recovery at a later date, which could increase the near-term working capital and borrowing requirements of those companies. for
table of contents part i item 1a & 1b entergy corporation, utility operating companies, and system energy a description of fuel and purchased power recovery mechanisms and information regarding the regulatory proceedings for fuel and purchased power costs recovery, see note 2 to the financial statements.
there is uncertainty regarding the effect of the termination of the system agreement on the utility operating companies.
the utility operating companies historically have engaged in the coordinated planning, construction, and operation of generating resources and bulk transmission facilities under the terms of the system agreement, which is a rate schedule that had been approved by the ferc.
entergy arkansas's participation in the system agreement terminated in december 2013, and entergy mississippi's participation in the system agreement terminated in november 2015. pursuant to a settlement agreement approved by the ferc in december 2015, the system agreement terminated in its entirety with respect to the remaining utility operating companies on august 31, 2016.
there is uncertainty regarding the long-term effect of the termination of the system agreement on the utility operating companies because of the significant effect of the agreement on the generation and transmission functions of the utility operating companies and the significant period of time (over 30 years) that it has been in existence. in the absence of the system agreement, there is uncertainty around the effectiveness of governance processes and the potential absence of federal authority to resolve certain issues among the utility operating companies and their retail regulators.
in addition, although the system agreement terminated in its entirety in august 2016, there are a number of outstanding system agreement proceedings at the ferc that may require future adjustments, including challenges to the level and timing of payments made by entergy arkansas under the system agreement. the outcome and timing of these ferc proceedings and resulting recovery and impact on rates cannot be predicted at this time.
for further information regarding the regulatory proceedings relating to the system agreement, see note 2 to the financial statements.
the utility operating companies are subject to economic risks associated with participation in the miso markets and the allocation of transmission upgrade costs. the operation of the utility operating companies' transmission system pursuant to the miso rto tariff and their participation in the miso rto's wholesale markets may be adversely affected by regulatory or market design changes, as well as liability under, or any future inability to comply with, existing or future regulations or requirements.
on december 19, 2013, the utility operating companies integrated into the miso rto. miso maintains functional control over the combined transmission systems of its members and administers wholesale energy and ancillary services markets for market participants in the miso region, including the utility operating companies. the utility operating companies sell capacity, energy, and ancillary services on a bilateral basis to certain wholesale customers and offer available electricity production of their generating facilities into the miso day-ahead and real-time energy markets pursuant to the miso tariff and market rules. the utility operating companies are subject to economic risks associated with participation in the miso markets. miso tariff rules and system conditions, including transmission congestion, could affect the utility operating companies' ability to sell power in certain regions and/or the economic value of such sales, and miso market rules may change in ways that cause additional risk.
the utility operating companies participate in the miso regional transmission planning process and are subject to risks associated with planning decisions that miso makes in the exercise of control over the planning of the utility operating companies' transmission assets that are under miso's functional control. the utility operating companies pay transmission rates that reflect the cost of transmission projects that the utility operating companies do not own, which could increase cash or financing needs. the terms and conditions of the miso tariff, including provisions related to the design and implementation of wholesale markets and the allocation of transmission upgrade costs, are subject to regulation by ferc. the operation of the utility operating companies'
table of contents part i item 1a & 1b entergy corporation, utility operating companies, and system energy miso tariff and their participation in the miso wholesale markets may be adversely affected by regulatory or market design changes, as well as liability under, or any future inability to comply with, existing or future regulations or requirements. in addition, orders from each of the utility operating companies' respective retail regulators generally require that the utility operating companies make filings, within a specified period of their integration into miso, setting forth the results of analysis of the costs and benefits of continued membership in miso and/or requesting approval of their continued membership in miso, and the outcome of such proceedings may affect the utility operating companies' continued membership in miso.
a delay or failure in recovering amounts for storm restoration costs incurred as a result of severe weather could have material effects on entergy and those utility operating companies affected by severe weather.
entergy's and its utility operating companies' results of operations, liquidity, and financial condition can be materially affected by the destructive effects of severe weather. severe weather can also result in significant outages for the customers of the utility operating companies and, therefore, reduced revenues for the utility operating companies during the period of the outages. a delay or failure in recovering amounts for storm restoration costs incurred or revenues lost as a result of severe weather could have a material effect on entergy and those utility operating companies affected by severe weather.
nuclear operating, shutdown and regulatory risks
certain of the utility operating companies, system energy, and entergy wholesale commodities must consistently operate their nuclear power plants at high capacity factors in order to be successful, and lower capacity factors could materially affect entergy's and their results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.
nuclear capacity factors significantly affect the results of operations of certain utility operating companies, system energy, and entergy wholesale commodities. nuclear plant operations involve substantial fixed operating costs. consequently, to be successful, a plant owner must consistently operate its nuclear power plants at high capacity factors. for the utility operating companies that own nuclear plants, lower capacity factors can increase production costs by requiring the affected companies to generate additional energy, sometimes at higher costs, from their fossil facilities or purchase additional energy in the spot or forward markets in order to satisfy their supply needs. for the entergy wholesale commodities nuclear plants, lower capacity factors directly affect revenues and cash flow from operations. entergy wholesale commodities' forward sales are comprised of various hedge products, many of which have some degree of operational-contingent price risk. certain unit-contingent contracts guarantee specified minimum capacity factors. in the event plants with these contracts were operating below the guaranteed capacity factors, entergy would be subject to price risk for the undelivered power. further, entergy wholesale commodities' nuclear forward sales contracts can also be on a firm ld basis, which subjects entergy to increasing price risk as capacity factors decrease. many of these firm hedge products have damages risk, capped through the use of risk management products.
certain of the utility operating companies, system energy, and entergy wholesale commodities nuclear plant owners periodically shut down their nuclear power plants to replenish fuel. plant maintenance and upgrades are often scheduled during such refueling outages. if refueling outages last longer than anticipated or if unplanned outages arise, entergy's and their results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity could be materially affected.
outages at nuclear power plants to replenish fuel require the plant to be "turned off." refueling outages generally are planned to occur once every 18 to 24 months and average approximately 30 days in duration. plant maintenance and upgrades are often scheduled during such planned outages. when refueling outages last longer than anticipated or a plant experiences unplanned outages, capacity factors decrease and maintenance costs may
table of contents part i item 1a & 1b entergy corporation, utility operating companies, and system energy increase. lower than forecasted capacity factors may cause entergy wholesale commodities to experience reduced revenues and may also create damages risk with certain hedge products as previously discussed.
certain of the utility operating companies, system energy, and entergy wholesale commodities face risks related to the purchase of uranium fuel (and its conversion, enrichment, and fabrication), and the risk of being unable to effectively manage these risks by purchasing from a diversified mix of sellers located in a diversified mix of countries could materially affect entergy's and their results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.
based upon currently planned fuel cycles, entergy's nuclear units have a diversified portfolio of contracts and inventory that provides substantially adequate nuclear fuel materials and conversion and enrichment services at what entergy believes are reasonably predictable prices through most of 2017 and beyond. the nuclear fuel supply portfolio for the entergy wholesale commodities segment is being adjusted to reflect reduced overall requirements related to the planned permanent shutdown of the palisades, pilgrim, indian point 2 and indian point 3 plants and the planned sale of the fitzpatrick plant
entergy's ability to purchase nuclear fuel at reasonably predictable prices, however, depends upon the performance reliability of uranium miners and enrichers. while there are a number of possible alternate suppliers that may be accessed to mitigate any supplier performance failure, the pricing of any such alternate uranium supply from the market will be dependent upon the market for uranium supply at that time. entergy also may draw upon its own inventory intended for later generation periods, depending upon its risk management strategy at that time. entergy buys uranium from a diversified mix of sellers located in a diversified mix of countries, and from time to time purchases from nearly all qualified reliable major market participants worldwide that sell into the u.s. market prices for nuclear fuel have been extremely volatile from time to time in the past. although entergy's nuclear fuel contract portfolio provides a degree of hedging against market risks for several years, costs for nuclear fuel in the future cannot be predicted with certainty due to normal inherent market uncertainties, and price increases could materially affect the liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations of certain of the utility operating companies, system energy, and entergy wholesale commodities.
entergy's ability to assure nuclear fuel supply also depends upon the performance and reliability of conversion, enrichment, and fabrication services providers. these service providers are fewer in number than uranium suppliers.
for conversion and enrichment services, entergy diversifies its supply by supplier and country and may take special measures to ensure a reliable supply of enriched uranium for fabrication into nuclear fuel. for fabrication services, each plant is dependent upon the performance of the fabricator of that plant's nuclear fuel; therefore, entergy relies upon additional monitoring, inspection, and oversight of the fabrication process to assure reliability and quality of its nuclear fuel. certain of the suppliers and service providers are located in or dependent upon countries, such as russia, in which deteriorating economic conditions or international sanctions could restrict the ability of such suppliers to continue to supply fuel or provide such services. the inability of such suppliers or service providers to perform such obligations could materially affect the liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations of certain of the utility operating companies, system energy, and entergy wholesale commodities.
entergy arkansas, entergy louisiana, system energy, and the entergy wholesale commodities business face the risk that the nrc will change or modify its regulations, suspend, not renew, or revoke their licenses, or increase oversight of their nuclear plants, which could materially affect entergy's and their results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.
the nrc may modify, suspend, not renew, or revoke licenses, shut down a nuclear facility and impose civil penalties for failure to comply with the atomic energy act, related regulations, or the terms of the licenses for nuclear facilities. a change in the atomic energy act, other applicable statutes, or the applicable regulations or licenses, or the nrc's interpretation thereof, may require a substantial increase in capital expenditures or may result in increased operating or decommissioning costs and could materially affect the results of operations, liquidity, or financial condition of entergy (through entergy wholesale commodities), its utility operating companies, or system energy. a change in the classification of a plant owned by one of these companies under the nrc's reactor oversight process, which is the nrc's program to collect information about plant performance, assess the information for its safety significance,
table of contents part i item 1a & 1b entergy corporation, utility operating companies, and system energy and provide for appropriate licensee and nrc response, also could cause the owner of the plant to incur material additional costs as a result of the increased oversight activity and potential response costs associated with the change in classification. for additional information concerning the current classification of the plants owned by entergy arkansas, entergy louisiana, system energy, and the entergy wholesale commodities business, see entergy's business
regulation of entergy's business
- nrc reactor oversight process in part i, item 1 and note 8 to the financial statements.
events at nuclear plants owned by one of these companies, as well as those owned by others, may lead to a change in laws or regulations or the terms of the applicable licenses, or the nrc's interpretation thereof, or may cause the nrc to increase oversight activity or initiate actions to modify, suspend, or revoke licenses, shut down a nuclear facility, or impose civil penalties. as a result, if an incident were to occur at any nuclear generating unit, whether an entergy nuclear generating unit or not, it could materially affect the financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity of entergy, certain of the utility operating companies, system energy, or entergy wholesale commodities. for example, the earthquake of march 11, 2011 that affected the fukushima daiichi nuclear plants in japan resulted in the nrc issuing various orders requiring u.s. nuclear operators, including entergy, to undertake plant modifications or perform additional analyses that, among other things, have resulted in increased capital and operating costs associated with operating entergy's nuclear plants, some of which have been material.
certain of the utility operating companies, system energy, and entergy wholesale commodities are exposed to risks and costs related to operating and maintaining their nuclear power plants, and their failure to maintain operational efficiency at their nuclear power plants could materially affect entergy's and their results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.
the nuclear generating units owned by certain of the utility operating companies, system energy, and the entergy wholesale commodities business began commercial operations in the 1970s-1980s. older equipment may require more capital expenditures to keep each of these nuclear power plants operating safely and efficiently. this equipment is also likely to require periodic upgrading and improvement. any unexpected failure, including failure associated with breakdowns, forced outages, or any unanticipated capital expenditures, could result in increased costs, some of which costs may not be fully recoverable by the utility operating companies and system energy in regulatory proceedings. operations at any of the nuclear generating units owned and operated by entergy's subsidiaries could degrade to the point where the affected unit needs to be shut down or operated at less than full capacity. if this were to happen, identifying and correcting the causes may require significant time and expense. a decision may be made to close a unit rather than incur the expense of restarting it or returning the unit to full capacity. for the utility operating companies and system energy, this could result in certain costs being stranded and potentially not fully recoverable in regulatory proceedings. for entergy wholesale commodities, this could result in lost revenue and increased fuel and purchased power expense to meet supply commitments and penalties for failure to perform under their contracts with customers. in addition, the operation and maintenance of entergy's nuclear facilities require the commitment of substantial human resources that can result in increased costs.
the nuclear industry continues to address susceptibility to stress corrosion cracking of certain materials within plant systems. the issue is applicable at all nuclear units to varying degrees and is managed in accordance with industry standard practices and guidelines that include in-service examinations, replacements, and mitigation strategies. developments in the industry or identification of issues at the nuclear units could require unanticipated remediation efforts that cannot be quantified in advance.
moreover, entergy is becoming more dependent on fewer suppliers for key parts of entergy's nuclear power plants that may need to be replaced or refurbished. in addition, certain major parts have long lead-times to manufacture if an unplanned replacement is needed. this dependence on a reduced number of suppliers and long lead-times on certain major parts for unplanned replacements could result in delays in obtaining qualified replacement parts and, therefore, greater expense for entergy.
table of contents part i item 1a & 1b entergy corporation, utility operating companies, and system energy the costs associated with the storage of the spent nuclear fuel of certain of the utility operating companies, system energy, and the owners of the entergy wholesale commodities nuclear power plants, as well as the costs of and their ability to fully decommission their nuclear power plants, could be significantly affected by the timing of the opening of a spent nuclear fuel disposal facility, as well as interim storage and transportation requirements.
certain of the utility operating companies, system energy and the owners of the entergy wholesale commodities nuclear plants incur costs on a periodic basis for the on-site storage of spent nuclear fuel. the approval of a license for a national repository for the disposal of spent nuclear fuel, such as the one proposed for yucca mountain, nevada, or any interim storage facility, and the timing of such facility opening, will significantly affect the costs associated with on-site storage of spent nuclear fuel. for example, while the doe is required by law to proceed with the licensing of yucca mountain and, after the license is granted by the nrc, to construct the repository and commence the receipt of spent fuel, the nrc licensing of the yucca mountain repository is effectively at a standstill. these actions may prolong the time before spent fuel is removed from entergy's plant sites. because the doe has not accomplished its objectives, it is in non-compliance with the nuclear waste policy act of 1982 and has breached its spent fuel disposal contracts, and entergy has sued the doe for such breach.
furthermore, entergy is uncertain as to when the doe plans to commence acceptance of spent fuel from its facilities for storage or disposal. as a result, continuing future expenditures will be required to increase spent fuel storage capacity at the companies' nuclear sites and maintenance costs on existing storage facilities may increase.
the costs of on-site storage are also affected by regulatory requirements for such storage. in addition, the availability of a repository or other off-site storage facility for spent nuclear fuel may affect the ability to fully decommission the nuclear units and the costs relating to decommissioning. for further information regarding spent fuel storage, see the "

certain of the utility operating companies, system energy, and the entergy wholesale commodities nuclear plant owners may be required to pay substantial retrospective premiums imposed under the price-anderson act in the event of a nuclear incident, and losses not covered by insurance could have a material effect on entergy's and their results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity.
accidents and other unforeseen problems at nuclear power plants have occurred both in the united states and elsewhere. the price-anderson act limits each reactor owner's public liability (off-site) for a single nuclear incident to the payment of retrospective premiums into a secondary insurance pool of up to approximately $127.3
million per reactor. with 102 reactors currently participating, this translates to a total public liability cap of approximately $13 billion per incident. the limit is subject to change to account for the effects of inflation, a change in the primary limit of insurance coverage, and changes in the number of licensed reactors. as required by the price-anderson act, the utility operating companies, system energy, and entergy wholesale commodities carry the maximum available amount of primary nuclear off-site liability insurance with american nuclear insurers (which is
$450 million for each operating site as of january 1, 2017). claims for any nuclear incident exceeding that amount are covered under the retrospective premiums paid into the secondary insurance pool. as a result, in the event of a nuclear incident that causes damages (off-site) in excess of the primary insurance coverage, each owner of a nuclear plant reactor, including entergy's utility operating companies, system energy, and the entergy wholesale commodities plant owners, regardless of fault or proximity to the incident, will be required to pay a retrospective premium, equal to its proportionate share of the loss in excess of the primary insurance level, up to a maximum of approximately $127.3 million per reactor per incident (entergy's maximum total contingent obligation per incident is $1.273 billion). the retrospective premium payment is currently limited to approximately $19 million per year per incident per reactor until the aggregate public liability for each licensee is paid up to the $127.3 million cap.
neil is a utility industry mutual insurance company, owned by its members. all member plants could be subject to an annual assessment (retrospective premium of up to 10 times current annual premium for all policies) should the surplus (reserve) be significantly depleted due to insured losses. as of december 31, 2016, the maximum annual assessment amounts total $135.2 million for the utility plants and $127.4 million for the entergy wholesale commodities plants. retrospective premium insurance available through neil's reinsurance treaty can cover the
table of contents part i item 1a & 1b entergy corporation, utility operating companies, and system energy potential assessments and the entergy wholesale commodities plants currently maintain the retrospective premium insurance to cover those potential assessments.
as an owner of nuclear power plants, entergy participates in industry self-insurance programs and could be liable to fund claims should a plant owned by a different company experience a major event. any resulting liability from a nuclear accident may exceed the applicable primary insurance coverage and require contribution of additional funds through the industry-wide program that could significantly affect the results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity of entergy, certain of the utility operating companies, system energy, or the entergy wholesale commodities subsidiaries.
market performance and other changes may decrease the value of assets in the decommissioning trusts, which then could require significant additional funding.
owners of nuclear generating plants have an obligation to decommission those plants. certain of the utility operating companies, system energy, and owners of the entergy wholesale commodities nuclear power plants maintain decommissioning trust funds for this purpose. certain of the utility operating companies collect funds from their customers, which are deposited into the trusts covering the units operated for or on behalf of those companies.
those rate collections, as adjusted from time to time by rate regulators, are generally based upon operating license lives and trust fund balances as well as estimated trust fund earnings and decommissioning costs. in connection with the acquisition of certain nuclear plants, the entergy wholesale commodities plant owners also acquired decommissioning trust funds that are funded in accordance with nrc regulations. assets in these trust funds are subject to market fluctuations, will yield uncertain returns that may fall below projected return rates, and may result in losses resulting from the recognition of impairments of the value of certain securities held in these trust funds. as part of the pilgrim, indian point 1 and indian point 2, vermont yankee, and palisades/big rock point purchases, the former owners transferred decommissioning trust funds, along with the liability to decommission the plants, to the respective entergy wholesale commodities nuclear power plant owners. in addition, the former owner of indian point 3 and fitzpatrick retained the decommissioning trusts and related liability to decommission these plants, but had the right to require the respective entergy wholesale commodities nuclear plant owners to assume the decommissioning liability provided that it assigned the funds in the corresponding decommissioning trust, up to a specified level, to such owners. alternatively, the former owner could have contracted with entergy nuclear, inc. for the decommissioning work at a price equal to the funds in the corresponding decommissioning trust up to a specified amount. a request was made to the nrc for permission to transfer the indian point 3 and fitzpatrick decommissioning trusts to entergy nuclear operations, inc., which was received in january 2017. the decommissioning trusts and decommissioning liabilities for the indian point 3 and fitzpatrick plants were transferred to entergy nuclear operations, inc. by the former owner in january 2017. as part of the indian point 1 and indian point 2 purchase, the entergy wholesale commodities nuclear power plant owner also funded an additional $25 million to a supplemental decommissioning trust fund. as part of the palisades transaction, the entergy wholesale commodities business assumed responsibility for spent fuel at the decommissioned big rock point nuclear plant, which is located near charlevoix, michigan. once the spent fuel is removed from the site, the entergy wholesale commodities business will dismantle the spent fuel storage facility and complete site decommissioning. entergy is providing $5 million in credit support to provide financial assurance to the nrc for this obligation.
an early plant shutdown, poor investment results or higher than anticipated decommissioning costs could cause trust fund assets to be insufficient to meet the decommissioning obligations, with the result that the entergy wholesale commodities nuclear plant owners may be required to provide additional funds or credit support to satisfy regulatory requirements for decommissioning. for further information regarding nuclear decommissioning costs, see the "

table of contents part i item 1a & 1b entergy corporation, utility operating companies, and system energy changes in nrc regulations or other binding regulatory requirements may cause increased funding requirements for nuclear plant decommissioning trusts.
nrc regulations require certain minimum financial assurance requirements for meeting obligations to decommission nuclear power plants. those financial assurance requirements may change from time to time, and certain changes may result in a material increase in the financial assurance required for decommissioning the utility operating companies', system energy's, and owners of entergy wholesale commodities nuclear power plants. such changes could result in the need for additional contributions to decommissioning trusts, or the posting of parent guarantees, letters of credit, or other surety mechanisms. for further information regarding nuclear decommissioning costs, see the "

new and existing concerns are being expressed in public forums about the safety of nuclear generating units and nuclear fuel, in particular in the northeastern united states, which is where most of the current fleet of entergy wholesale commodities nuclear power plants is located. these concerns have led to, and are expected to continue to lead to, various proposals to federal regulators and governing bodies in some localities where entergy's subsidiaries own nuclear generating units for legislative and regulatory changes that could lead to the shutdown of nuclear units, denial of license renewal applications, restrictions on nuclear units as a result of unavailability of sites for spent nuclear fuel storage and disposal, or other adverse effects on owning, operating and decommissioning nuclear generating units. entergy vigorously responds to these concerns and proposals. if any of the existing proposals, or any proposals that may arise in the future with respect to legislative and regulatory changes, become effective, they could have a material effect on entergy's results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.
a failure to obtain renewed licenses or other approvals required for the continued operation of the entergy wholesale commodities' indian point nuclear power plants could have a material effect on entergy's results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity and could lead to an increase in depreciation rates or an acceleration of the timing for the funding of decommissioning obligations.
the license renewal and related processes for the entergy wholesale commodities' indian point nuclear power plants have been and may continue to be the subject of significant public debate and regulatory and legislative review and scrutiny at the federal and, in certain cases, state level. the original expiration date of the operating license for indian point 2 was september 2013 and the original expiration date of the operating license for indian point 3
was december 2015. because these plants filed timely license renewal applications, the nrc's rules provide that these plants may continue to operate under their existing operating licenses until their renewal applications have been finally determined. various parties have expressed opposition to renewal of these licenses. renewal of the indian point licenses is the subject of ongoing proceedings before the atomic safety and licensing board (aslb) of the nrc and, with respect to issues resolved by the aslb, before the nrc on appeal.
the new york state department of environmental conservation has taken the position that indian point 2 and indian point 3 must obtain a new state-issued clean water act section 401 water quality certification as part of the license renewal process. in addition, before the nrc may issue renewed operating licenses it must resolve its obligation to address the requirements of the coastal zone management act (czma). for further information regarding these environmental regulations see the "

if the nrc finally denies the applications for the renewal of operating licenses for the indian point nuclear power plants, or if indian point fails to obtain other approvals, entergy's results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity could be materially affected by loss of revenue and cash flow associated with the plant or plants until the proposed shutdown date, potential impairments of the carrying value of the plants, increased depreciation rates, and an accelerated need for decommissioning funds, which could require additional funding. in addition, entergy may incur increased operating costs depending on any conditions that may be imposed in connection with license renewal. for further discussion regarding the license renewal processes for the indian point nuclear power plants, see the " entergy wholesale commodities authorizations to operate its nuclear plants " in entergy corporation and subsidiaries management's financial discussion and analysis.
the decommissioning trust fund assets for the nuclear power plants owned by entergy wholesale commodities nuclear plant owners may not be adequate to meet decommissioning obligations if one or more of their nuclear power plants is retired earlier than the anticipated shutdown date, the plants cost more to decommission than estimated, or if current regulatory requirements change, which then could require additional funding.
under nrc regulations, entergy wholesale commodities' nuclear subsidiaries are permitted to project the nrc-
required decommissioning amount, based on an nrc formula or a site-specific estimate, and the amount in each of the entergy wholesale commodities nuclear power plant's decommissioning trusts combined with other decommissioning financial assurances in place. the projections are made based on the operating license expiration date and the mid-
point of the subsequent decommissioning process, or the anticipated actual completion of decommissioning if a site-
specific estimate is used, for each of these nuclear power plants. as a result, if the projected amount of individual plants' decommissioning trusts exceeds the nrc-required decommissioning amount, then its decommissioning obligations are considered to be funded in accordance with nrc regulations. if the projected costs do not sufficiently reflect the actual costs the applicable entergy subsidiaries would be required to incur to decommission these nuclear power plants, or funding is otherwise inadequate, or if the formula, formula inputs, or site-specific estimate is changed to require increased funding, additional resources would be required.
furthermore, depending upon the level of funding available in the trust funds, the nrc may not permit the trust funds to be used to pay for related costs such as the management of spent nuclear fuel that are not included in the nrc's formula. the nrc may also require a plan for the provision of separate funding for spent fuel management costs. in addition to nrc requirements, there are other decommissioning-related obligations for certain of the entergy wholesale commodities nuclear power plants, which management believes it will be able to satisfy.
entergy wholesale commodities subsidiaries have announced plans to sell the fitzpatrick nuclear power plant and shut down the pilgrim, palisades, indian point 2 and indian point 3 nuclear power plants earlier than the respective license expiration date of the plants (or the license expiration date assuming 20 year renewed licenses for indian point 2 and indian point 3). as discussed previously, the former owner of indian point 3 and fitzpatrick retained the decommissioning trusts and related liability to decommission these plants, but had the right to require the respective entergy wholesale commodities nuclear plant owners to assume the decommissioning liability provided that it assigned the funds in the corresponding decommissioning trust, up to a specified level, to such owners. alternatively, the former owner could have contracted with entergy nuclear, inc. for the decommissioning work at a price equal to the funds in the corresponding decommissioning trust up to a specified amount. a request was made to the nrc for permission to transfer the indian point 3 and fitzpatrick decommissioning trusts to entergy nuclear operations, inc., which was received in january 2017. the decommissioning trusts and decommissioning liabilities for the indian point 3 and fitzpatrick plants were transferred to entergy nuclear operations, inc. by the former owner in january 2017. as part of the indian point 1 and indian point 2 purchase, the entergy wholesale commodities nuclear power plant owner also funded an additional $25 million to a supplemental decommissioning trust fund. if decommissioning of these
table of contents part i item 1a & 1b entergy corporation, utility operating companies, and system energy plants were conducted without the full benefit of a safe storage period, or if funding is otherwise inadequate for an earlier decommissioning, the applicable entergy subsidiary may be unable to rely upon only the decommissioning trust to fund the entire decommissioning obligation, which would require it to obtain funding from other sources.
vermont yankee submitted notification of permanent cessation of operations and permanent removal of fuel from the reactor in january 2015 after final shutdown in december 2014. the post shutdown decommissioning activities report for vermont yankee, including a site specific cost estimate, was submitted to the nrc in december 2014. vermont yankee's future certifications to satisfy the nrc's financial assurance requirements will now be based on the site specific cost estimate, including the estimated cost of managing spent fuel, rather than the nrc minimum formula for estimating decommissioning costs. entergy expects that amounts available in vermont yankee's decommissioning trust fund, including expected earnings, together with the credit facilities entered into in january 2015 that are expected to be repaid with recoveries from doe litigation related to spent fuel storage, will be sufficient to cover expected costs of decommissioning, spent fuel management costs, and site restoration. future nrc filings will determine whether any other financial assurance may be required, including additional funding for spent fuel management, which will be required until the federal government takes possession of the fuel and removes it from the site, per its current obligation. in june 2015 the nrc granted an exemption allowing use of vermont yankee's decommissioning trust funds for operational spent fuel management activities at that site. in august 2015, vermont and two vermont utilities filed a petition in the u.s. court of appeals for the d.c. circuit challenging the nrc's issuance of that exemption. in february 2016 the court dismissed the petition as premature because vermont and the utilities had requested the nrc to reconsider a number of issues related to vermont yankee's use of the decommissioning trust fund including use to pay for spent fuel management expenses pursuant to the exemption granted in june 2015. in october 2016 the nrc denied vermont's and the utilities' request for a hearing and other relief ,
including their challenge to the propriety of the exemption's issuance, but directed the nrc staff to conduct an assessment of any environmental impacts associated with the exemption. in november 2016, entergy announced that it has entered into a purchase and sale agreement with northstar group services, inc. to sell to a northstar subsidiary 100% of the membership interests in entergy nuclear vermont yankee, the owner of the vermont yankee plant. the sale of entergy nuclear vermont yankee to northstar will include the transfer of entergy nuclear vermont yankee's nuclear decommissioning trust and its obligations for spent fuel management and decommissioning and is subject to regulatory approvals and other closing conditions. see the " entergy wholesale commodities exit from the merchant power business
" section of management's financial discussion and analysis for entergy corporation and subsidiaries and note 14 to the financial statements for further information about the agreement to sell entergy nuclear vermont yankee to a subsidiary of northstar.
further, federal or state regulatory changes, including mandated increases in decommissioning funding or changes in the methods or standards for decommissioning operations, may also increase the funding requirements of, or accelerate the timing for funding of, the obligations related to the decommissioning of entergy wholesale commodities nuclear power plants or may restrict the decommissioning-related costs that can be paid from the decommissioning trusts. as a result, under any of these circumstances, entergy's results of operations, liquidity, and financial condition could be materially affected.
entergy wholesale commodities nuclear power plants are exposed to price risk.
entergy and its subsidiaries do not have a regulator-authorized rate of return on their capital investments in non-
utility businesses. in particular, the sale of capacity and energy from the entergy wholesale commodities nuclear power plants, unless otherwise contracted, is subject to the fluctuation of market power prices. in order to reduce future price risk to desired levels, entergy wholesale commodities utilizes contracts that are unit-contingent and firm ld and various products such as forward sales, options, and collars. as of december 31, 2016, entergy wholesale commodities' nuclear power generation plants had sold forward 87% in 2017, 56% in 2018, and 5% in 2019 of its generation portfolio's planned energy output, reflecting the planned shutdown or sale of the entergy wholesale commodities nuclear power plants by 2021.
table of contents part i item 1a & 1b entergy corporation, utility operating companies, and system energy market conditions such as product cost, market liquidity, and other portfolio considerations influence the product and contractual mix. the obligations under unit-contingent agreements depend on a generating asset that is operating; if the generation asset is not operating, the seller generally is not liable for damages. for some unit-
contingent obligations, however, there is also a guarantee of availability that provides for the payment to the power purchaser of contract damages, if incurred, in the event the unit owner fails to deliver power as a result of the failure of the specified generation unit to generate power at or above a specified availability threshold. firm ld sales transactions may be exposed to substantial operational price risk, a portion of which may be capped through the use of risk management products, to the extent that the plants do not run as expected and market prices exceed contract prices.
market prices may fluctuate substantially, sometimes over relatively short periods of time, and at other times experience sustained increases or decreases. demand for electricity and its fuel stock can fluctuate dramatically, creating periods of substantial under- or over-supply. during periods of over-supply, prices might be depressed.
also, from time to time there may be political pressure, or pressure from regulatory authorities with jurisdiction over wholesale and retail energy commodity and transportation rates, to impose price limitations, credit requirements, bidding rules and other mechanisms to address volatility and other issues in these markets.
the effects of sustained low natural gas prices and power market structure challenges have resulted in lower market prices for electricity in the power regions where the entergy wholesale commodities nuclear power plants are located. in addition, currently the market design under which the plants operate does not adequately compensate merchant nuclear plants for their environmental and fuel diversity benefits in the region. these conditions were primary factors leading to entergy's decision to shut down (or sell) entergy wholesale commodities' nuclear power plants before the end of their operating licenses (or requested operating licenses for indian point 2 and indian point 3).
the price that different counterparties offer for various products including forward sales is influenced both by market conditions as well as the contract terms such as damage provisions, credit support requirements, and the number of available counterparties interested in contracting for the desired forward period. depending on differences between market factors at the time of contracting versus current conditions, entergy wholesale commodities' contract portfolio may have average contract prices above or below current market prices, including at the expiration of the contracts, which may significantly affect entergy wholesale commodities' results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity. new hedges are generally layered into on a rolling forward basis, which tends to drive hedge over-performance to market in a falling price environment, and hedge underperformance to market in a rising price environment; however, hedge timing, product choice, and hedging costs will also affect these results. see the "
market and credit risk sensitive instruments
" section of management's financial discussion and analysis for entergy corporation and subsidiaries. since entergy wholesale commodities has announced the closure (or sale) of its nuclear plants, entergy wholesale commodities may enter into fewer forward sales contracts for output from such plants.
among the factors that could affect market prices for electricity and fuel, all of which are beyond entergy's control to a significant degree, are:
prevailing market prices for natural gas, uranium (and its conversion, enrichment, and fabrication), coal,
•  oil, and other fuels used in electric generation plants, including associated transportation costs, and supplies of such commodities;
•  seasonality and realized weather deviations compared to normalized weather forecasts;
•  availability of competitively priced alternative energy sources and the requirements of a renewable portfolio standard;
•  changes in production and storage levels of natural gas, lignite, coal and crude oil, and refined products;
•  liquidity in the general wholesale electricity market, including the number of creditworthy counterparties available and interested in entering into forward sales agreements for entergy's full hedging term;
the actions of external parties, such as the ferc and local independent system operators and other state or
•  federal energy regulatory bodies, that may impose price limitations and other mechanisms to address some of the volatility in the energy markets;
•  electricity transmission, competing generation or fuel transportation constraints, inoperability, or inefficiencies;
table of contents part i item 1a & 1b entergy corporation, utility operating companies, and system energy
•  the general demand for electricity, which may be significantly affected by national and regional economic conditions;
•  weather conditions affecting demand for electricity or availability of hydroelectric power or fuel supplies;
•  the rate of growth in demand for electricity as a result of population changes, regional economic conditions, and the implementation of conservation programs or distributed generation;
•  regulatory policies of state agencies that affect the willingness of entergy wholesale commodities customers to enter into long-term contracts generally, and contracts for energy in particular;
increases in supplies due to actions of current entergy wholesale commodities competitors or new market
•  entrants, including the development of new generation facilities, expansion of existing generation facilities, the disaggregation of vertically integrated utilities, and improvements in transmission that allow additional supply to reach entergy wholesale commodities' nuclear markets;
changes in federal and state energy and environmental laws and regulations and other initiatives, such as
•  the regional greenhouse gas initiative, including but not limited to, the price impacts of proposed emission controls;
•  changes in law resulting from federal or state energy legislation or legislation subjecting energy derivatives used in hedging and risk management transactions to governmental regulation; and
•  natural disasters, terrorist actions, wars, embargoes, and other catastrophic events.
the entergy wholesale commodities business is subject to substantial governmental regulation and may be adversely affected by legislative, regulatory or market design changes, as well as liability under, or any future inability to comply with, existing or future regulations or requirements.
the entergy wholesale commodities business is subject to extensive federal, state, and local laws and regulation.
compliance with the requirements under these various regulatory regimes may cause the entergy wholesale commodities business to incur significant additional costs, and failure to comply with such requirements could result in the shutdown of the non-complying facility, the imposition of liens, fines and/or civil or criminal liability.
public utilities under the federal power act are required to obtain ferc acceptance of their rate schedules for wholesale sales of electricity. each of the owners of the entergy wholesale commodities nuclear power plants that generates electricity, as well as entergy nuclear power marketing, llc, is a "public utility" under the federal power act by virtue of making wholesale sales of electric energy and/or owning wholesale electric transmission facilities. the ferc has granted these generating and power marketing companies the authority to sell electricity at market-based rates. the ferc's orders that grant the entergy wholesale commodities' generating and power marketing companies market-based rate authority reserve the right to revoke or revise that authority if the ferc subsequently determines that the entergy wholesale commodities business can exercise market power in transmission or generation, create barriers to entry, or engage in abusive affiliate transactions. in addition, the entergy wholesale commodities' market-based sales are subject to certain market behavior rules, and if any of its generating and power marketing companies were deemed to have violated one of those rules, they would be subject to potential disgorgement of profits associated with the violation and/or suspension or revocation of their market-
based rate authority and potential penalties of up to $1 million per day per violation. if the entergy wholesale commodities' generating or power marketing companies were to lose their market-based rate authority, such companies would be required to obtain the ferc's acceptance of a cost-of-service rate schedule and could become subject to the accounting, record-keeping, and reporting requirements that are imposed on utilities with cost-based rate schedules. this could have an adverse effect on the rates the entergy wholesale commodities business charges for power from its facilities.
the entergy wholesale commodities business is also affected by legislative and regulatory changes, as well as changes to market design, market rules, tariffs, cost allocations, and bidding rules imposed by the existing independent system operators. the independent system operators that oversee most of the wholesale power markets impose, and in the future may continue to impose, mitigation, including price limitations, offer caps and other mechanisms, to address some of the volatility and the potential exercise of market power in these markets. these types of price limitations and other regulatory mechanisms may have an adverse effect on the profitability of the entergy wholesale
table of contents part i item 1a & 1b entergy corporation, utility operating companies, and system energy commodities business' generation facilities that sell energy and capacity into the wholesale power markets. for further information regarding federal, state and local laws and regulation applicable to the entergy wholesale commodities business, see the "
regulation of entergy's business
" section in part i, item 1.
the regulatory environment applicable to the electric power industry is subject to changes as a result of restructuring initiatives at both the state and federal levels. entergy cannot predict the future design of the wholesale power markets or the ultimate effect that the changing regulatory environment will have on the entergy wholesale commodities business. in addition, in some of these markets, interested parties have proposed material market design changes, including the elimination of a single clearing price mechanism and have raised claims that the competitive marketplace is not working because energy prices in wholesale markets exceed the marginal cost of operating nuclear power plants, as well as proposals to re-regulate the markets, impose a generation tax, or require divestitures by generating companies to reduce their market share. other proposals to re-regulate may be made and legislative or other attention to the electric power market restructuring process may delay or reverse the deregulation process, which could require material changes to business planning models. if competitive restructuring of the electric power markets is reversed, modified, discontinued, or delayed, the entergy wholesale commodities business' results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity could be materially affected.
the power plants owned by the entergy wholesale commodities business are subject to impairment charges in certain circumstances, which could have a material effect on entergy's results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.
entergy reviews long-lived assets held in all of its business segments whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that recoverability of these assets is uncertain. generally, the determination of recoverability is based on the undiscounted net cash flows expected to result from the operations of such assets. projected net cash flows depend on the expected operating life of the assets, the future operating costs associated with the assets, the efficiency and availability of the assets and generating units, and the future market and price for energy and capacity over the remaining life of the assets. in particular, the assets of the entergy wholesale commodities business are subject to further impairment in connection with the closure or sale of the plants discussed below.
moreover, prior to the closure or sale of these plants, the failure of the entergy wholesale commodities business to achieve forecasted operating results and cash flows, an unfavorable change in forecasted operating results or cash flows, a reduction in the expected remaining useful life of a unit (including if the operating licenses for the indian point power plants are not renewed by the nrc), or a decline in observable industry market multiples could all result in potential additional impairment charges for the affected assets.
on august 27, 2013, entergy announced its plan to close and decommission vermont yankee. vermont yankee ceased power production in the fourth quarter 2014 at the end of a fuel cycle. this decision was approved by the board in august 2013, and resulted in the recognition of impairment charges in 2013 and 2014. in october 2015, entergy determined that it will close the pilgrim and fitzpatrick plants. the pilgrim plant will cease operations no later than june 1, 2019. fitzpatrick was expected to shut down at the end of its current fuel cycle, planned for january
27, 2017, but in august 2016, entergy entered into an agreement to sell the fitzpatrick plant to exelon generation company, llc which will continue to operate the plant. during the third quarter 2015, entergy recorded impairment and other related charges to write down the carrying values of the fitzpatrick and pilgrim plants and related assets to their fair values. in addition, in the fourth quarter 2015, entergy recorded impairment and other related charges to write down the carrying value of the palisades plant and related assets to their fair value. in december
2016, entergy reached an agreement with consumers energy to terminate the ppa for the palisades plant in 2018. if the agreement receives regulatory approval, palisades will shut down in 2018. in january 2017, entergy announced that it reached a settlement with new york state and plans to close the indian point 2 plant in 2020 and the indian point 3 plant in 2021. as a result, in the fourth quarter of 2016, entergy recorded impairment and other related charges to write down the carrying values of the palisades and indian point 2 and indian point 3 plants and related assets to their fair value. in addition to the impairments and other related charges, entergy has incurred severance and employee retention costs and expects to incur additional charges through 2021 relating to the decisions to shut down vermont yankee, palisades, pilgrim, indian point 2 and indian point 3, and the decision to sell fitzpatrick.
table of contents part i item 1a & 1b entergy corporation, utility operating companies, and system energy if entergy concludes that any of its nuclear power plants is unlikely to operate through its current useful life, which conclusion would be based on a variety of factors, such a conclusion could result in a further impairment of part or all of the carrying value of the plant. any impairment charge taken by entergy with respect to its long-
lived assets, including the power plants owned by the entergy wholesale commodities business, would likely be material in the quarter that the charge is taken and could otherwise have a material effect on entergy's results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity. for further information regarding evaluating long-lived assets for impairment, see the "
critical accounting estimates
- impairment of long-lived assets and trust fund investments " section of management's financial discussion and analysis for entergy corporation and subsidiaries and for further discussion of the impairment charges, see note 14
to the financial statements.
general business
entergy and the utility operating companies depend on access to the capital markets and, at times, may face potential liquidity constraints, which could make it more difficult to handle future contingencies such as natural disasters or substantial increases in gas and fuel prices. disruptions in the capital and credit markets may adversely affect entergy's and its subsidiaries' ability to meet liquidity needs, access capital and operate and grow their businesses, and the cost of capital.
entergy's business is capital intensive and dependent upon its ability to access capital at reasonable rates and other terms. at times there are also spikes in the price for natural gas and other commodities that increase the liquidity requirements of the utility operating companies and entergy wholesale commodities. in addition, entergy's and the utility operating companies' liquidity needs could significantly increase in the event of a hurricane or other weather-related or unforeseen disaster similar to that experienced in entergy's service territory with hurricane katrina and hurricane rita in 2005, hurricane gustav and hurricane ike in 2008, and hurricane isaac in
2012. the occurrence of one or more contingencies, including a delay in regulatory recovery of fuel or purchased power costs or storm restoration costs, higher than expected pension contributions, an acceleration of payments or decreased credit lines, less cash flow from operations than expected, or other unknown events, such as future storms, could cause the financing needs of entergy and its subsidiaries to increase. in addition, accessing the debt capital markets more frequently in these situations may result in an increase in leverage. material leverage increases could negatively affect the credit ratings of entergy and the utility operating companies, which in turn could negatively affect access to the capital markets.
the inability to raise capital on favorable terms, particularly during times of uncertainty in the capital markets, could negatively affect entergy and its subsidiaries' ability to maintain and to expand their businesses. events beyond entergy's control, such as the volatility and disruption in global capital and credit markets in 2008 and
2009, may create uncertainty that could increase its cost of capital or impair its ability to access the capital markets, including the ability to draw on its bank credit facilities. entergy and its subsidiaries are unable to predict the degree of success they will have in renewing or replacing their credit facilities as they come up for renewal. moreover, the size, terms, and covenants of any new credit facilities may not be comparable to, and may be more restrictive than, existing facilities. if entergy and its subsidiaries are unable to access the credit and capital markets on terms that are reasonable, they may have to delay raising capital, issue shorter-term securities and/or bear an unfavorable cost of capital, which, in turn, could impact their ability to grow their businesses, decrease earnings, significantly reduce financial flexibility and/or limit entergy corporation's ability to sustain its current common stock dividend level.

s or its subsidiaries
' credit ratings could negatively affect entergy corporation
s and its subsidiaries
ability to access capital and/or could require entergy corporation or its subsidiaries to post collateral, accelerate certain payments, or repay certain indebtedness.
there are a number of factors that rating agencies evaluate to arrive at credit ratings for each of entergy corporation and the registrant subsidiaries, including each registrant's regulatory framework, ability to recover costs and earn returns, diversification and financial strength and liquidity. if one or more rating agencies downgrade entergy corporation's, any of the utility operating companies', or system energy's ratings, particularly below investment grade, borrowing costs would increase, the potential pool of investors and funding sources would likely decrease, and cash or letter of credit collateral demands may be triggered by the terms of a number of commodity contracts, leases, and other agreements.
most of entergy corporation's and its subsidiaries' large customers, suppliers, and counterparties require sufficient creditworthiness to enter into transactions. if entergy corporation's or its subsidiaries' ratings decline, particularly below investment grade, or if certain counterparties believe entergy corporation or the utility operating companies are losing creditworthiness and demand adequate assurance under fuel, gas, and purchased power contracts, the counterparties may require posting of collateral in cash or letters of credit, prepayment for fuel, gas or purchased power or accelerated payment, or counterparties may decline business with entergy corporation or its subsidiaries. at december 31, 2016, based on power prices at that time, entergy had liquidity exposure of $128 million under the guarantees in place supporting entergy wholesale commodities transactions and $8 million of posted cash collateral. in the event of a decrease in entergy corporation's credit rating to below investment grade, based on power prices as of december 31, 2016, entergy would have been required to provide approximately $57 million of additional cash or letters of credit under some of the agreements. in the event of a decrease in the credit ratings of entergy's utility operating companies to below investment grade, those companies collectively could be required to provide up to $50 million of additional cash or letters of credit to miso. as of december 31, 2016, the liquidity exposure associated with entergy wholesale commodities assurance requirements, including return of previously received collateral from counterparties, would increase by $238
million for a $1 per mmbtu increase in gas prices in both the short- and long-term markets.
entergy and its subsidiaries' ability to successfully complete strategic transactions, including merger, acquisition, divestiture, joint venture, restructuring or other strategic transactions, is subject to significant risks, including the risk that required regulatory or governmental approvals may not be obtained, risks relating to unknown or undisclosed problems or liabilities, and the risk that for these or other reasons, entergy and its subsidiaries may be unable to achieve some or all of the benefits that they anticipate from such transactions.
from time to time, entergy and its subsidiaries have pursued and may continue to pursue strategic transactions including merger, acquisition, divestiture, joint venture, restructuring or other strategic transactions. in particular, as discussed in the " entergy wholesale commodities exit from the merchant power business " section of management's financial discussion and analysis for entergy corporation and subsidiaries, in august 2016, entergy entered into an agreement to sell the fitzpatrick plant to exelon generation company, llc. further, in november
2016, entergy announced that it has entered into a purchase and sale agreement with northstar for the sale of 100%
of the membership interests in entergy nuclear vermont yankee, which owns the vermont yankee plant. in addition, as part of entergy's plan to exit the merchant power business, it plans to shut down its remaining merchant nuclear power plants by 2021. these transactions are subject to regulatory approval and other material conditions or contingencies. the failure to complete these transactions or any future strategic transaction successfully or on a timely basis could have an adverse effect on entergy's financial condition, results of operations and the market's perception of entergy's ability to execute its strategy. further, these transactions, and any completed or future strategic transactions, involve substantial risks, including the following:
table of contents part i item 1a & 1b entergy corporation, utility operating companies, and system energy the disposition of a business or asset may involve continued financial involvement in the divested business,
•  such as through continuing equity ownership, transition service agreements, guarantees, indemnities, or other current or contingent financial obligations;
entergy may encounter difficulty in finding buyers or executing alternative exit strategies on acceptable terms in a timely manner when it decides to sell an asset or a business, which could delay the
•  accomplishment of its strategic objectives. alternatively, entergy may dispose of a business or asset at a price or on terms that are less than what it had anticipated, or with the exclusion of assets that must be divested or run off separately;
•  the disposition of a business could result in impairments and related write-offs of the carrying values of the relevant assets;
•  acquired businesses or assets may not produce revenues, earnings or cash flow at anticipated levels;
•  acquired businesses or assets could have environmental, permitting or other problems for which contractual protections prove inadequate;
•  entergy and/or its subsidiaries may assume liabilities that were not disclosed to them, that exceed their estimates, or for which their rights to indemnification from the seller are limited;
•  the disposition of a business, including entergy's planned exit from the merchant power business, could divert management's attention from other business concerns;
entergy and/or its subsidiaries may be unable to obtain the necessary regulatory or governmental approvals
•  to close a transaction, such approvals may be granted subject to terms that are unacceptable to them, or entergy or its subsidiaries otherwise may be unable to achieve anticipated regulatory treatment of any such transaction or acquired business or assets; and
•  entergy or its subsidiaries otherwise may be unable to achieve the full strategic and financial benefits that they anticipate from the transaction, or such benefits may be delayed or may not occur at all.
entergy may not be successful in managing these or any other significant risks that it may encounter in acquiring or divesting a business, or engaging in other strategic transactions, which could have a material adverse effect on its business.
the construction of, and capital improvements to, power generation facilities involve substantial risks. should construction or capital improvement efforts be unsuccessful, the financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity of entergy and the utility operating companies could be materially affected.
entergy's and the utility operating companies' ability to complete construction of power generation facilities in a timely manner and within budget is contingent upon many variables and subject to substantial risks. these variables include, but are not limited to, project management expertise and escalating costs for materials, labor, and environmental compliance. delays in obtaining permits, shortages in materials and qualified labor, suppliers and contractors not performing as required under their contracts, changes in the scope and timing of projects, poor quality initial cost estimates from contractors, the inability to raise capital on favorable terms, changes in commodity prices affecting revenue, fuel costs, or materials costs, downward changes in the economy, changes in law or regulation, including environmental compliance requirements, and other events beyond the control of the utility operating companies or the entergy wholesale commodities business may occur that may materially affect the schedule, cost, and performance of these projects. if these projects are significantly delayed or become subject to cost overruns or cancellation, entergy and the utility operating companies could incur additional costs and termination payments, or face increased risk of potential write-off of the investment in the project. in addition, the utility operating companies could be exposed to higher costs and market volatility, which could affect cash flow and cost recovery, should their respective regulators decline to approve the construction of new generation needed to meet the reliability needs of customers at the lowest reasonable cost. for further information regarding capital expenditure plans and other uses of capital in connection with the potential construction of additional generation supply sources within the utility operating companies' service territory, and as to the entergy wholesale commodities business, see the " capital expenditure plans and other uses of capital " section of management's financial discussion and analysis for entergy and each of the registrant subsidiaries.
table of contents part i item 1a & 1b entergy corporation, utility operating companies, and system energy the utility operating companies, system energy, and the entergy wholesale commodities business may incur substantial costs to fulfill their obligations related to environmental and other matters.
the businesses in which the utility operating companies, system energy, and the entergy wholesale commodities business operate are subject to extensive environmental regulation by local, state, and federal authorities. these laws and regulations affect the manner in which the utility operating companies, system energy, and the entergy wholesale commodities business conduct their operations and make capital expenditures. these laws and regulations also affect how the utility operating companies, system energy, and the entergy wholesale commodities business manage air emissions, discharges to water, wetlands impacts, solid and hazardous waste storage and disposal, cooling and service water intake, the protection of threatened and endangered species, hazardous materials transportation, and similar matters. federal, state, and local authorities continually revise these laws and regulations, and the laws and regulations are subject to judicial interpretation and to the permitting and enforcement discretion vested in the implementing agencies. developing and implementing plans for facility compliance with these requirements can lead to capital, personnel, and operation and maintenance expenditures.
violations of these requirements can subject the utility operating companies, system energy, and the entergy wholesale commodities business to enforcement actions, capital expenditures to bring existing facilities into compliance, additional operating costs or operating restrictions to achieve compliance, remediation and clean-up costs, civil penalties, and exposure to third parties' claims for alleged health or property damages or for violations of applicable permits or standards. in addition, the utility operating companies, system energy, and the entergy wholesale commodities business potentially are subject to liability under these laws for the costs of remediation of environmental contamination of property now or formerly owned or operated by the utility operating companies, system energy, and entergy wholesale commodities and of property contaminated by hazardous substances they generate. the utility operating companies are currently involved in proceedings relating to sites where hazardous substances have been released and may be subject to additional proceedings in the future. the utility operating companies, system energy, and the entergy wholesale commodities business have incurred and expect to incur significant costs related to environmental compliance.
emissions of nitrogen and sulfur oxides, mercury, particulates, greenhouse gases, and other regulated air emissions from generating plants are potentially subject to increased regulation, controls and mitigation expenses. in addition, existing air regulations and programs promulgated by the epa often are challenged legally, sometimes resulting in large-scale changes to anticipated regulatory regimes and the resulting need to shift course, both operationally and economically, depending on the nature of the changes. risks relating to global climate change, initiatives to compel greenhouse gas emission reductions, and water availability issues are discussed below.
entergy and its subsidiaries may not be able to obtain or maintain all required environmental regulatory approvals.
if there is a delay in obtaining any required environmental regulatory approvals, or if entergy and its subsidiaries fail to obtain, maintain, or comply with any such approval, the operation of its facilities could be stopped or become subject to additional costs. for further information regarding environmental regulation and environmental matters, see the "
s business
- environmental regulation
" section of part i, item 1.
the utility operating companies, system energy, and the entergy wholesale commodities business may incur substantial costs related to reliability standards.
entergy's business is subject to extensive and mandatory reliability standards. such standards, which are established by the north american electric reliability corporation (nerc), the serc reliability corporation (serc), and other regional enforcement entities, are approved by the ferc and frequently are reviewed, amended, and supplemented. failure to comply with such standards could result in the imposition of fines or civil penalties, and potential exposure to third party claims for alleged violations of such standards. the standards, as well as the laws and regulations that govern them, are subject to judicial interpretation and to the enforcement discretion vested in the implementing agencies. in addition to exposure to civil penalties and fines, the utility operating companies have incurred and expect to incur significant costs related to compliance with new and existing reliability standards, including costs associated with the utility operating companies' transmission system and generation assets. the changes to the
table of contents part i item 1a & 1b entergy corporation, utility operating companies, and system energy reliability standards applicable to the electric power industry are ongoing, and entergy cannot predict the ultimate effect that the reliability standards will have on its utility and entergy wholesale commodities.
the effects of weather and economic conditions, and the related impact on electricity and gas usage, may materially affect the utility operating companies
temperatures above normal levels in the summer tend to increase electric cooling demand and revenues, and temperatures below normal levels in the winter tend to increase electric and gas heating demand and revenues. as a corollary, moderate temperatures in either season tend to decrease usage of energy and resulting revenues. seasonal pricing differentials, coupled with higher consumption levels, typically cause the utility operating companies to report higher revenues in the third quarter of the fiscal year than in the other quarters. extreme weather conditions or storms, however, may stress the utility operating companies' generation facilities and transmission and distribution systems, resulting in increased maintenance and capital costs (and potential increased financing needs), limits on their ability to meet peak customer demand, increased regulatory oversight, and lower customer satisfaction. these extreme conditions could have a material effect on the utility operating companies' financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity.
entergy's electricity sales volumes are affected by a number of factors, including economic conditions, weather, customer bill sizes (large bills tend to induce conservation), trends in energy efficiency, new technologies and self generation alternatives, including the willingness and ability of large industrial customers to develop co-
generation facilities that greatly reduce their demand from entergy. some of these factors are inherently cyclical or temporary in nature, such as the weather or economic conditions, and rarely have a long-lasting effect on entergy's operating results. others, such as the increasing adoption of energy efficient appliances, new building codes, and new technologies are having a more permanent effect of reducing sales growth rates from historical norms. distributed generation has not had a substantive impact on entergy's electricity sales yet, but further advances have the potential to do so in the future. electricity sales to industrial customers, in particular, benefit from steady economic growth and favorable commodity prices and are also sensitive to changes in conditions in the markets in which its customers operate. any negative change in any of these or other factors has the potential to result in slower sales growth or sales declines and increased bad debt expense, which could materially affect entergy's and the utility operating companies' results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.
the effects of climate change and environmental and regulatory obligations intended to compel greenhouse gas emission reductions or to place a price on greenhouse gas emissions could materially affect the financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity of entergy, the utility operating companies, system energy, and the entergy wholesale commodities business.
in an effort to address climate change concerns, federal, state, and local authorities are calling for additional laws and regulations aimed at known or suspected causes of climate change. for example, in response to the united states supreme court's 2007 decision holding that the epa has authority to regulate emissions of co2 and other
"greenhouse gases" under the clean air act, the epa, various environmental interest groups, and other organizations are focusing considerable attention on co2 emissions from power generation facilities and their potential role in climate change. in 2010, epa promulgated its first regulations controlling greenhouse gas emissions from certain vehicles and from new and significantly modified stationary sources of emissions, including electric generating units. during 2012 and 2014, epa proposed co2 emission standards for new and existing sources; epa finalized these standards in 2015. as examples of state action, in the northeast, the regional greenhouse gas initiative (rggi)
establishes a cap on co2 emissions from electric power plants and requires generators to purchase emission permits to cover their co2 emissions, and a similar program has been developed in california. the impact that recent changes in the federal government will have on existing and pending environmental laws and regulations related to greenhouse gas emissions is currently unclear.
table of contents part i item 1a & 1b entergy corporation, utility operating companies, and system energy developing and implementing plans for compliance with greenhouse gas emissions reduction requirements can lead to additional capital, personnel, and operation and maintenance expenditures and could significantly affect the economic position of existing facilities and proposed projects; moreover, long-term planning to meet environmental requirements can be negatively impacted and costs may increase to the extent laws and regulations change prior to full implementation. these requirements could, in turn, lead to changes in the planning or operations of balancing authorities or organized markets in areas where the utility operating companies, system energy, or entergy wholesale commodities do business. violations of such requirements may subject entergy wholesale commodities and the utility operating companies to enforcement actions, capital expenditures to bring existing facilities into compliance, additional operating costs or operating restrictions to achieve compliance, civil penalties, and exposure to third parties' claims for alleged health or property damages or for violations of applicable permits or standards. to the extent entergy believes any of these costs are recoverable in rates, however, additional material rate increases for customers could be resisted by entergy's regulators and, in extreme cases, entergy's regulators might deny or defer timely recovery of these costs. future changes in environmental regulation governing the emission of co2 and other greenhouse gases could make some of entergy's electric generating units uneconomical to maintain or operate, and could increase the difficulty that entergy and its subsidiaries have with obtaining or maintaining required environmental regulatory approvals, which could also materially affect the financial condition, results of operations and liquidity of entergy and its subsidiaries. in addition, lawsuits have occurred or are reasonably expected against emitters of greenhouse gases alleging that these companies are liable for personal injuries and property damage caused by climate change. these lawsuits may seek injunctive relief, monetary compensation, and punitive damages.
in addition to the regulatory and financial risks associated with climate change discussed above, potential physical risks from climate change include an increase in sea level, wind and storm surge damages, wetland and barrier island erosion, risks of flooding and changes in weather conditions, (such as increases in precipitation, drought, or changes in average temperatures), and potential increased impacts of extreme weather conditions or storms. entergy subsidiaries own assets in, and serve, communities that are at risk from sea level rise, changes in weather conditions, storms, and loss of the protection offered by coastal wetlands. a significant portion of the nation's oil and gas infrastructure is located in these areas and susceptible to storm damage that could be aggravated by wetland and barrier island erosion, which could give rise to fuel supply interruptions and price spikes. entergy and its subsidiaries also face the risk that climate change could impact the availability and quality of water supply necessary for operations.
these and other physical changes could result in changes in customer demand, increased costs associated with repairing and maintaining generation facilities and transmission and distribution systems resulting in increased maintenance and capital costs (and potential increased financing needs), limits on the entergy system's ability to meet peak customer demand, increased regulatory oversight, and lower customer satisfaction. also, to the extent that climate change adversely impacts the economic health of a region or results in energy conservation or demand side management programs, it may adversely impact customer demand and revenues. such physical or operational risks could have a material effect on entergy's, entergy wholesale commodities', system energy's, and the utility operating companies' financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity.
continued and future availability and quality of water for cooling, process, and sanitary uses could materially affect the financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity of the utility operating companies, system energy, and the entergy wholesale commodities business.
water is a vital natural resource that is also critical to the utility operating companies'
, system energy's, and entergy wholesale commodities' business operations. entergy's facilities use water for cooling, boiler make-up, sanitary uses, potable supply, and many other uses. two of entergy's utility operating companies own and/or operate hydroelectric facilities. accordingly, water availability and quality are critical to entergy's business operations. impacts to water availability or quality could negatively impact both operations and revenues.
entergy secures water through various mechanisms (ground water wells, surface waters intakes, municipal supply, etc.) and operates under the provisions and conditions set forth by the provider and/or regulatory authorities.
entergy also obtains and operates in substantial compliance with water discharge permits issued under
table of contents part i item 1a & 1b entergy corporation, utility operating companies, and system energy various provisions of the clean water act and/or state water pollution control provisions. regulations and authorizations for both water intake and use and for waste discharge can become more stringent in times of water shortages, low flows in rivers, low lake levels, low groundwater aquifer volumes, and similar conditions. the increased use of water by industry, agriculture, and the population at large, population growth, and the potential impacts of climate change on water resources may cause water use restrictions that affect entergy and its subsidiaries.
entergy and its subsidiaries may not be adequately hedged against changes in commodity prices, which could materially affect entergy's and its subsidiaries' results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.
to manage near-term financial exposure related to commodity price fluctuations, entergy and its subsidiaries, including the utility operating companies and the entergy wholesale commodities business, may enter into contracts to hedge portions of their purchase and sale commitments, fuel requirements, and inventories of natural gas, uranium and its conversion and enrichment, coal, refined products, and other commodities, within established risk management guidelines. as part of this strategy, entergy and its subsidiaries may utilize fixed- and variable-price forward physical purchase and sales contracts, futures, financial swaps, and option contracts traded in the over-
the-counter markets or on exchanges. however, entergy and its subsidiaries normally cover only a portion of the exposure of their assets and positions to market price volatility, and the coverage will vary over time. in addition, entergy also elects to leave certain volumes during certain years unhedged. to the extent entergy and its subsidiaries have unhedged positions, fluctuating commodity prices can materially affect entergy's and its subsidiaries' results of operations and financial position.
although entergy and its subsidiaries devote a considerable effort to these risk management strategies, they cannot eliminate all the risks associated with these activities. as a result of these and other factors, entergy and its subsidiaries cannot predict with precision the impact that risk management decisions may have on their business, results of operations, or financial position.
entergy has guaranteed or indemnified the performance of a portion of the obligations relating to hedging and risk management activities. reductions in entergy's or its subsidiaries' credit quality or changes in the market prices of energy commodities could increase the cash or letter of credit collateral required to be posted in connection with hedging and risk management activities, which could materially affect entergy's or its subsidiaries' liquidity and financial position.
the utility operating companies and the entergy wholesale commodities business are exposed to the risk that counterparties may not meet their obligations, which may materially affect the utility operating companies and entergy wholesale commodities.
the hedging and risk management practices of the utility operating companies and the entergy wholesale commodities business are exposed to the risk that counterparties that owe entergy and its subsidiaries money, energy, or other commodities will not perform their obligations. currently, some hedging agreements contain provisions that require the counterparties to provide credit support to secure all or part of their obligations to entergy or its subsidiaries. if the counterparties to these arrangements fail to perform, entergy or its subsidiaries may enforce and recover the proceeds from the credit support provided and acquire alternative hedging arrangements, which credit support may not always be adequate to cover the related obligations. in such event, entergy and its subsidiaries might incur losses in addition to amounts, if any, already paid to the counterparties. in addition, the credit commitments of entergy's lenders under its bank facilities may not be honored for a variety of reasons, including unexpected periods of financial distress affecting such lenders, which could materially affect the adequacy of its liquidity sources.
table of contents part i item 1a & 1b entergy corporation, utility operating companies, and system energy the wall street transparency and accountability act of 2010 and rules and regulations promulgated under the act may adversely affect the ability of the utility operating companies and the entergy wholesale commodities business to utilize certain commodity derivatives for hedging and mitigating commercial risk.
the wall street transparency and accountability act of 2010, which was enacted on july 21, 2010 as part of the dodd-frank wall street reform and consumer protection act (act), and the rules and regulations promulgated under the act impose governmental regulation on the over-the-counter derivative market, including the commodity swaps used by the utility operating companies and the entergy wholesale commodities business to hedge and mitigate commercial risk. under the act, certain swaps are subject to mandatory clearing and exchange trading requirements.
swap dealers and major market participants in the swap market are subject to capital, margin, registration, reporting, recordkeeping, and business conduct requirements with respect to their swap activities. entergy is not a swap dealer or a major swap participant, and does not expect to qualify as either in the future. non-swap dealers and non-major swap participants, such as entergy, are subject to reporting, recordkeeping, and business conduct requirements (i.e., anti-manipulation, anti-disruptive trading practices, and whistleblower provisions) with respect to their swap activities. position limits may also apply to certain swaps activities. position limit rules promulgated by the commodity futures trading commission were vacated by the us district court for the district of columbia. the commodity futures trading commission has subsequently proposed new position limit rules. if the commodity futures trading commission's issues final position limit rules, those rules may apply to certain of entergy's swaps activities.
the act required the applicable regulators, which in the case of commodity swaps will be the commodity futures trading commission, to engage in substantial rulemaking in order to implement the provisions of the act and such rulemaking has been largely completed. both the utility operating companies and the entergy wholesale commodities business currently utilize commodity swaps to hedge and mitigate commodity price risk. it is not known whether the act and regulations promulgated under the act will have an adverse effect upon the market for the commodity swaps used by the utility operating companies and the entergy wholesale commodities business. however, to the extent that the act and regulations promulgated under the act have the effect of increasing the price of such commodity swaps or limiting or reducing the availability of such commodity swaps, whether through the imposition of additional capital, margin, or compliance costs upon market participants, the imposition of position limits, or otherwise, the financial performance of the utility operating companies and/or the entergy wholesale commodities business may be adversely affected. to the extent that the utility operating companies and the entergy wholesale commodities business may be required to post margin in connection with existing or future commodity swaps in addition to any margin currently posted by such entities, such entities may need to secure additional sources of capital to meet such liquidity needs or cease utilizing such commodity swaps.
market performance and other changes may decrease the value of benefit plan assets, which then could require additional funding and result in increased benefit plan costs.
the performance of the capital markets affects the values of the assets held in trust under entergy's pension and postretirement benefit plans. a decline in the market value of the assets may increase the funding requirements relating to entergy's benefit plan liabilities and also result in higher benefit costs. as the value of the assets decreases, the "expected return on assets" component of benefit costs decreases, resulting in higher benefits costs. additionally, asset losses are incorporated into benefit costs over time, thus increasing benefits costs.
volatility in the capital markets has affected the market value of these assets, which may affect entergy's planned levels of contributions in the future. additionally, changes in interest rates affect the liabilities under entergy's pension and postretirement benefit plans; as interest rates decrease, the liabilities increase, potentially requiring additional funding and recognition of higher liability carrying costs. the funding requirements of the obligations related to the pension benefit plans can also increase as a result of changes in, among other factors, retirement rates, life expectancy assumptions, or federal regulations. for further information regarding entergy's pension and other postretirement benefit plans, refer to the "
critical accounting estimates
- qualified pension and other postretirement benefits " section of management's financial discussion and analysis for entergy and each of its registrant subsidiaries and note 11 to the financial statements.
table of contents part i item 1a & 1b entergy corporation, utility operating companies, and system energy the litigation environment in the states in which certain entergy subsidiaries operate poses a significant risk to those businesses.
entergy and its subsidiaries are involved in the ordinary course of business in a number of lawsuits involving employment, commercial, asbestos, hazardous material and ratepayer matters, and injuries and damages issues, among other matters. the states in which the utility operating companies operate, in particular louisiana, mississippi, and texas, have proven to be unusually litigious environments. judges and juries in these states have demonstrated a willingness to grant large verdicts, including punitive damages, to plaintiffs in personal injury, property damage, and business tort cases. entergy and its subsidiaries use legal and appropriate means to contest litigation threatened or filed against them, but the litigation environment in these states poses a significant business risk.
domestic or international terrorist attacks, including cyber attacks, and failures or breaches of entergy's and its subsidiaries' technology systems may adversely affect entergy's results of operations.
as power generators and distributors, entergy and its subsidiaries face heightened risk of an act or threat of terrorism, including physical and cyber attacks, either as a direct act against one of entergy's generation facilities, transmission operations centers, or distribution infrastructure used to manage and transport power to customers. an actual act could affect entergy's ability to operate, including its ability to operate the information technology systems and network infrastructure on which it relies to conduct its business. the utility operating companies also face heightened risk of an act or threat by cyber criminals, intent on accessing personal information for the purpose of committing identity theft.
entergy and its subsidiaries operate in a highly regulated industry that requires the continued operation of sophisticated information technology systems and network infrastructure in accordance with prescriptive standards.
despite the implementation of multiple layers of security by entergy and its subsidiaries, technology systems remain vulnerable to potential threats that could lead to unauthorized access or loss of availability to critical systems essential to the reliable operation of entergy's electric system. if entergy's or its subsidiaries'
technology systems were compromised and unable to recover timely to a normal state of operations, entergy or its subsidiaries may be unable to perform critical business functions that are essential to the company's well-being and the health, safety, and security needs of its customers. in addition, an attack on its information technology infrastructure may result in a loss of its confidential, sensitive, and proprietary information, including personal information of its customers, employees, vendors, and others in entergy's care.
if any such attacks, failures or breaches were to occur, entergy's and the utility operating companies' business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. the risk of such attacks, failures, or breaches may cause entergy and the utility operating companies to incur increased capital and operating costs to implement increased security for its nuclear power plants and other facilities, such as additional physical facility security and additional security personnel, and for systems to protect its information technology and network infrastructure systems. such events may also expose entergy to an increased risk of judgments and fines.
changes in taxation as well as the inherent difficulty in quantifying potential tax effects of business decisions could negatively impact entergy's, the utility operating companies', and system energy's results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
entergy and its subsidiaries make judgments regarding the potential tax effects of various transactions and results of operations to estimate their obligations to taxing authorities. these tax obligations include income, franchise, real estate, sales and use, and employment-related taxes. these judgments include provisions for potential adverse outcomes regarding tax positions that have been taken. entergy and its subsidiaries also estimate their ability to utilize tax benefits, including those in the form of carryforwards for which the benefits have already been reflected in the financial statements. changes in federal, state, or local tax laws, adverse tax audit results or adverse tax rulings on positions taken by entergy and its subsidiaries could negatively affect entergy's, the utility operating companies', and system energy's results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.
table of contents part i item 1a & 1b entergy corporation, utility operating companies, and system energy the trump administration has included as part of its agenda a potential reform of u.s. tax laws, and house republicans plan to advance their tax reform "blueprint." tax reform proposals call for, among other items, a reduction in the corporate federal income tax rate from the current 35% to as low as 15%, the immediate deduction of capital investment expenditures, and full or partial elimination of debt interest expense deductions. further, for the utility operating companies, regulators may impose rate reductions to provide the benefit of any income tax expense reductions to customers and refund "excess" deferred income taxes. for these reasons, entergy, the utility operating companies, and system energy cannot predict the effect any potential changes may have on their future results of operations, cash flows, or financial position, and such changes could be significant.
for further information regarding entergy's income taxes, see note 3 to the financial statements.
the effect of higher purchased gas cost charges to customers may adversely affect entergy new orleans's results of operations and liquidity.
gas rates charged to retail gas customers are comprised primarily of purchased gas cost charges, which provide no return or profit to entergy new orleans, and distribution charges, which provide a return or profit to the utility.
distribution charges are affected by the amount of gas sold to customers. purchased gas cost charges, which comprise most of a customer's bill and may be adjusted monthly, represent gas commodity costs that entergy new orleans recovers from its customers. entergy new orleans's cash flows can be affected by differences between the time period when gas is purchased and the time when ultimate recovery from customers occurs. when purchased gas cost charges increase substantially reflecting higher gas procurement costs incurred by entergy new orleans, customer usage may decrease, especially in weaker economic times, resulting in lower distribution charges for entergy new orleans, which could adversely affect results of operations.
system energy owns and operates a single nuclear generating facility, and it is dependent on affiliated companies for all of its revenues.
system energy's operating revenues are derived from the allocation of the capacity, energy, and related costs associated with its 90% ownership/leasehold interest in grand gulf. charges under the unit power sales agreement are paid by the utility operating companies as consideration for their respective entitlements to receive capacity and energy. the useful economic life of grand gulf is finite and is limited by the terms of its operating license, which expires in november 2044. system energy's financial condition depends both on the receipt of payments from the utility operating companies under the unit power sales agreement and on the continued commercial operation of grand gulf.
for information regarding the unit power sales agreement, the sale and leaseback transactions and certain other agreements relating to the entergy system companies' support of system energy (including the capital funds agreement), see notes 8 and 10 to the financial statements and the "
utility
- system energy and related agreements " section of part i, item 1.
as a holding company, entergy corporation depends on cash distributions from its subsidiaries to meet its debt service and other financial obligations and to pay dividends on its common stock.
entergy corporation is a holding company with no material revenue generating operations of its own or material assets other than the stock of its subsidiaries. accordingly, all of its operations are conducted by its subsidiaries. entergy corporation's ability to satisfy its financial obligations, including the payment of interest and principal on its outstanding debt, and to pay dividends on its common stock depends on the payment to it of dividends
table of contents part i item 1a & 1b entergy corporation, utility operating companies, and system energy or distributions by its subsidiaries. the payments of dividends or distributions to entergy corporation by its subsidiaries in turn depend on their results of operations and cash flows and other items affecting retained earnings, and on any applicable legal, regulatory, or contractual limitations on subsidiaries' ability to pay such dividends or distributions. provisions in the articles of incorporation of certain of entergy corporation's subsidiaries restrict the payment of cash dividends to entergy corporation. for further information regarding dividend or distribution restrictions to entergy corporation, see note 7 to the financial statements.
table of contents entergy arkansas, inc. and subsidiaries management's financial discussion and analysis results of operations net income
net revenue consists of operating revenues net of: 1) fuel, fuel-related expenses, and gas purchased for resale, 2)
purchased power expenses, and 3) other regulatory charges (credits). following is an analysis of the change in net revenue comparing 2016 to 2015.
the retail electric price variance is primarily due to an increase in base rates, as approved by the apsc. the new base rates were effective february 24, 2016 and began billing with the first billing cycle of april 2016. the increase includes an interim base rate adjustment surcharge, effective with the first billing cycle of april 2016, to recover the incremental revenue requirement for the period february 24, 2016 through march 31, 2016. a significant portion of the increase is related to the purchase of power block 2 of the union power station. see note 2 to the financial statements for further discussion of the rate case. see note 14 to the financial statements for further discussion of the union power station purchase.

purchased power expenses, and 3) other regulatory credits. following is an analysis of the change in net revenue comparing 2015 to 2014.
the volume/weather variance is primarily due to an increase of 110 gwh, or 1%, in billed electricity usage, including the effect of more favorable weather on residential and commercial sales and an increase in industrial usage. the increase in industrial usage is primarily due to increased demand by existing customers primarily in the petroleum refining and primary metals industries.
the retail electric price variance is primarily due to an increase in the energy efficiency rider, as approved by the apsc, effective july 2014 and july 2015.
the asset retirement obligation affects net revenue because entergy arkansas records a regulatory charge or credit for the difference between asset retirement obligation-related expenses and trust earnings plus asset retirement obligation related costs collected in revenue. the variance is primarily caused by an increase in regulatory credits because of an increase in accretion expense.
nuclear refueling outage expenses increased primarily due to the amortization of higher costs associated with the most recent outages as compared to the previous outages.
a decrease of $21.6 million in compensation and benefits costs primarily due to a decrease in net periodic pension and other postretirement benefits costs as a result of an increase in the discount rate used to

table of contents entergy arkansas, inc. and subsidiaries management's financial discussion and analysis taxes other than income taxes increased primarily due to an increase in local franchise taxes resulting from higher residential and commercial revenues in 2015 as compared to 2014, an increase in payroll taxes, and an increase in ad valorem taxes resulting from higher assessments.
depreciation and amortization expenses increased primarily due to additions to plant in service.
other income increased primarily due to an increase in the allowance for equity funds used during construction resulting from increased transmission spending in 2015 as compared to 2014.
interest expense increased primarily due to the issuance of $250 million of 4.95% series first mortgage bonds in december 2014, partially offset by an increase in the allowance for borrowed funds used during construction resulting from increased transmission spending in 2015 as compared to 2014.
income taxes the effective income tax rates for 2016, 2015, and 2014 were 39.2%, 35.3%, and 40.8%, respectively. see note 3 to the financial statements for a reconciliation of the federal statutory rate of 35% to the effective income tax rates.
ano damage, outage, and nrc reviews in march 2013, during a scheduled refueling outage at ano 1, a contractor-owned and operated heavy-lifting apparatus collapsed while moving the generator stator out of the turbine building. the collapse resulted in the death of an ironworker and injuries to several other contract workers, caused ano 2 to shut down, and damaged the ano turbine building. the total cost of assessment, restoration of off-site power, site restoration, debris removal, and replacement of damaged property and equipment was approximately $ 95 million . entergy arkansas is pursuing its options for recovering damages that resulted from the stator drop, including its insurance coverage and legal action. during 2014, entergy arkansas collected $50 million from nuclear electric insurance limited
(neil), a mutual insurance company that provides property damage coverage to the members' nuclear generating plants. litigation remains pending.
in addition, entergy arkansas incurred replacement power costs for ano 2 power during its outage and incurred incremental replacement power costs for ano 1 power because the outage extended beyond the originally-planned duration of the refueling outage. in february 2014 the apsc approved entergy arkansas's request to exclude from the calculation of its revised energy cost rate $65.9 million of deferred fuel and purchased energy costs incurred in
2013 as a result of the ano stator incident. the apsc authorized entergy arkansas to retain the $65.9 million in its deferred fuel balance with recovery to be reviewed in a later period after more information regarding various claims associated with the ano stator incident is available.
shortly after the stator incident, the nrc deployed an augmented inspection team to review the plant's response. in july 2013 a second team of nrc inspectors visited ano to evaluate certain items that were identified as requiring follow-up inspection to determine whether performance deficiencies existed. in march 2014 the nrc issued an inspection report on the follow-up inspection that discussed two preliminary findings, one that was preliminarily determined to be "red with high safety significance" for unit 1 and one that was preliminarily determined to be
"yellow with substantial safety significance" for unit 2, with the nrc indicating further that these preliminary findings may warrant additional regulatory oversight. this report also noted that one additional item related to flood barrier effectiveness was still under review.
in march 2015, after several nrc inspections and regulatory conferences, the nrc issued a letter notifying entergy of its decision to move ano into the "multiple/repetitive degraded cornerstone column," or column 4, of the nrc's reactor oversight process action matrix. placement into column 4 requires significant additional nrc inspection activities at the ano site, including a review of the site's root cause evaluation associated with flood barrier
table of contents entergy arkansas, inc. and subsidiaries management's financial discussion and analysis effectiveness and stator issues, an assessment of the effectiveness of the site's corrective action program, an additional design basis inspection, a safety culture assessment, and possibly other inspection activities consistent with the nrc's inspection procedure. entergy arkansas incurred incremental costs of approximately $53
million in 2015 to prepare for the nrc inspection that began in early 2016. excluding remediation and response costs that may result from the additional nrc inspection activities, entergy arkansas also incurred approximately
$44 million in 2016 in support of nrc inspection activities and to implement entergy arkansas's performance improvement initiatives developed in 2015. a lesser amount of incremental expense is expected to be ongoing annually after 2016, until ano transitions out of column 4.
the nrc completed the supplemental inspection required for ano's column 4 designation in february 2016, and published its inspection report in june 2016. in its inspection report, the nrc concluded that the ano site is being operated safely and that entergy understands the depth and breadth of performance concerns associated with ano's performance decline. also in june 2016, the nrc issued a confirmatory action letter to confirm the actions entergy arkansas has taken and will continue to take to improve performance at ano. the nrc will verify the completion of those actions through quarterly follow-up inspections, the results of which will determine when ano should transition out of column 4.

capital structure entergy arkansas's capitalization is balanced between equity and debt, as shown in the following table. the decrease in the debt to capital ratio for entergy arkansas is primarily due to the capital contribution received from entergy corporation in march 2016, partially offset by the issuance of long-term debt in 2016 and the redemption of $75 million of 6.45% series preferred stock and $10 million of 6.08% series preferred stock, as discussed above.

net debt consists of debt less cash and cash equivalents. debt consists of short-term borrowings and long-term debt, including the currently maturing portion. capital consists of debt, preferred stock without sinking fund, and common equity. net capital consists of capital less cash and cash equivalents. entergy arkansas uses the debt to capital ratios excluding securitization bonds in analyzing its financial condition and believes they provide useful information to its investors and creditors in evaluating entergy arkansas's financial condition because the securitization bonds are non-recourse to entergy arkansas, as more fully described in note 5 to the financial statements. entergy arkansas also uses the net debt to net capital ratio excluding securitization bonds in analyzing its financial condition and believes it provides useful information to its investors and creditors in evaluating entergy arkansas's financial condition because net debt indicates entergy arkansas's outstanding debt position that could not be readily satisfied by cash and cash equivalents on hand.
entergy arkansas seeks to optimize its capital structure in accordance with its regulatory requirements and to control its cost of capital while also maintaining equity capitalization at a level consistent with investment-
grade debt ratings. to the extent that operating cash flows are in excess of planned investments, cash may be used to reduce outstanding debt or may be paid as a dividend, or both, in appropriate amounts to maintain the targeted capital structure. to the extent that operating cash flows are insufficient to support planned investments, entergy arkansas may issue incremental debt or reduce dividends, or both, to maintain its targeted capital structure. in addition, in certain infrequent circumstances, such as large transactions that would materially alter the capital structure if financed entirely with debt and reducing dividends, entergy arkansas may receive equity contributions to maintain the targeted capital structure.
uses of capital entergy arkansas requires capital resources for:
•  construction and other capital investments;
•  debt and preferred stock maturities or retirements;
•  working capital purposes, including the financing of fuel and purchased power costs; and

unrecovered retail balance in the amount of $1.9 million. additionally, the redetermined rates reflected the recovery of a $1.9 million system agreement bandwidth remedy payment resulting from a compliance filing pursuant to the ferc's december 2015 order related to test year 2009 production costs. the rates for the 2016 production cost allocation rider update became effective with the first billing cycle of july 2016, and rates will be effective through june 2017.
energy cost recovery rider entergy arkansas's retail rates include an energy cost recovery rider to recover fuel and purchased energy costs in monthly customer bills. the rider utilizes the prior calendar-year energy costs and projected energy sales for the twelve -month period commencing on april 1 of each year to develop an energy cost rate, which is redetermined annually and includes a true-up adjustment reflecting the over- or under-recovery, including carrying charges, of the energy costs for the prior calendar year. the energy cost recovery rider tariff also allows an interim rate request depending upon the level of over- or under-recovery of fuel and purchased energy costs.
in october 2005 the apsc initiated an investigation into entergy arkansas's interim energy cost recovery rate. the investigation focused on entergy arkansas's 1) gas contracting, portfolio, and hedging practices; 2) wholesale purchases during the period; 3) management of the coal inventory at its coal generation plants; and 4) response to the contractual failure of the railroads to provide coal deliveries. in march 2006 the apsc extended its investigation to cover the costs included in entergy arkansas's march 2006 annual energy cost rate filing, and a hearing was held in the apsc investigation in october 2006.
in january 2007 the apsc issued an order in its review of the energy cost rate. the apsc found that entergy arkansas failed to maintain an adequate coal inventory level going into the summer of 2005 and that entergy arkansas should be responsible for any incremental energy costs that resulted from two outages caused by employee and contractor error. the coal plant generation curtailments were caused by railroad delivery problems and entergy arkansas resolved litigation with the railroad regarding the delivery problems. the apsc staff was directed to perform an analysis with entergy arkansas's assistance to determine the additional fuel and purchased energy costs associated with these findings and file the analysis within sixty days of the order. after a final determination of the costs is made by the apsc, entergy arkansas will be directed to refund that amount with interest to its customers as a credit on the energy cost recovery rider. entergy arkansas requested rehearing of the order.
in february 2010 the apsc denied entergy arkansas's request for rehearing, and held a hearing in september 2010 to determine the amount of damages, if any, that should be assessed against entergy arkansas. a decision is pending.
entergy arkansas expects the amount of damages, if any, to have an immaterial effect on its results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.
the apsc also established a separate docket to consider the resolved railroad litigation, and in february 2010 it established a procedural schedule that concluded with testimony through september 2010. the testimony was filed, and the apsc will decide the case based on the record in the proceeding.
table of contents entergy arkansas, inc. and subsidiaries management's financial discussion and analysis in january 2014, entergy arkansas filed a motion with the apsc relating to its redetermination of its energy cost rate that was subsequently filed in march 2014. in that motion, entergy arkansas requested that the apsc authorize entergy arkansas to exclude $65.9 million of deferred fuel and purchased energy costs incurred in 2013 from the redetermination of its 2014 energy cost rate. the $65.9 million is an estimate of the incremental fuel and replacement energy costs that entergy arkansas incurred as a result of the ano stator incident. entergy arkansas requested that the apsc authorize entergy arkansas to retain that amount in its deferred fuel balance, with recovery to be reviewed in a later period after more information is available regarding various claims associated with the ano stator incident. the apsc approved entergy arkansas's request in february 2014. see the "

opportunity sales proceeding in june 2009 the lpsc filed a complaint requesting that the ferc determine that certain of entergy arkansas's sales of electric energy to third parties: (a) violated the provisions of the system agreement that allocate the energy generated by entergy system resources, (b) imprudently denied the entergy system and its ultimate consumers the benefits of low-cost entergy system generating capacity, and (c) violated the provision of the system agreement that prohibits sales to third parties by individual companies absent an offer of a right-of-first-refusal to other utility operating companies. the lpsc's complaint challenges sales made beginning in 2002 and requests refunds. in july 2009 the utility operating companies filed a response to the complaint requesting that the ferc dismiss the complaint on the merits without hearing because the lpsc has failed to meet its burden of showing any violation of the system agreement and failed to produce any evidence of imprudent action by the entergy system. in their response, the utility operating companies explained that the system agreement clearly contemplates that the utility operating companies may make sales to third parties for their own account, subject to the requirement that those sales be included in the load (or load shape) for the applicable utility operating company. the ferc subsequently ordered a hearing in the proceeding.
the lpsc filed direct testimony in the proceeding alleging, among other things, (1) that entergy violated the system agreement by permitting entergy arkansas to make non-requirements sales to non-affiliated third parties rather than making such energy available to the other utility operating companies' customers; and (2) that over the period 2000 - 2009, these non-requirements sales caused harm to the utility operating companies' customers and these customers should be compensated for this harm by entergy. in subsequent testimony, the lpsc modified its original damages claim in favor of quantifying damages by re-running intra-system bills. the utility operating companies believe the lpsc's allegations are without merit. a hearing in the matter was held in august 2010.
in december 2010 the alj issued an initial decision. the alj found that the system agreement allowed for entergy arkansas to make the sales to third parties but concluded that the sales should be accounted for in the same manner as joint account sales. the alj concluded that "shareholders" should make refunds of the damages to the utility operating companies, along with interest. entergy disagreed with several aspects of the alj's initial decision and in january 2011 filed with the ferc exceptions to the decision.
the ferc issued a decision in june 2012 and held that, while the system agreement is ambiguous, it does provide authority for individual utility operating companies to make opportunity sales for their own account and entergy arkansas made and priced these sales in good faith. the ferc found, however, that the system agreement does not provide authority for an individual utility operating company to allocate the energy associated with such opportunity sales as part of its load, but provides a different allocation authority. the ferc further found that the after-the-fact accounting methodology used to allocate the energy used to supply the sales was inconsistent with the system agreement. quantifying the effect of the ferc's decision will require re-running intra-system bills for a ten-year period, and the ferc in its decision established further hearing procedures to determine the calculation of the effects. in july 2012, entergy and the lpsc filed requests for rehearing of the ferc's june 2012
decision, which are pending with the ferc.
as required by the procedural schedule established in the calculation proceeding, entergy filed its direct testimony that included a proposed illustrative re-run, consistent with the directives in ferc's order, of intra-
table of contents entergy arkansas, inc. and subsidiaries management's financial discussion and analysis bills for 2003, 2004, and 2006, the three years with the highest volume of opportunity sales. entergy's proposed illustrative re-run of intra-system bills shows that the potential cost for entergy arkansas would be up to $12
million for the years 2003, 2004, and 2006, excluding interest, and the potential benefit would be significantly less than that for each of the other utility operating companies. entergy's proposed illustrative re-run of the intra-system bills also shows an offsetting potential benefit to entergy arkansas for the years 2003, 2004, and
2006 resulting from the effects of the ferc's order on system agreement service schedules mss-1, mss-2, and mss-3, and the potential offsetting cost would be significantly less than that for each of the other utility operating companies. entergy provided to the lpsc an illustrative intra-system bill recalculation as specified by the lpsc for the years 2003, 2004, and 2006, and the lpsc then filed answering testimony in december 2012. in its testimony the lpsc claims that the damages, excluding interest, that should be paid by entergy arkansas to the other utility operating company's customers for 2003, 2004, and 2006 are $42 million to entergy gulf states, inc., $7 million to entergy louisiana, $23 million to entergy mississippi, and $4 million to entergy new orleans. the ferc staff and certain intervenors filed direct and answering testimony in february 2013. in april 2013, entergy filed its rebuttal testimony in that proceeding, including a revised illustrative re-run of the intra-system bills for the years 2003, 2004, and 2006. the revised calculation determines the re-pricing of the opportunity sales based on consideration of moveable resources only and the removal of exchange energy received by entergy arkansas, which increases the potential cost for entergy arkansas over the three years 2003, 2004, and 2006 by $2.3 million from the potential costs identified in the utility operating companies' prior filings in september and october 2012. a hearing was held in may 2013 to quantify the effect of repricing the opportunity sales in accordance with the ferc's decision.
in august 2013 the presiding judge issued an initial decision in the calculation proceeding. the initial decision concludes that the methodology proposed by the lpsc, rather than the methodologies proposed by entergy or the ferc staff, should be used to calculate the payments that entergy arkansas is to make to the other utility operating companies. the initial decision also concludes that the other system agreement service schedules should not be adjusted and that payments by entergy arkansas should not be reflected in the rough production cost equalization bandwidth calculations for the applicable years. the initial decision does recognize that the lpsc's methodology would result in an inequitable windfall to the other utility operating companies and, therefore, concludes that any payments by entergy arkansas should be reduced by 20% . the lpsc, apsc, city council, and ferc staff filed briefs on exceptions and/or briefs opposing exceptions. entergy filed a brief on exceptions requesting that ferc reverse the initial decision and a brief opposing certain exceptions taken by the lpsc and ferc staff.
in april 2016 the ferc issued orders addressing the requests for rehearing filed in july 2012 and the alj's august
2013 initial decision. the first order denies entergy's request for rehearing and affirms ferc's earlier rulings that entergy's original methodology for allocating energy costs to the opportunity sales was incorrect and, as a result, entergy arkansas must make payments to the other utility operating companies to put them in the same position that they would have been in absent the incorrect allocation. the ferc clarified that interest should be included with the payments. the second order affirmed in part, and reversed in part, the rulings in the alj's initial decision regarding the methodology that should be used to calculate the payments entergy arkansas is to make to the other utility operating companies. the ferc affirmed the alj's ruling that a full re-run of intra-
system bills should be performed, but required that methodology be modified so that the sales have the same priority for purposes of energy allocation as joint account sales. the ferc reversed the alj's decision that any payments by entergy arkansas should be reduced by 20% . the ferc also reversed the alj's decision that adjustments to other system agreement service schedules and excess bandwidth payments should not be taken into account when calculating the payments to be made by entergy arkansas. the ferc held that such adjustments and excess bandwidth payments should be taken into account, but ordered further proceedings before an alj to address whether a cap on any reduction due to bandwidth payments was necessary and to implement the other adjustments to the calculation methodology.
the effect of the ferc's decisions, if upheld, is that entergy arkansas will make payments to some or all of the other utility operating companies. as part of the further proceedings required by the ferc, entergy has performed an initial re-run of the intra-system bills for the ten-year period (2000-2009) to attempt to quantify the effects of the ferc's rulings. the alj will issue an initial decision and ferc will issue an order reviewing that decision.
no payments will be made or received by the utility operating companies until the ferc issues an order reviewing that
table of contents entergy arkansas, inc. and subsidiaries management's financial discussion and analysis initial decision and entergy submits a subsequent filing to comply with that order. because further proceedings are required, the amount and recipients of payments by entergy arkansas are unknown at this time. based on testimony previously submitted in the case, however, in the first quarter 2016 entergy arkansas recorded a liability of $87
million for its estimated increased costs and payment to the other utility operating companies, including interest.
this estimate is subject to change depending on how the ferc resolves the issues that are still outstanding in the case. entergy arkansas's increased costs will be attributed to entergy arkansas's retail and wholesale businesses, and it is not probable that entergy arkansas will recover the wholesale portion. therefore entergy arkansas recorded a regulatory asset of approximately $75 million , which represents its estimate of the retail portion of the costs.
in may 2016, entergy services filed a request for rehearing of the ferc's april 2016 order addressing the requests for rehearing filed in july 2012. entergy services also filed a request for clarification and/or rehearing of the ferc's april 2016 order addressing the alj's august 2013 initial decision. the apsc and the lpsc also filed requests for rehearing of the ferc's april 2016 order. also, in may 2016 a procedural schedule was established with a hearing in may 2017 and an initial decision expected in august 2017. pursuant to that procedural schedule, entergy services re-ran intra-system bills for the ten-year period to quantify the effects of the ferc's ruling.
the lpsc submitted testimony disputing certain aspects of the calculations, and entergy services submitted answering testimony.

nuclear matters entergy arkansas owns and operates, through an affiliate, the ano 1 and ano 2 nuclear power plants. entergy arkansas is, therefore, subject to the risks related to owning and operating nuclear plants. these include risks from the use, storage, handling and disposal of high-level and low-level radioactive materials, regulatory requirement changes, including changes resulting from events at other plants, limitations on the amounts and types of insurance commercially available for losses in connection with nuclear operations, and technological and financial uncertainties related to decommissioning nuclear plants at the end of their licensed lives, including the sufficiency of funds in decommissioning trusts. in the event of an unanticipated early shutdown of either ano 1 or ano 2, entergy arkansas may be required to file with the apsc a rate mechanism to provide additional funds or credit support to satisfy regulatory requirements for decommissioning.
in 2016, entergy conducted a comprehensive evaluation of the entergy nuclear fleet and determined that it is necessary to increase investments in its nuclear plants to position the fleet to meet its operational goals. these investments will result in increased operating and capital costs associated with operating entergy's nuclear plants going forward. the preliminary estimates of the increase to planned capital costs for 2017 through 2019 identified through and associated with this initiative are estimated to be $290 million for entergy arkansas. the current estimates of the capital costs identified through this initiative are included in entergy arkansas's preliminary capital investment plan estimate for 2017 through 2019 given in "

uses of capital
" above. the increase to planned other operation and maintenance expenses identified through and associated with this initiative is preliminarily estimated to be approximately $35 million in 2017 for entergy arkansas, with a similar level of expenses expected to continue going forward. in addition, nuclear refueling outage expenses are expected to increase going forward.
the nuclear industry continues to address susceptibility to stress corrosion cracking of certain materials within the plant systems. the issue is applicable at all nuclear units to varying degrees and is managed in accordance with industry standard practices and guidelines that include in-service examinations, replacements, and mitigation strategies. developments in the industry or identification of issues at the nuclear units could require unanticipated remediation efforts that cannot be quantified in advance.

costs and funding total qualified pension cost for entergy arkansas in 2016 was $37.6 million. entergy arkansas anticipates 2017
qualified pension cost to be $37 million. in 2016, entergy arkansas refined its approach to estimating the service cost and interest cost components of qualified pension costs, which had the effect of lowering qualified pension costs by $13.3 million. entergy arkansas contributed $83 million to its qualified pension plan in 2016 and estimates pension contributions will be approximately $79.4 million in 2017, although the 2017 required pension contributions will be known with more certainty when the january 1, 2017 valuations are completed, which is expected by april 1, 2017.
total other postretirement health care and life insurance benefit income for entergy arkansas in 2016 was $5.9
million. entergy arkansas expects 2017 postretirement health care and life insurance benefit income of approximately $4 million. in 2016, entergy arkansas refined its approach to estimating the service cost and interest cost components of other postretirement costs, which had the effect of lowering qualified other postretirement costs by $2.5 million. entergy arkansas contributed $5.6 million to its other postretirement plans in 2016 and estimates 2017 contributions will be approximately $525 thousand.
the retirement and mortality rate assumptions are reviewed every three-to-five years as part of an actuarial study that compares these assumptions to the actual experience of the pension and other postretirement plans. the 2014
actuarial study reviewed plan experience from 2010 through 2013. as a result of the 2014 actuarial study and the issuance of new mortality tables in october 2014 by the society of actuaries, changes were made to reflect modified demographic pattern expectations as well as longer life expectancies. these changes are reflected in the december
31, 2014 financial disclosures. adoption of the new mortality assumptions for 2015 resulted in an increase at december 31, 2014 of $106.9 million in the qualified pension benefit obligation and $16 million in the accumulated postretirement
table of contents entergy arkansas, inc. and subsidiaries management's financial discussion and analysis obligation. the new mortality assumptions increased anticipated 2015 qualified pension cost by approximately $15.4
million and other postretirement cost by approximately $2.2 million. in 2016, the mortality projection scale was updated to mp-2016, with no change in the base mortality table assumption.

table of contents entergy louisiana, llc and subsidiaries management's financial discussion and analysis results of operations net income
net income increased $175.4 million primarily due to the effect of a settlement with the irs related to the
2010-2011 irs audit, which resulted in a $136.1 million reduction of income tax expense. also contributing to the increase were lower other operation and maintenance expenses, higher net revenue, and higher other income. the increase was partially offset by higher depreciation and amortization expenses, higher interest expense, and higher nuclear refueling outage expenses.
net revenue consists of operating revenues net of: 1) fuel, fuel-related expenses, and gas purchased for resale, 2)
purchased power expenses, and 3) other regulatory charges. following is an analysis of the change in net revenue comparing 2016 to 2015.
the retail electric price variance is primarily due to an increase in formula rate plan revenues, implemented with the first billing cycle of march 2016, to collect the estimated first-year revenue requirement related to the purchase of power blocks 3 and 4 of the union power station. see note 2 to the financial statements for further discussion.
the transmission equalization variance is primarily due to changes in transmission investments, including entergy louisiana's exit from the system agreement in august 2016.
table of contents entergy louisiana, llc and subsidiaries management's financial discussion and analysis in industrial usage is primarily due to increased demand from new customers and expansion projects, primarily in the chemicals industry.
the louisiana act 55 financing savings obligation variance results from a regulatory charge for tax savings to be shared with customers per an agreement approved by the lpsc. the tax savings resulted from the 2010-2011 irs audit settlement on the treatment of the louisiana act 55 financing of storm costs for hurricane gustav and hurricane ike. see note 3 to the financial statements for additional discussion of the settlement and benefit sharing.
included in other is a provision of $23 million recorded in 2016 related to the settlement of the waterford 3
replacement steam generator prudence review proceeding, offset by a provision of $32 million recorded in 2015
related to the uncertainty at that time associated with the resolution of the waterford 3 replacement steam generator prudence review proceeding. see note 2 to the financial statements for a discussion of the waterford 3
replacement steam generator prudence review proceeding.
net revenue consists of operating revenues net of: 1) fuel, fuel-related expenses, and gas purchased for resale, 2)
purchased power expenses, and 3) other regulatory charges (credits). following is an analysis of the change in net revenue comparing 2015 to 2014.
waterford 3 replacement steam generator provision           (32.0  )
the retail electric price variance is primarily due to formula rate plan increases, as approved by the lpsc, effective december 2014 and january 2015. entergy louisiana's formula rate plan increases are discussed in note 2
to the financial statements.
the volume/weather variance is primarily due to an increase of 841 gwh, or 2%, in billed electricity usage, as a result of increased industrial usage primarily due to increased demand for existing large refinery customers, new customers, and expansion projects primarily in the chemicals industry, partially offset by a decrease in demand in the chemicals industry as a result of a seasonal outage for an existing customer.
the waterford 3 replacement steam generator provision is due to a regulatory charge of approximately $32 million recorded in 2015 related to the uncertainty associated with the resolution of the waterford 3 replacement steam generator project. see note 2 to the financial statements for a discussion of the waterford 3 replacement steam generator prudence review proceeding.
the miso deferral variance is due to the deferral in 2014 of non-fuel miso-related charges, as approved by the lpsc. the deferral of non-fuel miso-related charges is partially offset in other operation and maintenance expenses. see note 2 to the financial statements for further discussion of the recovery of non-fuel miso-related charges.

the decrease was partially offset by an increase of $19.9 million in nuclear generation expenses primarily due to higher nuclear labor costs, including contract labor.
depreciation and amortization expenses increased primarily due to additions to plant in service, including power blocks 3 and 4 of the union power station purchased in march 2016.
other income increased primarily due to an increase in the allowance for equity funds used during construction due to higher construction work in progress in 2016, which included the st. charles power station project and increased distribution and transmission spending. the increase was also due to higher trust income in 2016 on the river bend and waterford 3 decommissioning trust fund investments.
the increase was partially offset by the refinancing at lower interest rates of certain first mortgage bonds. see note 5 to the financial statements for details of long-term debt.

depreciation and amortization expenses increased primarily due to additions to plant in service, including the ninemile unit 6 project, which was placed in service in december 2014.

income taxes the effective income tax rates for 2016, 2015, and 2014, were 12.6%, 28.6%, and 29.3%, respectively. the difference in the effective income tax rate of 12.6% for 2016 versus the statutory rate of 35% for 2016 was primarily

waterford 3 replacement steam generator project following the completion of the waterford 3 replacement steam generator project, the lpsc undertook a prudence review in connection with a filing made by entergy louisiana in april 2013 with regard to the following aspects of the replacement project: 1) project management; 2) cost controls; 3) success in achieving stated objectives; 4) the costs of the replacement project; and 5) the outage length and replacement power costs. in july 2014 the lpsc staff filed testimony recommending potential project and replacement power cost disallowances of up to $71 million , citing a need for further explanation or documentation from entergy louisiana. an intervenor filed testimony recommending disallowance of $141 million of incremental project costs, claiming the steam generator fabricator was imprudent. entergy louisiana provided further documentation and explanation requested by the lpsc staff. an evidentiary hearing was held in december 2014. at the hearing the parties maintained the positions reflected in pre-filed testimony. entergy louisiana believed that the replacement steam generator costs were prudently incurred and applicable legal principles supported their recovery in rates. nevertheless, entergy louisiana recorded a write-off of $16 million of waterford 3's plant balance in december 2014 because of the uncertainty at the time associated with the resolution of the prudence review. in december 2015 the alj issued a proposed recommendation, which was subsequently finalized, concluding that entergy louisiana prudently managed the waterford 3 replacement steam generator project, including the selection, use, and oversight of contractors, and could not reasonably have anticipated the damage to the steam generators. nevertheless, the alj concluded that entergy louisiana was liable for the conduct of its contractor and subcontractor and, therefore, recommended a disallowance of $67 million in capital costs. additionally, the alj concluded that entergy louisiana did not sufficiently justify the incurrence of $2 million in replacement power costs during the replacement outage. although the alj's recommendation had not yet been considered by the lpsc, after considering the progress of the proceeding in light of the alj recommendation, entergy louisiana recorded in the fourth quarter 2015 approximately $77 million in charges, including a $45 million asset write-off and a $32 million regulatory charge, to reflect that a portion of the assets associated with the waterford 3 replacement steam generator project was no longer probable of recovery.
in october 2016 the parties reached a settlement in this matter. this settlement was approved by the lpsc in december 2016. the settlement effectively provides for an agreed-upon disallowance of $67 million of plant, which had been previously written off by entergy louisiana, as discussed above. the settlement also requires a refund of approximately $71 million to be given through a one-time credit included in customers' bills in january 2017. of the $71 million of refunds, $68 million was credited to customers through entergy louisiana's formula rate plan, outside of sharing, and $3 million through its fuel adjustment clause. entergy louisiana had previously recorded a provision of $48 million for this refund. the previously-recorded provision included the cumulative revenues through december 2016 related to the $67 million of disallowed plant. an additional regulatory charge of $23

$26.8 million for entergy gulf states louisiana and $51.1 million for entergy louisiana was filed. the december
2014 estimate forms the basis of rates implemented effective with the first billing cycle of january 2015. in july

management's financial discussion and analysis results of operations net income
net income increased $17.9 million primarily due to the write-off in 2014 of the regulatory assets associated with new nuclear generation development costs as a result of a joint stipulation entered into with the mississippi public utilities staff, subsequently approved by the mpsc, partially offset by higher depreciation and amortization expenses, higher taxes other than income taxes, higher other operation and maintenance expenses, and lower net revenue. see note 2 to the financial statements for discussion of the new nuclear generation development costs and the joint stipulation.
net revenue consists of operating revenues net of: 1) fuel, fuel-related expenses, and gas purchased for resale, 2)
purchased power expenses, and 3) other regulatory charges (credits). following is an analysis of the change in net revenue comparing 2016 to 2015.
the retail electric price variance is primarily due to a $19.4 million net annual increase in revenues, as approved by the mpsc, effective with the first billing cycle of july 2016, and an increase in revenues collected through the storm damage rider. see note 2 to the financial statements for more discussion on the formula rate plan and the storm damage rider.
the volume/weather variance is primarily due to an increase of 153 gwh, or 1%, in billed electricity usage, including an increase in industrial usage, partially offset by the effect of less favorable weather on residential and commercial sales. the increase in industrial usage is primarily due to expansion projects in the pulp and paper industry, increased demand for existing customers, primarily in the metals industry, and new customers in the wood products industry.
management's financial discussion and analysis the net wholesale revenue variance is primarily due to entergy mississippi's exit from the system agreement in november 2015.
the reserve equalization revenue variance is primarily due to the absence of reserve equalization revenue as compared to the same period in 2015 resulting from entergy mississippi's exit from the system agreement in november
net revenue consists of operating revenues net of: 1) fuel, fuel-related expenses, and gas purchased for resale, 2)
purchased power expenses, and 3) other regulatory charges. following is an analysis of the change in net revenue comparing 2015 to 2014.
the volume/weather variance is primarily due to an increase of 86 gwh, or 1%, in billed electricity usage, including the effect of more favorable weather on residential and commercial sales.
the retail electric price variance is primarily due to a $16 million net annual increase in revenues, effective february 2015, as a result of the mpsc order in the june 2014 rate case and an increase in revenues collected through the energy efficiency rider, partially offset by a decrease in revenues collected through the storm damage rider. the rate case included the realignment of certain costs from collection in riders to base rates. see note 2
to the financial statements for a discussion of the rate case, the energy efficiency rider, and the storm damage rider.
the net wholesale revenue variance is primarily due to a wholesale customer contract termination in october 2015.
transmission equalization revenue represents amounts received by entergy mississippi from certain other entergy utility operating companies, in accordance with the system agreement, to allocate the costs of collectively planning, constructing, and operating entergy's bulk transmission facilities. the transmission equalization variance is primarily attributable to the realignment, effective february 2015, of these revenues from the determination of base rates to inclusion in a rider. such revenues had a favorable effect on net revenue in 2014, but minimal effect in 2015. entergy mississippi exited the system agreement in november 2015. see note 2 to the financial statements for a discussion of the system agreement.
reserve equalization revenue represents amounts received by entergy mississippi from certain other entergy utility operating companies, in accordance with the system agreement, to allocate the costs of collectively maintaining adequate electric generating capacity across the entergy system. the reserve equalization variance is primarily attributable to the realignment, effective february 2015, of these revenues from the determination of base rates to inclusion in a rider. such revenues had a favorable effect on net revenue in 2014, but minimal effect in 2015.
management's financial discussion and analysis mississippi exited the system agreement in november 2015. see note 2 to the financial statements for a discussion of the system agreement.
•  a decrease of $9.4 million in fossil-fueled generation expenses primarily due to a lower scope of work done during plant outages in 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015;
a decrease of $6.1 million in compensation and benefits costs primarily due to a decrease in net periodic pension and other postretirement benefits costs as a result of an increase in the discount rate used to value the benefit liabilities and a refinement in the approach used to estimate the service cost and

•  a decrease of $2 million in energy efficiency costs; and
•  several individually insignificant items.
the decrease was partially offset by an increase of $7.1 million in storm damage provisions and an increase of $6
million in distribution expenses primarily due to higher vegetation maintenance. see note 2 to the financial statements for a discussion of storm cost recovery.
depreciation and amortization expenses increased primarily due to additions to plant in service.

•  retirement and mortality assumptions, partially offset by a decrease in the accrual for incentive-based compensation.  see  "critical accounting estimates" below and note 11 to the financial statements for further discussion of pension and other postretirement benefit costs.
the increase was partially offset by a decrease of $17.6 million in storm damage provisions. see note 2 to the financial statements for a discussion of storm cost recovery.
management's financial discussion and analysis the asset write-off variance is due to the $56.2 million ($36.7 million after-tax) write-off in 2014 of entergy mississippi's regulatory assets associated with new nuclear generation development costs. see " new nuclear generation development costs " below and note 2 to the financial statements for discussion of the new nuclear generation development costs.
depreciation and amortization expenses increased primarily due to additions to plant in service and higher depreciation rates in 2015, as approved by the mpsc.
income taxes the effective income tax rates for 2016, 2015, and 2014 were 36.9%, 40.0%, and 42.7%, respectively. see note 3 to the financial statements for a reconciliation of the federal statutory rate of 35% to the effective income tax rates.
liquidity and capital resources cash flow cash flows for the years ended december 31, 2016 , 2015 , and 2014 were as follows:

period operating activities net cash flow provided by operating activities decreased $160 million in 2016 primarily due to a decrease due to the timing of recovery of fuel and purchased power costs in 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015 and $15.3
million in insurance proceeds received in 2015 related to the unplanned outage event that occurred at the baxter wilson (unit 1) power plant in september 2013. the decrease was partially offset by income tax refunds of $12.5
million in 2016 compared to income tax payments of $61.3 million in 2015. entergy mississippi had income tax refunds in 2016 and income tax payments in 2015 in accordance with the entergy corporation and subsidiary companies intercompany income tax allocation agreement. the 2016 income tax refunds resulted primarily from adjustments associated with the settlement of the 2010-2011 irs audit whereas the income tax payments in 2015 were primarily due to the results of operations and the reversal of taxable temporary differences as well as final settlement of amounts outstanding associated with the 2006-2007 irs audit. see note 3 to the financial statements for a discussion of the income tax audits.

investing activities net cash flow used in investing activities increased $44.3 million in 2016 primarily due to:
•  an increase of $72.4 million in transmission construction expenditures primarily due to a higher scope of work performed in 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015;
•  insurance proceeds of $12.9 million received in 2015 related to the unplanned outage event that occurred at the baxter wilson (unit 1) power plant  in september 2013;
•  an increase of $11.4 million in distribution construction expenditures primarily due to a higher scope of non-storm related work performed in 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015; and
•  an increase of $10.1 million due to various information technology projects and upgrades.
the increase was partially offset by a decrease of $20.1 million in fossil-fueled generation construction expenditures primarily due to a decreased scope of work performed during plant outages in 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015 and money pool activity.
million in 2015. the money pool is an inter-company borrowing arrangement designed to reduce the utility subsidiaries' need for external short-term borrowings.
net cash flow used in investing activities increased $67.4 million in 2015 primarily due to:
•  an increase in transmission construction expenditures primarily due to a higher scope of work done in 2015;
•  an increase in information technology capital expenditures due to various technology projects and upgrades in 2015; and
•  money pool activity.
the increase was partially offset by $12.9 million of insurance proceeds received in 2015 related to the unplanned outage event that occurred at the baxter wilson (unit 1) power plant in september 2013.
management's financial discussion and analysis increases in entergy mississippi's receivable from the money pool are a use of cash flow, and entergy mississippi's receivable from the money pool increased by $25.3 million in 2015 compared to increasing by $0.6 million in 2014.
financing activities entergy mississippi's financing activities provided $8.4 million of cash in 2016 compared to using $43.2 million in
2015 primarily due to the net issuance of $61.4 million of long-term debt in 2016 and a decrease of $16 million in common stock dividends paid in 2016, partially offset by the redemption of $30 million of 6.25% series preferred stock. the decrease in dividends paid was primarily because of lower operating cash flows and higher capital expenditures, each discussed above.
net cash flow used in financing activities decreased $20.9 million in 2015 primarily due to a decrease of $21.4
million in common stock dividends paid. the decrease in dividends paid was primarily due to higher capital expenditures, as discussed above.
see note 5 to the financial statements for details on long-term debt.
capital structure entergy mississippi's capitalization is balanced between equity and debt, as shown in the following table.
debt to capital             50.2  %                   49.7  %
net debt to net capital     48.4  %                   45.9  %
net debt consists of debt less cash and cash equivalents. debt consists of short-term borrowings, capital lease obligations, and long-term debt, including the currently maturing portion. capital consists of debt, preferred stock without sinking fund, and common equity. net capital consists of capital less cash and cash equivalents.
entergy mississippi uses the debt to capital ratio in analyzing its financial condition and believes it provides useful information to its investors and creditors in evaluating entergy mississippi's financial condition. entergy mississippi uses the net debt to net capital ratio in analyzing its financial condition and believes it provides useful information to its investors and creditors in evaluating entergy mississippi's financial condition because net debt indicates entergy mississippi's outstanding debt position that could not be readily satisfied by cash and cash equivalents on hand.
entergy mississippi seeks to optimize its capital structure in accordance with its regulatory requirements and to control its cost of capital while also maintaining equity capitalization at a level consistent with investment-
grade debt ratings. to the extent that operating cash flows are in excess of planned investments, cash may be used to reduce outstanding debt or may be paid as a dividend, or both, in appropriate amounts to maintain the targeted capital structure. to the extent that operating cash flows are insufficient to support planned investments, entergy mississippi may issue incremental debt or reduce dividends, or both, to maintain its targeted capital structure. in addition, in certain infrequent circumstances, such as large transactions that would materially alter the capital structure if financed entirely with debt and reducing dividends, entergy mississippi may receive equity contributions to maintain the targeted capital structure.
uses of capital entergy mississippi requires capital resources for:

in march 2016, entergy mississippi submitted its formula rate plan 2016 test year filing showing entergy mississippi's projected earned return for the 2016 calendar year to be below the formula rate plan bandwidth. the filing showed a $32.6 million rate increase was necessary to reset entergy mississippi's earned return on common equity to the specified point of adjustment of 9.96% , within the formula rate plan bandwidth. in june 2016 the mpsc approved entergy mississippi's joint stipulation with the mississippi public utilities staff. the joint stipulation provided for a total revenue increase of $23.7 million . the revenue increase includes a $19.4 million increase through the formula rate plan, resulting in a return on common equity point of adjustment of 10.07% . the revenue increase also includes $4.3 million in incremental ad valorem tax expenses to be collected through an updated ad valorem tax adjustment rider. the revenue increase and ad valorem tax adjustment rider were effective with the july 2016 bills.
in august 2012 the mpsc opened inquiries to review whether the current formulaic methodology used to calculate the return on common equity in both entergy mississippi's formula rate plan and mississippi power company's annual formula rate plan was still appropriate or could be improved to better serve the public interest. the intent of this inquiry and review was for informational purposes only; the evaluation of any recommendations for changes to the existing methodology would take place in a general rate case or in the existing formula rate plan docket. in march 2013 the mississippi public utilities staff filed its consultant's report which noted the return on common equity estimation methods used by entergy mississippi and mississippi power company are commonly used throughout the electric utility industry. the report suggested ways in which the methods used by entergy mississippi and mississippi power company might be improved, but did not recommend specific changes in the return on common equity formulas or calculations at that time. in june 2014 the mpsc expanded the scope of the august 2012 inquiry to study the merits of adopting a uniform formula rate plan that could be applied, where possible in whole or in part, to both entergy mississippi and mississippi power company in order to achieve greater consistency in the plans. the mpsc directed the mississippi public utilities staff to investigate and review entergy mississippi's formula rate plan rider schedule and mississippi power company's performance evaluation plan by considering the merits and deficiencies and possibilities for improvement of each and then to propose a uniform formula rate plan that, where possible, could be applicable to both companies. no procedural schedule has been set. in october 2014 the mississippi public utilities staff conducted a public technical conference to discuss performance benchmarking and its potential application to the electric utilities' formula rate plans.
management's financial discussion and analysis fuel and purchased power cost recovery entergy mississippi's rate schedules include an energy cost recovery rider that is adjusted annually to reflect accumulated over- or under-recoveries. entergy mississippi's fuel cost recoveries are subject to annual audits conducted pursuant to the authority of the mpsc.
entergy mississippi had a deferred fuel balance of $60.4 million as of march 31, 2014. in may 2014, entergy mississippi filed for an interim adjustment under its energy cost recovery rider. the interim adjustment proposed a net energy cost factor designed to collect over a six-month period the under-recovered deferred fuel balance as of march 31, 2014 and also reflected a natural gas price of $4.50 per mmbtu. in may 2014, entergy mississippi and the public utilities staff entered into a joint stipulation in which entergy mississippi agreed to a revised net energy cost factor that reflected the proposed interim adjustment with a reduction in costs recovered through the energy cost recovery rider associated with the suspension of the doe nuclear waste storage fee. in june 2014 the mpsc approved the joint stipulation and allowed entergy mississippi's interim adjustment. in november 2014, entergy mississippi filed its annual redetermination of the annual factor to be applied under the energy cost recovery rider. due to lower gas prices and a lower deferred fuel balance, the redetermined annual factor was a decrease from the revised interim net energy cost factor. in january 2015 the mpsc approved the redetermined annual factor effective january 30, 2015.
entergy mississippi had a deferred fuel over-recovery balance of $58.3 million as of may 31, 2015, along with an under-recovery balance of $12.3 million under the power management rider. pursuant to those tariffs, in july 2015, entergy mississippi filed for interim adjustments under both the energy cost recovery rider and the power management rider to flow through to customers the approximately $46 million net over-recovery over a six-month period. in august 2015, the mpsc approved the interim adjustments effective with september 2015 bills. in november
2015, entergy mississippi filed its annual redetermination of the annual factor to be applied under the energy cost recovery rider. the calculation of the annual factor included a projected over-recovery balance of $48 million projected through january 31, 2016. in january 2016 the mpsc approved the redetermined annual factor effective february 1, 2016. the mpsc further ordered, however, that due to the significant change in natural gas price forecasts since entergy mississippi's filing in november 2015 entergy mississippi shall file a revised fuel factor with the mpsc no later than february 1, 2016. pursuant to that order, entergy mississippi submitted a revised fuel factor. additionally, because entergy mississippi's projected over-recovery balance for the period ending january
31, 2016 was $68 million , in february 2016, entergy mississippi filed for another interim adjustment to the energy cost factor effective april 2016 to flow through to customers the projected over-recovery balance over a six-month period. that interim adjustment was approved by the mpsc in february 2016 effective for april 2016 bills.
in november 2016, entergy mississippi filed its annual redetermination of the annual factor to be applied under the energy cost recovery rider. the calculation of the annual factor included an over-recovery of less than $2 million as of september 30, 2016. in january 2017 the mpsc approved the annual factor effective with february 2017 bills.
also in january 2017 the mpsc certified to the mississippi legislature the audit reports of its independent auditors for the fuel year ending september 30, 2016. in its order, the mpsc expressly reserved the right to review and determine the recoverability of any and all purchased power expenditures made during fiscal year 2016.
mississippi attorney general complaint the mississippi attorney general filed a complaint in state court in december 2008 against entergy corporation, entergy mississippi, entergy services, and entergy power alleging, among other things, violations of mississippi statutes, fraud, and breach of good faith and fair dealing, and requesting an accounting and restitution. the complaint is wide ranging and relates to tariffs and procedures under which entergy mississippi purchases power not generated in mississippi to meet electricity demand. entergy believes the complaint is unfounded. in december 2008
the defendant entergy companies removed the attorney general's lawsuit to u.s. district court in jackson, mississippi. the mississippi attorney general moved to remand the matter to state court. in august 2012 the district court issued an opinion denying the attorney general's motion for remand, finding that the district court has subject matter jurisdiction under the class action fairness act.
management's financial discussion and analysis the defendant entergy companies answered the complaint and filed a counterclaim for relief based upon the mississippi public utilities act and the federal power act. in may 2009 the defendant entergy companies filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings asserting grounds of federal preemption, the exclusive jurisdiction of the mpsc, and factual errors in the attorney general's complaint. in september 2012 the district court heard oral argument on entergy's motion for judgment on the pleadings.
in january 2014 the u.s. supreme court issued a decision in which it held that cases brought by attorneys general as the sole plaintiff to enforce state laws were not considered "mass actions" under the class action fairness act, so as to establish federal subject matter jurisdiction. one day later the attorney general renewed his motion to remand the entergy case back to state court, citing the u.s. supreme court's decision. the defendant entergy companies responded to that motion reiterating the additional grounds asserted for federal question jurisdiction, and the district court held oral argument on the renewed motion to remand in february 2014. in april 2015 the district court entered an order denying the renewed motion to remand, holding that the district court has federal question subject matter jurisdiction. the attorney general appealed to the u.s. fifth circuit court of appeals the denial of the motion to remand. in july 2015 the fifth circuit issued an order denying the appeal, and the attorney general subsequently filed a petition for rehearing of the request for interlocutory appeal, which was also denied.
in december 2015 the district court ordered that the parties submit to the court undisputed and disputed facts that are material to the entergy defendants' motion for judgment on the pleadings, as well as supplemental briefs regarding the same. those filings were made in january 2016.
in september 2016 the attorney general filed a mandamus petition with the u.s. fifth circuit court of appeals in which the attorney general asked the fifth circuit to order the chief judge to reassign this case to another judge.
in september 2016 the district court denied the entergy companies' motion for judgment on the pleadings. the entergy companies filed a motion seeking to amend the district court's order denying the entergy companies' motion for judgment on the pleadings and allowing an interlocutory appeal. in october 2016 the fifth circuit granted the attorney general's motion for writ of mandamus and directed the chief judge to assign the case to a new judge. the case was reassigned in october 2016. in january 2017 the district court denied the entergy companies' motion to amend the order denying the motion for judgment on the pleadings, and the parties are in the process of preparing a proposed case management order.
advanced metering infrastructure (ami) filing in november 2016, entergy mississippi filed an application seeking an order from the mpsc granting a certificate of public convenience and necessity and finding that entergy mississippi's deployment of ami is in the public interest. entergy mississippi proposed to replace existing meters with advanced meters that enable two-way data communication; to design and build a secure and reliable network to support such communications; and to implement support systems. ami is intended to serve as the foundation of entergy mississippi's modernized power grid. the filing identified a number of quantified and unquantified benefits, and entergy mississippi provided a cost benefit analysis showing that its ami deployment is expected to produce a nominal benefit to customers of $496 million over a 15 year period, which when netted against the costs of ami results in $183 million of net customer benefits.
entergy mississippi also sought to continue to include in rate base the remaining book value at december 31, 2015, approximately $56 million, of existing meters that will be retired as part of the ami deployment and also to depreciate those assets using current depreciation rates. entergy mississippi proposed a 15-year depreciable life for the new advanced meters, the three-year deployment of which is expected to begin in 2019, subject to approval by the mpsc, with deployment of the communications network expected to begin in 2018. entergy mississippi proposed to include the ami deployment costs and the quantified benefits in existing rate mechanisms, primarily through future formula rate plan filings and/or future energy cost recovery rider schedule re-determinations, as applicable.
storm damage provision and storm cost recovery on july 1, 2013, entergy mississippi and the mississippi public utilities staff entered into a joint stipulation, wherein both parties agreed that approximately $32 million in storm restoration costs incurred in 2011 and 2012
management's financial discussion and analysis prudently incurred and chargeable to the storm damage provision, while approximately $700,000 in prudently incurred costs were more properly recoverable through the formula rate plan. entergy mississippi and the mississippi public utilities staff also agreed that the storm damage provision should be increased from $750,000 per month to $1.75
million per month. in september 2013 the mpsc approved the joint stipulation with the increase in the storm damage provision effective with october 2013 bills. in february 2015, entergy mississippi provided notice to the mississippi public utilities staff that the storm damage provision would be set to zero effective with the march
2015 billing cycle as a result of entergy mississippi's storm damage provision balance exceeding $15 million as of january 31, 2015, but would return to its current level when the storm damage provision balance becomes less than
$10 million . as of april 30, 2016, entergy mississippi's storm damage provision balance was less than $10 million , therefore entergy mississippi resumed billing the monthly storm damage provision effective with june 2016 bills.
as of september 30, 2016, however, entergy mississippi's storm damage provision balance again exceeded $15 million
. accordingly the storm damage provision was reset to zero beginning with the november 2016 billing cycle and will remain at zero until the balance again becomes less than $10 million , at which time it will return to its prior level.

net revenue consists of operating revenues net of: 1) fuel, fuel-related expenses, and gas purchased for resale, 2)
purchased power expenses, and 3) other regulatory charges. following is an analysis of the change in net revenue comparing 2016 to 2015.
the retail electric price variance is primarily due to an increase in the purchased power and capacity acquisition cost recovery rider, as approved by the city council, effective with the first billing cycle of march 2016, primarily related to the purchase of power block 1 of the union power station. see note 14 to the financial statements for discussion of the union power station purchase.
the volume/weather variance is primarily due to a decrease of 112 gwh, or 2%, in billed electricity usage, partially offset by the effect of favorable weather on commercial sales and a 2% increase in the average number of electric customers.

capital structure entergy new orleans's capitalization is balanced between equity and debt as shown in the following table. the increase in the debt to capital ratio is primarily due to the issuance of long-term debt in 2016, partially offset by the $47.8 million capital contribution received from entergy corporation in march 2016 and an increase in retained earnings.

net debt consists of debt less cash and cash equivalents. debt consists of short-term borrowings, long-term debt, including the currently maturing portion, and the long-term payable to entergy louisiana. capital consists of debt, preferred stock without sinking fund, and common equity. net capital consists of capital less cash and cash equivalents. entergy new orleans uses the debt to capital ratios excluding securitization bonds in analyzing its financial condition and believes they provide useful information to its investors and creditors in evaluating entergy new orleans's financial condition because the securitization bonds are non-recourse to entergy new orleans, as more fully described in note 5 to the financial statements. entergy new orleans also uses the net debt to net capital ratio excluding securitization bonds in analyzing its financial condition and believes it provides useful information to its investors and creditors in evaluating entergy new orleans's financial condition because net debt indicates entergy new orleans's outstanding debt position that could not be readily satisfied by cash and cash equivalents on hand.
entergy new orleans seeks to optimize its capital structure in accordance with its regulatory requirements and to control its cost of capital while also maintaining equity capitalization at a level consistent with investment-
grade debt ratings. to the extent that operating cash flows are in excess of planned investments, cash may be used to reduce outstanding debt or may be paid as a dividend, or both, in appropriate amounts to maintain the targeted capital structure. to the extent that operating cash flows are insufficient to support planned investments, entergy new orleans may issue incremental debt or reduce dividends, or both, to maintain its targeted capital structure. in addition, in certain infrequent circumstances, such as large transactions that would materially alter the capital structure if financed entirely with debt and reducing dividends, entergy new orleans may receive equity contributions to maintain the targeted capital structure.
table of contents entergy new orleans, inc. and subsidiaries management's financial discussion and analysis uses of capital entergy new orleans requires capital resources for:
•  construction and other capital investments;
•  working capital purposes, including the financing of fuel and purchased power costs;
•  debt and preferred stock maturities or retirements; and
following are the amounts of entergy new orleans's planned construction and other capital investments.
-in millions planned construction and capital investment:
(a)  includes estimated interest payments.  long-term debt is discussed in note 5 to the financial statements.
purchase obligations represent the minimum purchase obligation or cancellation charge for contractual
(b)  obligations to purchase goods or services.  for entergy new orleans, almost all of the total consists of unconditional fuel and purchased power obligations, including its obligations under the unit power sales agreement, which is discussed in note 8 to the financial statements.
in addition to the contractual obligations given above, entergy new orleans currently expects to contribute approximately $9.9 million to its qualified pension plan and approximately $3.7 million to other postretirement health care and life insurance plans in 2017, although the 2017 required pension contributions will be known with more certainty when the january 1, 2017 valuations are completed, which is expected by april 1, 2017. see "
critical accounting estimates
- qualified pension and other postretirement benefits " below for a discussion of qualified pension and other postretirement benefits funding.
also in addition to the contractual obligations, entergy new orleans has $138.9 million of unrecognized tax benefits and interest net of unused tax attributes and payments for which the timing of payments beyond 12 months cannot be reasonably estimated due to uncertainties in the timing of effective settlement of tax positions. see note 3 to the financial statements for additional information regarding unrecognized tax benefits.
in addition to routine capital spending to maintain operations, the planned capital investment estimate for entergy new orleans includes specific investments such as the new orleans power station discussed below; transmission projects to enhance reliability, reduce congestion, and enable economic growth; distribution spending to enhance reliability and improve service to customers, including initial investment to support advanced metering; system
table of contents entergy new orleans, inc. and subsidiaries management's financial discussion and analysis improvements; and other investments. estimated capital expenditures are subject to periodic review and modification and may vary based on the ongoing effects of regulatory constraints and requirements, environmental compliance, business opportunities, market volatility, economic trends, business restructuring, changes in project plans, and the ability to access capital. management provides more information on long-term debt and preferred stock maturities in notes 5 and 6 to the financial statements.

in march 2013, entergy louisiana filed a rate case for the algiers area, which is in new orleans and is regulated by the city council. entergy louisiana requested a rate increase of $13 million over three years , including a
10.4% return on common equity and a formula rate plan mechanism identical to its lpsc request. in january 2014 the city council advisors filed direct testimony recommending a rate increase of $5.56 million over three years , including an 8.13% return on common equity. in june 2014 the city council unanimously approved a settlement that includes the following:
•  recovery of an additional$853 thousandannually through a miso recovery rider; and the adoption of a four-year formula rate plan requiring the filing of annual evaluation reports in may of
•  each year, commencing may 2015, with resulting rates being implemented in october of each year.  the formula rate plan includes a midpoint target authorized return on common equity of9.95%with a +/-40basis point bandwidth.
the rate increase was effective with bills rendered on and after the first billing cycle of july 2014. additional compliance filings were made with the city council in october 2014 for approval of the form of certain rate riders, including among others, a ninemile 6 non-fuel cost recovery interim rider, allowing for contemporaneous recovery of capacity
table of contents entergy new orleans, inc. and subsidiaries management's financial discussion and analysis costs related to the commencement of commercial operation of the ninemile 6 generating unit and a purchased power capacity cost recovery rider. the monthly ninemile 6 cost recovery interim rider was implemented in december 2014
to initially collect $915 thousand from entergy louisiana customers in the algiers area.
as a provision of the settlement agreement approved by the city council in may 2015 providing for the algiers asset transfer, it was agreed that, with limited exceptions, no action may be taken with respect to entergy new orleans's base rates until rates are implemented from a base rate case that must be filed for its electric and gas operations in 2018. this provision eliminated the formula rate plan applicable to algiers operations. the limited exceptions include continued implementation of the remaining two years of the four-year phased-in rate increase for the algiers area and certain exceptional cost increases or decreases in the base revenue requirement. an additional provision of the settlement agreement allows for continued recovery of the revenue requirement associated with the capacity and energy from ninemile 6 received by entergy new orleans under a power purchase agreement with entergy louisiana (algiers ppa). the settlement authorizes entergy new orleans to recover the remaining revenue requirement related to the algiers ppa through base rates charged to algiers customers. the settlement also provided for continued implementation of the algiers miso recovery rider.
in addition to the algiers ppa, entergy new orleans has a separate power purchase agreement with entergy louisiana for 20% of the capacity and energy from ninemile 6 (ninemile ppa), which commenced operation in december 2014.
initially, recovery of the non-fuel costs associated with the ninemile ppa was authorized through a special ninemile 6 rider billed to only entergy new orleans customers outside of algiers.
in august 2015, entergy new orleans filed an application with the city council seeking authorization to proceed with the purchase of union power block 1, with an expected base purchase price of approximately $237 million , subject to adjustments, and seeking approval of the recovery of the associated costs. in november 2015 the city council issued written resolutions and an order approving an agreement in principle between entergy new orleans and city council advisors providing that the purchase of union power block 1 and related assets by entergy new orleans is prudent and in the public interest. the city council authorized expansion of the terms of the purchased power and capacity acquisition cost recovery rider to recover the non-fuel purchased power expense from ninemile 6, the revenue requirement associated with the purchase of power block 1 of the union power station, and a credit to customers of $400 thousand monthly beginning june 2016 in recognition of the decrease in other operation and maintenance expenses that would result with the deactivation of michoud units 2 and 3. in march 2016, entergy new orleans purchased power block 1 of the union power station for approximately $237 million and initiated recovery of these costs with march 2016 bills. in july 2016, entergy new orleans and the city council utility committee agreed to a temporary increase in the michoud credit to customers to a total of $1.4 million monthly for august 2016
a 2008 rate case settlement included $3.1 million per year in electric rates to fund the energy smart energy efficiency programs. in september 2009 the city council approved the energy efficiency programs filed by entergy new orleans. the rate settlement provides an incentive for entergy new orleans to meet or exceed energy savings targets set by the city council and provides a mechanism for entergy new orleans to recover lost contribution to fixed costs associated with the energy savings generated from the energy efficiency programs. in october 2013 the city council approved the extension of the energy smart program through december 2014. the city council approved the use of $3.5 million of rough production cost equalization funds for program costs. in addition, entergy new orleans will be allowed to recover its lost contribution to fixed costs and to earn an incentive for meeting program goals. in january 2015 the city council approved extending the energy smart program through march 2015 and using $1.2 million of rough production cost equalization funds to cover program costs for the extended period.

using the remainder of the approximately $12.8 million of 2014 rough production cost equalization funds, with any remaining costs being recovered through the fuel adjustment clause. this funding methodology was modified in november 2015 when the city council directed entergy new orleans to use a combination of guaranteed customer savings related to a prior agreement with the city council and rough production cost equalization funds to cover program costs prior to recovering any costs through the fuel adjustment clause. in february 2017, entergy new orleans filed a proposed implementation

fuel and purchased power cost recovery entergy new orleans's electric rate schedules include a fuel adjustment tariff designed to reflect no more than targeted fuel and purchased power costs, adjusted by a surcharge or credit for deferred fuel expense arising from the monthly reconciliation of actual fuel and purchased power costs incurred with fuel cost revenues billed to customers, including carrying charges.
entergy new orleans's gas rate schedules include a purchased gas adjustment to reflect estimated gas costs for the billing month, adjusted by a surcharge or credit similar to that included in the electric fuel adjustment clause, including carrying charges.
due to higher fuel costs associated in part with the extended grand gulf outage and the partially simultaneous union power block 1 planned outage, for the december 2016, january 2017, and february 2017 billing months, the city council authorized entergy new orleans to cap the fuel adjustment charge billed to customers at $0.035 per kwh and to defer billing of all fuel costs in excess of the capped amount by including such costs in the over- or under-

table of contents entergy texas, inc. and subsidiaries management's financial discussion and analysis results of operations net income
net income increased $37.9 million primarily due to lower other operation and maintenance expenses, the asset write-off of its receivable associated with the spindletop gas storage facility in 2015, and higher net revenue.
net income decreased $5.2 million primarily due to the asset write-off of its receivable associated with the spindletop gas storage facility and higher other operation and maintenance expenses, partially offset by higher net revenue and a lower effective tax rate.
net revenue consists of operating revenues net of: 1) fuel, fuel-related expenses, and gas purchased for resale, 2)
purchased power expenses, and 3) other regulatory charges. following is an analysis of the change in net revenue comparing 2016 to 2015.
purchased power capacity            12.4
the reserve equalization variance is primarily due to a reduction in reserve equalization expense primarily due to changes in the entergy system generation mix compared to the same period in 2015 as a result of the execution of a new purchased power agreement and entergy mississippi's exit from the system agreement, each in november 2015, and entergy texas's exit from the system agreement in august 2016. see note 2 to the financial statements for a discussion of the system agreement.
the purchased power capacity variance is primarily due to decreased expenses due to the termination of the purchased power agreements between entergy louisiana and entergy texas in august 2016, as well as capacity cost changes for ongoing purchased power capacity contracts.
the transmission revenue variance is primarily due to an increase in attachment o rates charged by miso to transmission customers and a settlement of attachment o rates previously billed to transmission customers by miso.
table of contents entergy texas, inc. and subsidiaries management's financial discussion and analysis the retail electric price variance is primarily due to the implementation of the transmission cost recovery factor rider, as approved by the puct and implemented in september 2016, and the increase in the distribution cost recovery rider, as approved by the puct and implemented in january 2016. this increase was partially offset by a decrease in energy efficiency revenues. see note 2 to the financial statements for further discussion of the transmission cost recovery factor rider and distribution cost recovery factor rider filings.
the net wholesale revenue variance is primarily due to lower capacity revenues resulting from the termination of the purchased power agreements between entergy louisiana and entergy texas in august 2016.
net revenue consists of operating revenues net of: 1) fuel, fuel-related expenses, and gas purchased for resale, 2)
purchased power expenses, and 3) other regulatory charges. following is an analysis of the change in net revenue comparing 2015 to 2014.
purchased power capacity            (5.6  )
increase in the average number of customers, partially offset by a decrease in sales to industrial customers and the effect of less favorable weather on residential sales. the decrease in industrial sales is primarily due to extended seasonal outages for existing large refinery customers, partially offset by new customers in the transportation industry.
the retail electric price variance is primarily due to an annual base rate increase of $18.5 million, effective april 2014, as a result of the puct's order in the september 2013 rate case, the implementation of the distribution cost recovery rider, as approved by the puct, and an increase in the energy efficiency rider, as approved by the puct, each effective january 2015. energy efficiency revenues are largely offset by costs included in other operation and maintenance expenses and have a minimal effect on net income. see note 2 to the financial statements for further discussion of the rate case.
the purchased power capacity variance is primarily due to increased expenses due to contract changes and price changes for ongoing purchased power capacity.
table of contents entergy texas, inc. and subsidiaries management's financial discussion and analysis other income statement variances

•  an increase of $7.5 million in transmission expenses primarily due to an increase in the amount of transmission costs allocated by miso;
•  a net increase of $6.4 million in energy efficiency costs for fixed costs collected from customers; and the write-off in the third quarter 2015 of $4.3 million of rate case expenses and acquisition costs related

table of contents entergy texas, inc. and subsidiaries management's financial discussion and analysis liquidity and capital resources cash flow cash flows for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014 were as follows:
operating activities                              306,601        284,268        315,164

period operating activities net cash flow provided by operating activities increased $22.3 million in 2016 primarily due to increased net income and a decrease of $31.8 million in income tax payments in 2016. entergy texas had income tax payments in
2016 and 2015 in accordance with the entergy corporation and subsidiary companies intercompany income tax allocation agreement. the income tax payments in 2016 resulted primarily from adjustments associated with the settlement of the 2010-2011 irs audit; whereas, the income tax payments in 2015 resulted primarily from the results of operations and the reversal of taxable temporary differences. see note 3 to the financial statements for a discussion of the income tax audit. the increase was partially offset by an increase of $5.2 million in interest paid in 2016 due to the issuance of $125 million of 2.55% series first mortgage bonds in march 2016 and the timing of collections from customers.
net cash flow provided by operating activities decreased $30.9 million in 2015 primarily due to:
•  with the entergy corporation and subsidiary companies intercompany income tax allocation agreement.  the income tax payments in 2015 resulted primarily from the results of operations and the reversal of taxable temporary differences; and a net decrease of $24 million related to the system agreement bandwidth remedy payments in 2014.  in the second quarter 2014, entergy texas received total payments of $48.6 million as a result of the compliance
•  filing pursuant to the ferc's february 2014 orders related to the bandwidth payments/receipts for the june -
december 2005 period, of which $24.6 million was refunded to entergy texas customers as of december 31,
the decrease was partially offset by an increase due to the timing of recovery of fuel and purchased power costs.
investing activities net cash flow used in investing activities increased $14.9 million in 2016 primarily due to increases of $27.7
million in transmission construction expenditures and $11.7 million in distribution construction expenditures primarily due to a greater scope of projects in 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015. the increase was partially offset by a $21.4 million decrease in fossil-fueled generation construction expenditures primarily due to a decreased scope of work performed during plant outages in 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015.
table of contents entergy texas, inc. and subsidiaries management's financial discussion and analysis net cash flow used in investing activities increased $128.8 million in 2015 primarily due to:
•  an increase in transmission construction expenditures primarily due to a greater scope of projects in 2015;
•  an increase in information technology capital expenditures due to various technology projects and upgrades in 2015; and
•  an increase in fossil-fueled generation construction expenditures primarily due to lewis creek dam repairs in 2015 and a greater scope of work done during outages in 2015.
financing activities net cash flow provided by financing activities increased $24.8 million in 2016 primarily due to the retirement of
$200 million of 3.6% series first mortgage bonds in june 2015 and the issuance of $125 million of 2.55% series first mortgage bonds in march 2016, partially offset by the issuance of $250 million of 5.15% series first mortgage bonds in may 2015 and money pool activity.
decreases in entergy texas's payable to the money pool are a use of cash flow, and entergy texas's payable to the money pool decreased by $22.1 million in 2016 compared to increasing by $22.1 million in 2015. the money pool is an inter-company borrowing arrangement designed to reduce the utility subsidiaries' need for external short-term borrowings.
entergy texas's financing activities provided $2.8 million of cash in 2015 compared to using $144.7 million of cash in 2014 primarily due to the following activity:
•  the retirement, prior to maturity, of $150 million of 7.875% series first mortgage bonds in june 2014;
$70 million in common stock dividends paid in 2014.  entergy texas did not pay dividends to its parent in
•  2015 primarily because of lower operating cash flows and higher capital expenditures, each discussed above;
•  money pool activity.
these activities were partially offset by the retirement of $200 million of 3.6% series first mortgage bonds in june 2015 and the issuance of $135 million of 5.625% series first mortgage bonds in may 2014.
capital structure entergy texas's capitalization is balanced between equity and debt, as shown in the following table.
debt to capital                         58.5  %                    60.2  %

net debt consists of debt less cash and cash equivalents. debt consists of long-term debt, including the currently maturing portion. capital consists of debt and common equity. net capital consists of capital less cash and cash equivalents. entergy texas uses the debt to capital ratios excluding securitization bonds in analyzing its financial
table of contents entergy texas, inc. and subsidiaries management's financial discussion and analysis condition and believes they provide useful information to its investors and creditors in evaluating entergy texas's financial condition because the securitization bonds are non-recourse to entergy texas, as more fully described in note 5 to the financial statements. entergy texas also uses the net debt to net capital ratio excluding securitization bonds in analyzing its financial condition and believes it provides useful information to its investors and creditors in evaluating entergy texas's financial condition because net debt indicates entergy texas's outstanding debt position that could not be readily satisfied by cash and cash equivalents on hand.
entergy texas seeks to optimize its capital structure in accordance with its regulatory requirements and to control its cost of capital while also maintaining equity capitalization at a level consistent with investment-grade debt ratings. to the extent that operating cash flows are in excess of planned investments, cash may be used to reduce outstanding debt or may be paid as a dividend, or both, in appropriate amounts to maintain the targeted capital structure. to the extent that operating cash flows are insufficient to support planned investments, entergy texas may issue incremental debt or reduce dividends, or both, to maintain its targeted capital structure. in addition, in certain infrequent circumstances, such as large transactions that would materially alter the capital structure if financed entirely with debt and reducing dividends, entergy texas may receive equity contributions to maintain the targeted capital structure.
uses of capital entergy texas requires capital resources for:
•  construction and other capital investments;
•  debt maturities or retirements;
•  working capital purposes, including the financing of fuel and purchased power costs; and
following are the amounts of entergy texas's planned construction and other capital investments.
-in millions planned construction and capital investment:
(a)  includes estimated interest payments.  long-term debt is discussed in note 5 to the financial statements.
(b)  does not include power purchase agreements that are accounted for as leases that are included in purchase obligations.

management's financial discussion and analysis system energy's principal asset currently consists of an ownership interest and a leasehold interest in grand gulf.
the capacity and energy from its 90% interest is sold under the unit power sales agreement to its only four customers, entergy arkansas, entergy louisiana, entergy mississippi, and entergy new orleans. system energy's operating revenues are derived from the allocation of the capacity, energy, and related costs associated with its
90% interest in grand gulf pursuant to the unit power sales agreement. payments under the unit power sales agreement are system energy's only source of operating revenues.
income taxes the effective income tax rates for 2016, 2015, and 2014 were 42.3%, 32.3%, and 46.4%, respectively. see note 3 to the financial statements for a reconciliation of the federal statutory rate of 35% to the effective income tax rates.
liquidity and capital resources cash flow cash flows for the years ended december 31, 2016 , 2015 , and 2014 were as follows:

table of contents system energy resources, inc.
management's financial discussion and analysis operating activities net cash flow provided by operating activities decreased $160.6 million in 2016 primarily due to:
2016 and 2015 in accordance with the entergy corporation and subsidiary companies intercompany income tax
•  allocation agreement.  the income tax refunds in 2016 and 2015 resulted primarily from the adoption of a new accounting method for income tax purposes in which system energy will treat its nuclear decommissioning costs as production costs of electricity includable in cost of goods sold.  see note 3 to the financial statements for further discussion of the adoption of the new accounting method; and
the decrease was partially offset by proceeds of $28.4 million received in august 2016 from the doe resulting from litigation regarding spent nuclear fuel storage costs that were previously expensed. see note 8 to the financial statements for a discussion of the spent nuclear fuel litigation.
net cash flow provided by operating activities increased $74.3 million in 2015 primarily due to an increase in income tax refunds of $104 million in 2015 and a decrease of $40.2 million in spending on nuclear refueling outages in 2015. the increase was partially offset by an increase in interest paid on the grand gulf sale-leaseback obligation as a result of the renewal in december 2013. system energy received income tax refunds in 2015 and 2014
in accordance with the entergy corporation and subsidiary companies intercompany income tax allocation agreement.

investing activities net cash flow used in investing activities increased $95 million in 2016 primarily due to:
fluctuations in nuclear fuel activity because of variations from year to year in the timing and pricing of
•  fuel reload requirements in the utility business, material and services deliveries, and the timing of cash payments during the nuclear fuel cycle; and an increase in nuclear construction expenditures primarily as a result of a higher scope of work performed
•  in 2016 on grand gulf outage projects, partially offset by decreased spending in 2016 on compliance with nrc post-fukushima requirements.
the increase was partially offset by money pool activity and proceeds of $15.8 million received in august 2016 from the doe resulting from litigation regarding spent nuclear fuel storage costs that were previously capitalized. see note 8 to the financial statements for discussion of the spent nuclear fuel litigation.
the money pool is an inter-company borrowing arrangement designed to reduce the utility subsidiaries' need for external short-term borrowings.
net cash flow used in investing activities decreased $66.4 million in 2015 primarily due to fluctuations in nuclear fuel activity because of variations from year to year in the timing and pricing of fuel reload requirements in the utility business, material and services deliveries, and the timing of cash payments during the nuclear fuel cycle.

see note 5 to the financial statements for details of long-term debt.
capital structure system energy's capitalization is balanced between equity and debt, as shown in the following table. the increase in the debt to capital ratio for system energy is primarily due to net borrowings of $66.9 million on the system energy nuclear fuel company variable interest entity's credit facility and common stock dividends and distributions in 2016.
debt to capital              45.5  %                    42.3  %
net debt to net capital      33.5  %                    30.5  %
table of contents system energy resources, inc.
management's financial discussion and analysis net debt consists of debt less cash and cash equivalents. debt consists of short-term borrowings and long-term debt, including the currently maturing portion. capital consists of debt and common equity. net capital consists of capital less cash and cash equivalents. system energy uses the debt to capital ratio in analyzing its financial condition and believes it provides useful information to its investors and creditors in evaluating system energy's financial condition. system energy uses the net debt to net capital ratio in analyzing its financial condition and believes it provides useful information to its investors and creditors in evaluating system energy's financial condition because net debt indicates system energy's outstanding debt position that could not be readily satisfied by cash and cash equivalents on hand.
system energy seeks to optimize its capital structure in accordance with its regulatory requirements and to control its cost of capital while also maintaining equity capitalization at a level consistent with investment-grade debt ratings. to the extent that operating cash flows are in excess of planned investments, cash may be used to reduce outstanding debt or may be paid as a dividend, or both, in appropriate amounts to maintain the targeted capital structure. to the extent that operating cash flows are insufficient to support planned investments, system energy may issue incremental debt or reduce dividends, or both, to maintain its targeted capital structure.
uses of capital system energy requires capital resources for:
•  construction and other capital investments;
•  debt maturities or retirements;
•  working capital purposes, including the financing of fuel costs; and
following are the amounts of system energy's planned construction and other capital investments.
-in millions planned construction and capital investment:
(a)  includes estimated interest payments.  long-term debt is discussed in note 5 to the financial statements.
purchase obligations represent the minimum purchase obligation or cancellation charge for contractual
(b)  obligations to purchase goods or services.  for system energy, it includes nuclear fuel purchase obligations.
in addition to the contractual obligations given above, system energy expects to contribute approximately $18.1
million to its qualified pension plans and approximately $690 thousand to other postretirement health care and life insurance plans in 2017, although the 2017 required pension contributions will be known with more certainty when the january 1, 2017 valuations are completed, which is expected by april 1, 2017. see "

- qualified pension and other postretirement benefits " below for a discussion of qualified pension and other postretirement benefits funding.
table of contents system energy resources, inc.
management's financial discussion and analysis also in addition to the contractual obligations, system energy has $382.3 million of unrecognized tax benefits and interest net of unused tax attributes and payments for which the timing of payments beyond 12 months cannot be reasonably estimated due to uncertainties in the timing of effective settlement of tax positions. see note 3 to the financial statements for additional information regarding unrecognized tax benefits.
in addition to routine spending to maintain operations, the planned capital investment estimate includes specific investments and initiatives such as the nuclear fleet operational excellence initiative, as discussed below in "
nuclear matters ," and plant improvements.
as a wholly-owned subsidiary, system energy dividends its earnings to entergy corporation at a percentage determined monthly.
sources of capital system energy's sources to meet its capital requirements include:
•  internally generated funds;
•  bank financing under new or existing facilities.
system energy may refinance, redeem, or otherwise retire debt prior to maturity, to the extent market conditions and interest and dividend rates are favorable.
all debt and common stock issuances by system energy require prior regulatory approval. debt issuances are also subject to issuance tests set forth in its bond indentures and other agreements. system energy has sufficient capacity under these tests to meet its foreseeable capital needs.
system energy's receivables from the money pool were as follows as of december 31 for each of the following years.
see note 4 to the financial statements for a description of the money pool.
the system energy nuclear fuel company variable interest entity has a credit facility in the amount of $120 million scheduled to expire in may 2019. as of december 31, 2016, $66.9 million in letters of credit were outstanding under the credit facility to support a like amount of commercial paper issued by the system energy nuclear fuel company variable interest entity. see note 4 to the financial statements for additional discussion of the variable interest entity credit facility.
system energy obtained authorizations from the ferc through october 2017 for the following:
•  long-term borrowings and security issuances; and
•  long-term borrowings by its nuclear fuel company variable interest entity.

complaint against system energy in january 2017 the apsc and mpsc filed a complaint with the ferc against system energy. the complaint seeks a reduction in the return on equity component of the unit power sales agreement pursuant to which system energy sells its grand gulf capacity and energy to entergy arkansas, entergy louisiana, entergy mississippi, and entergy new orleans. entergy arkansas also sells some of its grand gulf capacity and energy to entergy louisiana, entergy mississippi, and entergy new orleans under separate agreements. the current return on equity under the unit power sales agreement is 10.94%. the complaint alleges that the return on equity is unjust and unreasonable because current capital market and other considerations indicate that it is excessive. the complaint requests the ferc to institute proceedings to investigate the return on equity and establish a lower return on equity, and also requests that the ferc establish january 23, 2017 as a refund effective date. the complaint includes return on equity analysis that purports to establish that the range of reasonable return on equity for system energy is between
8.37% and 8.67%. system energy answered the complaint in february 2017 and disputes a return on equity of 8.37% to
nuclear matters system energy owns and operates grand gulf. system energy is, therefore, subject to the risks related to owning and operating a nuclear plant. these include risks from the use, storage, handling and disposal of high-level and low-
level radioactive materials, regulatory requirement changes, including changes resulting from events at other plants, limitations on the amounts and types of insurance commercially available for losses in connection with nuclear operations, and technological and financial uncertainties related to decommissioning nuclear plants at the end of their licensed lives, including the sufficiency of funds in decommissioning trusts. in the event of an unanticipated early shutdown of grand gulf, system energy may be required to provide additional funds or credit support to satisfy regulatory requirements for decommissioning. in december 2016, the nrc granted the extension of grand gulf's operating license to 2044.
in 2016, entergy conducted a comprehensive evaluation of the entergy nuclear fleet and determined that it is necessary to increase investments in its nuclear plants to position the fleet to meet its operational goals. these investments will result in increased operating and capital costs associated with operating entergy's nuclear plants going forward. the preliminary estimates of the increase to planned capital costs for 2017 through 2019 identified through and associated with this initiative are estimated to be $265 million for system energy. the current estimates of the capital costs identified through this initiative are included in system energy's capital investment plan preliminary estimate for 2017 through 2019 given in "
liquidity and capital resources - uses of capital
" above. the increase to planned other operation and maintenance expenses identified through and associated with this initiative is preliminarily estimated to be approximately $35 million in 2017 for system energy, with a similar level of expenses expected to continue going forward. in addition, nuclear refueling outage expenses are expected to increase going forward.
the nuclear industry continues to address susceptibility to stress corrosion cracking of certain materials within the plant systems. the issue is applicable at all nuclear units to varying degrees and is managed in accordance with industry standard practices and guidelines that include in-service examinations, replacements, and mitigation strategies. developments in the industry or identification of issues at the nuclear units could require unanticipated remediation efforts that cannot be quantified in advance.

management's financial discussion and analysis grand gulf outage and nrc review grand gulf began a maintenance outage on september 8, 2016 to replace a residual heat removal pump. although the pump had been replaced, on september 27, 2016 management decided to keep the plant in an outage for additional training and other steps to support management's operational goals. grand gulf returned to service on january 31,
based on the plant's recent performance indicators, in november 2016 the nrc placed grand gulf in the "regulatory response column," or column 2, of its reactor oversight process action matrix. additionally, in october 2016 the nrc commenced a special inspection to investigate the circumstances surrounding the unplanned unavailability of an alternate heat removal system during the september 2016 replacement of the heat removal pump and to evaluate the licensee's actions to address the causes of the event. depending upon the findings of the nrc and the plant's performance indicators, there is risk that the nrc could move grand gulf into the "degraded cornerstone column," or column 3, of the nrc's reactor oversight action matrix.
environmental risks system energy's facilities and operations are subject to regulation by various governmental authorities having jurisdiction over air quality, water quality, control of toxic substances and hazardous and solid wastes, and other environmental matters. management believes that system energy is in substantial compliance with environmental regulations currently applicable to its facilities and operations. because environmental regulations are subject to change, future compliance costs cannot be precisely estimated.
critical accounting estimates the preparation of system energy's financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to apply appropriate accounting policies and to make estimates and judgments that can have a significant effect on reported financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. management has identified the following accounting policies and estimates as critical because they are based on assumptions and measurements that involve a high degree of uncertainty, and there is the potential for future changes in the assumptions and measurements that could produce estimates that would have a material impact on the presentation of system energy's financial position or results of operations.

the retirement and mortality rate assumptions are reviewed every three-to-five years as part of an actuarial study that compares these assumptions to the actual experience of the pension and other postretirement plans. the 2014
actuarial study reviewed plan experience from 2010 through 2013. as a result of the 2014 actuarial study and the issuance of new mortality tables in october 2014 by the society of actuaries, changes were made to reflect modified demographic pattern expectations as well as longer life expectancies. these changes are reflected in the december
31, 2014 financial disclosures. adoption of the new mortality assumptions for 2015 resulted in an increase at december 31, 2014 of $17.7 million in the qualified pension benefit obligation and $3.1 million in the accumulated postretirement obligation. the new mortality assumptions increased anticipated 2015 qualified pension cost by approximately $2.7 million and other postretirement cost by approximately $0.4 million. in 2016, the mortality projection scale was updated to mp-2016, with no change in the base mortality table assumption.

million share repurchase program. the amount of share repurchases under these programs may vary as a result of material changes in business results or capital spending or new investment opportunities. in addition, in the first quarter 2016, entergy withheld 19,399 shares of its common stock at $68.09 per share, 36,439 shares of its common stock at $70.58 per share, and 82,619 shares of its common stock at $71.60 per share to pay income taxes due upon vesting of restricted stock granted and payout of performance units as part of its long-term incentive program.

table of contents internal control over financial reporting
the managements of entergy corporation, entergy arkansas, entergy louisiana, entergy mississippi, entergy new orleans, entergy texas, and system energy (individually "registrant" and collectively the "registrants") are responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the registrants. each registrant's internal control system is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the preparation and fair presentation of each registrant's financial statements presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
all internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.
each registrant's management assessed the effectiveness of each registrant's internal control over financial reporting as of december 31, 2016 . in making this assessment, each registrant's management used the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission (coso) in internal control -
integrated framework. the 2013 coso framework was utilized for management's assessment.
based on each management's assessment and the criteria set forth by the 2013 coso framework, each registrant's management believes that each registrant maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31, 2016 .
the report of deloitte & touche llp, entergy corporation's independent registered public accounting firm, regarding entergy corporation's internal control over financial reporting is included herein. the report of deloitte & touche llp is not applicable to entergy arkansas, entergy louisiana, entergy mississippi, entergy new orleans, entergy texas, and system energy because these registrants are non-accelerated filers.
changes in internal controls over financial reporting under the supervision and with the participation of each registrant's management, including its respective peo and pfo, each registrant evaluated changes in internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended december 31, 2016 and found no change that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, internal control over financial reporting.
table of contents attestation report of registered public accounting firm report of independent registered public accounting firm to the board of directors and shareholders of entergy corporation and subsidiaries new orleans, louisiana we have audited the internal control over financial reporting of entergy corporation and subsidiaries (the
"corporation") as of december 31, 2016, based on criteria established in internal control -integrated framework
(2013) issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission. the corporation's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in item 9a, internal control over financial reporting. our responsibility is to express an opinion on the corporation's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board (united states). those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
a company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company's principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company's board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. a company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
in our opinion, the corporation maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31, 2016, based on the criteria established in internal control -integrated framework
(2013) issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission.
we have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board (united states), the consolidated financial statements of the corporation as of and for the year ended december 31, 2016
and our report dated february 24, 2017 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.

•  no agreements providing for severance payments to executive officers that exceed 2.99 times annual base salary and annual incentive awards without shareholder approval
•  no unusual or excessive perquisites
•  no grants of supplemental service credit to newly-hired officers under any of entergy corporation's non-qualified retirement plans entergy corporation's pay for performance philosophy entergy corporation's executive compensation programs are based on a philosophy of pay for performance that is embodied in the design of its annual and long-term incentive plans. entergy corporation believes the executive pay programs described in this section and in the accompanying tables have played a significant role in its ability to drive strong financial and operational results and to attract and retain a highly experienced and successful management team. the annual incentive plan incentivizes and rewards the achievement of operational financial metrics that are deemed by the personnel committee to be consistent with the overall goals and strategic direction that the entergy corporation board has approved for entergy corporation. the long-term incentive programs further align the interests of entergy corporation executives and its shareholders by directly tying the value of the equity awards granted to executives under these programs to entergy corporation's stock price performance and total shareholder return. by incentivizing officers to achieve important financial and operational objectives and create long-term shareholder value, these programs play a key role in creating sustainable value for the benefit of all of entergy corporation's stakeholders, including its shareholders, customers, employees, and communities.
2016 incentive pay outcomes the 2016 incentive pay outcomes for the named executive officers demonstrated the application of entergy corporation's pay for performance philosophy.
annual incentive plan awards under the executive annual incentive plan or annual incentive plan are tied to entergy corporation's financial and operational performance through the entergy achievement multiplier (eam), which is the performance metric used to determine the maximum funding available for awards under the plan. the 2016 eam was determined based in equal part on entergy corporation's success in achieving its operational earnings per share and operational operating cash flow goals set at the beginning of the year. these goals were approved by the personnel committee based on entergy corporation's financial plan and the board's overall goals for entergy corporation and were consistent with its published earnings guidance.
2016 annual incentive program payout.for 2016, the personnel committee, based on a recommendation of the finance committee, determined that management exceeded its operational earnings per share goal of $5.35 per share by $1.76, but fell short of its operational operating cash flow goal of $3.180 billion by approximately $176 million.  based on the targets and ranges previously established by the committee, these results resulted in a calculated eam of 133%.  this determined the maximum funding level for the plan, and
•  for the named executive officers who are members of the office of the chief executive, the maximum award, as a percentage of target that could be received by them, subject to downward adjustment based on individual performance.  individual awards under the annual incentive plan for members of entergy corporation's office of the chief executive,  are determined by the personnel committee.  after considering individual performance, the personnel committee approved a payout of 133% of target for entergy corporation's chief executive officer and payouts ranging from 100% to 130% of target for the named executive officers who are members of the office of the chief executive.
after the eam was established to determine overall funding for the annual incentive plan, entergy corporation's chief executive officer allocated incentive award funding to individual business units based on business unit results. individual awards were determined for the named executive officers who are not members of the office of the chief executive by their immediate supervisor based on the individual officer's key accountabilities, accomplishments, and performance. this resulted in payouts that ranged from 60% of target to 125% of target for the named executive officers who are not members of entergy corporation's office of the chief executive.
long-term incentives long term incentives consist of three components to incentivize long-term value creation - performance units, stock options, and restricted stock. performance under the long-term performance unit program is measured over a three year period by assessing entergy corporation's total shareholder return in relation to the total shareholder return of the companies included in the philadelphia utility index. payouts, if any, are based on entergy corporation's total shareholder return performance in relation to its peers and are not subject to adjustment by the personnel committee. entergy corporation also uses stock options, which reward increases in the market value of its common stock, and restricted stock which is an effective retention mechanism.
long-term performance unit program payout.for the three year performance period ending in 2016, entergy
•  corporation's total shareholder return was in the third quartile, resulting in a payout of 36% of target for its executive officers.  payouts were made in shares of entergy corporation stock which are required to be held by executives until they satisfy the executive stock ownership guidelines.
table of contents what entergy corporation pays and why how entergy corporation sets target pay to develop a competitive compensation program, the personnel committee annually reviews compensation data from two sources:
use of competitive data the personnel committee uses published and private compensation survey data to develop marketplace compensation levels for the executive officers. the data, which are compiled by pay governance llc, the committee's independent compensation consultant, compare the current compensation opportunities provided to each of entergy corporation's executive officers against the compensation opportunities provided to executives holding similar positions at companies with corporate revenues similar to entergy corporation's. for non-industry specific positions, the committee reviews general industry data for total cash compensation (base salary and annual incentive) since the market for talent is broader than the utility sector. for management positions that are industry-specific, such as group president, utility operations, the committee reviews data from utility companies for total cash compensation.
however, for long-term incentives, all positions are reviewed relative to utility market data. the survey data reviewed by the committee cover hundreds of companies across a broad range of industries and approximately 60
investor-owned utility companies. in evaluating compensation levels against the survey data, the committee considers only the aggregated survey data. the identities of the companies participating in the compensation survey data are not disclosed to, or considered by, the committee in its decision-making process and, thus, are not considered material by the committee.
the committee uses this survey data to develop compensation opportunities that are designed to deliver total target compensation at approximately the 50th percentile of the surveyed companies in the aggregate. the survey data are the primary data used for purposes of assessing target compensation. as a result, mr. denault, entergy corporation's chief executive officer, is compensated at a higher level than the other named executive officers, reflecting market practices that compensate chief executive officers at greater potential compensation levels with more pay "at risk" than other named executive officers, due to the greater responsibilities and accountability required of a chief executive officer. in most cases, the committee considers its objectives to have been met if entergy corporation's chief executive officer and the eight (8) other executive officers who constitute what is referred to as the office of the chief executive each has a target compensation opportunity that falls within the range of 85% - 115% of the 50th percentile of the survey data. promoted officers or officers who are new to their roles may be transitioned into the targeted market range over time. actual compensation received by an individual officer may be above or below the targeted range based on an individual officer's skills, performance, experience, and responsibilities, entergy corporation performance, and internal pay equity. for 2016, the total target compensation of most of the named executive officers fell within the targeted range except there was one officer whose total targeted compensation was slightly above the targeted range, two officers whose total targeted compensation was slightly below the targeted range, based on skills, performance, experience and responsibilities, and internal pay equity, and one that was below the targeted range who is new to the role.
proxy analysis although the survey data described above are the primary data used in determining compensation, the committee reviews data derived from the proxy statements of companies included in the philadelphia utility index as an additional point of comparison. the proxy data are used to compare the compensation levels of the named executive officers who are members of the office of the chief executive with the compensation levels of the corresponding top
5 highest paid executive officers of the companies included in the philadelphia utility index, as reported in their proxy statements. the personnel committee uses this analysis to evaluate the overall reasonableness of entergy corporation's compensation programs. the following companies were included in the philadelphia utility index at the time the proxy data from the 2016 filings were compiled:

table of contents fixed compensation base salary the personnel committee determines the base salaries for all of the named executive officers who are members of the office of the chief executive based on competitive compensation data, performance considerations, and advice provided by the committee's independent compensation consultant. for the other named executive officers, their salaries are established by their immediate supervisors using the same criteria. the committee also considers internal pay equity; however, the committee has not established any predetermined formula against which the base salary of one named executive officer is measured against another officer or employee.
in 2016, all of the named executive officers, other than mr. bakken and mr. riley, received merit increases in their base salaries ranging from approximately 2.5% to 4.5%. the increases in base salary were made in light of current economic conditions and the projected growth in executive salaries in 2016 based on the market data previously discussed in this cd&a under "what entergy corporation pays and why - how entergy corporation sets target pay," as well as an internal pay equity comparison.
the following table sets forth the 2015 and 2016 base salaries for the named executive officers. except as indicated below, changes in base salaries for 2016 were effective in april.
when mr. bakken joined entergy in april 2016, his base salary was set at $605,000 based on competitive
(1)  market data that placed him at the 50th percentile of the market data discussed above, as well as internal pay equity considerations.
in april 2016, mr. brown received a merit increase of 4% to his base salary.  in may 2016, mr. brown's base salary was further adjusted to $605,000 following an external market competitive pay analysis to
(2)  reflect his additional responsibilities when he assumed leadership of entergy corporation's corporate communications and regulatory and governmental affairs groups, in addition to his leadership of entergy corporation's legal department.
(3)  in november 2016, mr. fisackerly's base salary was increased by 9.5% after a review of his compensation in light of his experience relative to competitive market data.
(4)  in may 2016, mr. riley's salary was increased from $306,168 to $335,000 when he became president and chief executive officer, entergy arkansas and assumed the increased responsibilities of that role.
table of contents variable compensation short-term compensation annual incentive plan performance-based incentives are included in the named executive officers' compensation packages because entergy corporation believes performance-based incentives encourage the named executive officers to pursue objectives consistent with the overall entergy corporation goals and strategic direction that the entergy corporation board has approved.
eam is the performance metric used to determine the maximum percentage of target annual plan opportunities that will be paid each year to each named executive officer who is a member of the office of the chief executive under the annual incentive plan. once the eam has been determined, individual awards for the office of the chief executive members may be adjusted downward, but not upward, from the eam at the personnel committee's discretion, based on individual performance and other factors deemed relevant by the personnel committee. for 2016, the target annual incentive plan opportunities for each of the named executive officers, expressed as a percentage of the officer's base salary, were:
•  135% for mr. denault;
•  70% for mr. bakken, mr. brown, mr. marsh, and mr. west;
•  60% for mr. may;
•  50% for mr. mcdonald; and
•  40% for mr. fisackerly, ms. rainer, mr. rice, and mr. riley.
the target opportunities established for these officers were comparable to the target opportunities historically set for these positions and levels of responsibility, except for mr. denault's and mr. riley's. mr. denault's target opportunity was set to align it with target opportunities of other chief executive officers based on the compensation survey data compiled by pay governance. mr. riley's target was set consistent with market and internal pay equity. target opportunities for the named executive officers who are members of the office of the chief executive are established by the personnel committee, and these named executive officers may earn a maximum payout ranging from 0% to 200% of their target opportunity, calculated as described in the table below.
target award opportunities are set based on an executive officer's position and executive management level within the entergy organization. executive management levels at entergy range from level 1 through level 4. at december
31, 2016, mr. denault held a level 1 position, messrs. bakken, brown, marsh, and west held positions in level 2, mr. may held a level 3 position, and the remaining named executive officers held positions in level 4. accordingly, their respective incentive award opportunities differ from one another based on their management level and the external market data developed by the committee's independent compensation consultant.
each year the personnel committee reviews the performance measures used to determine the eam. in december 2015, the personnel committee decided to retain operational earnings per share and operational operating cash flow, each measure weighted equally, as the performance measures for determining the eam. the committee considered a variety of other potential measures, but determined that operational earnings per share and operational operating cash flow continued to be the best metrics to use because, among other things, they are objective measures that entergy corporation's investors consider to be important in evaluating its financial performance and because entergy corporation's goals in that regard are broadly communicated both internally and externally. this provides both discipline and transparency that the committee believes are important objectives of any well designed incentive compensation plan.
the personnel committee also engages in a rigorous process each year to establish the targets for the annual incentive plan with a goal of establishing target achievement levels that are consistent with entergy corporation's strategy and business objectives for the upcoming year, as reflected in its financial plan, and sufficient to drive results that represent a high level of achievement, taking into consideration the applicable business environment and specific
table of contents challenges facing it. these targets are approved based on a comprehensive review by the full board of entergy corporation's financial plan, including changes in commodity market conditions and other key drivers of anticipated changes in performance from the preceding year. the committee also reviews the effects on plan results of various risks and opportunities that are recognized at the time the plan is set, to assure that targets that are determined based on the plan reflect an appropriate balance of risks and opportunities. the committee further confirms that the targets it approves are aligned with the earnings guidance that will be communicated to the financial markets, which assures that the internal targets entergy corporation sets for purposes of its incentive compensation plans are aligned with the external expectations set and communicated to its shareholders.
in january 2016, after full board review of management's 2016 financial plan for entergy corporation and engaging in the process discussed above, the committee determined the annual incentive plan targets to be used for purposes of determining annual incentive plan awards for 2016. in keeping with its past practice, the committee also determined that for purposes of measuring performance against such targets, the committee would exclude the effect on reported results of any major storms that may occur during the year. this exclusion was viewed by the committee as appropriate because although entergy corporation includes estimates for minor storm events in its financial plan, it does not include estimates for a major storm event, such as a hurricane. the committee also approved the exclusion from reported results of the outcome of a pending regulatory litigation matter, to the extent such outcome was not treated as a special item and excluded from operational results. neither of these pre-approved exclusions ultimately resulted in any adjustment to the reported results.
in determining the targets to set for 2016, the committee reviewed anticipated drivers for operational earnings per share and operational operating cash flow for 2016 as set forth in entergy corporation's financial plan. under the plan, operational earnings per share were expected to decline from 2015 results due primarily to the significant impact on 2015 operational results of tax benefits and, to a lesser extent, favorable weather, which were not anticipated to recur in 2016. together, they accounted for $1.89 of operational earnings per share for 2015. under the plan, operational operating cash flow was also expected to decline slightly in 2016 from 2015 results due primarily to the timing of recovery of certain fuel and purchased power costs in the utility business.
after adjusting to eliminate the impact of weather and tax benefits, the 2016 plan targets for operational earnings per share required management to achieve strong growth in utility operational earnings and modest growth in entergy wholesale commodities operational earnings, despite an expectation for further declines in wholesale energy and capacity prices. while the resulting targets represented declines from 2015 operational results, the committee concluded, based on a careful review of the overall plan, that the targets derived from the plan challenged management appropriately to deliver strong growth in entergy corporation's core business while continuing to manage the significant risks at entergy wholesale commodities and represented an appropriate balancing of entergy corporation's business risks and opportunities for 2016.
the following table shows the resulting annual incentive plan targets established by the personnel committee in january 2016, and 2016 results:

table of contents in january 2017, the finance and personnel committees jointly reviewed entergy corporation's financial results against the performance objectives reflected in the table above. management discussed with the committees the operational earnings per share and operating cash flow results for 2016, including primary factors explaining how those results compared to the 2016 business plan and annual incentive plan targets. operational earnings per share exceeded the operational earnings per share goal of $5.35 per share set at the beginning of the year by $1.76, but management fell short of achieving its operational operating cash flow goal of $3.180 billion by approximately $176
million, leading to a calculated eam of 133%. operational results excluded the impact of certain special items that were excluded from as-reported (gaap) earnings per share and operating cash flow to determine operational earnings per share and operational operating cash flow, including asset impairments and related write-offs at entergy wholesale commodities related to entergy corporation's 2016 decision to close two nuclear generating plants, and certain costs associated with nuclear plant closings. the personnel committee did not make any adjustments to the operational earnings per share and operating cash flow results to determine the eam for 2016.
for members of entergy corporation's office of the chief executive, individual executive officer awards under the annual incentive plan are determined by the personnel committee. in determining these individual executive officer awards under the annual incentive plan, the committee considered individual performance and, in particular, whether there were additional factors beyond those captured by the eam measures that should be taken into account in determining whether to exercise negative discretion to reduce awards below the levels determined by the eam. in determining the extent of negative discretion, if any, that it would exercise with respect to each named executive officer who is a member of the office of the chief executive, the committee considered the executive's key accountabilities and accomplishments, time in role, and individual performance executing on entergy corporation's strategies in 2016. this resulted in a payout equal to the eam, or 133% of target, for the chief executive officer and awards ranging from 100% of target to 130% of target for the other named executive officers who are members of the office of the chief executive.
after the eam was established to determine overall funding for the annual incentive plan, entergy corporation's chief executive officer allocated incentive award funding to individual business units based on business unit results. individual awards were determined for the remaining named executive officers who are not members of the office of the chief executive by their immediate supervisor based on the individual officer's key accountabilities, accomplishments, and performance. this resulted in payouts that ranged from 60% of target to 125% of target for the named executive officers who are not members of the office of the chief executive.
based on the foregoing evaluation of management performance, the personnel committee approved the following annual incentive plan payouts to each named executive officer for 2016:
(1)  pursuant to the terms of the annual incentive plan, mr. mcdonald received a pro-rated annual incentive award since he retired prior to the end of the performance year.
table of contents long-term incentive compensation entergy corporation's goal for its long-term incentive compensation is to focus the executive officers on building shareholder value and to increase the executive officers' ownership of entergy corporation's common stock in order to more closely align their interest with those of its shareholders. in entergy corporation's long-term incentive compensation programs, a mix of performance units, restricted stock, and stock options are used. performance units reward the named executive officers on the basis of total shareholder return, which is a measure of stock price appreciation and dividend payments, in relation to the companies in the philadelphia utility index. restricted stock ties the executive officers' long-term financial interest to the long-term financial interests of entergy corporation's shareholders. stock options provide a direct incentive to increase the value of entergy corporation's common stock. in general, entergy corporation seeks to allocate the total value of long-term incentive compensation
60% to performance units and 40% to a combination of stock options and restricted stock, equally divided in value, based on the value the compensation model seeks to deliver. awards for individual named executive officers may vary from this target as a result of individual performance, promotions, and internal pay equity.
the performance units for the 2014-2016 and 2015-2017 performance periods were awarded under the 2011 equity ownership plan and long-term cash incentive plan (2011 equity ownership plan) and the performance units for the
2016-2018 performance period and all of the shares of restricted stock, stock options, and restricted stock units granted to the named executive officers in 2016 were granted pursuant to the 2015 equity ownership plan (the 2015
equity ownership plan, together with the 2011 equity ownership plan, the equity ownership plans). the equity ownership plans require both a change in control and an involuntary job loss or substantial diminution of duties (a
"double trigger") for the acceleration of these awards upon a change in control.
performance unit program entergy corporation issues performance unit awards to the named executive officers under the long-term performance unit program. each performance unit represents the value of one share of entergy corporation's common stock at the end of the three-year performance period, plus dividends accrued during the performance period. the personnel committee sets payout opportunities for the program at the outset of each performance period, and the program is structured to reward named executive officers only if performance goals approved by the personnel committee are met. the personnel committee has no discretion to make awards if minimum performance goals are not achieved.
the performance units granted under the long-term performance unit program and accrued dividends on any shares earned during the performance period are settled in shares of entergy corporation common stock rather than cash.
all shares paid out under the long-term performance unit program are required to be retained by the officers until applicable executive stock ownership requirements are met.
the long-term performance unit program specifies a minimum, target, and maximum achievement level, the achievement of which will determine the number of performance units that may be earned by each participant. entergy corporation measures performance by assessing entergy corporation's total shareholder return relative to the total shareholder return of the companies in the philadelphia utility index, which entergy corporation refers to as its peer companies. the personnel committee identified the philadelphia utility index as the appropriate industry peer group for this purpose because the companies included in this index, in the aggregate, approximate entergy corporation in terms of business and scale. the personnel committee chose relative total shareholder return as a measure of performance because it reflects entergy corporation's creation of shareholder value relative to other electric utilities over the performance period. it also takes into account dividends paid by the companies in this index and normalizes certain events that affect the industry as a whole. minimum, target, and maximum performance levels are determined by reference to the ranking of entergy corporation's total shareholder return against the total shareholder return of the companies in the philadelphia utility index.
performance unit program grants . at any given time, a participant in the long-term performance unit program may be participating in up to three performance periods. during 2016, eligible participants were participating
table of contents in the 2014-2016, 2015-2017, and 2016-2018 performance periods. subject to achievement of the applicable performance levels as described below, the personnel committee established the following target performance unit payout opportunities for each of the 2014-2016, 2015-2017, and 2016-2018 performance periods.

the range of potential payouts for the 2014-2016, 2015-2017, and 2016-2018 performance periods under the program is shown below.

payout for the 2014-2016 performance period . in january 2017, the committee reviewed entergy corporation's total shareholder return for the 2014-2016 performance period in order to determine the payout to participants for the
2014-2016 performance period. the committee compared entergy corporation's total shareholder return against the total shareholder return of the companies that comprise the philadelphia utility index, with the performance measures and range of potential payouts for the 2014-2016 performance period similar to that discussed above. as recommended by the finance committee, the personnel committee determined that entergy corporation's relative total shareholder return fell in the third quartile, resulting in payouts to the named executive officers of 36% of target. payouts under the performance unit program are made in shares of entergy corporation common stock. for the
2014-2016 performance period, the following numbers of shares of entergy corporation common stock, including dividend equivalents were issued:

(2)  as a new hire in 2016, mr. bakken was not eligible to participate in the 2014-2016 performance period.
(3)  pursuant to the terms of the long-term performance unit program, mr. mcdonald received a pro-rated award since he retired prior to the end of the performance period.
stock options and restricted stock stock options and restricted stock are granted as a long-term incentive to the executive officers. as previously discussed, the personnel committee considers several factors in determining the number of stock options and shares of restricted stock it will grant to the named executive officers, including entergy corporation and individual performance, internal pay equity, prevailing market practice, targeted long-term value created by the use of stock options and restricted stock, and the potential dilutive effect of stock option and restricted stock grants. the committee's assessment of individual performance of each named executive officer is the most important factor in determining the number of shares of restricted stock and stock options awarded, except with respect to the chief executive officer for whom comparative market data is the most important factor. stock option and restricted stock awards for entergy corporation's chief executive officer are determined solely by the personnel committee on the basis of the same considerations. mr. denault's 2016 awards are comparable to historical awards granted to entergy corporation's chief executive officer and reflect the decreased stock price at the time of grant.
the following table sets forth the number of stock options and shares of restricted stock granted to each named executive officer in 2016. the exercise price for each option was $70.56, which was the closing price of entergy corporation's common stock on the date of grant.

(1)  mr. bakken was not eligible to receive stock options or restricted stock in 2016.
(2)  in light of his upcoming retirement in may 2016, mr. mcdonald did not receive any stock options or restricted stock when the awards were determined in january 2016.
restricted stock units restricted stock units granted under the 2015 equity ownership plan represent phantom shares of entergy corporation common stock (i.e., non-stock interests that have an economic value equivalent to a share of its common stock).
entergy corporation occasionally grants restricted stock units for retention purposes, to offset forfeited compensation from a previous employer or for other limited purposes. if all conditions of the grant are satisfied, restrictions on the restricted units lift at the end of the restricted period, and the restricted stock units are settled in shares of entergy corporation common stock. restricted stock units are generally service-based awards for which restrictions lift, subject to continued employment, generally over a two- to five-year period.
on april 6, 2016, in connection with the commencement of his employment as chief nuclear officer, the personnel committee granted mr. bakken 30,000 restricted stock units. mr. bakken's award was made in part to recruit him to join entergy, to offset compensation that mr. bakken forfeited by joining entergy, in recognition of his leadership role as chief nuclear officer to transform the nuclear fleet, and to encourage retention of his leadership in light of his marketability as a chief nuclear officer.
mr. bakken's restricted stock units will vest and be settled in shares of entergy corporation's common stock in three equal installments on april 6, 2019, april 6, 2022, and april 6, 2025, provided that he remains continually employed as chief nuclear officer or in a comparable position through each vesting date. pursuant to his restricted stock unit agreement, if mr. bakken's employment terminates due to total disability or death, then he will vest in and be paid the 10,000 restricted stock units that otherwise would have vested had he satisfied the vesting conditions of the restricted stock unit agreement through the next vesting date to occur following the date of his death or total disability. additionally, if mr. bakken's employment is terminated by his entergy employer other than for cause on or before april 5, 2019, then he will vest in and be paid the 10,000 restricted stock units in which he otherwise would have vested on april 6, 2019, subject to mr. bakken timely executing and not revoking a release of claims against entergy corporation and its affiliates. in the event of a change in control, the unvested restricted stock units will fully vest upon mr. bakken's termination of employment by his entergy employer without cause or by mr. bakken with good reason during a change in control period (as defined in the 2015 equity ownership plan). otherwise, if mr. bakken voluntarily resigns or is terminated, he will forfeit all unvested stock units.

medical, dental, and vision coverage, life and accidental death and dismemberment insurance, business travel accident insurance, and long-term disability insurance.
health & welfare benefits  eligibility, coverage levels, potential employee contributions, and other plan design features are the same for the named executive officers as for the broad employee population.
corporate aircraft usage, annual physical exams, relocation assistance, and event tickets.  the office of the chief executive members do not receive tax gross ups on any benefits, except for relocation assistance.named executive officers who are not
2016 perquisites           members of the office of the chief executive also were provided in 2016 with club dues, housing allowances, where appropriate, and tax gross up payments on some perquisites.for additional information regarding perquisites, see the "all other compensation" column in the 2016 summary compensation table.
eligible individuals who become disabled under the terms of the plan are eligible executive disability plan  for 65% of the difference between their base salary and $276,923 (i.e. the base salary that produces the maximum $15,000 monthly disability payment under the general long-term disability plan).
entergy corporation provides these benefits to its named executive officers as part of providing a competitive executive compensation program and because it believes that these benefits are important retention and recruitment tools since many, if not all, of the companies with which entergy corporation competes for executive talent provide similar arrangements to their senior executive officers.
table of contents compensation arrangements mr. bakken's employment in connection with the commencement of his employment, mr. bakken received a sign-on bonus of $650,000 and received a grant of 30,000 restricted stock units on april 6, 2016, the terms of which are previously described. mr. bakken is also eligible for certain relocation benefits pursuant to entergy corporation's relocation assistance policy and to certain additional relocation benefits, including the direct purchase of his home at an agreed upon price, which the personnel committee determined was necessary to facilitate mr. bakken's transition to entergy corporation and to mitigate the expenses associated with his relocation. mr. bakken's sign-on bonus and certain of his relocation benefits are subject to forfeiture if mr. bakken terminates his service prior to the one year anniversary of his date of hire.
bakken was not eligible to participate in the 2014-2016 performance period, but received pro-rated target award opportunities for the 2015-2017 and 2016-2018 performance periods, in accordance with the terms of the program. mr.
bakken also participates in the cash balance plan and the cash balance equalization plan, retirement plans that are available to all eligible executive officers hired on or after july 1, 2014. for more information about the cash balance plan and the cash balance equalization plan, see "2016 pension benefits." beginning in 2017, mr. bakken also is eligible to participate in the annual stock option and restricted stock programs.
mr. bakken also participates in the nuclear retention plan, a retention plan for officers and other leaders with expertise in the nuclear industry. the personnel committee authorized this plan to attract and retain key management and employee talent in the nuclear power field, a field that requires unique technical and other expertise that is in great demand in the utility industry. the plan provides for bonuses to be paid annually over a three-year employment period with the bonus opportunity dependent on the participant's management level and continued employment. each annual payment is equal to an amount ranging from 15% to 30% of the employee's base salary as of their date of enrollment in the plan. mr. bakken's participation in the plan commenced in may 2016 and in accordance with the terms and conditions of the plan, in may 2017, 2018, and 2019, subject to his continued employment, mr. bakken will receive a cash bonus equal to 30% of his base salary as of may 1, 2016. this plan does not allow for accelerated or pro-rated payout upon termination of any kind. the three year coverage period and percentage of base salary payable under the plan are consistent with the terms of participation of other senior nuclear officers who participate in this plan.
the terms of mr. bakken's employment were reviewed by the personnel committee, were determined based on competitive market data, and were designed to reflect the competition for chief nuclear officer talent in the marketplace and the committee's assessment of the critical role this position plays in transforming the nuclear fleet and to encourage retention of his leadership in light of his marketability as a chief nuclear officer.
post-termination agreements and arrangements the personnel committee believes that retention and transitional compensation arrangements are an important part of overall compensation. the committee believes that these arrangements help to secure the continued employment and dedication of the named executive officers, notwithstanding any concern that they might have at the time of a change in control regarding their own continued employment. in addition, the committee believes that these arrangements are important as recruitment and retention devices, as all or nearly all of the companies with which entergy corporation competes for executive talent have similar arrangements in place for their senior employees.
to achieve these objectives, entergy corporation has established a system executive continuity plan under which each of the named executive officers is entitled to receive "change in control" payments and benefits if such officer's employment is involuntarily terminated in connection with a change in control of entergy corporation.
severance payments under the system executive continuity plan are based on a multiple of the sum of an executive officer's annual base salary plus his average annual incentive plan award for the two calendar years immediately preceding the calendar year in which the termination of employment occurs. under no circumstances can this multiple
table of contents exceed 2.99 times the sum of (a) the executive officer's annual base salary as in effect at any time within one year prior to the commencement of a change in control period or if higher, immediately prior to a circumstance constituting good reason plus (b) his annual incentive, calculated using the average annual target opportunity derived under the annual incentive plan for the two calendar years immediately preceding the calendar year in which the officer's termination occurs, or if higher, the annual incentive award actually received under the annual incentive plan for the calendar year immediately preceding the calendar year in which the termination of employment occurs. entergy corporation strives to ensure that the benefits and payment levels under the system executive continuity plan are consistent with market practices. the executive officers, including the named executive officers, will not receive any tax gross up payments on any severance benefits received under this plan. for more information regarding the system executive continuity plan, see "2016 potential payments upon termination or change in control-system executive continuity plan."
in certain cases, the committee may approve the execution of a retention agreement with an individual executive officer. these decisions are made on a case by case basis to reflect specific retention needs or other factors, including market practice. if a retention agreement is entered into with an individual officer, the committee considers the economic value associated with that agreement in making overall compensation decisions for that officer. entergy corporation has voluntarily adopted a policy that any employment or severance agreements providing severance benefits in excess of 2.99 times the sum of an officer's annual base salary and annual incentive award
(other than the value of the vesting or payment of an outstanding equity-based award or the pro rata vesting or payment of an outstanding long-term incentive award) must be approved by its shareholders.
entergy corporation currently has a retention agreement with mr. denault. in general, mr. denault's retention agreement provides for certain payments and benefits in the event of his termination of employment by entergy other than for cause, by mr. denault for good reason or on account of his death or disability. see "2016 potential payments upon termination or change in control - mr. denault's retention agreement." because mr. denault has reached age 55, certain severance payment provisions in his retention agreement no longer apply. mr. denault will not receive tax gross up payments on any payments or benefits he may receive under his agreement. mr. denault's retention agreement was entered into in 2006 when he was entergy corporation's chief financial officer and was designed to reflect the competition for chief financial officer talent in the marketplace at that time and the committee's assessment of the critical role this position played in executing entergy corporation's long-term financial and other strategic objectives. based on the market data provided by its former independent compensation consultant, the committee believes the benefits and payment levels under mr. denault's retention agreement are consistent with market practices.
for additional information regarding the system executive continuity plan and mr. denault's retention agreement described above, see "2016 potential payments upon termination or change in control."
compensation policies and practices entergy corporation strives to ensure that its compensation philosophy and practices are in line with the best practices of companies in its industry as well as other companies in the s&p 500. some of these practices include the following:
clawback provisions entergy corporation has adopted a clawback policy that covers all individuals subject to section 16 of the exchange act, including all of the members of the office of the chief executive. under the policy, the committee will require reimbursement of incentives paid to these executive officers where:
(i) the payment was predicated upon the achievement of certain financial results with respect to the applicable performance period that were subsequently determined to be the subject of a material restatement
•  other than a restatement due to changes in accounting policy; or (ii) a material miscalculation of a performance award occurs, whether or not the financial statements were restated and, in either such case, a lower payment would have been made to the executive officer based upon the restated financial results or correct calculation; or
table of contents in the board of directors' view, the executive officer engaged in fraud that caused or partially caused the
•  need for a restatement or caused a material miscalculation of a performance award, in each case, whether or not the financial statements were restated.
the amount the committee requires to be reimbursed is equal to the excess of the gross incentive payment made over the gross payment that would have been made if the original payment had been determined based on the restated financial results or correct calculation. further, following a material restatement of entergy corporation's financial statements, entergy corporation will seek to recover any compensation received by its chief executive officer and chief financial officer that is required to be reimbursed under section 304 of the sarbanes-oxley act of 2002.
stock ownership guidelines and share retention requirements for many years, entergy corporation has had stock ownership guidelines for executives, including the named executive officers. these guidelines are designed to align the executives' long-term financial interests with those of shareholders. annually, the personnel committee monitors the executive officers' compliance with these guidelines.

•  all net after-tax shares paid out under the long-term performance unit program;
•  all net after-tax shares of the restricted stock received upon vesting; and at least 75% of the after-tax net shares received upon the exercise of entergy corporation stock options, except for stock options granted before january 1, 2014, as to which the executive officer must retain at least 75% of the after-tax net shares until the earlier of achievement of the stock ownership guidelines or
trading controls and anti-pledging and anti-hedging policies executive officers, including the named executive officers, are required to receive the permission of entergy corporation's general counsel prior to entering into any transaction involving its securities, including gifts, other than the exercise of employee stock options. trading is generally permitted only during open trading windows occurring immediately following the release of earnings. employees, who are subject to trading restrictions, including the named executive officers, may enter into trading plans under rule 10b5-1 of the exchange act, but these trading plans may be entered into only during an open trading window and must be approved by entergy corporation. the named executive officer bears full responsibility if he or she violates this policy by permitting shares to be bought or sold without pre-approval or when trading is restricted.
entergy corporation also prohibits its directors and executive officers, including the named executive officers, from pledging any entergy corporation securities or entering into margin accounts involving its securities. entergy corporation prohibits these transactions because of the potential that sales of entergy corporation securities could occur outside trading periods and without the required approval of the general counsel.
an anti-hedging policy has also been adopted that prohibits officers, directors and employees from entering into hedging or monetization transactions involving entergy corporation's common stock. prohibited transactions include, without limitation, zero-cost collars, forward sale contracts, purchase or sale of options, puts, calls, straddles or equity swaps or other derivatives that are directly linked to entergy corporation's common stock or transactions
table of contents involving "short-sales" of entergy corporation's common stock. the entergy corporation board adopted this policy to require officers, directors and employees to continue to own entergy corporation stock with the full risks and rewards of ownership, thereby ensuring continued alignment of their objectives with those of its other shareholders.
how compensation decisions are made role of the personnel committee the personnel committee has overall responsibility for approving the compensation program for the named executive officers and makes all final compensation decisions regarding entergy corporation's named executive officers. the committee works with entergy corporation's executive management to ensure that the compensation policies and practices are consistent with its values and support the successful recruitment, development and retention of executive talent so entergy corporation can achieve its business objectives and optimize its long-term financial returns. each year, entergy corporation's senior vice president, human resources presents the proposed compensation model for the following year, including the compensation elements, mix of elements and measures for each element, and consults with entergy corporation's chief executive officer on recommended compensation for senior executives.
the committee evaluates executive pay each year to ensure that the compensation policies and practices are consistent with entergy corporation's philosophy. the personnel committee is responsible for, among its other duties, the following actions related to the named executive officers:
•  developing and implementing compensation policies and programs for hiring, evaluating, and setting compensation for the executive officers, including any employment agreement with an executive officer;
•  evaluating the performance of entergy corporation's chairman and chief executive officer; and
•  reporting, at least annually, to the board on succession planning, including succession planning for the chief executive officer.
role of the chief executive officer the personnel committee solicits recommendations from entergy corporation's chief executive officer with respect to compensation decisions for the named executive officers who are members of entergy corporation's office of the chief executive. entergy corporation's chief executive officer provides the personnel committee with an assessment of the performance of each of these named executive officers and recommends compensation levels to be awarded to each of them. in addition, the committee may request that the chief executive officer provide management feedback and recommendations on changes in the design of compensation programs, such as special retention plans or changes in the structure of bonus programs. however, the chief executive officer does not play any role with respect to any matter affecting his own compensation, nor does he have any role determining or recommending the amount or form of director compensation. the personnel committee also relies on the recommendations of entergy corporation's senior vice president, human resources with respect to compensation decisions, policies, and practices.
entergy corporation's chief executive officer may attend meetings of the personnel committee only at the invitation of the chair of the personnel committee and cannot call a meeting of the committee. since he is not a member of the committee, he has no vote on matters submitted to the committee. during 2016, mr. denault attended 6 meetings of the personnel committee.
role of the compensation consultant entergy corporation's personnel committee has the sole authority for the appointment, compensation, and oversight of its outside compensation consultant. the committee conducts an annual review of the compensation consultant, and in 2016, it retained pay governance llc as its independent compensation consultant to assist it in, among other things, evaluating different compensation programs and developing market data to assess the compensation programs.
also in 2016, the corporate governance committee retained pay governance to review and perform a competitive analysis of non-employee director compensation.
table of contents during 2016, pay governance assisted the committee with its responsibilities related to entergy corporation's compensation programs for its executives. the committee directed pay governance to: (i) regularly attend meetings of the committee; (ii) conduct studies of competitive compensation practices; (iii) identify entergy corporation's market surveys and proxy peer group; (iv) review base salary, annual incentives, and long-term incentive compensation opportunities relative to competitive practices; and (v) develop conclusions and recommendations related to the executive compensation plan of entergy corporation for consideration by the committee. a senior consultant from pay governance attended all personnel committee meetings to which he was invited in 2016.
compensation consultant independence to maintain the independence of the personnel committee's compensation consultant, the board has adopted a policy that any consultant (including its affiliates) retained by the board of directors or any committee of the board of directors to provide advice or recommendations on the amount or form of executive or director compensation should not be retained by entergy corporation or any of its affiliates to provide other services in an aggregate amount that exceeds $120,000 in any year. in 2016, the personnel committee's independent compensation consultant, pay governance, did not provide any services to entergy corporation other than its services to the personnel committee and the corporate governance committee. annually, the committee reviews the relationship with its compensation consultant, including services provided, quality of those services, and fees associated with services in its evaluation of the executive compensation consultant's independence. the committee also assesses pay governance's independence under nyse rules and has concluded that no conflict of interests exists that would prevent pay governance from independently advising the personnel committee.
tax and accounting considerations section 162(m) of the internal revenue code ("the code") limits the tax deductibility by a publicly held corporation of compensation in excess of $1 million paid to entergy corporation's chief executive officer or any of its other named executive officers who may be section 162(m) covered employees, unless that compensation is
"performance-based compensation" within the meaning of section 162(m). the personnel committee considers deductibility under section 162(m) as it structures the compensation packages that are provided to its named executive officers. likewise, the personnel committee considers financial accounting consequences as it structures the compensation packages that are provided to entergy corporation's named executive officers. however, the personnel committee and the board believe that it is in the best interest of entergy corporation that the personnel committee retains the flexibility and discretion to make compensation awards, whether or not deductible. this flexibility is necessary to foster achievement of performance goals established by the personnel committee, as well as other corporate goals that the committee deems important to entergy corporation's success, such as encouraging employee retention and rewarding achievement of key goals.
personnel committee report the personnel committee report included in the entergy corporation proxy statement is incorporated by reference, but will not be deemed to be "filed" in this annual report on form 10-k. none of the subsidiaries has a compensation committee or other board committee performing equivalent functions. the board of directors of each of the subsidiaries is comprised of individuals who are officers or employees of entergy corporation or one of the subsidiaries. these boards do not make determinations regarding the compensation paid to executive officers of the subsidiaries.
2016 summary compensation tables the following table summarizes the total compensation paid or earned by each of the named executive officers for the fiscal year ended december 31, 2016, and to the extent required by sec executive compensation disclosure rules, the fiscal years ended december 31, 2015 and 2014. for information on the principal positions held by each of the named executive officers, see item 10, "directors and executive officers of the registrants."
the compensation set forth in the table represents the aggregate compensation paid by all entergy system companies.

plan in 2006, mr. denault entered into an agreement granting him an additional 15 years of service and permission to retire under the non-qualified system executive retirement plan in the event his employment is terminated by his entergy employer other than for cause (as defined in the retention agreement), by mr.
(1)  denault for good reason (as defined in the retention agreement), or on account of his death or disability.
his retention agreement also provides that if he terminates employment for any other reason, he shall be entitled to the additional 15 years of service under the non-qualified system executive retirement plan only if his entergy employer grants him permission to retire.  the additional 15 years of service increases the present value of his benefit by $3,627,700.
(2)  service under the non-qualified system executive retirement plan is granted from date of hire.  qualified plan benefit service is granted from the later of date of hire or plan participation date.
(3)  does not include any credit service prior to his rehire date, however, the system executive retirement plan reflects a net credited service date of december 28, 1989.
qualified retirement benefits entergy retirement plan the qualified retirement plan in which the named executive officers, except for mr. bakken, participate is a funded, tax-qualified, noncontributory final average pay defined benefit pension plan that provides benefits to most of the non-bargaining unit employees of the entergy system companies. benefits under this plan are calculated as an annuity payable at age 65 and generally are equal to 1.5% of a participant's final average monthly earnings
(fame) multiplied by years of service (not to exceed 40). "earnings" for purposes of calculating fame generally includes the employee's base salary and eligible annual incentive award and excludes all other bonuses. fame is calculated using the employee's average monthly earnings for the 60 consecutive months in which the employee's earnings were highest during the 120 month period immediately preceding the employee's retirement and includes up to 5 annual bonuses paid during the 60 month period. benefits under this plan are payable monthly after attainment of at least age 55 and after separation from an entergy system company, subject to reduction for early commencement, as described below. the amount of annual earnings that may be considered in calculating fame and benefits under the tax-qualified pension plan is limited by the code. participants are 100% vested in their benefit upon completing 5 years of vesting service or upon attainment of age 65 while an active participant in the plan.
contributions to the pension plan are made entirely by the entergy employer and are paid into a trust fund from which the benefits of participants are paid.
normal retirement age under the plan is 65. employees who terminate employment prior to age 55 and have a vested benefit in the plan may receive a reduced vested retirement benefit commencing as early as age 55 that is based on the normal age 65 retirement benefit (reduced by 7% per year for the first 5 years commencement precedes age 65, and reduced by 6% for each additional year commencement precedes age 65). employees who are at least age 55 with at least 10 years of vesting service upon termination of employment are entitled to a subsidized early retirement benefit beginning as early as age 55. the subsidized early retirement benefit is equal to the normal age 65
retirement benefit reduced by 2% per year for each year that early retirement precedes age 65.
mr. denault, mr. brown, and ms. rainer are eligible for subsidized early retirement benefits.
cash balance plan the qualified defined benefit pension plan in which employees whose most recent hire or rehire date is on or after july 1, 2014 participate is a funded, tax-qualified, noncontributory cash balance defined benefit pension plan that provides benefits to most of the non-bargaining unit employees of the entergy system companies hired or rehired on or after july 1, 2014. mr. bakken is the only named executive officer who participates in this plan. generally, the normal retirement benefit under this plan, payable as a single life annuity commencing at normal retirement age 65, is determined by converting the balance of the participant's nominal cash balance account, which is equal to the sum of his or her annual pay credits and his or her annual interest credits, into an actuarially equivalent annuity, as those terms are defined under the plan. pay credits are made on december 31 of each plan year and range from 4% to 8% of the participant's eligible earnings, based upon the sum of his or her age and vesting service as of january 1 of the plan year. interest credits are made on december 31 of each calendar year, beginning with the calendar year following the calendar year in which the participant first becomes a participant, and are calculated based upon the annual rate of interest on 30-year u. s. treasury securities, as specified by the internal revenue service, for the month of august preceding the first day of the applicable calendar year. the interest crediting rate applied for any plan year will never be less than 2.6%, and will never exceed 9%. a participant becomes vested in his or her cash balance plan benefit if he or she has at least 3 years of vesting service or attains age 65
while actively employed by an entergy system company. normal retirement age is 65, and if a participant terminates employment at that time, payment of his or her normal retirement benefit begins on the first day of the month following his or her normal retirement date. however, if a participant with a vested benefit terminates employment before
table of contents his or her normal retirement date, he or she can commence a terminated vested benefit as early as the first day of the month following his or her termination of employment. participants may elect to receive various optional forms of actuarially equivalent benefit payments, if they satisfy the plan's eligibility requirements.
401(k) savings plan the savings plan is a tax-qualified 401(k) retirement savings plan, wherein total combined before-tax and after-tax contributions may not exceed 30% of a participant's base salary up to certain contribution limits defined by the code. in addition, under the savings plan, the entergy employer of savings plan participants, who participate in the entergy retirement plan, matches an amount equal to seventy cents for each dollar contributed by participating employees, including the named executive officers, other than mr. bakken, with respect to the first 6% of their eligible earnings under the plan for that pay period. the entergy employer of savings plan participants who participate in the cash balance plan makes a company matching contribution on behalf of the participant equal to one dollar for each dollar contributed by participating employees with respect to the first 6% of their eligible earnings each pay period. participants who are age 50 or older as of the last day of the plan year and who have made the maximum before-tax deferral contributions for the plan year may make additional before-tax catch-up contributions to the savings plan up to $6,000 per year; however, catch-up contributions are not eligible for a company matching contribution.
non-qualified retirement benefits the named executive officers are eligible to participate in certain non-qualified retirement benefit plans that provide retirement income, including the pension equalization plan, the cash balance equalization plan, and the system executive retirement plan. each of these plans is an unfunded non-qualified defined benefit pension plan that provides benefits to key management employees. in these plans, as described below, an executive is typically enrolled in one or more non-qualified plans, but is only paid the amount due under the plan that provides the highest benefit. in general, upon disability, participants in the pension equalization plan and the system executive retirement plan remain eligible for continued service credits until the earlier of recovery, separation from service due to disability, or retirement eligibility. generally, spouses of participants who die before commencement of benefits may be eligible for a portion of the participant's accrued benefit.
the pension equalization plan the pension equalization plan is a non-qualified unfunded restoration retirement plan that provides for the payment to eligible participants who also participate in the entergy retirement plan from entergy's general assets of a single lump sum cash distribution generally upon separation from service generally equal to the actuarial present value of the difference between the amount that would have been payable as an annuity under the tax-qualified pension plan, but for code limitations on pension benefits and earnings that may be considered in calculating tax-
qualified pension benefits, and the amount actually payable as an annuity under the entergy retirement plan. the pension equalization plan also takes into account as eligible earnings certain incentive awards paid to certain participants under the annual incentive plan not included in earnings under the retirement plan and includes supplemental credited service granted to a participant in calculating his or her benefit. participants receive their pension equalization plan benefit in the form of a single sum cash distribution. the benefits under this plan are offset by benefits payable from the qualified retirement plan and may be offset by prior entergy employer benefits. the pension equalization plan benefit attributable to supplemental credited service is not vested until age 65. subject to the prior written consent of the entergy employer (which consent is deemed given if the participant's employment is terminated within 24 months following a change in control by the employer without
"cause" or by the participant for "good reason," each as defined in the plan), an employee with supplemental credited service who terminates employment prior to age 65 may be vested in his or her benefit, with payment of the lump sum benefit generally at separation from service unless delayed 6 months under code section 409a. benefits payable prior to age 65 are subject to the same terminated vested or early retirement reduction factors as benefits payable under the entergy retirement plan.
table of contents effective july 1, 2014, participants in the pension equalization plan are no longer provided with supplemental credited service unless the grant of supplemental credited service was approved and accepted in writing by the plan administrator prior to july 1, 2014. in addition, the pension equalization plan was amended effective july 1, 2014
cash balance equalization plan the cash balance equalization plan is a non-qualified unfunded restoration retirement plan that provides for the payment to eligible participants who participate in the cash balance plan from entergy corporation's general assets of a single lump sum cash distribution generally upon separation from service generally equal to the difference between the amount that would have been payable as a lump sum under the cash balance plan, but for code limitations on pension benefits and earnings that may be considered in calculating tax-qualified cash balance plan benefits, and the amount actually payable as a lump sum under the cash balance plan. in the event of a change in control, participants whose employment is terminated without "cause" or by the employee for "good reason," as each is defined in the cash balance plan, shall become fully vested in all benefits accrued under this plan as of the date of termination of employment and shall be entitled to a lump-sum payable under this plan generally as soon as reasonably practicable following the first day of the month after the termination of employment.
the system executive retirement plan the system executive retirement plan is a non-qualified supplemental retirement plan that provides for a single sum payment at age 65. like the pension equalization plan, the system executive retirement plan is designed to provide for the payment to eligible participants who participate in the entergy retirement plan from entergy corporation's general assets of a single-sum cash distribution upon the participant's separation from service. the single-sum benefit is generally equal to the actuarial present value of a specified percentage of the participant's "final average monthly compensation" (which is generally 1/36th of the sum of the participant's annual rate of base salary and annual incentive plan award for the 3 highest years during the last 10 years preceding termination of employment), after first being reduced by the value of the participant's entergy retirement plan benefit.

the system executive retirement plan benefit is not vested until age 65. subject to the prior written consent of the entergy employer, an employee who terminates his or her employment prior to age 65 may be vested in the system executive retirement plan benefit, with payment of the lump sum benefit generally at separation from service unless delayed 6 months under code section 409a. benefits payable prior to age 65 are subject to the same terminated vested or early retirement reduction factors as benefits payable under the entergy retirement plan. further, in the event of a change in control, participants whose employment is terminated without "cause" or by the employee for
"good reason," as each is defined in the plan are also eligible for a subsidized lump sum benefit payment, even if they do not currently meet the age or service requirements for early retirement under that plan or have company permission to separate from employment. such lump sum benefit is payable generally at separation from service unless delayed 6 months under code section 409a. the system executive retirement plan was closed to new executive officers effective july 1, 2014.
2016 non-qualified deferred compensation as of december 31, 2016, mr. may had a deferred account balance under a frozen defined contribution restoration plan. the amount is deemed invested, as chosen by the participant, in certain t. rowe price investment funds that are also available to the participant under the savings plan. mr. may has elected to receive the deferred account balance after he retires. the defined contribution restoration plan, until it was frozen in 2005, credited eligible employees' deferral accounts with employer contributions to the extent contributions under the qualified savings plan in which the employee participated were subject to limitations imposed by the code.

2016 potential payments upon termination or change in control entergy corporation has plans and other arrangements that provide compensation to a named executive officer if his or her employment terminates under specified conditions, including following a change in control of entergy corporation. in addition, in 2006 entergy corporation entered into a retention agreement with mr. denault that provides possibility of additional service credit under the system executive retirement plan upon certain terminations of employment. there are no plans or agreements that would provide for payments to any of the named executive officers solely upon a change in control.
the tables below reflect the amount of compensation each of the named executive officers would have received if his or her employment with their entergy employer had been terminated under various scenarios as of december 31, 2016.
for purposes of these tables, a stock price of $73.47 was used, which was the closing market price on december 30,

pension benefits:
in addition to the payments and benefits in the table, if a named executive officer's, other than mr.
denault's, mr. brown's, and ms. rainer's, employment were terminated under certain conditions relating to a change in control, each also would have been entitled to receive his vested pension benefits upon
(3)  attainment of age 55 and would have been eligible for early retirement benefits under the system executive retirement plan calculated using early retirement reduction factors. for a description of the pension benefits, see "2016 pension benefits."  if a named executive officer's, other than mr. denault's, mr.
table of contents terminated for cause or each were to resign before age 65 without the permission of their entergy employer, each would not receive a benefit under the system executive retirement plan. in addition to the payments and benefits in the table, if mr. bakken's employment were terminated under certain conditions relating to a change in control, on the first day of the month following the qualifying event (as defined in the cash balance equalization plan), he would have become vested in and have been entitled to receive his vested pension benefits accumulated in the cash balance equalization plan as of the date of the qualifying event so long as a forfeiture event does not occur as described in the plan. for a description of the pension benefits under the cash balance equalization plan, see
"2016 pension benefits."
in addition to the payments and benefits in the table, mr. brown and ms. rainer each would have been eligible to retire and entitled to receive vested pension benefits.  for a description of the pension benefits available, see "2016 pension benefits."  in the event of a termination by their entergy employer without cause or by the executive for good reason in connection with a change in control, mr. brown and
(4)  ms. rainer each would be eligible for subsidized early retirement benefits under the system executive retirement plan even if they do not have their entergy employer's permission to separate from employment.
if mr. brown's or ms. rainer's employment were terminated for cause or if either were to retire before age
65 without the permission of their entergy employer, they would not receive a benefit under the system executive retirement plan.
in addition to the payments and benefits in the table, mr. denault also would have been entitled to receive his vested pension benefits.  if mr. denault's employment was terminated by his entergy employer other than for cause, by mr. denault for good reason or on account of his death or disability, he would
(5)  also be eligible for certain additional retirement benefits. for a description of these benefits, see
"2016 pension benefits."  otherwise, if mr. denault's employment was terminated for cause or he was to retire before age 65 without the permission of his entergy employer, he would not receive a benefit under the system executive retirement plan.
severance payments in the event of a termination (not due to death or disability) by the executive for good reason or by the applicable entergy employer not for cause during the period beginning upon the occurrence of a "potential change in control" (as defined in the system executive continuity plan) and ending on the 2nd anniversary of a change in control, each named executive officer would be entitled to receive pursuant to the system executive continuity plan a lump sum severance payment equal to a multiple of the sum of (1) their annual base salary as in effect at any time within one year prior to the commencement of a change in control period or, if higher, immediately prior to a circumstance constituting good reason plus (2) their annual incentive, calculated using the average annual target opportunity derived under the annual incentive plan
(6)  for 2014 and 2015 (the two calendar years immediately preceding the calendar year in which termination occurs), but in no event shall the severance be more than the product of 2.99 times the sum of (a) their annual base salary as in effect at any time within one year prior to the commencement of a change in control period or, if higher, immediately prior to a circumstance constituting good reason plus (b) the higher of their actual annual incentive payment under the annual incentive plan for the 2015 performance year or their annual incentive, calculated using the average annual target opportunity derived under the annual incentive plan for 2014 and 2015 (the two calendar years immediately preceding the calendar year in which termination occurs).  for purposes of this table, it assumed the following target opportunity and base salary was assumed:
table of contents named executive officer    target opportunity  base salary a. christopher bakken iii  0%                     $605,000
performance units with respect to mr. denault, in the event of a termination event, he is entitled to a target ltip award, as defined in his 2006 retention agreement, calculated by using the average annual number of performance units with respect to the two most recent performance periods preceding the calendar year in which his employment termination occurs, assuming all performance goals were achieved at target. for purposes of the
(7)  table, the value of mr. denault's retention payment was calculated by taking an average of the target performance units from the 2012-2014 performance unit program (26,900) and from the 2013-2015 performance unit program (38,000).  this average number of units (32,450) multiplied by the closing price of entergy corporation stock on december 30, 2016 ($73.47) would equal a payment of $2,384,102.  in the event of death or disability, mr. denault receives the greater of target ltip award calculated as described above or the sum of the amount that would be payable under the provisions of each open performance unit program.
in the event of a qualifying termination related to a change in control, each named executive officer would have forfeited their performance units for the 2015-2017 performance period and would have been entitled to receive, pursuant to the 2011 equity ownership plan, a single-lump sum payment that would not be based on any outstanding performance period. for the 2015-2017 performance period, the payment would have been calculated using the average annual number of performance units they would have been entitled to receive under each performance unit program with respect to the two most recent performance periods
(8)  preceding (but not including) the calendar year in which their termination occurs, assuming all performance goals were achieved at target multiplied by the closing price of entergy corporation stock on december 30, 2016. for purposes of the table, the value of mr. denault's payment was calculated by taking an average of the target performance units from the 2012-2014 performance unit program (26,900) and
2013-2015 performance unit program (38,000). this average number of units (32,450) multiplied by the closing price of entergy corporation stock on december 30, 2016 ($73.47) would equal a payment of
$2,384,102 for the forfeited performance units.
the value of the payment for messrs. marsh, bakken, and west was calculated by taking an average of the target performance units from the 2012-2014 performance unit program (5,400) and 2013-2015 performance unit program
(7,600). this average number of units (6,500) multiplied by the closing price of entergy corporation stock on december 30, 2016 ($73.47) would equal a payment of $477,555 for the forfeited performance units.
the value of the payment for mr. may was calculated by taking an average of the target performance units from the
2012-2014 performance unit program (2,400) and 2013-2015 performance unit program (3,000). this average number of units (2,700) multiplied by the closing price of entergy corporation stock on december 30, 2016 ($73.47) would equal a payment of $198,369 for the forfeited performance units.
the value of the payment for messrs. fisackerly, rice, riley, and ms. rainer was calculated by taking an average of the target performance units from the 2012-2014 performance unit program (1,500) and 2013-2015 performance unit program (1,900). this average number of units (1,700) multiplied by the closing price of entergy corporation stock on december 30, 2016 ($73.47) would equal a payment of $124,899 for the forfeited performance units.
table of contents in the event of a qualifying termination related to a change in control, each named executive officer would have forfeited his performance units for the 2016-2018 performance period and would have been entitled to receive, pursuant to the 2015 equity ownership plan, a single-lump sum payment that would not be based on any outstanding performance period. the 2016-2018 performance period payment would have been calculated using the most recent performance period preceding (but not including) the calendar year in which termination occurs. for purposes of the table, the value of mr. denault's payment was calculated by multiplying the target performance units for the
2013-2015 performance unit program (38,000) by the closing price of entergy corporation stock on december 30, 2016
($73.47), which would equal a payment of $2,791,860 for the forfeited performance units.
the value of the payment for messrs. marsh, bakken, and west was calculated by multiplying the target performance units for the 2013-2015 performance unit program (7,600) by the closing price of entergy corporation stock on december 30, 2016 ($73.47), which would equal a payment of $558,372 for the forfeited performance units.
the value of the payment for mr. may was calculated by multiplying the target performance units for the 2013-2015
performance unit program (3,000) by the closing price of entergy corporation stock on december 30, 2016 ($73.47), which would equal a payment of $220,410 for the forfeited performance units. the value of the payment for messrs.
fisackerly, rice, riley, and ms. rainer was calculated by multiplying the target performance units for the
2013-2015 performance unit program (1,900) by the closing price of entergy corporation stock on december 30, 2016
($73.47), which would equal a payment of $139,593 for the forfeited performance units.
in the event of retirement in the case of mr. denault, mr. brown, or ms. rainer, or upon death or disability, other than mr. denault, each named executive officer would not have forfeited their performance units for all open performance periods, but rather such performance unit awards would have been pro-rated based on their number of months of participation in each open performance unit program performance period, in accordance with their grant agreement under the performance unit program. the amount of the award is based on actual performance achieved, with a stock price set as of the end of the performance period, and payable in the form of a lump sum after the completion of the performance period. for purposes of the table, the values of the awards were calculated as follows:
2015 - 2017 plan - 22,067 (24/36*33,100) performance units at target, assuming a stock price of $73.47
2016 - 2018 plan - 13,900 (12/36*41,700) performance units at target, assuming a stock price of $73.47

under certain circumstances described below, the payments and benefits received by a named executive officer pursuant to the system executive continuity plan may be forfeited and, in certain cases, subject to repayment.
benefits are no longer payable under the system executive continuity plan, and unvested performance units under the performance unit program are subject to forfeiture, if the executive:
•  accepts employment with entergy corporation or any of its subsidiaries;
•  elects to receive the benefits of another severance or separation program;
•  removes, copies or fails to return any property belonging to entergy corporation or any of its subsidiaries;
•  discloses non-public data or information concerning entergy corporation or any its subsidiaries; or
•  violates his or her non-compete provision, which generally runs for two years but extends to three years if permissible under applicable law.
furthermore, if the executive discloses non-public data or information concerning entergy corporation or any of its subsidiaries or violates his or her non-compete provision, he or she will be required to repay any benefits previously received under the system executive continuity plan.
termination for cause if a named executive officer's employment is terminated for "cause" (as defined in the system executive continuity plan and described above under "termination related to a change in control"), he or she is generally entitled to the same compensation and separation benefits described below under "voluntary resignation," except that all options are no longer exercisable.

table of contents entergy audit committee guidelines for pre-approval of independent auditor services the audit committee has adopted the following guidelines regarding the engagement of entergy's independent auditor to perform services for entergy:
the independent auditor will provide the audit committee, for approval, an annual engagement letter
1.  outlining the scope of services proposed to be performed during the fiscal year, including audit services and other permissible non-audit services (e.g. audit-related services, tax services, and all other services).
for other permissible services not included in the engagement letter, entergy management will submit a description of the proposed service, including a budget estimate, to the audit committee for pre-approval.
2.  management and the independent auditor must agree that the requested service is consistent with the sec's rules on auditor independence prior to submission to the audit committee.  the audit committee, at its discretion, will pre-approve permissible services and has established the following additional guidelines for permissible non-audit services provided by the independent auditor:
•  aggregate non-audit service fees are targeted at fifty percent or less of the approved audit service fee.
•  all other services should only be provided by the independent auditor if it is the only qualified provider of that service or if the audit committee specifically requests the service.
3.  the audit committee will be informed quarterly as to the status of pre-approved services actually provided by the independent auditor.
to ensure prompt handling of unexpected matters, the audit committee delegates to the audit committee chair
4.  or its designee the authority to approve permissible services and fees.  the audit committee chair or designee will report action taken to the audit committee at the next scheduled audit committee meeting.
5.  the vice president and general auditor will be responsible for tracking all independent auditor fees and will report quarterly to the audit committee.

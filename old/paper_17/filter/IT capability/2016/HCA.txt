10-k.as a consequence, current plans, anticipated actions and future financial position and results of operations may differ from those expressed in any forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of hca. you are cautioned not to unduly rely on such forward-looking statements when evaluating the information presented in this report.
2016 operations summary net income attributable to hca holdings, inc. totaled $2.890 billion, or $7.30 per diluted share, for 2016, compared to $2.129 billion, or $4.99 per diluted share, for 2015. the 2016 results include tax benefits of $51
2016, of a new accounting standard that requires the excess tax benefits related to employee equity award settlements to be recorded as a component of the provision for income taxes for periods subsequent to adoption. the
2016 results also include net gains on sales of facilities of $23 million, or $0.05 per diluted share, losses on retirement of debt of $4 million, or $0.01 per diluted share, and legal claim benefits of $246 million, or $0.39
per diluted share, related to the settlement of a previously disclosed contractual dispute regarding our obligation to fund certain capital expenditures in connection with our purchase of hospitals from health midwest in 2003. the
2015 results include net losses on sales of facilities of $5 million, losses on retirement of debt of $135 million, or $0.20 per diluted share, and legal claim costs of $249 million, or $0.37 per diluted share. all per diluted share disclosures are based upon amounts net of the applicable income taxes. shares used for diluted earnings per share were 395.851 million shares and 426.721 million shares for the years ended december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. during 2016 and 2015, we repurchased 36.325 million and 31.991 million shares, respectively, of our common stock.
revenues increased to $41.490 billion for 2016 from $39.678 billion for 2015. revenues increased 4.6% and 4.1%, respectively, on a consolidated basis and on a same facility basis for 2016, compared to 2015. the consolidated revenues increase can be primarily attributed to the combined impact of a 2.3% increase in revenue per equivalent admission and a 2.2% increase in equivalent admissions. the same facility revenues increase resulted from a 2.2%
increase in same facility revenue per equivalent admission and a 1.9% increase in same facility equivalent admissions.
during 2016, consolidated admissions increased 1.2% and same facility admissions increased 1.1%, compared to 2015.
inpatient surgical volumes increased 1.4% on both a consolidated and same facility basis during 2016, compared to
2015. outpatient surgical volumes increased 2.5% on a consolidated basis and increased 1.2% on a same facility basis during 2016, compared to 2015. emergency room visits increased 4.1% on a consolidated basis and increased
3.8% on a same facility basis during 2016, compared to 2015.
for 2016, the provision for doubtful accounts declined $656 million, compared to 2015. the self-payrevenue deductions for charity care and uninsured discounts increased $469 million and $2.355 billion, respectively, for
2016, compared to 2015. the sum of the provision for doubtful accounts, uninsured discounts and charity care, as a percentage of the sum of revenues, the provision for doubtful accounts, uninsured discounts and charity care, was
33.0% for 2016, compared to 31.5% for 2015. same facility uninsured admissions increased 3.8% and same facility uninsured emergency room visits increased 4.5% for 2016, compared to 2015. same facility uninsured admissions increased 4.5% and same facility uninsured emergency room visits increased 1.2% for 2015, compared to 2014.
managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
cash flows from operating activities increased $919 million, from $4.734 billion for 2015 to $5.653 billion for
2016. the increase in cash flows from operating activities was primarily related to the $736 million increase in net income.
business strategy we are committed to providing the communities we serve with high quality, cost-effective health care while growing our business, increasing our profitability and creating long-term value for our stockholders. to achieve these objectives, we align our efforts around the following growth agenda:
grow our presence in existing markets.we believe we are well positioned in a number of large and growing markets that will allow us the opportunity to generate long-term, attractive growth through the expansion of our presence in these markets. we plan to continue recruiting and strategically collaborating with the physician community and adding attractive service lines such as cardiology, emergency services, oncology and womens services. additional components of our growth strategy include expanding our footprint through developing various outpatient access points, including surgery centers, urgent care clinics, freestanding emergency departments and walk-inclinics.
achieve industry-leading performance in clinical and satisfaction measures.achieving high levels of patient safety, patient satisfaction and clinical quality are central goals of our business model. to achieve these goals, we have implemented a number of initiatives including infection reduction initiatives, hospitalist programs, advanced health information technology and evidence-based medicine programs. we routinely analyze operational practices from our best-performing hospitals to identify ways to implement organization-wide performance improvements and reduce clinical variation. we believe these initiatives will continue to improve patient care, help us achieve cost efficiencies, grow our revenues and favorably position us in an environment where our constituents are increasingly focused on quality, efficacy and efficiency.
recruit and employ physicians to meet need for high quality health services.we depend on the quality and dedication of the health care providers and other team members who serve at our facilities. we believe a critical component of our growth strategy is our ability to successfully recruit and strategically collaborate with physicians and other professionals to provide high quality care. we attract and retain physicians by providing high quality, convenient facilities with advanced technology, by expanding our specialty services and by building our outpatient operations.
we believe our continued investment in the employment, recruitment and retention of physicians will improve the quality of care at our facilities.
continue to leverage our scale and market positions to enhance profitability.we believe there is significant opportunity to continue to grow the profitability of our company by fully leveraging the scale and scope of our franchise. we are currently investing in initiatives such as additional care navigators, clinical data exchange and centralized patient transfer operations, which will enable us to improve coordination of care and patient retention across our markets. we believe our centrally managed business processes and ability to leverage cost-saving practices across our extensive network will enable us to continue to manage costs effectively. we continue to invest in our parallon subsidiary group to leverage key components of our support infrastructure, including revenue cycle management, health care group purchasing, supply chain management and staffing functions.
managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
pursue a disciplined development strategy.we continue to believe there are significant growth opportunities in our markets. we will continue to provide financial and operational resources to analyze and develop our in-
marketopportunities. to complement our in-marketgrowth agenda, we intend to focus on selectively developing and acquiring new hospitals, outpatient facilities and other health care service providers. we believe the challenges faced by the hospital industry may spur consolidation and we believe our size, scale, national presence and access to capital will position us well to participate in any such consolidation. we have a strong record of successfully acquiring and integrating hospitals and entering into joint ventures and intend to continue leveraging this experience.
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses. our estimates are based on historical experience and various other assumptions we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis and make changes to the estimates and related disclosures as experience develops or new information becomes known. actual results may differ from these estimates.
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.
revenues revenues are recorded during the period the health care services are provided, based upon the estimated amounts due from payers. estimates of contractual allowances under managed care health plans are based upon the payment terms specified in the related contractual agreements. laws and regulations governing the medicare and medicaid programs are complex and subject to interpretation. the estimated reimbursement amounts are made on a payer-specific basis and are recorded based on the best information available regarding managements interpretation of the applicable laws, regulations and contract terms. management continually reviews the contractual estimation process to consider and incorporate updates to laws and regulations and the frequent changes in managed care contractual terms resulting from contract renegotiations and renewals. we have invested significant resources to refine and improve our billing systems and the information system data used to make contractual allowance estimates. we have developed standardized calculation processes and related training programs to improve the utility of our patient accounting systems.
the emergency medical treatment and labor act (emtala) requires any hospital participating in the medicare program to conduct an appropriate medical screening examination of every person who presents to the hospitals emergency room for treatment and, if the individual is suffering from an emergency medical condition, to either stabilize the condition or make an appropriate transfer of the individual to a facility able to handle the condition. the obligation to screen and stabilize emergency medical conditions exists regardless of an individuals ability to pay for treatment. federal and state laws and regulations, including but not limited to emtala, require, and our commitment to providing quality patient care encourages, the provision of services to patients who are financially unable to pay for the health care services they receive. the health reform law requires health plans to reimburse hospitals for emergency services provided to enrollees without prior authorization and without regard to whether a participating provider contract is in place. further, the health reform law contains provisions that are decreasing the number of uninsured individuals, including requirements or incentives for individuals to obtain, and large employers to provide, insurance coverage. these mandates are
managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
critical accounting policies and estimates (continued)
reducing the financial impact of screening for and stabilizing emergency medical conditions. however, the 2016
federal elections may result in the repeal or relacement of, or significant changes to, the health reform law, which could impact the number of uninsured individuals and coverage for care provided to screen for and stabilize such conditions.
we do not pursue collection of amounts related to patients who meet our guidelines to qualify as charity care;
therefore, they are not reported in revenues. patients treated at our hospitals for nonelective care, who have income at or below 200% of the federal poverty level, are eligible for charity care. the federal poverty level is established by the federal government and is based on income and family size. we provide discounts from our gross charges to uninsured patients who do not qualify for medicaid or charity care. after the discounts are applied, we are still unable to collect a significant portion of uninsured patients accounts, and we record significant provisions for doubtful accounts (based upon our historical collection experience) related to uninsured patients in the period the services are provided.
due to the complexities involved in the classification and documentation of health care services authorized and provided, the estimation of revenues earned and the related reimbursement are often subject to interpretations that could result in payments that are different from our estimates. adjustments to estimated medicare and medicaid reimbursement amounts and disproportionate-share funds, which resulted in net increases to revenues, related primarily to cost reports filed during the respective year were $31 million, $48 million and $50 million in 2016,
provision for doubtful accounts and the allowance for doubtful accounts the collection of outstanding receivables from medicare, medicaid, managed care payers, other third-party payers and patients is our primary source of cash and is critical to our operating performance. the primary collection risks relate to uninsured patient accounts, including patient accounts for which the primary insurance carrier has paid the amounts covered by the applicable agreement, but patient responsibility amounts (deductibles and copayments) remain outstanding. the provision for doubtful accounts and the allowance for doubtful accounts relate primarily to amounts due directly from patients. an estimated allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded for all uninsured accounts, regardless of the aging of those accounts. accounts are written off when all reasonable internal and external collection efforts have been performed. our collection policies include a review of all accounts against certain standard collection criteria, upon completion of our primary internal collection efforts.
accounts determined to possess positive collectibility attributes are forwarded to a secondary internal or external collection agency and the other accounts are written off. the accounts that are not collected by the secondary collection agency are written off when secondary collection efforts are completed (usually within 12 months).
writeoffs are based upon specific identification and the writeoff process requires a writeoff adjustment entry to the patient accounting system. we do not pursue collection of amounts related to patients that meet our guidelines to qualify as charity care.
the amount of the provision for doubtful accounts is based upon managements assessment of historical writeoffs and expected net collections, business and economic conditions, trends in federal, state, and private
managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
critical accounting policies and estimates (continued)
employer health care coverage and other collection indicators. management relies on the results of detailed reviews of historical writeoffs and recoveries at facilities that represent a majority of our revenues and accounts receivable (the hindsight analysis) as a primary source of information in estimating the collectibility of our accounts receivable. we perform the hindsight analysis quarterly, utilizing rolling twelve-months accounts receivable collection and writeoff data. we believe our quarterly updates to the estimated allowance for doubtful accounts at each of our hospital facilities provide reasonable valuations of our accounts receivable. these routine, quarterly changes in estimates have not resulted in material adjustments to our allowance for doubtful accounts, provision for doubtful accounts or period-to-periodcomparisons of our results of operations. at december
to quantify the total impact of and trends related to uninsured accounts, we believe it is beneficial to view the revenue deductions related to uninsured accounts (charity care and uninsured discounts) and provision for doubtful accounts in combination, rather than each separately. a summary of these amounts for the years ended december 31, follows (dollars in millions):
charity care                       $   4,151    $   3,682    $   3,775
the sum of the provision for doubtful accounts, uninsured discounts and charity care, as a percentage of the sum of revenues, the provision for doubtful accounts, uninsured discounts and charity care was 33.0% for 2016, 31.5% for
2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. management expects a continuation of the challenges related to the collection of the patient due accounts. adverse changes in the percentage of our patients having adequate health care coverage, increases in patient responsibility amounts under certain health care coverages, general economic conditions, patient accounting service center operations, payer mix, or trends in federal, state, and private employer health care coverage could affect the collection of accounts receivable, cash flows and results of operations.

critical accounting policies and estimates (continued)
professional liability claims we, along with virtually all health care providers, operate in an environment with professional liability risks.
our facilities are insured by our 100% owned insurance subsidiary for losses up to $50 million per occurrence, subject to a $15 million per occurrence self-insured retention. the insurance subsidiary has obtained reinsurance for professional liability risks generally above a retention level of $25 million per occurrence. we purchase excess insurance on a claims-made basis for losses in excess of $50 million per occurrence. provisions for losses related to professional liability risks were $430 million, $344 million and $395 million for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
reserves for professional liability risks represent the estimated ultimate cost of all reported and unreported losses incurred through the respective consolidated balance sheet dates. the estimated ultimate cost includes estimates of direct expenses and fees paid to outside counsel and experts, but does not include the general overhead costs of our insurance subsidiary or corporate office. individual case reserves are established based upon the particular circumstances of each reported claim and represent our estimates of the future costs that will be paid on reported claims. case reserves are reduced as claim payments are made and are adjusted upward or downward as our estimates regarding the amounts of future losses are revised. once the case reserves for known claims are determined, information is stratified by loss layers and retentions, accident years, reported years, and geographic location of our hospitals. several actuarial methods are employed to utilize this data to produce estimates of ultimate losses and reserves for incurred but not reported claims, including: paid and incurred extrapolation methods utilizing paid and incurred loss development to estimate ultimate losses; frequency and severity methods utilizing paid and incurred claims development to estimate ultimate average frequency (number of claims) and ultimate average severity (cost per claim); and bornhuetter-ferguson methods which add expected development to actual paid or incurred experience to estimate ultimate losses. these methods use our company-specific historical claims data and other information. company-specific claim reporting and payment data collected over an approximate

professional liability claims (continued)
data includes information regarding our business, including historical paid losses and loss adjustment expenses, historical and current case loss reserves, actual and projected hospital statistical data, professional liability retentions for each policy year, geographic information and other data.
reserves and provisions for professional liability risks are based upon actuarially determined estimates. the estimated reserve ranges, net of amounts receivable under reinsurance contracts, were $1.358 billion to $1.625
billion at december 31, 2016 and $1.294 billion to $1.548 billion at december 31, 2015. our estimated reserves for professional liability claims may change significantly if future claims differ from expected trends. we perform sensitivity analyses which model the volatility of key actuarial assumptions and monitor our reserves for adequacy relative to all our assumptions in the aggregate. based on our analysis, we believe the estimated professional liability reserve ranges represent the reasonably likely outcomes for ultimate losses. we consider the number and severity of claims to be the most significant assumptions in estimating reserves for professional liabilities. a
$28 million or reduce the reserve estimate by $26 million. a 2.5% change in the expected claim severity trend could be reasonably likely and would increase the reserve estimate by $102 million or reduce the reserve estimate by $93
million. we believe adequate reserves have been recorded for our professional liability claims; however, due to the complexity of the claims, the extended period of time to resolve the claims and the wide range of potential outcomes, our ultimate liability for professional liability claims could change by more than the estimated sensitivity amounts and could change materially from our current estimates.
the reserves for professional liability risks cover approximately 2,700 individual claims at both december 31, 2016
and 2015 and estimates for unreported potential claims. the time period required to resolve these claims can vary depending upon the jurisdiction and whether the claim is settled or litigated. the average time period between the occurrence and final resolution for our professional liability claims is approximately four years, although the facts and circumstances of each individual claim can result in an occurrence-to-resolutiontimeframe that varies from this average. the estimation of the timing of payments beyond a year can vary significantly.
reserves for professional liability risks were $1.539 billion and $1.465 billion at december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. the current portion of these reserves, $391 million and $350 million at december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, is included in other accrued expenses. obligations covered by reinsurance and excess insurance contracts are included in the reserves for professional liability risks, as we remain liable to the extent reinsurers and excess insurance carriers do not meet their obligations. reserves for professional liability risks

changes in our professional liability reserves, net of reinsurance recoverable, for the years ended december 31, are summarized in the following table (dollars in millions):
net reserves for professional liability    $  1,421    $  1,382       $  1,255
net reserves for professional liability    $  1,494    $  1,421       $  1,382
income taxes we calculate our provision for income taxes using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized by identifying the temporary differences that arise from the recognition of items in different periods for tax and accounting purposes. deferred tax assets generally represent the tax effects of amounts expensed in our income statement for which tax deductions will be claimed in future periods.
although we believe we have properly reported taxable income and paid taxes in accordance with applicable laws, federal, state or international taxing authorities may challenge our tax positions upon audit. significant judgment is required in determining and assessing the impact of uncertain tax positions. we report a liability for unrecognized tax benefits from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in our income tax return.
during each reporting period, we assess the facts and circumstances related to uncertain tax positions. if the realization of unrecognized tax benefits is deemed probable based upon new facts and circumstances, the estimated liability and the provision for income taxes are reduced in the current period. final audit results may vary from our estimates.
results of operations revenue/volume trends our revenues depend upon inpatient occupancy levels, the ancillary services and therapy programs ordered by physicians and provided to patients, the volume of outpatient procedures and the charge and negotiated payment rates for such services. gross charges typically do not reflect what our facilities are actually paid. our facilities have entered into agreements with third-party payers, including government programs and managed care health plans, under which the facilities are paid based upon the cost of providing services, predetermined rates per diagnosis, fixed per diem rates or discounts from gross charges. we do not pursue collection of amounts related to patients who meet our guidelines to qualify for charity care; therefore, they are not reported in revenues. we provide discounts to uninsured patients who do not qualify for medicaid or charity care.

same facility revenues increased 4.1% for the year ended december 31, 2016 compared to the year ended december 31,
increase for 2016 can be attributed to the combined impact of a 2.2% increase in same facility revenue per equivalent admission and a 1.9% increase in same facility equivalent admissions. the 6.4% increase for 2015 can be primarily attributed to the combined impact of a 1.7% increase in same facility revenue per equivalent admission and a 4.6% increase in same facility equivalent admissions.
2014. consolidated emergency room visits increased 4.1% during 2016 compared to 2015 and increased 8.0% during 2015

at december 31, 2016, we owned and operated 43 hospitals and 32 surgery centers in the state of florida. our florida facilities revenues totaled $9.522 billion, $9.059 billion and $8.336 billion for the years ended december
31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. at december 31, 2016, we owned and operated 40 hospitals and 26 surgery centers in the state of texas. our texas facilities revenues totaled $9.898 billion, $9.517 billion and $8.706
billion for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. during 2016, 2015 and 2014, 56% of our admissions and 47%, 47% and 46%, respectively, of our revenues were generated by our florida and texas facilities.
we receive a significant portion of our revenues from government health programs, principally medicare and medicaid, which are highly regulated and subject to frequent and substantial changes. in 2011, the centers for medicare & medicaid services (cms) approved a medicaid waiver that allows texas to continue receiving supplemental medicaid reimbursement while expanding its medicaid managed care program. texas currently operates its medicaid waiver program pursuant to this waiver, which cms has agreed to extend through december 2017. texas has requested an additional extension of the waiver and related funding through september 30, 2019. we cannot predict whether the texas medicaid waiver program will be further extended, be revised or that revenues recognized from the program will not decline.
the texas waiver program includes two primary components: an indigent care component and a delivery system reform incentive payment (dsrip) component. initiatives under the dsrip program are designed to provide incentive payments to hospitals and other providers for their investments in delivery system reforms that increase access to health care, improve the quality of care and enhance the health of patients and families they serve. we provide indigent care services in several communities in the state of texas, in affiliation with other hospitals. the state of texas has been involved in efforts to increase the indigent care provided by private hospitals. as a result of additional indigent care being provided by private hospitals, public hospital districts or counties in texas have available funds that were previously devoted to indigent care. the public hospital districts or counties are under no contractual or legal obligation to provide such indigent care. the public hospital districts or counties have elected to transfer some portion of these available funds to the states medicaid program. such action is at the sole discretion of the public hospital districts or counties. it is anticipated that these contributions to the state will be matched with federal medicaid funds. the state then may make supplemental payments to

hospitals in the state for medicaid services rendered. hospitals receiving medicaid supplemental payments may include those that are providing additional indigent care services. our texas medicaid revenues included $370
in addition, we receive supplemental payments in several other states. we are aware these supplemental payment programs are currently being reviewed by certain state agencies and some states have made waiver requests to cms to replace their existing supplemental payment programs. it is possible these reviews and waiver requests will result in the restructuring of such supplemental payment programs and could result in the payment programs being reduced or eliminated. because deliberations about these programs are ongoing, we are unable to estimate the financial impact the program structure modifications, if any, may have on our results of operations.

net income attributable to hca holdings, inc. totaled $2.890 billion, or $7.30 per diluted share, for 2016, compared to $2.129 billion, or $4.99 per diluted share, for 2015. financial results for 2016 include tax benefits of $51 million, or $0.13 per diluted share, related to the resolution of federal income tax issues for our 2011 and
2012 tax years and $162 million, or $0.41 per diluted share, related to our early adoption, during the first quarter of 2016, of a new accounting standard that requires the excess tax benefits related to employee equity award settlements to be recorded as a component of the provision for income taxes for periods subsequent to adoption. financial results for 2016 also include net gains on sales of facilities of $23 million, or $0.05 per diluted share, losses on retirement of debt of $4 million, or $0.01 per diluted share, and legal claim benefits of
$246 million, or $0.39 per diluted share, related to the settlement of a previously disclosed contractual dispute regarding our obligation to fund certain capital expenditures in connection with our purchase of hospitals from health midwest in 2003. financial results for 2015 include net losses on sales of facilities of $5 million, losses on retirement of debt of $135 million, or $0.20 per diluted share and legal claim costs of $249 million, or $0.37

2016. the provision for doubtful accounts and the allowance for doubtful accounts relate primarily to uninsured amounts due directly from patients, including copayment and deductible amounts for patients who have health care coverage. the self-payrevenue deductions for charity care and uninsured discounts increased $469 million and $2.355
billion, respectively, during 2016 compared to 2015. the sum of the provision for doubtful accounts, uninsured discounts and charity care, as a percentage of the sum of revenues, the provision for doubtful accounts, uninsured discounts and charity care, was 33.0% for 2016 compared to 31.5% for 2015. at december 31, 2016, our allowance for doubtful accounts represented approximately 97.5% of the $5.116 billion total patient due accounts receivable balance, including accounts, net of estimated contractual discounts, related to patients for which eligibility for medicaid coverage or uninsured discounts was being evaluated.
revenues increased 4.6% to $41.490 billion for 2016 from $39.678 billion for 2015. the increase in revenues was due primarily to the combined impact of a 2.3% increase in revenue per equivalent admission and a 2.2% increase in equivalent admissions compared to 2015. same facility revenues increased 4.1% due to the combined impact of a 2.2%
increase in same facility revenue per equivalent admission and a 1.9% increase in same facility equivalent admissions compared to 2015.

other operating expenses, as a percentage of revenues, was 18.1% in 2016 and 17.9% in 2015. other operating expenses are primarily comprised of contract services, professional fees, repairs and maintenance, rents and leases, utilities, insurance (including professional liability insurance) and nonincome taxes. provisions for losses related to professional liability risks were $430 million and $344 million for 2016 and 2015, respectively.
the increase in provision for losses related to professional liability risks for 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to $64 million of favorable development related to prior years claims recorded in 2015.

during 2016, we issued $1.200 billion aggregate principal amount of 4.500% senior secured notes due 2027. we used the net proceeds for general corporate purposes and to retire a portion of one of our senior secured term loans. we also entered into a joinder agreement to retire the remaining portion of this senior secured term loan using proceeds from a new $1.200 billion senior secured term loan facility maturing in february 2024. the pretax loss on retirement of debt was $4 million. during 2015, we redeemed all $1.525 billion aggregate principal amount of 73/4%
we reached a settlement agreement with the health care foundation of greater kansas city related to a previously disclosed contractual dispute regarding our obligation to fund certain capital expenditures in connection with our purchase of hospitals from health midwest in 2003. the settlement agreement enabled us to reduce the accrual for this claim by $290 million and resulted in the recognition of net legal claim benefits of $246 million related to this litigation for 2016. we recorded $129 million of legal claim costs during 2015 related to this matter. we also recorded $120 million of legal claim costs during 2015 to settle a securities class action lawsuit and related derivative actions.

the effective tax rates were 32.3% and 37.2% for 2016 and 2015, respectively. the effective tax rate computations exclude net income attributable to noncontrolling interests as it relates to consolidated partnerships. our provision for income taxes for 2016 included tax benefits of $51 million primarily related to the resolution of federal income tax issues for our 2011 and 2012 tax years and $162 million related to our early adoption, during the first quarter of 2016, of asu 2016-09which requires the excess tax benefits related to employee equity award settlements be recorded as a component of the provision for income taxes for periods subsequent to adoption.
the decline in net income attributable to noncontrolling interests related primarily to joint ventures in our united kingdom market, a texas market and an oklahoma market.
2014. financial results for 2015 include net losses on sales of facilities of $5 million, losses on retirement of debt of $135 million, or $0.20 per diluted share and legal claim costs of $249 million, or $0.37 per diluted share.

2015, our allowance for doubtful accounts represented approximately 94.5% of the $5.636 billion total patient due accounts receivable balance, including accounts, net of estimated contractual discounts, related to patients for which eligibility for medicaid coverage or uninsured discounts was being evaluated.
managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
5.5% increase in equivalent admissions compared to 2014. same facility revenues increased 6.4% due primarily to the combined impact of a 1.7% increase in same facility revenue per equivalent admission and a 4.6% increase in same facility equivalent admissions compared to 2014. we recorded $142 million of medicaid revenues during the second quarter of 2014 related to the receipt of reimbursements in excess of our estimates for the indigent care component of the texas medicaid waiver program for the program year ended september 30, 2013. we recorded $94 million of medicare revenues during the third quarter of 2014 as the settlement amount for certain claims denied by recovery audit contractor (rac) entities conducting reviews on behalf of cms and pending in the appeals process. cms offered an administrative agreement to providers willing to withdraw their pending appeals in exchange for a timely partial payment (generally, 68% of the claim amount, subject to certain adjustments), which we accepted during
2014. all revenue amounts and revenue-related statistics for the year ended december 31, 2014 include the impact of these two items that resulted in increases to revenues.
salaries and benefits, as a percentage of revenues, were 45.7% in 2015 and 45.1% in 2014. salaries and benefits per equivalent admission increased 3.1% in 2015 compared to 2014. same facility labor rate increases averaged 2.8% for

other operating expenses, as a percentage of revenues, was 17.9% in 2015 and 18.2% in 2014. other operating expenses are primarily comprised of contract services, professional fees, repairs and maintenance, rents and leases, utilities, insurance (including professional liability insurance) and nonincome taxes. provisions for losses related to professional liability risks were $344 million and $395 million for 2015 and 2014, respectively, and the expense decline in 2015 was primarily due to favorable development related to prior years claims.
equity in earnings of affiliates was $46 million for 2015 and $43 million for 2014.
net losses on sales of facilities were $5 million for 2015 and related to sales of real estate and other investments. net gains on sales of facilities were $29 million for 2014 and related to the sale of a hospital facility and sales of real estate and other investments.

we recorded $120 million of legal claim costs during 2015 to settle a securities class action lawsuit and related derivative actions. we also recorded $129 million of legal claim costs during 2015 related to the health midwest litigation for additional court-awarded interest costs. we recorded $78 million of legal claim costs during 2014
related to the health midwest litigation.
the effective tax rate was 37.2% for both 2015 and 2014. the effective tax rate computations exclude net income attributable to noncontrolling interests as it relates to consolidated partnerships.
the increase in net income attributable to noncontrolling interests related primarily to joint ventures in our united kingdom market, a texas market and an oklahoma market.
liquidity and capital resources our primary cash requirements are paying our operating expenses, servicing our debt, capital expenditures on our existing properties, acquisitions of hospitals and other health care entities, repurchases of our common stock, distributions to stockholders and distributions to noncontrolling interests. our primary cash sources are cash flows from operating activities, issuances of debt and equity securities and dispositions of hospitals and other health care entities.
cash provided by operating activities totaled $5.653 billion in 2016 compared to $4.734 billion in 2015 and $4.448
billion in 2014. working capital totaled $3.252 billion at december 31, 2016 and $3.716 billion at december 31,
2015. the $919 million increase in cash provided by operating activities for 2016, compared to 2015, was primarily related to the $736 million increase in net income. the $286 million increase in cash provided by operating activities for 2015, compared to 2014, was primarily related to the net impact of an increase in net income of $323
million and net negative changes in working capital items of $59 million. cash payments for interest and income taxes increased $85 million for 2016 compared to 2015 and increased $21 million for 2015 compared to 2014.
cash used in investing activities was $3.240 billion, $2.583 billion and $2.918 billion in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. excluding acquisitions, capital expenditures were $2.760 billion in 2016, $2.375 billion in 2015 and
$2.176 billion in 2014. we expended $576 million, $351 million and $766 million for acquisitions of hospitals and health care entities during 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. planned capital expenditures are expected to approximate $2.9 billion in 2017. at december 31, 2016, there were projects under construction which had an estimated additional cost to complete and equip over the next five years of approximately $2.5 billion. we expect to finance capital expenditures with internally generated and borrowed funds.

liquidity and capital resources (continued)
cash used in financing activities totaled $2.508 billion in 2016, $1.976 billion in 2015 and $1.378 billion in
2014. during 2016, we had a net increase of $815 million in our indebtedness and used cash of $2.751 billion for repurchases of common stock. during 2015, we had a net increase of $778 million in our indebtedness and used cash of $2.397 billion for repurchases of common stock. during 2014, we had a net increase of $778 million in our indebtedness and used cash of $1.750 billion for repurchases of common stock. during 2016, 2015 and 2014, we made distributions to noncontrolling interests of $434 million, $495 million and $442 million, respectively. we paid debt issuance costs of $40 million, $50 million and $73 million for 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. we, or our affiliates, may in the future repurchase portions of our debt or equity securities, subject to certain limitations, from time to time in either the open market or through privately negotiated transactions, in accordance with applicable sec and other legal requirements. the timing, prices, and sizes of purchases depend upon prevailing trading prices, general economic and market conditions, and other factors, including applicable securities laws. at december 31, 2016, $1.853 billion of share repurchase authorization remained available under the $2 billion share repurchase program authorized by our board of directors during november 2016. funds for the repurchase of debt or equity securities have, and are expected to, come primarily from cash generated from operations and borrowed funds.
in addition to cash flows from operations, available sources of capital include amounts available under our senior secured credit facilities ($2.097 billion as of december 31, 2016 and $2.277 billion as of january 31, 2017) and anticipated access to public and private debt and equity markets.
investments of our professional liability insurance subsidiaries, to maintain statutory equity and pay claims, totaled $385 million and $482 million at december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. the insurance subsidiary maintained net reserves for professional liability risks of $215 million and $261 million at december 31, 2016 and
2015, respectively. our facilities are insured by our 100% owned insurance subsidiary for losses up to $50 million per occurrence; however, this coverage is subject to a $15 million per occurrence self-insured retention. net reserves for the self-insured professional liability risks retained were $1.279 billion and $1.160 billion at december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. claims payments, net of reinsurance recoveries, during the next 12 months are expected to approximate $382 million. we estimate that approximately $333 million of the expected net claim payments during the next 12 months will relate to claims subject to the self-insured retention.
financing activities we are a highly leveraged company with significant debt service requirements. our debt totaled $31.376 billion and
during january 2015, we issued $1.000 billion aggregate principal amount of 5.375% senior notes due 2025. we used a portion of the net proceeds to repay at maturity our $750 million aggregate principal amount of 6.375% senior notes due 2015.

financing activities (continued)
during june 2015, we entered into a joinder agreement to retire certain of our existing senior secured term loans using proceeds from a new $1.400 billion senior secured term loan credit facility maturing on june 10, 2020. the pretax loss on retirement of debt was $3 million.
during march 2016, we issued $1.500 billion aggregate principal amount of 5.250% senior secured notes due 2026. we used the net proceeds for general corporate purposes and to retire a portion of one of our senior secured term loans. we also entered into a joinder agreement to retire the remaining portion of this senior secured term loan using proceeds from a new $1.500 billion senior secured term loan facility maturing in march 2023.
during august 2016, we issued $1.200 billion aggregate principal amount of 4.500% senior secured notes due 2027. we used the net proceeds for general corporate purposes and to retire a portion of one of our senior secured term loans. we also entered into a joinder agreement to retire the remaining portion of this senior secured term loan using proceeds from a new $1.200 billion senior secured term loan facility maturing in february 2024. the pretax loss on retirement of debt was $4 million.
management believes that cash flows from operations, amounts available under our senior secured credit facilities and our anticipated access to public and private debt markets will be sufficient to meet expected liquidity needs during the next twelve months.

market risk we are exposed to market risk related to changes in market values of securities. the investments in debt and equity securities of our 100% owned insurance subsidiaries were $381 million and $4 million, respectively, at december 31,
2016. these investments are carried at fair value, with changes in unrealized gains and losses being recorded as adjustments to other comprehensive income. at december 31, 2016, we had a net unrealized gain of $11 million on the insurance subsidiaries investment securities.
we are exposed to market risk related to market illiquidity. investments in debt and equity securities of our 100%
owned insurance subsidiaries could be impaired by the inability to access the capital markets. should the 100%
owned insurance subsidiaries require significant amounts of cash in excess of normal cash requirements to pay claims and other expenses on short notice, we may have difficulty selling these investments in a timely manner or be forced to sell them at a price less than what we might otherwise have been able to in a normal market environment. we may be required to recognize other-than-temporary impairments on our investment securities in future periods should issuers default on interest payments or should the fair market valuations of the securities deteriorate due to ratings downgrades or other issue-specific factors.
we are also exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates, and we periodically enter into interest rate swap agreements to manage our exposure to these fluctuations. our interest rate swap agreements involve the exchange of fixed and variable rate interest payments between two parties, based on common notional principal amounts and maturity dates. the notional amounts of the swap agreements represent balances used to calculate the exchange of cash flows and are not our assets or liabilities. our credit risk related to these agreements is considered low because the swap agreements are with creditworthy financial institutions. the interest payments under these agreements are settled on a net basis. these derivatives have been recognized in the financial statements at their respective fair values. changes in the fair value of these derivatives, which are designated as cash flow hedges, are included in other comprehensive income.
with respect to our interest-bearing liabilities, approximately $3.902 billion of long-term debt at december 31,
2016 was subject to variable rates of interest, while the remaining balance in long-term debt of $27.474 billion at december 31, 2016 was subject to fixed rates of interest. both the general level of interest rates and, for the senior secured credit facilities, our leverage affect our variable interest rates. our variable debt is comprised primarily of amounts outstanding under the senior secured credit facilities. borrowings under the senior secured credit facilities bear interest at a rate equal to an applicable margin plus, at our option, either (a) a base rate determined by reference to the higher of (1) the federal funds rate plus 0.50% and (2) the prime rate of bank of america or (b) a libor rate for the currency of such borrowing for the relevant interest period. the applicable margin for borrowings under the senior secured credit facilities may fluctuate according to a leverage ratio. the average effective interest rate for our long-term debt declined from 5.6% for 2015 to 5.5% for 2016.
the estimated fair value of our total long-term debt was $32.833 billion at december 31, 2016. the estimates of fair value are based upon the quoted market prices for the same or similar issues of long-term debt with the same maturities. based on a hypothetical 1% increase in interest rates, the potential annualized reduction to future pretax earnings would be approximately $39 million. to mitigate the impact of fluctuations in interest rates, we generally target a majority of our debt portfolio to be maintained at fixed rates.
our international operations and the related market risks associated with foreign currencies have not been significant to our net income, but unfavorable british pound to us dollar exchange rates during 2016 had a negative impact on comprehensive income.
managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
financial instruments derivative financial instruments are employed to manage risks, including interest rate exposures, and are not used for trading or speculative purposes. we recognize derivative instruments, such as interest rate swap agreements, in the consolidated balance sheets at fair value. changes in the fair value of derivatives are recognized periodically either in earnings or in stockholders equity, as a component of other comprehensive income, depending on whether the derivative financial instrument qualifies for hedge accounting, and if so, whether it qualifies as a fair value hedge or a cash flow hedge. gains and losses on derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, to the extent they are effective, are recorded in other comprehensive income, and subsequently reclassified to earnings to offset the impact of the hedged items when they occur.
effects of inflation and changing prices various federal, state and local laws have been enacted that, in certain cases, limit our ability to increase prices. revenues for general, acute care hospital services rendered to medicare patients are established under the federal governments prospective payment system. total fee-for-servicemedicare revenues were 21.4%, 21.8% and 22.6%
management believes hospital industry operating margins have been, and may continue to be, under significant pressure because of changes in payer and service mix and growth in operating expenses in excess of the increase in prospective payments under the medicare program. in addition, as a result of increasing regulatory and competitive pressures, our ability to maintain operating margins through price increases to non-medicarepatients is limited.
tax examinations during 2016, the irs completed its examination, resolving all outstanding federal income tax issues for our 2011
and 2012 tax years. we are also subject to examination by state and foreign taxing authorities.
management believes hca holdings, inc., its predecessors and affiliates properly reported taxable income and paid taxes in accordance with applicable laws and agreements established with the irs, state and foreign taxing authorities and final resolution of any disputes will not have a material, adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position. however, if payments due upon final resolution of any issues exceed our recorded estimates, such resolutions could have a material, adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position.

item 9a. controls and procedures
1. conclusion regarding the effectiveness of disclosure controls and procedures under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined under rule 13a-15(e)promulgated under the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended (the exchange act).
(a) managements report on internal control over financial reporting our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in exchange act rule 13a-15(f).because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. therefore, even those systems determined to be effective, can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.
under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in internal control  integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission (2013 framework). based on our assessment under the framework in internal control  integrated framework, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of december 31, 2016.
ernst & young, llp, the independent registered public accounting firm that audited our consolidated financial statements included in this form 10-k,has issued a report on our internal control over financial reporting, which is included herein.
we have audited hca holdings, inc.s internal control over financial reporting as of december 31, 2016, based on criteria established in internal control  integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission (2013 framework) (the coso criteria). hca holdings, inc.s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying managements report on internal control over financial reporting. our responsibility is to express an opinion on the companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board (united states). those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
a companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. a companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
in our opinion, hca holdings, inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31, 2016, based on the coso criteria.
we also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board (united states), the consolidated balance sheets of hca holdings, inc. as of december 31, 2016 and 2015, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders deficit, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended december 31, 2016 and our report dated february 22, 2017 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

consolidated statements of stockholders deficit for the years ended december                    f-6
(unaudited)
we have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of hca holdings, inc. as of december 31, 2016 and
2015, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders deficit, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended december 31, 2016. these financial statements are the responsibility of the companys management. our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
we conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board (united states). those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. an audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. an audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. we believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
in our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of hca holdings, inc. at december 31, 2016 and 2015, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended december 31, 2016, in conformity with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles.
as discussed in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the company changed its accounting for share-based payment accounting under accounting standards update 2016-09, improvements to employee share-based payment accounting, and applied the change on a prospective basis.
we also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board (united states), hca holdings, inc.s internal control over financial reporting as of december 31, 2016, based on criteria established in internal control  integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission (2013 framework), and our report dated february 22, 2017 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

notes to consolidated financial statements note 1  accounting policies reporting entity hca holdings, inc. is a holding company whose affiliates own and operate hospitals and related health care entities. the term affiliates includes direct and indirect subsidiaries of hca holdings, inc. and partnerships and joint ventures in which such subsidiaries are partners. at december 31, 2016, these affiliates owned and operated 170 hospitals, 118 freestanding surgery centers and provided extensive outpatient and ancillary services.
hca holdings, inc.s facilities are located in 20 states and england. the terms company, hca, we, our or
us, as used herein and unless otherwise stated or indicated by context, refer to hca holdings, inc. and its affiliates. the terms facilities or hospitals refer to entities owned and operated by affiliates of hca and the term employees refers to employees of affiliates of hca.
basis of presentation the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. actual results could differ from those estimates.
the consolidated financial statements include all subsidiaries and entities controlled by hca. we generally define
control as ownership of a majority of the voting interest of an entity. the consolidated financial statements include entities in which we absorb a majority of the entitys expected losses, receive a majority of the entitys expected residual returns, or both, as a result of ownership, contractual or other financial interests in the entity. the accounts of acquired entities are included in our consolidated financial statements for periods subsequent to our acquisition of controlling interests. significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated.
investments in entities we do not control, but in which we have a substantial ownership interest and can exercise significant influence, are accounted for using the equity method.
the majority of our expenses are cost of revenue items. costs that could be classified as general and administrative include our corporate office costs, which were $373 million, $327 million and $285 million for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
laws and regulations governing the medicare and medicaid programs are complex and subject to interpretation. as a result, there is at least a reasonable possibility recorded estimates will change by a material amount. estimated reimbursement amounts are adjusted in subsequent periods as cost reports are prepared and filed and as final settlements are determined (in relation to certain government programs, primarily medicare, this is generally referred to as the cost report filing and settlement process). the adjustments to estimated medicare and medicaid reimbursement amounts and disproportionate-share funds related primarily to cost reports filed during the respective year resulted in net increases to revenues of $31 million, $48 million and $50 million in 2016, 2015 and
the emergency medical treatment and labor act (emtala) requires any hospital participating in the medicare program to conduct an appropriate medical screening examination of every person who presents to the hospitals emergency room for treatment and, if the individual is suffering from an emergency medical condition, f-9
to either stabilize the condition or make an appropriate transfer of the individual to a facility able to handle the condition. the obligation to screen and stabilize emergency medical conditions exists regardless of an individuals ability to pay for treatment. federal and state laws and regulations require, and our commitment to providing quality patient care encourages, us to provide services to patients who are financially unable to pay for the health care services they receive. patients treated at hospitals for nonelective care, who have income at or below 200% of the federal poverty level, are eligible for charity care. the federal poverty level is established by the federal government and is based on income and family size. because we do not pursue collection of amounts determined to qualify as charity care, they are not reported in revenues. we provide discounts to uninsured patients who do not qualify for medicaid or charity care. in implementing the uninsured discount policy, we may first attempt to provide assistance to uninsured patients to help determine whether they may qualify for medicaid, other federal or state assistance or charity care. if an uninsured patient does not qualify for these programs, the uninsured discount is applied.
to quantify the total impact of and trends related to uninsured accounts, we believe it is beneficial to view charity care, uninsured discounts and the provision for doubtful accounts in combination, rather than each separately. a summary of these amounts for the years ended december 31, follows (dollars in millions):
charity care                       $   4,151       20  %    $   3,682       20  %    $   3,775       24  %
patient care costs (salaries and benefits, supplies, other operating             $  35,304       $  33,760       $  31,478
care the sum of charity care, uninsured discounts and the provision for doubtful accounts, as a percentage of the sum of revenues, charity care, uninsured discounts and the provision for doubtful accounts was 33.0% for 2016, 31.5% for
recent pronouncements in may 2014, the financial accounting standards board (fasb) and the international accounting standards board issued a final, converged, principles-based standard on revenue recognition. companies across f-10
all industries will use a five-step model to recognize revenue from customer contracts. the new standard, which replaces nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance, will require significant management judgments and change the way many companies recognize revenue in their financial statements. in july 2015, the fasb decided to defer the effective date of the new revenue standard by one year to annual and interim periods beginning after december 15,
2017 for public entities and permit entities to adopt one year earlier if they choose. the fasb decided, based on its outreach to various stakeholders and continuing amendments to the new revenue standard, that a deferral was necessary to provide adequate time to effectively implement the new standard. we are continuing to evaluate the effects the adoption of this standard will have on our financial statements and financial disclosures. we believe the most significant impact will be to the presentation of our income statement where the provision for doubtful accounts will be recorded as a direct reduction to revenues and will not be presented as a separate line item. we expect to adopt the new standard using the full retrospective application, and we do not believe the adoption will have a significant impact on our recognition of net revenues for any period.
in february 2016, the fasb issued accounting standards update 2016-02, leases(asu 2016-02),which requires lessees to recognize assets and liabilities for most leases. asu 2016-02is effective for public business entities for annual and interim periods beginning after december 15, 2018 (calendar year 2019). early adoption is permitted. asu
2016-02stransition provisions will be applied using a modified retrospective approach at the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements. we are currently evaluating the provisions of asu 2016-02to determine how our financial statements will be affected, and we believe the primary effect of adopting the new standard will be to record right-of-useassets and obligations for current operating leases.
in march 2016, the fasb issued accounting standards update 2016-05, derivatives and hedging (topic 815): effect of derivative contract novations on existing hedge accounting relationships(asu 2016-05),which clarified that a novation of a derivative contract in a hedge accounting relationship does not, in and of itself, represent a termination of the original derivative instrument or a change in the critical terms of the hedge relationship. we elected to adopt asu 2016-05prospectively effective january 1, 2016.
in march 2016, the fasb issued accounting standards update 2016-09, improvements to employee share-based payment accounting(asu 2016-09),which requires changes to how companies account for certain aspects of share-based payments to employees, including the accounting for income taxes, forfeitures and statutory tax withholding requirements, as well as classification in the statement of cash flows. we elected to adopt asu
in january 2017, the fasb issued asu 2017-04, simplifying the test for goodwill impairment (asu 2017-04).the new guidance eliminates the requirement to calculate the implied fair value of goodwill (i.e., step 2 of the current goodwill impairment test) to measure a goodwill impairment charge. instead, entities will record an impairment charge based on the excess of a reporting units carrying amount over its fair value (i.e., measure the charge based on the current step 1). asu 2017-04is effective for annual and any interim impairment tests for periods beginning after december 15, 2019. we are currently evaluating the provisions of asu 2017-04to determine how our goodwill impairment testing will be impacted and whether we may elect to adopt asu 2017-04prior to the stated effective date. the adoption of asu 2017-04 would only impact our financial statements in situations where an impairment of a reporting units assets is determined.
cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents include highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less when purchased.
our insurance subsidiaries cash equivalent investments in excess of the amounts required to pay estimated professional liability claims during the next twelve months are not included in cash and cash equivalents as these funds are not available for general corporate purposes. carrying values of cash and cash equivalents approximate fair value due to the short-term nature of these instruments.
our cash management system provides for daily investment of available balances and the funding of outstanding checks when presented for payment. outstanding, but unpresented, checks totaling $565 million and $517 million at december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, have been included in accounts payable in the consolidated balance sheets. upon presentation for payment, these checks are funded through available cash balances or our credit facility.
accounts receivable we receive payments for services rendered from federal and state agencies (under the medicare and medicaid programs), managed care health plans, commercial insurance companies, employers and patients. we recognize that revenues and receivables from government agencies are significant to our operations, but do not believe there are significant credit risks associated with these government agencies. we do not believe there are any other significant concentrations of revenues from any particular payer that would subject us to any significant credit risks in the collection of our accounts receivable.
additions to the allowance for doubtful accounts are made by means of the provision for doubtful accounts. accounts written off as uncollectible are deducted from the allowance for doubtful accounts and subsequent recoveries are added. the amount of the provision for doubtful accounts is based upon managements assessment of historical and expected net collections, business and economic conditions, trends in federal, state and private employer health care coverage and other collection indicators. the provision for doubtful accounts and the allowance for doubtful accounts relate to uninsured amounts due directly from patients (including copayment and deductible amounts from patients who have health care coverage). accounts are written off when all reasonable internal and external collection efforts have been performed. we consider the return of an account from the secondary collection agency to be the culmination of our reasonable collection efforts and the timing basis for writing off the account balance. writeoffs are based upon specific identification and the writeoff process requires a writeoff adjustment entry to the patient accounting system. management relies on the results of detailed reviews of historical writeoffs and recoveries at facilities that represent a majority of our revenues and accounts receivable (the
hindsight analysis) as a primary source of information to utilize in estimating the collectibility of our accounts receivable. we perform the hindsight analysis quarterly, utilizing rolling twelve-months accounts receivable collection and writeoff data. at december 31, 2016 and 2015, the allowance for doubtful accounts represented approximately 97.5% and 94.5%, respectively, of the $5.116 billion and $5.636 billion, respectively, patient due accounts receivable balance. the patient due accounts receivable balance represents the estimated uninsured portion of our accounts receivable. the estimated uninsured portion of medicaid pending and uninsured discount pending accounts is included in our patient due accounts receivable balance. days revenues in accounts receivable were 50 days, 53 days and 54 days at december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. changes in general economic conditions, patient accounting service center operations, payer mix, or federal or state governmental health care coverage could affect our collection of accounts receivable, cash flows and results of operations.
when events, circumstances or operating results indicate the carrying values of certain long-lived assets expected to be held and used might be impaired, we prepare projections of the undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the assets and their eventual disposition. if the projections indicate the recorded amounts are not expected to be recoverable, such amounts are reduced to estimated fair value. fair value may be estimated based upon internal evaluations that include quantitative analyses of revenues and cash flows, reviews of recent sales of similar facilities and independent appraisals.
long-lived assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of their carrying amounts or fair value less costs to sell or close. the estimates of fair value are usually based upon recent sales of similar assets and market responses based upon discussions with and offers received from potential buyers.
available-for-saleas defined in accounting standards codification (asc) no. 320, investments  debt and equity securitiesand are recorded at fair value. the investment securities are held for the purpose of providing a funding source to pay liability claims covered by the insurance subsidiaries. we perform quarterly assessments of individual investment securities to determine whether declines in market value are temporary or other-than-
temporary. our investment securities evaluation process involves subjective judgments, often involves estimating the outcome of future events, and requires a significant level of professional judgment in determining whether an impairment has occurred. we evaluate, among other things, the financial position and near term prospects of the issuer, conditions in the issuers industry, liquidity of the investment, changes in the amount or timing of expected future cash flows from the investment, and recent downgrades of the issuer by a rating agency, to determine if, and when, a decline in the fair value of an investment below amortized cost is considered other-than-
temporary. the length of time and extent to which the fair value of the investment is less than amortized cost and our ability and intent to retain the investment, to allow for any anticipated recovery of the investments fair value, are important components of our investment securities evaluation process.
goodwill and intangible assets goodwill is not amortized but is subject to annual impairment tests. in addition to the annual impairment review, impairment reviews are performed whenever circumstances indicate a possible impairment may exist. impairment testing for goodwill is done at the reporting unit level. reporting units are one level below the business segment level, and our impairment testing is performed at the operating division level. we compare the fair value of the reporting unit assets to the carrying amount, on at least an annual basis, to determine if there is potential impairment. if the fair value of the reporting unit assets is less than their carrying value, we compare the fair value of the goodwill to its carrying value. if the fair value of the goodwill is less than its carrying value, an f-13
impairment loss is recognized. fair value is estimated based upon internal evaluations of each reporting unit that include quantitative analyses of market multiples, revenues and cash flows and reviews of recent sales of similar facilities. no goodwill impairments were recognized during 2016, 2015 and 2014. since january 1, 2000, we have recognized total goodwill impairments of $102 million in the aggregate. none of the goodwill impairments related to evaluations of goodwill at the reporting unit level, as all recognized goodwill impairments during this period related to goodwill allocated to asset disposal groups.
during 2016, goodwill increased by $41 million related to acquisitions and declined by $49 million related to sales, foreign currency translation and other adjustments. during 2015, goodwill increased by $323 million related to acquisitions and declined by $2 million related to foreign currency translation and other adjustments.
during 2016, identifiable intangible assets declined by $19 million due to amortization, foreign currency translation and other adjustments. during 2015, identifiable intangible assets increased by $22 million related to acquisitions and declined by $22 million due to amortization, foreign currency translation and other adjustments.
identifiable intangible assets are amortized over estimated lives ranging generally from three to 10 years. the gross carrying amount of identifiable intangible assets at both december 31, 2016 and 2015 was $184 million and accumulated amortization was $79 million and $60 million, respectively. the gross carrying amount of indefinite-
lived identifiable intangible assets at both december 31, 2016 and 2015 was $269 million. indefinite-lived identifiable intangible assets are not amortized but are subject to annual impairment tests, and impairment reviews are performed whenever circumstances indicate a possible impairment may exist.
professional liability claims reserves for professional liability risks were $1.539 billion and $1.465 billion at december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. the current portion of the reserves, $391 million and $350 million at december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, is included in other accrued expenses in the consolidated balance sheets. provisions for losses related to professional liability risks were $430 million, $344 million and $395 million for 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and are included in other operating expenses in our consolidated income statements. provisions for losses related to professional liability risks are based upon actuarially determined estimates. loss and loss expense reserves represent the estimated ultimate net cost of all reported and unreported losses incurred through the respective consolidated balance sheet dates. the reserves for unpaid losses and loss expenses are estimated using individual case-basis valuations and actuarial analyses. those estimates are subject to the effects of trends in loss severity and frequency. the estimates are continually reviewed and adjustments are recorded as experience develops or new information becomes known. adjustments to the estimated reserve amounts are included in current operating results. the reserves for professional liability risks cover approximately 2,700 individual claims at both december 31, 2016 and 2015 and estimates for unreported potential claims. the time period required to resolve these claims can vary depending upon the jurisdiction and whether the claim is settled f-14
professional liability claims (continued)
or litigated. during 2016 and 2015, $357 million and $305 million, respectively, of net payments were made for professional and general liability claims. the estimation of the timing of payments beyond a year can vary significantly. although considerable variability is inherent in professional liability reserve estimates, we believe the reserves for losses and loss expenses are adequate; however, there can be no assurance the ultimate liability will not exceed our estimates.
a portion of our professional liability risks is insured through a 100% owned insurance subsidiary. subject to a
$15 million per occurrence self-insured retention, our facilities are insured by our 100% owned insurance subsidiary for losses up to $50 million per occurrence. the insurance subsidiary has obtained reinsurance for professional liability risks generally above a retention level of $25 million per occurrence. we also maintain professional liability insurance with unrelated commercial carriers for losses in excess of amounts insured by our insurance subsidiary.
the obligations covered by reinsurance and excess insurance contracts are included in the reserves for professional liability risks, as we remain liable to the extent the reinsurers and excess insurance carriers do not meet their obligations under the reinsurance and excess insurance contracts. the amounts receivable under the reinsurance contracts include $36 million and $35 million at december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, recorded in other assets, and $9 million at both december 31, 2016 and 2015 recorded in other current assets.
financial instruments derivative financial instruments are employed to manage interest rate risks, and are not used for trading or speculative purposes. we recognize our interest rate swap derivative instruments in the consolidated balance sheets at fair value. changes in the fair value of derivatives are recognized periodically in stockholders equity, as a component of other comprehensive income (loss), provided the derivative financial instrument qualifies for hedge accounting. gains and losses on derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, to the extent they are effective, are recorded in other comprehensive income (loss), and subsequently reclassified to earnings to offset the impact of the forecasted transactions when they occur. in the event the forecasted transaction to which a cash flow hedge relates is no longer likely, the amount in other comprehensive income (loss) is recognized in earnings and generally the derivative is terminated.
the net interest paid or received on interest rate swaps is recognized as interest expense. gains and losses resulting from the early termination of interest rate swap agreements are deferred and amortized as adjustments to interest expense over the remaining term of the debt originally associated with the terminated swap.
electronic health record incentive payments the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 provides for medicare and medicaid incentive payments for eligible hospitals and professionals that adopt and meaningfully use certified electronic health record (ehr)
technology. we recognize income related to medicare and medicaid incentive payments using a gain contingency model that is based upon when our eligible hospitals have demonstrated meaningful use of certified ehr technology for the applicable period and the cost report information for the full cost report year that will determine the final calculation of the incentive payment is available.
noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities the consolidated financial statements include all assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of less than 100%
owned entities that we control. accordingly, we have recorded noncontrolling interests in the earnings and equity of such entities.
note 2  share-based compensation stock incentive plan the 2006 stock incentive plan for key employees of hca holdings, inc. and its affiliates, as amended and restated
(the stock incentive plan), is designed to promote the long term financial interests and growth of the company by attracting and retaining management and other personnel and to motivate them to achieve long range goals and further the alignment of interests of participants with those of our stockholders through opportunities for increased stock, or stock-based, ownership in the company. portions of the options, stock appreciation rights
(sars) and restricted share units (rsus) granted under the stock incentive plan vest solely based upon continued employment over a specific period of time, and portions of the options, sars and rsus, and all performance share units (psus) vest based both upon continued employment over a specific period of time and upon the achievement of predetermined financial targets over time. we granted 1,601,300 and 1,746,300 sars and 2,628,500
employee stock purchase plan the hca holdings, inc. employee stock purchase plan (espp) was approved by the stockholders of the company during the april 2014 annual meeting with 12,000,000 shares of our common stock reserved for issuance thereunder. the espp provides our participating employees an opportunity to obtain shares of our common stock at a discount (through payroll deductions over three-month periods). at december 31, 2016, 9,720,000 shares of common stock were reserved for issuance under the espp provisions. during 2016 and 2015, the company recognized $8 million of compensation expense for each year related to the espp.
stock option, sar, rsu and psu activity the fair value of each stock option and sar award is estimated on the grant date, using valuation models and the weighted average assumptions indicated in the following table. awards under the stock incentive plan generally vest based on continued employment (time stock options and sars and time rsus) and based upon continued employment and the achievement of certain financial targets (performance stock options and sars, performance rsus and
psus). psus have a three-year cumulative earnings per share target, and the number of psus earned can vary from zero (for actual performance of less than 80% of target) to two times the original psu grant (for actual performance of 120% or more of target). each grant is valued as a single award with an expected term equal to the average expected term of the component vesting tranches. we use historical exercise behavior data and other factors to estimate the expected term of the options and sars. the expected term of the share-based award is limited by the contractual term, and employee post-vesting termination behavior is incorporated in the historical exercise behavior data.
stock option, sar, rsu and psu activity (continued)
compensation cost is recognized on the straight-line attribution method. the straight-line attribution method requires that total compensation expense recognized must at least equal the vested portion of the grant-date fair value. the expected volatility is derived using historical stock price information for our common stock and that of certain peer group companies, and the volatility implied by the trading of options to purchase our stock on open-
market exchanges. the risk-free interest rate is the approximate yield on united states treasury strips having a life equal to the expected share-based award life on the date of grant. the expected life is an estimate of the number of years a share-based award will be held before it is exercised.

note 3  acquisitions and dispositions during 2016, we paid $343 million to acquire three hospital facilities and $233 million to acquire nonhospital health care entities. during 2015, we paid $15 million to acquire a hospital and $336 million to acquire nonhospital health care entities. during 2014, we paid $161 million to acquire three hospitals and $605 million to acquire nonhospital health care entities. purchase price amounts have been allocated to the related assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their respective fair values. the purchase price paid in excess of the fair value of identifiable net assets of these acquired entities aggregated $41 million, $323 million and $542 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. the consolidated financial statements include the accounts and operations of the acquired entities subsequent to the respective acquisition dates. the pro forma effects of these acquired entities on our results of operations for periods prior to the respective acquisition dates were not significant.
during 2016, we received proceeds of $26 million and recognized a net pretax gain of $23 million ($19 million after tax) related to sales of real estate and other investments. during 2015, we received proceeds of $73 million and recognized a net pretax loss of $5 million ($3 million after tax) related to the sale of a hospital facility and sales of real estate and other investments. during 2014, we received proceeds of $51 million and recognized a net pretax gain of $29 million ($18 million after tax) related to the sale of a hospital facility and sales of real estate and other investments.
our provision for income taxes for the year ended december 31, 2016 included tax benefits of $162 million related to the adoption of asu 2016-09,which changes how companies account for certain aspects of share-based payments to employees. under asu 2016-09,we no longer record excess tax benefits (when the deductible amount related to the settlement of employee equity awards for tax purposes exceeds the cumulative compensation cost recognized for financial reporting purposes) in equity. instead, we recognize these tax benefits (and deficiencies, if applicable)
as a component of our tax provision. this reporting change is applied prospectively and prior period amounts are not restated (the excess tax benefits for the years ending december 31, 2015 and 2014, related to the settlement of employee equity awards, were $222 million and $150 million, respectively, and were recorded in equity). asu
2016-09requires companies to present excess tax benefits as an operating activity on the statement of cash flows rather than as a financing activity, as previously required. we have elected to apply the change to the statement of cash flows presentation prospectively.
during 2016, the irs completed its examination of our 2011 and 2012 tax years, resolving all outstanding federal tax issues. we reduced our provision for income taxes for the year ended december 31, 2016 by $51 million, including interest (net of tax), as a result of this resolution. the provision for income taxes reflects $15
million of reductions in interest expense (net of tax) and $7 million and $6 million of interest expense (net of tax) related to taxing authority examinations for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.

($554 million, $73 million and $6 million, respectively, as of december 31, 2015). unrecognized tax benefits of
depending on the resolution of any federal, state and foreign tax disputes, the completion of examinations by federal, state or foreign taxing authorities, or the expiration of statutes of limitation for specific taxing jurisdictions, we believe it is reasonably possible that our liability for unrecognized tax benefits may significantly increase or decrease within the next 12 months. however, we are currently unable to estimate the range of any possible change.

the average expected maturity of the investments in debt securities at december 31, 2016 was 3.7 years, compared to the average scheduled maturity of 5.3 years. expected and scheduled maturities may differ because the issuers of certain securities have the right to call, prepay or otherwise redeem such obligations prior to their scheduled maturity date.
note 7  financial instruments interest rate swap agreements we have entered into interest rate swap agreements to manage our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates. these swap agreements involve the exchange of fixed and variable rate interest payments between two parties based on common notional principal amounts and maturity dates. pay-fixedinterest rate swaps effectively convert libor indexed variable rate obligations to fixed interest rate obligations. the interest payments under these agreements are settled on a net basis. the net interest payments, based on the notional amounts in these agreements, generally match the timing of the related liabilities, for the interest rate swap agreements which have been designated as cash flow hedges. the notional amounts of the swap agreements represent amounts used to calculate the exchange of cash flows and are not our assets or liabilities. our credit risk related to these agreements is considered low because the swap agreements are with creditworthy financial institutions.

note 8  assets and liabilities measured at fair value accounting standards codification 820, fair value measurements and disclosures(asc 820) emphasizes fair value is a market-based measurement, and fair value measurements should be determined based on the assumptions market participants would use in pricing assets or liabilities. asc 820 utilizes a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between market participant assumptions based on market data obtained from sources independent of the reporting entity (observable inputs classified within levels 1 and 2 of the hierarchy) and the reporting entitys own assumptions about market participant assumptions (unobservable inputs classified within level 3 of the hierarchy).
level 1 inputs utilize quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. level 2
inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included in level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. level 2 inputs may include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, as well as inputs observable for the asset or liability (other than quoted prices), such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates, and yield curves observable at commonly quoted intervals. level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability, which are typically based on an entitys own assumptions, as there is little, if any, related market activity. in instances where the determination of the fair value measurement is based on inputs from different levels of the fair value hierarchy, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the entire fair value measurement falls is based on the lowest level input significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment.
cash traded investments our cash traded investments are generally classified within level 1 or level 2 of the fair value hierarchy because they are valued using quoted market prices, broker or dealer quotations, or alternative pricing sources with reasonable levels of price transparency. certain types of cash traded instruments are classified within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy because they trade infrequently and therefore have little or no price transparency. the valuation of these securities involves the consideration of market factors and managements judgment.
derivative financial instruments we have entered into interest rate swap agreements to manage our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates. the valuation of these instruments is determined using widely accepted valuation techniques, including discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows of each derivative. this analysis reflects the contractual terms of the derivatives, including the period to maturity, and uses observable market-based inputs, including interest rate curves and implied volatilities. we incorporate credit valuation adjustments to reflect both our own nonperformance risk and the respective counterpartys nonperformance risk in the fair value measurements of these instruments.
note 8  assets and liabilities measured at fair value (continued)
although we determined the majority of the inputs used to value our derivatives fall within level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, the credit valuation adjustments associated with our derivatives utilize level 3 inputs, such as estimates of current credit spreads, to evaluate the likelihood of default by us and our counterparties. we assessed the significance of the impact of the credit valuation adjustments on the overall valuation of our derivative positions, and at december 31, 2016 and 2015, we determined the credit valuation adjustments were not significant to the overall valuation of our derivatives.

senior secured credit facilities and other senior secured debt (continued)
borrowings under the senior secured credit facilities bear interest at a rate equal to, at our option, either (a) a base rate determined by reference to the higher of (1) the federal funds rate plus 0.50% or (2) the prime rate of bank of america or (b) a libor rate for the currency of such borrowing for the relevant interest period, plus, in each case, an applicable margin. the applicable margin for borrowings under the senior secured credit facilities may be reduced subject to attaining certain leverage ratios.
the senior secured credit facilities contain a number of covenants that restrict, subject to certain exceptions, our (and some or all of our subsidiaries) ability to incur additional indebtedness, repay subordinated indebtedness, create liens on assets, sell assets, make investments, loans or advances, engage in certain transactions with affiliates, pay dividends and distributions, and enter into sale and leaseback transactions. in addition, we are required to satisfy and maintain a maximum total leverage ratio covenant under the cash flow credit facility and, in certain situations under the abl credit facility, a minimum interest coverage ratio covenant.

general debt information the senior secured credit facilities and senior secured notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by substantially all existing and future, direct and indirect, 100% owned material domestic subsidiaries that are
unrestricted subsidiaries under our indenture (the 1993 indenture) dated december 16, 1993 (except for certain special purpose subsidiaries that only guarantee and pledge their assets under our abl credit facility).
all obligations under the abl credit facility, and the guarantees of those obligations, are secured, subject to permitted liens and other exceptions, by a first-priority lien on substantially all of the receivables of the borrowers and each guarantor under such abl credit facility (the receivables collateral).
all obligations under the cash flow credit facility and the guarantees of such obligations are secured, subject to permitted liens and other exceptions, by:
a first-priority lien on the capital stock owned by hca inc., or by any u.s. guarantor, in each of their respective first-tier subsidiaries;
a first-priority lien on substantially all present and future assets of hca inc. and of each u.s. guarantor other than (i) principal properties (as defined in the 1993 indenture), (ii) certain other real properties and (iii) deposit accounts, other bank or securities accounts, cash, leaseholds, motor-vehicles and certain other exceptions;

note 10  contingencies and legal claim costs we operate in a highly regulated and litigious industry. as a result, various lawsuits, claims and legal and regulatory proceedings have been and can be expected to be instituted or asserted against us. we are also subject to claims and suits arising in the ordinary course of business, including claims for personal injuries or wrongful restriction of, or interference with, physicians staff privileges. in certain of these actions the claimants may seek punitive damages against us which may not be covered by insurance. we are also subject to claims by various taxing authorities for additional taxes and related interest and penalties. the resolution of any such lawsuits, claims or legal and regulatory proceedings could have a material, adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position or liquidity.
government investigations, claims and litigation health care companies are subject to numerous investigations by various governmental agencies. under the federal false claims act (fca), private parties have the right to bring qui tam, or whistleblower, suits against companies that submit false claims for payments to, or improperly retain overpayments from, the government. some states have adopted similar state whistleblower and false claims provisions. certain of our individual facilities have received, and from time to time, other facilities may receive, government inquiries from, and may be subject to investigation by, federal and state agencies. depending on whether the underlying conduct in these or future inquiries or investigations could be considered systemic, their resolution could have a material, adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position or liquidity.
health midwest litigation in october 2009, the health care foundation of greater kansas city, a nonprofit health foundation, filed suit against hca inc. in the circuit court of jackson county, missouri and alleged that hca did not fund the level of f-28
health midwest litigation (continued)
capital expenditures and uncompensated care agreed to in connection with hcas purchase of hospitals from health midwest in 2003. the central issue in the case was whether hcas construction of new hospitals counted towards its
$450 million five-year capital commitment. in addition, the plaintiff alleged that hca did not make its required capital expenditures in a timely fashion. on january 24, 2013, the court ruled in favor of the plaintiff and awarded at least $162 million. the court also ordered a court-supervised accounting of hcas capital expenditures, as well as of expenditures on charity and uncompensated care during the ten years following the purchase. the court also indicated it would award plaintiff attorneys fees, which the parties stipulated were approximately $12 million for the trial phase. hca recorded $175 million of legal claim costs in the fourth quarter of 2012 related to this ruling, and consistent with the judges order, accrued interest on that sum at 9% per annum. on april 25, 2014, the parties stipulated to an additional $78 million shortfall relating to the capital expenditures issue. hca recorded
$78 million of legal claims costs in the first quarter of 2014 as a result of the stipulation, and accrued interest on that amount at 9% per annum. pursuant to the terms of the stipulation, the parties preserved their respective rights to contest the judges underlying ruling, whether through motions in the trial court or on appeal. on february 9, 2015, the parties reached an agreement to settle the part of their dispute relating to charity and uncompensated care for $15 million. the foundation is required to use that amount, net of attorneys fees, for charitable activities in the kansas city area. the parties also agreed on an additional amount for attorneys fees for the plaintiff for the accounting phase of the case. the parties filed post-trial motions, on which the court ruled on october 21, 2015. the court denied defendants motion to have the court change its rulings on liability and damages related to the capital expenditures issue. the court granted the plaintiffs motion for an award of additional pre-judgmentinterest, but did not specify whether the interest awarded was simple interest or would be compounded. the court subsequently concluded that interest was to be compounded, and on december 9, 2015, the court entered judgment in the case in the total sum of $434 million, with interest continuing to accrue at 9% per annum, compounded annually, from and after november 19, 2015, until the matter is resolved. on january 15, 2016, hca filed a notice of appeal in the missouri court of appeals for the western district, and oral arguments were presented during december 2016. on january 17, 2017, the court of appeals issued an opinion that partly affirmed and partly overruled the trial court. the court of appeals ruled that the construction of new hospitals did qualify as capital expenditures, and that hca had met its overall $450 million five-year capital commitment. the court of appeals ruled, however, that certain interim milestones were not properly met, and consequently found hca liable to the foundation for a shortfall amount plus attorneys fees. the court of appeals reversed the trial court on the issues of pre-judgement interest and compounding of interest. it entered a modified judgement in the amount of $188
$290 million and resulted in the recognition of net legal claim benefits of $246 million for the year ended december 31, 2016.

adjusted segment ebitda is defined as income before depreciation and amortization, interest expense, losses (gains)
on sales of facilities, losses on retirement of debt, legal claim costs (benefits), income taxes and net income attributable to noncontrolling interests. we use adjusted segment ebitda as an analytical indicator for purposes of allocating resources to geographic areas and assessing their performance. adjusted segment ebitda is commonly used as an analytical indicator within the health care industry, and also serves as a measure of leverage capacity and debt service ability. adjusted segment ebitda should not be considered as a measure of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles, and the items excluded from adjusted segment ebitda are significant components in understanding and assessing financial performance. because adjusted segment ebitda is not a measurement determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and is thus susceptible to varying calculations, adjusted segment ebitda, as presented, may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. the geographic distributions of our revenues, equity in earnings of affiliates, adjusted segment ebitda, depreciation and amortization, assets and goodwill and other intangible assets are summarized in the following table (dollars in millions):

healthtrust, inc.  the hospital company (healthtrust) is the first-tier subsidiary of hca inc. the common stock of healthtrust has been pledged as collateral for the senior secured credit facilities and senior secured notes described in note 9. rule 3-16of regulation s-xunder the securities act requires the filing of separate financial statements for any affiliate of the registrant whose securities constitute a substantial portion of the collateral for any class of securities registered or being registered. we believe the separate financial statements requirement applies to healthtrust due to the pledge of its common stock as collateral for the senior secured notes. due to the corporate structure relationship of hca and healthtrust, hcas operating subsidiaries are also the operating subsidiaries of healthtrust. the corporate structure relationship, combined with the application of push-down accounting in healthtrusts consolidated financial statements related to hcas debt and financial instruments, results in the consolidated financial statements of healthtrust being substantially identical to the consolidated financial statements of hca. the consolidated financial statements of hca and healthtrust present the identical amounts for revenues, expenses, net income, assets, liabilities, total stockholders deficit, net cash provided by operating activities, net cash used in investing activities and net cash used in financing activities.
certain individual line items in the hca consolidated statements of stockholders deficit are combined into one line item in the healthtrust consolidated statements of stockholders deficit.

2016 operations summary net income attributable to hca holdings, inc. totaled $2.890 billion, or $7.30 per diluted share, for 2016, compared to $2.129 billion, or $4.99 per diluted share, for 2015. the 2016 results include tax benefits of $51 million, or $0.13 per diluted share, related to the resolution of federal income tax issues for our 2011 and 2012 tax years and $162 million, or $0.41 per diluted share, related to our early adoption, during the first quarter of 2016, of a new accounting standard that requires the excess tax benefits related to employee equity award settlements to be recorded as a component of the provision for income taxes for periods subsequent to adoption. the 2016 results also include net gains on sales of facilities of $23 million, or $0.05 per diluted share, losses on retirement of debt of $4 million, or $0.01 per diluted share, and legal claim benefits of $246 million, or $0.39 per diluted share, related to the settlement of a previously disclosed contractual dispute regarding our obligation to fund certain capital expenditures in connection with our purchase of hospitals from health midwest in 2003. the 2015 results include net losses on sales of facilities of $5 million, losses on retirement of debt of $135 million, or $0.20 per diluted share, and legal claim costs of $249 million, or $0.37 per diluted share. all per diluted share disclosures are based upon amounts net of the applicable income taxes. shares used for diluted earnings per share were 395.851 million shares and 426.721 million shares for the years ended december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. during 2016 and 2015, we repurchased 36.325 million and 31.991 million shares, respectively, of our common stock.
revenues increased to $41.490 billion for 2016 from $39.678 billion for 2015. revenues increased 4.6% and 4.1%, respectively, on a consolidated basis and on a same facility basis for 2016, compared to 2015. the consolidated revenues increase can be primarily attributed to the combined impact of a 2.3% increase in revenue per equivalent admission and a 2.2% increase in equivalent admissions. the same facility revenues increase resulted from a 2.2% increase in same facility revenue per equivalent admission and a 1.9% increase in same facility equivalent admissions.
during 2016, consolidated admissions increased 1.2% and same facility admissions increased 1.1%, compared to 2015. inpatient surgical volumes increased 1.4% on both a consolidated and same facility basis during 2016, compared to 2015. outpatient surgical volumes increased 2.5% on a consolidated basis and increased 1.2% on a same facility basis during 2016, compared to 2015. emergency room visits increased 4.1% on a consolidated basis and increased 3.8% on a same facility basis during 2016, compared to 2015.
for 2016, the provision for doubtful accounts declined $656 million, compared to 2015. the self-pay revenue deductions for charity care and uninsured discounts increased $469 million and $2.355 billion, respectively, for 2016, compared to 2015. the sum of the provision for doubtful accounts, uninsured discounts and charity care, as a percentage of the sum of revenues, the provision for doubtful accounts, uninsured discounts and charity care, was 33.0% for 2016, compared to 31.5% for 2015. same facility uninsured admissions increased 3.8% and same facility uninsured emergency room visits increased 4.5% for 2016, compared to 2015. same facility uninsured admissions increased 4.5% and same facility uninsured emergency room visits increased 1.2% for 2015, compared to 2014.
managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
cash flows from operating activities increased $919 million, from $4.734 billion for 2015 to $5.653 billion for 2016. the increase in cash flows from operating activities was primarily related to the $736 million increase in net income.
business strategy we are committed to providing the communities we serve with high quality, cost-effective health care while growing our business, increasing our profitability and creating long-term value for our stockholders. to achieve these objectives, we align our efforts around the following growth agenda:
grow our presence in existing markets. we believe we are well positioned in a number of large and growing markets that will allow us the opportunity to generate long-term, attractive growth through the expansion of our presence in these markets. we plan to continue recruiting and strategically collaborating with the physician community and adding attractive service lines such as cardiology, emergency services, oncology and womens services. additional components of our growth strategy include expanding our footprint through developing various outpatient access points, including surgery centers, urgent care clinics, freestanding emergency departments and walk-in clinics.
achieve industry-leading performance in clinical and satisfaction measures. achieving high levels of patient safety, patient satisfaction and clinical quality are central goals of our business model. to achieve these goals, we have implemented a number of initiatives including infection reduction initiatives, hospitalist programs, advanced health information technology and evidence-based medicine programs. we routinely analyze operational practices from our best-performing hospitals to identify ways to implement organization-wide performance improvements and reduce clinical variation. we believe these initiatives will continue to improve patient care, help us achieve cost efficiencies, grow our revenues and favorably position us in an environment where our constituents are increasingly focused on quality, efficacy and efficiency.
recruit and employ physicians to meet need for high quality health services. we depend on the quality and dedication of the health care providers and other team members who serve at our facilities. we believe a critical component of our growth strategy is our ability to successfully recruit and strategically collaborate with physicians and other professionals to provide high quality care. we attract and retain physicians by providing high quality, convenient facilities with advanced technology, by expanding our specialty services and by building our outpatient operations. we believe our continued investment in the employment, recruitment and retention of physicians will improve the quality of care at our facilities.
continue to leverage our scale and market positions to enhance profitability. we believe there is significant opportunity to continue to grow the profitability of our company by fully leveraging the scale and scope of our franchise. we are currently investing in initiatives such as additional care navigators, clinical data exchange and centralized patient transfer operations, which will enable us to improve coordination of care and patient retention across our markets. we believe our centrally managed business processes and ability to leverage cost-saving practices across our extensive network will enable us to continue to manage costs effectively. we continue to invest in our parallon subsidiary group to leverage key components of our support infrastructure, including revenue cycle management, health care group purchasing, supply chain management and staffing functions.
managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
pursue a disciplined development strategy. we continue to believe there are significant growth opportunities in our markets. we will continue to provide financial and operational resources to analyze and develop our in-market opportunities. to complement our in-market growth agenda, we intend to focus on selectively developing and acquiring new hospitals, outpatient facilities and other health care service providers. we believe the challenges faced by the hospital industry may spur consolidation and we believe our size, scale, national presence and access to capital will position us well to participate in any such consolidation. we have a strong record of successfully acquiring and integrating hospitals and entering into joint ventures and intend to continue leveraging this experience.
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses. our estimates are based on historical experience and various other assumptions we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis and make changes to the estimates and related disclosures as experience develops or new information becomes known. actual results may differ from these estimates.
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.
revenues revenues are recorded during the period the health care services are provided, based upon the estimated amounts due from payers. estimates of contractual allowances under managed care health plans are based upon the payment terms specified in the related contractual agreements. laws and regulations governing the medicare and medicaid programs are complex and subject to interpretation. the estimated reimbursement amounts are made on a payer-specific basis and are recorded based on the best information available regarding managements interpretation of the applicable laws, regulations and contract terms. management continually reviews the contractual estimation process to consider and incorporate updates to laws and regulations and the frequent changes in managed care contractual terms resulting from contract renegotiations and renewals. we have invested significant resources to refine and improve our billing systems and the information system data used to make contractual allowance estimates. we have developed standardized calculation processes and related training programs to improve the utility of our patient accounting systems.
the emergency medical treatment and labor act (emtala) requires any hospital participating in the medicare program to conduct an appropriate medical screening examination of every person who presents to the hospitals emergency room for treatment and, if the individual is suffering from an emergency medical condition, to either stabilize the condition or make an appropriate transfer of the individual to a facility able to handle the condition. the obligation to screen and stabilize emergency medical conditions exists regardless of an individuals ability to pay for treatment. federal and state laws and regulations, including but not limited to emtala, require, and our commitment to providing quality patient care encourages, the provision of services to patients who are financially unable to pay for the health care services they receive. the health reform law requires health plans to reimburse hospitals for emergency services provided to enrollees without prior authorization and without regard to whether a participating provider contract is in place. further, the health reform law contains provisions that are decreasing the number of uninsured individuals, including requirements or incentives for individuals to obtain, and large employers to provide, insurance coverage. these mandates are

reducing the financial impact of screening for and stabilizing emergency medical conditions. however, the 2016 federal elections may result in the repeal or relacement of, or significant changes to, the health reform law, which could impact the number of uninsured individuals and coverage for care provided to screen for and stabilize such conditions.
we do not pursue collection of amounts related to patients who meet our guidelines to qualify as charity care; therefore, they are not reported in revenues. patients treated at our hospitals for nonelective care, who have income at or below 200% of the federal poverty level, are eligible for charity care. the federal poverty level is established by the federal government and is based on income and family size. we provide discounts from our gross charges to uninsured patients who do not qualify for medicaid or charity care. after the discounts are applied, we are still unable to collect a significant portion of uninsured patients accounts, and we record significant provisions for doubtful accounts (based upon our historical collection experience) related to uninsured patients in the period the services are provided.
due to the complexities involved in the classification and documentation of health care services authorized and provided, the estimation of revenues earned and the related reimbursement are often subject to interpretations that could result in payments that are different from our estimates. adjustments to estimated medicare and medicaid reimbursement amounts and disproportionate-share funds, which resulted in net increases to revenues, related primarily to cost reports filed during the respective year were $31 million, $48 million and $50 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. the adjustments to estimated reimbursement amounts, which resulted in net increases to revenues, related primarily to cost reports filed during previous years were $90 million, $85 million and $53 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. we expect adjustments during the next 12 months related to medicare and medicaid cost report filings and settlements will result in increases to revenues generally similar to the amounts recorded during these years.
provision for doubtful accounts and the allowance for doubtful accounts the collection of outstanding receivables from medicare, medicaid, managed care payers, other third-party payers and patients is our primary source of cash and is critical to our operating performance. the primary collection risks relate to uninsured patient accounts, including patient accounts for which the primary insurance carrier has paid the amounts covered by the applicable agreement, but patient responsibility amounts (deductibles and copayments) remain outstanding. the provision for doubtful accounts and the allowance for doubtful accounts relate primarily to amounts due directly from patients. an estimated allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded for all uninsured accounts, regardless of the aging of those accounts. accounts are written off when all reasonable internal and external collection efforts have been performed. our collection policies include a review of all accounts against certain standard collection criteria, upon completion of our primary internal collection efforts. accounts determined to possess positive collectibility attributes are forwarded to a secondary internal or external collection agency and the other accounts are written off. the accounts that are not collected by the secondary collection agency are written off when secondary collection efforts are completed (usually within 12 months). writeoffs are based upon specific identification and the writeoff process requires a writeoff adjustment entry to the patient accounting system. we do not pursue collection of amounts related to patients that meet our guidelines to qualify as charity care.
the amount of the provision for doubtful accounts is based upon managements assessment of historical writeoffs and expected net collections, business and economic conditions, trends in federal, state, and private

employer health care coverage and other collection indicators. management relies on the results of detailed reviews of historical writeoffs and recoveries at facilities that represent a majority of our revenues and accounts receivable (the hindsight analysis) as a primary source of information in estimating the collectibility of our accounts receivable. we perform the hindsight analysis quarterly, utilizing rolling twelve-months accounts receivable collection and writeoff data. we believe our quarterly updates to the estimated allowance for doubtful accounts at each of our hospital facilities provide reasonable valuations of our accounts receivable. these routine, quarterly changes in estimates have not resulted in material adjustments to our allowance for doubtful accounts, provision for doubtful accounts or period-to-period comparisons of our results of operations. at december 31, 2016 and 2015, the allowance for doubtful accounts represented approximately 97.5% of the $5.116 billion and 94.5% of the $5.636 billion, respectively, patient due accounts receivable balance. the patient due accounts receivable balance represents the estimated uninsured portion of our accounts receivable. the estimated uninsured portion of medicaid pending and uninsured discount pending accounts is included in our patient due accounts receivable balance.
to quantify the total impact of and trends related to uninsured accounts, we believe it is beneficial to view the revenue deductions related to uninsured accounts (charity care and uninsured discounts) and provision for doubtful accounts in combination, rather than each separately. a summary of these amounts for the years ended december 31, follows (dollars in millions):
charity care                                $4,151             $3,682            $3,775
the sum of the provision for doubtful accounts, uninsured discounts and charity care, as a percentage of the sum of revenues, the provision for doubtful accounts, uninsured discounts and charity care was 33.0% for 2016, 31.5% for 2015 and 30.2% for 2014. days revenues in accounts receivable were 50 days, 53 days and 54 days at december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. management expects a continuation of the challenges related to the collection of the patient due accounts. adverse changes in the percentage of our patients having adequate health care coverage, increases in patient responsibility amounts under certain health care coverages, general economic conditions, patient accounting service center operations, payer mix, or trends in federal, state, and private employer health care coverage could affect the collection of accounts receivable, cash flows and results of operations.
managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
critical accounting policies and estimates (continued)
professional liability claims we, along with virtually all health care providers, operate in an environment with professional liability risks. our facilities are insured by our 100% owned insurance subsidiary for losses up to $50 million per occurrence, subject to a $15 million per occurrence self-insured retention. the insurance subsidiary has obtained reinsurance for professional liability risks generally above a retention level of $25 million per occurrence. we purchase excess insurance on a claims-made basis for losses in excess of $50 million per occurrence. provisions for losses related to professional liability risks were $430 million, $344 million and $395 million for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
reserves for professional liability risks represent the estimated ultimate cost of all reported and unreported losses incurred through the respective consolidated balance sheet dates. the estimated ultimate cost includes estimates of direct expenses and fees paid to outside counsel and experts, but does not include the general overhead costs of our insurance subsidiary or corporate office. individual case reserves are established based upon the particular circumstances of each reported claim and represent our estimates of the future costs that will be paid on reported claims. case reserves are reduced as claim payments are made and are adjusted upward or downward as our estimates regarding the amounts of future losses are revised. once the case reserves for known claims are determined, information is stratified by loss layers and retentions, accident years, reported years, and geographic location of our hospitals. several actuarial methods are employed to utilize this data to produce estimates of ultimate losses and reserves for incurred but not reported claims, including: paid and incurred extrapolation methods utilizing paid and incurred loss development to estimate ultimate losses; frequency and severity methods utilizing paid and incurred claims development to estimate ultimate average frequency (number of claims) and ultimate average severity (cost per claim); and bornhuetter-ferguson methods which add expected development to actual paid or incurred experience to estimate ultimate losses. these methods use our company-specific historical claims data and other information. company-specific claim reporting and payment data collected over an approximate 20-year period is used in our reserve estimation process. this company-specific

professional liability claims (continued)
data includes information regarding our business, including historical paid losses and loss adjustment expenses, historical and current case loss reserves, actual and projected hospital statistical data, professional liability retentions for each policy year, geographic information and other data.
reserves and provisions for professional liability risks are based upon actuarially determined estimates. the estimated reserve ranges, net of amounts receivable under reinsurance contracts, were $1.358 billion to $1.625 billion at december 31, 2016 and $1.294 billion to $1.548 billion at december 31, 2015. our estimated reserves for professional liability claims may change significantly if future claims differ from expected trends. we perform sensitivity analyses which model the volatility of key actuarial assumptions and monitor our reserves for adequacy relative to all our assumptions in the aggregate. based on our analysis, we believe the estimated professional liability reserve ranges represent the reasonably likely outcomes for ultimate losses. we consider the number and severity of claims to be the most significant assumptions in estimating reserves for professional liabilities. a 2.5% change in the expected frequency trend could be reasonably likely and would increase the reserve estimate by $28 million or reduce the reserve estimate by $26 million. a 2.5% change in the expected claim severity trend could be reasonably likely and would increase the reserve estimate by $102 million or reduce the reserve estimate by $93 million. we believe adequate reserves have been recorded for our professional liability claims; however, due to the complexity of the claims, the extended period of time to resolve the claims and the wide range of potential outcomes, our ultimate liability for professional liability claims could change by more than the estimated sensitivity amounts and could change materially from our current estimates.
the reserves for professional liability risks cover approximately 2,700 individual claims at both december 31, 2016 and 2015 and estimates for unreported potential claims. the time period required to resolve these claims can vary depending upon the jurisdiction and whether the claim is settled or litigated. the average time period between the occurrence and final resolution for our professional liability claims is approximately four years, although the facts and circumstances of each individual claim can result in an occurrence-to-resolution timeframe that varies from this average. the estimation of the timing of payments beyond a year can vary significantly.
reserves for professional liability risks were $1.539 billion and $1.465 billion at december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. the current portion of these reserves, $391 million and $350 million at december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, is included in other accrued expenses. obligations covered by reinsurance and excess insurance contracts are included in the reserves for professional liability risks, as we remain liable to the extent reinsurers and excess insurance carriers do not meet their obligations. reserves for professional liability risks (net of $45 million and $44 million receivable under reinsurance and excess insurance contracts at december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively) were $1.494 billion and $1.421 billion at december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. the estimated total net reserves for professional liability risks at december 31, 2016 and 2015 are comprised of $830 million and $863 million, respectively, of case reserves for known claims and $664 million and $558 million, respectively, of reserves for incurred but not reported claims.

changes in our professional liability reserves, net of reinsurance recoverable, for the years ended december 31, are summarized in the following table (dollars in millions):
net reserves for professional liability claims, january 1                   $1,421          $1,382              $1,255
net reserves for professional liability claims, december 31                 $1,494          $1,421              $1,382
income taxes we calculate our provision for income taxes using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized by identifying the temporary differences that arise from the recognition of items in different periods for tax and accounting purposes. deferred tax assets generally represent the tax effects of amounts expensed in our income statement for which tax deductions will be claimed in future periods.
although we believe we have properly reported taxable income and paid taxes in accordance with applicable laws, federal, state or international taxing authorities may challenge our tax positions upon audit. significant judgment is required in determining and assessing the impact of uncertain tax positions. we report a liability for unrecognized tax benefits from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in our income tax return. during each reporting period, we assess the facts and circumstances related to uncertain tax positions. if the realization of unrecognized tax benefits is deemed probable based upon new facts and circumstances, the estimated liability and the provision for income taxes are reduced in the current period. final audit results may vary from our estimates.
results of operations revenue/volume trends our revenues depend upon inpatient occupancy levels, the ancillary services and therapy programs ordered by physicians and provided to patients, the volume of outpatient procedures and the charge and negotiated payment rates for such services. gross charges typically do not reflect what our facilities are actually paid. our facilities have entered into agreements with third-party payers, including government programs and managed care health plans, under which the facilities are paid based upon the cost of providing services, predetermined rates per diagnosis, fixed per diem rates or discounts from gross charges. we do not pursue collection of amounts related to patients who meet our guidelines to qualify for charity care; therefore, they are not reported in revenues. we provide discounts to uninsured patients who do not qualify for medicaid or charity care.

same facility revenues increased 4.1% for the year ended december 31, 2016 compared to the year ended december 31, 2015 and increased 6.4% for the year ended december 31, 2015 compared to the year ended december 31, 2014. the 4.1% increase for 2016 can be attributed to the combined impact of a 2.2% increase in same facility revenue per equivalent admission and a 1.9% increase in same facility equivalent admissions. the 6.4% increase for 2015 can be primarily attributed to the combined impact of a 1.7% increase in same facility revenue per equivalent admission and a 4.6% increase in same facility equivalent admissions.
consolidated admissions increased 1.2% during 2016 compared to 2015 and increased 4.1% during 2015 compared to 2014. consolidated surgeries increased 2.1% during 2016 compared to 2015 and increased 2.0% during 2015 compared to 2014. consolidated emergency room visits increased 4.1% during 2016 compared to 2015 and increased 8.0% during 2015 compared to 2014.

at december 31, 2016, we owned and operated 43 hospitals and 32 surgery centers in the state of florida. our florida facilities revenues totaled $9.522 billion, $9.059 billion and $8.336 billion for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. at december 31, 2016, we owned and operated 40 hospitals and 26 surgery centers in the state of texas. our texas facilities revenues totaled $9.898 billion, $9.517 billion and $8.706 billion for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. during 2016, 2015 and 2014, 56% of our admissions and 47%, 47% and 46%, respectively, of our revenues were generated by our florida and texas facilities. uninsured admissions in florida and texas represented 69%, 68% and 66% of our uninsured admissions during 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
we receive a significant portion of our revenues from government health programs, principally medicare and medicaid, which are highly regulated and subject to frequent and substantial changes. in 2011, the centers for medicare & medicaid services (cms) approved a medicaid waiver that allows texas to continue receiving supplemental medicaid reimbursement while expanding its medicaid managed care program. texas currently operates its medicaid waiver program pursuant to this waiver, which cms has agreed to extend through december 2017. texas has requested an additional extension of the waiver and related funding through september 30, 2019. we cannot predict whether the texas medicaid waiver program will be further extended, be revised or that revenues recognized from the program will not decline.
the texas waiver program includes two primary components: an indigent care component and a delivery system reform incentive payment (dsrip) component. initiatives under the dsrip program are designed to provide incentive payments to hospitals and other providers for their investments in delivery system reforms that increase access to health care, improve the quality of care and enhance the health of patients and families they serve. we provide indigent care services in several communities in the state of texas, in affiliation with other hospitals. the state of texas has been involved in efforts to increase the indigent care provided by private hospitals. as a result of additional indigent care being provided by private hospitals, public hospital districts or counties in texas have available funds that were previously devoted to indigent care. the public hospital districts or counties are under no contractual or legal obligation to provide such indigent care. the public hospital districts or counties have elected to transfer some portion of these available funds to the states medicaid program. such action is at the sole discretion of the public hospital districts or counties. it is anticipated that these contributions to the state will be matched with federal medicaid funds. the state then may make supplemental payments to
managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
hospitals in the state for medicaid services rendered. hospitals receiving medicaid supplemental payments may include those that are providing additional indigent care services. our texas medicaid revenues included $370 million ($101 million dsrip related and $269 million indigent care related), $347 million ($95 million dsrip related and $252 million indigent care related) and $488 million ($97 million dsrip related and $391 million indigent care related) during 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, of medicaid supplemental payments.
in addition, we receive supplemental payments in several other states. we are aware these supplemental payment programs are currently being reviewed by certain state agencies and some states have made waiver requests to cms to replace their existing supplemental payment programs. it is possible these reviews and waiver requests will result in the restructuring of such supplemental payment programs and could result in the payment programs being reduced or eliminated. because deliberations about these programs are ongoing, we are unable to estimate the financial impact the program structure modifications, if any, may have on our results of operations.

revenues before provision for doubtful accounts increased 2.7% to $44.747 billion for 2016 from $43.591 billion for 2015. the provision for doubtful accounts declined $656 million from $3.913 billion in 2015 to $3.257 billion in 2016. the provision for doubtful accounts and the allowance for doubtful accounts relate primarily to uninsured amounts due directly from patients, including copayment and deductible amounts for patients who have health care coverage. the self-pay revenue deductions for charity care and uninsured discounts increased $469 million and $2.355 billion, respectively, during 2016 compared to 2015. the sum of the provision for doubtful accounts, uninsured discounts and charity care, as a percentage of the sum of revenues, the provision for doubtful accounts, uninsured discounts and charity care, was 33.0% for 2016 compared to 31.5% for 2015. at december 31, 2016, our allowance for doubtful accounts represented approximately 97.5% of the $5.116 billion total patient due accounts receivable balance, including accounts, net of estimated contractual discounts, related to patients for which eligibility for medicaid coverage or uninsured discounts was being evaluated.
revenues increased 4.6% to $41.490 billion for 2016 from $39.678 billion for 2015. the increase in revenues was due primarily to the combined impact of a 2.3% increase in revenue per equivalent admission and a 2.2% increase in equivalent admissions compared to 2015. same facility revenues increased 4.1% due to the combined impact of a 2.2% increase in same facility revenue per equivalent admission and a 1.9% increase in same facility equivalent admissions compared to 2015.

equity in earnings of affiliates was $54 million for 2016 and $46 million for 2015.
net gains on sales of facilities were $23 million for 2016 and related to sales of real estate and other investments. net losses on sales of facilities were $5 million for 2015 and related to sales of real estate and other investments.
during 2016, we issued $1.200 billion aggregate principal amount of 4.500% senior secured notes due 2027. we used the net proceeds for general corporate purposes and to retire a portion of one of our senior secured term loans. we also entered into a joinder agreement to retire the remaining portion of this senior secured term loan using proceeds from a new $1.200 billion senior secured term loan facility maturing in february 2024. the pretax loss on retirement of debt was $4 million. during 2015, we redeemed all $1.525 billion aggregate principal amount of 73/4% senior notes due 2021 and all $1.000 billion aggregate principal amount of our outstanding 6.500% senior notes due 2016. we also entered into a joinder agreement to retire certain of our existing senior secured term loans. the pretax losses on retirement of debt related to these redemptions were $135 million.
we reached a settlement agreement with the health care foundation of greater kansas city related to a previously disclosed contractual dispute regarding our obligation to fund certain capital expenditures in connection with our purchase of hospitals from health midwest in 2003. the settlement agreement enabled us to reduce the accrual for this claim by $290 million and resulted in the recognition of net legal claim benefits of $246 million related to this litigation for 2016. we recorded $129 million of legal claim costs during 2015 related to this matter. we also recorded $120 million of legal claim costs during 2015 to settle a securities class action lawsuit and related derivative actions.
managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
the effective tax rates were 32.3% and 37.2% for 2016 and 2015, respectively. the effective tax rate computations exclude net income attributable to noncontrolling interests as it relates to consolidated partnerships. our provision for income taxes for 2016 included tax benefits of $51 million primarily related to the resolution of federal income tax issues for our 2011 and 2012 tax years and $162 million related to our early adoption, during the first quarter of 2016, of asu 2016-09 which requires the excess tax benefits related to employee equity award settlements be recorded as a component of the provision for income taxes for periods subsequent to adoption. excluding the effect of these adjustments, the effective tax rate for 2016 would have been 37.3%.
net income attributable to noncontrolling interests declined from $567 million for 2015 to $542 million for 2016. the decline in net income attributable to noncontrolling interests related primarily to joint ventures in our united kingdom market, a texas market and an oklahoma market.
net income attributable to hca holdings, inc. totaled $2.129 billion, or $4.99 per diluted share, for the year ended december 31, 2015 compared to $1.875 billion, or $4.16 per diluted share, for the year ended december 31, 2014. financial results for 2015 include net losses on sales of facilities of $5 million, losses on retirement of debt of $135 million, or $0.20 per diluted share and legal claim costs of $249 million, or $0.37 per diluted share. financial results for the year ended december 31, 2014 include net gains on sales of facilities of $29 million, or $0.04 per diluted share, losses on retirement of debt of $335 million, or $0.47 per diluted share, and legal claim costs of $78 million, or $0.11 per diluted share. all per diluted share disclosures are based upon amounts net of the applicable income taxes. shares used for diluted earnings per share were 426.721 million shares and 450.352 million shares for the years ended december 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. during 2015, we repurchased 31.991 million shares of our common stock.

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
5.5% increase in equivalent admissions compared to 2014. same facility revenues increased 6.4% due primarily to the combined impact of a 1.7% increase in same facility revenue per equivalent admission and a 4.6% increase in same facility equivalent admissions compared to 2014. we recorded $142 million of medicaid revenues during the second quarter of 2014 related to the receipt of reimbursements in excess of our estimates for the indigent care component of the texas medicaid waiver program for the program year ended september 30, 2013. we recorded $94 million of medicare revenues during the third quarter of 2014 as the settlement amount for certain claims denied by recovery audit contractor (rac) entities conducting reviews on behalf of cms and pending in the appeals process. cms offered an administrative agreement to providers willing to withdraw their pending appeals in exchange for a timely partial payment (generally, 68% of the claim amount, subject to certain adjustments), which we accepted during 2014. all revenue amounts and revenue-related statistics for the year ended december 31, 2014 include the impact of these two items that resulted in increases to revenues.

liquidity and capital resources our primary cash requirements are paying our operating expenses, servicing our debt, capital expenditures on our existing properties, acquisitions of hospitals and other health care entities, repurchases of our common stock, distributions to stockholders and distributions to noncontrolling interests. our primary cash sources are cash flows from operating activities, issuances of debt and equity securities and dispositions of hospitals and other health care entities.
cash provided by operating activities totaled $5.653 billion in 2016 compared to $4.734 billion in 2015 and $4.448 billion in 2014. working capital totaled $3.252 billion at december 31, 2016 and $3.716 billion at december 31, 2015. the $919 million increase in cash provided by operating activities for 2016, compared to 2015, was primarily related to the $736 million increase in net income. the $286 million increase in cash provided by operating activities for 2015, compared to 2014, was primarily related to the net impact of an increase in net income of $323 million and net negative changes in working capital items of $59 million. cash payments for interest and income taxes increased $85 million for 2016 compared to 2015 and increased $21 million for 2015 compared to 2014.

in addition to cash flows from operations, available sources of capital include amounts available under our senior secured credit facilities ($2.097 billion as of december 31, 2016 and $2.277 billion as of january 31, 2017) and anticipated access to public and private debt and equity markets.
investments of our professional liability insurance subsidiaries, to maintain statutory equity and pay claims, totaled $385 million and $482 million at december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. the insurance subsidiary maintained net reserves for professional liability risks of $215 million and $261 million at december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. our facilities are insured by our 100% owned insurance subsidiary for losses up to $50 million per occurrence; however, this coverage is subject to a $15 million per occurrence self-insured retention. net reserves for the self-insured professional liability risks retained were $1.279 billion and $1.160 billion at december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. claims payments, net of reinsurance recoveries, during the next 12 months are expected to approximate $382 million. we estimate that approximately $333 million of the expected net claim payments during the next 12 months will relate to claims subject to the self-insured retention.
financing activities we are a highly leveraged company with significant debt service requirements. our debt totaled $31.376 billion and $30.488 billion at december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. our interest expense was $1.707 billion for 2016 and $1.665 billion for 2015.
during january 2015, we issued $1.000 billion aggregate principal amount of 5.375% senior notes due 2025. we used a portion of the net proceeds to repay at maturity our $750 million aggregate principal amount of 6.375% senior notes due 2015.

during june 2015, we entered into a joinder agreement to retire certain of our existing senior secured term loans using proceeds from a new $1.400 billion senior secured term loan credit facility maturing on june 10, 2020. the pretax loss on retirement of debt was $3 million.
during march 2016, we issued $1.500 billion aggregate principal amount of 5.250% senior secured notes due 2026. we used the net proceeds for general corporate purposes and to retire a portion of one of our senior secured term loans. we also entered into a joinder agreement to retire the remaining portion of this senior secured term loan using proceeds from a new $1.500 billion senior secured term loan facility maturing in march 2023.
during august 2016, we issued $1.200 billion aggregate principal amount of 4.500% senior secured notes due 2027. we used the net proceeds for general corporate purposes and to retire a portion of one of our senior secured term loans. we also entered into a joinder agreement to retire the remaining portion of this senior secured term loan using proceeds from a new $1.200 billion senior secured term loan facility maturing in february 2024. the pretax loss on retirement of debt was $4 million.
management believes that cash flows from operations, amounts available under our senior secured credit facilities and our anticipated access to public and private debt markets will be sufficient to meet expected liquidity needs during the next twelve months.

(a)   we have not included obligations related to unrecognized tax benefits of $418 million at december 31, 2016, as we cannot reasonably estimate the timing or amounts of cash payments, if any, at this time.
(c)   the estimation of the timing of payments for professional liability claims beyond a year can vary significantly. the time period required to resolve these claims can vary depending upon the jurisdiction and whether the claim is settled or litigated.
(d)   amounts relate to future operating lease obligations, purchase obligations and other obligations and are not recorded in our consolidated balance sheet. amounts also include physician commitments that are recorded in our consolidated balance sheet.
(e)   amounts relate primarily to instances in which we have agreed to indemnify various commercial insurers and lenders who have provided surety bonds and letters of credit to cover damages for legal cases which were awarded to plaintiffs by the courts.
(f)                                           in consideration for physicians relocating to the communities in which our hospitals are located and agreeing to engage in private practice for the benefit of the respective communities, we make advances to physicians, normally over a period of one year, to assist in establishing the physicians practices. the actual amount of these commitments to be advanced often depends upon the financial results of the physicians private practice during the recruitment agreement payment period. the physician commitments reflected were based on our maximum exposure on effective agreements at december 31, 2016.
managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
market risk we are exposed to market risk related to changes in market values of securities. the investments in debt and equity securities of our 100% owned insurance subsidiaries were $381 million and $4 million, respectively, at december 31, 2016. these investments are carried at fair value, with changes in unrealized gains and losses being recorded as adjustments to other comprehensive income. at december 31, 2016, we had a net unrealized gain of $11 million on the insurance subsidiaries investment securities.
we are exposed to market risk related to market illiquidity. investments in debt and equity securities of our 100% owned insurance subsidiaries could be impaired by the inability to access the capital markets. should the 100% owned insurance subsidiaries require significant amounts of cash in excess of normal cash requirements to pay claims and other expenses on short notice, we may have difficulty selling these investments in a timely manner or be forced to sell them at a price less than what we might otherwise have been able to in a normal market environment. we may be required to recognize other-than-temporary impairments on our investment securities in future periods should issuers default on interest payments or should the fair market valuations of the securities deteriorate due to ratings downgrades or other issue-specific factors.
we are also exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates, and we periodically enter into interest rate swap agreements to manage our exposure to these fluctuations. our interest rate swap agreements involve the exchange of fixed and variable rate interest payments between two parties, based on common notional principal amounts and maturity dates. the notional amounts of the swap agreements represent balances used to calculate the exchange of cash flows and are not our assets or liabilities. our credit risk related to these agreements is considered low because the swap agreements are with creditworthy financial institutions. the interest payments under these agreements are settled on a net basis. these derivatives have been recognized in the financial statements at their respective fair values. changes in the fair value of these derivatives, which are designated as cash flow hedges, are included in other comprehensive income.
with respect to our interest-bearing liabilities, approximately $3.902 billion of long-term debt at december 31, 2016 was subject to variable rates of interest, while the remaining balance in long-term debt of $27.474 billion at december 31, 2016 was subject to fixed rates of interest. both the general level of interest rates and, for the senior secured credit facilities, our leverage affect our variable interest rates. our variable debt is comprised primarily of amounts outstanding under the senior secured credit facilities. borrowings under the senior secured credit facilities bear interest at a rate equal to an applicable margin plus, at our option, either (a) a base rate determined by reference to the higher of (1) the federal funds rate plus 0.50% and (2) the prime rate of bank of america or (b) a libor rate for the currency of such borrowing for the relevant interest period. the applicable margin for borrowings under the senior secured credit facilities may fluctuate according to a leverage ratio. the average effective interest rate for our long-term debt declined from 5.6% for 2015 to 5.5% for 2016.
the estimated fair value of our total long-term debt was $32.833 billion at december 31, 2016. the estimates of fair value are based upon the quoted market prices for the same or similar issues of long-term debt with the same maturities. based on a hypothetical 1% increase in interest rates, the potential annualized reduction to future pretax earnings would be approximately $39 million. to mitigate the impact of fluctuations in interest rates, we generally target a majority of our debt portfolio to be maintained at fixed rates.
our international operations and the related market risks associated with foreign currencies have not been significant to our net income, but unfavorable british pound to us dollar exchange rates during 2016 had a negative impact on comprehensive income.
managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
financial instruments derivative financial instruments are employed to manage risks, including interest rate exposures, and are not used for trading or speculative purposes. we recognize derivative instruments, such as interest rate swap agreements, in the consolidated balance sheets at fair value. changes in the fair value of derivatives are recognized periodically either in earnings or in stockholders equity, as a component of other comprehensive income, depending on whether the derivative financial instrument qualifies for hedge accounting, and if so, whether it qualifies as a fair value hedge or a cash flow hedge. gains and losses on derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, to the extent they are effective, are recorded in other comprehensive income, and subsequently reclassified to earnings to offset the impact of the hedged items when they occur.
effects of inflation and changing prices various federal, state and local laws have been enacted that, in certain cases, limit our ability to increase prices. revenues for general, acute care hospital services rendered to medicare patients are established under the federal governments prospective payment system. total fee-for-service medicare revenues were 21.4%, 21.8% and 22.6% of our revenues for 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
management believes hospital industry operating margins have been, and may continue to be, under significant pressure because of changes in payer and service mix and growth in operating expenses in excess of the increase in prospective payments under the medicare program. in addition, as a result of increasing regulatory and competitive pressures, our ability to maintain operating margins through price increases to non-medicare patients is limited.
tax examinations during 2016, the irs completed its examination, resolving all outstanding federal income tax issues for our 2011 and 2012 tax years. we are also subject to examination by state and foreign taxing authorities.
management believes hca holdings, inc., its predecessors and affiliates properly reported taxable income and paid taxes in accordance with applicable laws and agreements established with the irs, state and foreign taxing authorities and final resolution of any disputes will not have a material, adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position. however, if payments due upon final resolution of any issues exceed our recorded estimates, such resolutions could have a material, adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position.

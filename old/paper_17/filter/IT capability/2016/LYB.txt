item 1a. risk factors.
you should carefully consider the following risk factors in addition to the other information included in this annual report on form 10-k. each of these risk factors could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition, as well as adversely affect the value of an investment in our common stock.
our business, including our results of operations and reputation, could be adversely affected by safety or product liability issues.
failure to appropriately manage safety, human health, product liability and environmental risks associated with our products, product life cycles and production processes could adversely impact employees, communities, stakeholders, our reputation and our results of operations. public perception of the risks associated with our products and production processes could impact product acceptance and influence the regulatory environment in which we operate. while we have procedures and controls to manage safety risks, issues could be created by events outside of our control, including natural disasters, severe weather events and acts of sabotage.
our operations are subject to risks inherent in chemical and refining businesses, and we could be subject to liabilities for which we are not fully insured or that are not otherwise mitigated.
we maintain property, business interruption, product, general liability, casualty and other types of insurance that we believe are appropriate for our business and operations as well as in line with customary industry practices. however, we are not fully insured against all potential hazards incident to our business, including losses resulting from natural disasters, wars or terrorist acts. changes in insurance market conditions have caused, and may in the future cause, premiums and deductibles for certain insurance policies to increase substantially and, in some instances, for certain insurance to become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage. if we were to incur a significant liability for which we were not fully insured, we might not be able to finance the amount of the uninsured liability on terms acceptable to us or at all, and might be obligated to divert a significant portion of our cash flow from normal business operations.
further, because a part of our business involves licensing polyolefin process technology, our licensees are exposed to similar risks involved in the manufacture and marketing of polyolefins. hazardous incidents involving our licensees, if they do result or are perceived to result from use of our technologies, may harm our reputation, threaten our relationships with other licensees and/or lead to customer attrition and financial losses. our policy of covering these risks through contractual limitations of liability and indemnities and through insurance may not always be effective. as a result, our financial condition and results of operation would be adversely affected, and other companies with competing technologies may have the opportunity to secure a competitive advantage.
energy costs generally follow price trends of crude oil and natural gas. these price trends may be highly volatile and cyclical. in the past, raw material and energy costs have experienced significant fluctuations that adversely affected our business segmentsÂ’ results of operations. for example, we have benefitted from the favorable ratio of u.s. natural gas prices to crude oil prices in recent years. this advantage was reduced as oil prices declined beginning in 2014. if the price of crude oil remains lower relative to u.s. natural gas prices or if the demand for natural gas and ngls increases, this may have a negative impact on our results of operations.
costs and limitations on supply of raw materials and energy may result in increased operating expenses.
the costs of raw materials and energy represent a substantial portion of our operating expenses. due to the significant competition we face and the commodity nature of many of our products we are not always able to pass on raw material and energy cost increases to our customers. when we do have the ability to pass on the cost increases, we are not always able to do so quickly enough to avoid adverse impacts on our results of operations.
cost increases for raw materials also may increase working capital needs, which could reduce our liquidity and cash flow. even if we increase our sales prices to reflect rising raw material and energy costs, demand for products may decrease as customers reduce their consumption or use substitute products, which may have an adverse impact on our results of operations. in addition, producers in natural gas cost-advantaged regions, such as the middle east and north america, benefit from the lower prices of natural gas and ngls. competition from producers in these regions may cause us to reduce exports from europe and elsewhere. any such reductions may increase competition for product sales within europe and other markets, which can result in lower margins in those regions.
for some of our raw materials and utilities there are a limited number of suppliers and, in some cases, the supplies are specific to the particular geographic region in which a facility is located. it is also common in the chemical and refining industries for a facility to have a sole, dedicated source for its utilities, such as steam, electricity and gas. having a sole or limited number of suppliers may limit our negotiating power, particularly in
the case of rising raw material costs. any new supply agreements we enter into may not have terms as favorable as those contained in our current supply agreements.
additionally, there is growing concern over the reliability of water sources, including around the texas gulf coast where several of our facilities are located. the decreased availability or less favorable pricing for water as a result of population growth, drought or regulation could negatively impact our operations.
if our raw material or utility supplies were disrupted, our businesses may incur increased costs to procure alternative supplies or incur excessive downtime, which would have a direct negative impact on plant operations. disruptions of supplies may occur as a result of transportation issues including, but not limited to, as a result of natural disasters and water levels that can affect the operations of vessels, barges, rails, trucks and pipeline traffic. these risks are particularly prevalent in the u.s. gulf coast area. additionally, the export of ngls from the u.s., greater restrictions on hydraulic fracturing or the lifting by the u.s. government of the ban on u.s. crude oil exports could restrict the availability of our raw materials, thereby increasing our costs.
with increased volatility in raw material costs, our suppliers could impose more onerous terms on us, resulting in shorter payment cycles and increasing our working capital requirements.
our ability to source raw materials may be adversely affected by political instability, civil disturbances or other governmental actions.
we obtain a portion of our principal raw materials from sources in north africa, the middle east, and central and south america that may be less politically stable than other areas in which we conduct business, such as europe or the u.s. political instability, civil disturbances and actions by governments in these areas are likely to substantially increase the price and decrease the supply of raw materials necessary for our operations, which will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
increased incidents of civil unrest, including terrorist attacks and demonstrations that have been marked by violence, have occurred in a number of countries in north africa and the middle east. some political regimes in these countries are threatened or have changed as a result of such unrest. political instability and civil unrest could continue to spread in the region and involve other areas. such unrest, if it continues to spread or grow in intensity, could lead to civil wars, regional conflicts, or regime changes resulting in governments that are hostile to countries in which we conduct substantial business, such as in europe, the u.s., or their respective trading partners.
economic disruptions and downturns in general, and particularly continued global economic uncertainty or economic turmoil in emerging markets, could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, operating results, financial condition and cash flows.
our results of operations can be materially affected by adverse conditions in the financial markets and depressed economic conditions generally. economic downturns in the businesses and geographic areas in which we sell our products substantially reduce demand for our products and result in decreased sales volumes and increased credit risk. recessionary environments adversely affect our business because demand for our products is reduced, particularly from our customers in industrial markets generally and the automotive and housing industries specifically, and may result in higher costs of capital. a significant portion of our revenues and earnings are derived from our business in europe, including southern europe. in addition, most of our european transactions and assets, including cash reserves and receivables, are denominated in euros.
if a sustained financial crisis in europe leads to a further significant devaluation of the euro, the value of our financial assets that are denominated in euros would be significantly reduced when translated to u.s. dollars for financial reporting purposes. we also derive significant revenues from our business in emerging markets, particularly the emerging markets in asia and south america. any broad-based downturn in these emerging
markets, or in a key market such as china, could require us to reduce export volumes into these markets and could also require us to divert product sales to less profitable markets. any of these conditions could ultimately harm our overall business, prospects, operating results, financial condition and cash flows.
the cyclicality and volatility of the industries in which we participate may cause significant fluctuations in our operating results.
our business operations are subject to the cyclical and volatile nature of the supply-demand balance in the chemical and refining industries. our future operating results are expected to continue to be affected by this cyclicality and volatility. the chemical and refining industries historically have experienced alternating periods of capacity shortages, causing prices and profit margins to increase, followed by periods of excess capacity, resulting in oversupply, declining capacity utilization rates and declining prices and profit margins.
in addition to changes in the supply and demand for products, changes in energy prices and other worldwide economic conditions can cause volatility. these factors result in significant fluctuations in profits and cash flow from period to period and over business cycles.
new capacity additions in asia, the middle east and north america may lead to periods of oversupply and lower profitability. a sizable number of expansions have been announced in north america. the timing and extent of any changes to currently prevailing market conditions are uncertain and supply and demand may be unbalanced at any time. as a consequence, we are unable to accurately predict the extent or duration of future industry cycles or their effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
we sell products in highly competitive global markets and face significant price pressures.
we sell our products in highly competitive global markets. due to the commodity nature of many of our products, competition in these markets is based primarily on price and, to a lesser extent, on product performance, product quality, product deliverability, reliability of supply and customer service. often, we are not able to protect our market position for these products by product differentiation and may not be able to pass on cost increases to our customers due to the significant competition in our business.
in addition, we face increased competition from companies that may have greater financial resources and different cost structures or strategic goals than us. these include large integrated oil companies (some of which also have chemical businesses), government-owned businesses, and companies that receive subsidies or other government incentives to produce certain products in a specified geographic region. continuing, increased competition from these companies, especially in our olefin and refining businesses, could limit our ability to increase product sales prices in response to raw material and other cost increases, or could cause us to reduce product sales prices to compete effectively, which could reduce our profitability. competitors with different cost structures or strategic goals than we have may be able to invest significant capital into their businesses, including expenditures for research and development.
in addition, specialty products we produce may become commoditized over time. increased competition could result in lower prices or lower sales volumes, which would have a negative impact on our results of operations.
interruptions of operations at our facilities may result in liabilities or lower operating results.
we own and operate large-scale facilities. our operating results are dependent on the continued operation of our various production facilities and the ability to complete construction and maintenance projects on schedule. interruptions at our facilities may materially reduce the productivity and profitability of a particular manufacturing facility, or our business as a whole, during and after the period of such operational difficulties. in the past, we had to shut down plants on the u.s. gulf coast, including the temporary shutdown of our houston refinery, as a result of hurricanes striking the texas coast.
in addition, because the houston refinery is our only refining operation, an outage at the refinery could have a particularly negative impact on our operating results. unlike our chemical and polymer production facilities, which may have sufficient excess capacity to mitigate the negative impact of lost production at other facilities, we do not have the ability to increase refining production elsewhere in the u.s.
although we take precautions to enhance the safety of our operations and minimize the risk of disruptions, our operations are subject to hazards inherent in chemical manufacturing and refining and the related storage and transportation of raw materials, products and wastes. these potential hazards include:
Â•   increased restrictions on, or the unavailability of, water for use at our manufacturing sites or for the transport of our products or raw materials;
Â•   shipment of incorrect or off-specification product to customers;
Â•   other environmental risks; and
some of these hazards may cause severe damage to or destruction of property and equipment or personal injury and loss of life and may result in suspension of operations or the shutdown of affected facilities.
large capital projects can take many years to complete, and market conditions could deteriorate significantly between the project approval date and the project startup date, negatively impacting project returns. if we are unable to complete capital projects at their expected costs and in a timely manner, or if the market conditions assumed in our project economics deteriorate, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.
delays or cost increases related to capital spending programs involving engineering, procurement and construction of facilities could materially adversely affect our ability to achieve forecasted internal rates of return and operating results. delays in making required changes or upgrades to our facilities could subject us to fines or penalties as well as affect our ability to supply certain products we produce. such delays or cost increases may arise as a result of unpredictable factors, many of which are beyond our control, including:
Â•   denial of or delay in receiving requisite regulatory approvals and/or permits;
Â•   adverse weather conditions, natural disasters or other events (such as equipment malfunctions, explosions, fires or spills) affecting our facilities, or those of vendors or suppliers;
Â•   shortages of sufficiently skilled labor, or labor disagreements resulting in unplanned work stoppages; and
Â•   nonperformance by, or disputes with, vendors, suppliers, contractors or subcontractors.
any one or more of these factors could have a significant impact on our ongoing capital projects. if we were unable to make up the delays associated with such factors or to recover the related costs, or if market conditions change, it could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
increased it security threats and more sophisticated and targeted computer crime could pose a risk to our systems, networks, products, facilities and services.
increased global information security threats and more sophisticated, targeted computer crime pose a risk to the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data, operations and infrastructure. while we attempt to mitigate these risks by employing a number of measures, including security measures, employee training, comprehensive monitoring of our networks and systems, and maintenance of backup and protective systems, our employees, systems, networks, products, facilities and services remain potentially vulnerable to sophisticated espionage or cyber-assault. depending on their nature and scope, such threats could potentially lead to the compromise of confidential information, improper use of our systems and networks, manipulation and destruction of data, defective products, production downtimes and operational disruptions, which in turn could adversely affect our reputation, competitiveness and results of operations.
we operate internationally and are subject to exchange rate fluctuations, exchange controls, political risks and other risks relating to international operations.
we operate internationally and are subject to the risks of doing business on a global level. these risks include fluctuations in currency exchange rates, economic instability and disruptions, restrictions on the transfer of funds and the imposition of duties and tariffs. additional risks from our multinational business include transportation delays and interruptions, war, terrorist activities, epidemics, pandemics, political instability, import and export controls, changes in governmental policies, labor unrest and current and changing regulatory environments.
we generate revenues from export sales and operations that may be denominated in currencies other than the relevant functional currency. exchange rates between these currencies and functional currencies in recent years have fluctuated significantly and may do so in the future. it is possible that fluctuations in exchange rates will result in reduced operating results. additionally, we operate with the objective of having our worldwide cash available in the locations where it is needed, including the united kingdom for our parent companyÂ’s significant cash obligations as a result of dividend and interest payments. it is possible that we may not always be able to provide cash to other jurisdictions when needed or that such transfers of cash could be subject to additional taxes, including withholding taxes.
our operating results could be negatively affected by the global laws, rules and regulations, as well as political environments, in the jurisdictions in which we operate. there could be reduced demand for our products, decreases in the prices at which we can sell our products and disruptions of production or other operations. additionally, there may be substantial capital and other costs to comply with regulations and/or increased security costs or insurance premiums, any of which could reduce our operating results.
we obtain a portion of our principal raw materials from international sources that are subject to these same risks. our compliance with applicable customs, currency exchange control regulations, transfer pricing regulations or any other laws or regulations to which we may be subject could be challenged. furthermore, these laws may be modified, the result of which may be to prevent or limit subsidiaries from transferring cash to us.
furthermore, we are subject to certain existing, and may be subject to possible future, laws that limit or may limit our activities while some of our competitors may not be subject to such laws, which may adversely affect our competitiveness.
changes in tax laws and regulations could affect our tax rate and our results of operations.
we are a tax resident in the united kingdom and are subject to the united kingdom corporate income tax system. lyondellbasell n.v. has little or no taxable income of its own because, as a holding company, it does not conduct any operations. through our subsidiaries, we have substantial operations world-wide. taxes are primarily paid on the earnings generated in various jurisdictions, including the united states, the netherlands, germany, france, and italy.
a portion of the companyÂ’s interest income from internal financing is either untaxed or taxed at rates substantially lower than the u.s. statutory rate. in september 2016, the uk enacted provisions (the so called Â“anti-hybrid provisionsÂ”), effective for years beginning january 1, 2017, that will impact our internal financing structure. in addition, in october 2016 the u.s. treasury issued final section 385 debt-equity regulations that may also impact our internal financings.
we monitor income tax legislative developments (including, for example, the u.s. tax reform proposals and the european unionÂ’s state aid investigations) in countries where we conduct business. recently, there has been an increase in attention, both in the u.k. and globally, to the tax practices of multinational companies, including proposals by the organization for economic cooperation and development with respect to base erosion and profit shifting. such attention may result in legislative changes that could adversely affect our tax rate. management does not believe that recent changes in income tax laws will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements, although new or proposed changes to tax laws could affect our tax liabilities in the future.
many of our businesses depend on our intellectual property. our future success will depend in part on our ability to protect our intellectual property rights, and our inability to do so could reduce our ability to maintain our competitiveness and margins.
we have a significant worldwide patent portfolio of issued and pending patents. these patents and patent applications, together with proprietary technical know-how, are significant to our competitive position, particularly with regard to po, performance chemicals, petrochemicals, and polymers. we rely on the patent, copyright and trade secret laws of the countries in which we operate to protect our investment in research and development, manufacturing and marketing. however, we may be unable to prevent third parties from using our intellectual property without authorization. proceedings to protect these rights could be costly, and we may not prevail.
the failure of our patents or confidentiality agreements to protect our processes, apparatuses, technology, trade secrets or proprietary know-how could result in significantly lower revenues, reduced profit margins and cash flows and/or loss of market share. we also may be subject to claims that our technology, patents or other intellectual property infringes on a third partyÂ’s intellectual property rights. unfavorable resolution of these claims could result in restrictions on our ability to deliver the related service or in a settlement that could be material to us.
shared control or lack of control of joint ventures may delay decisions or actions regarding the joint ventures.
a portion of our operations are conducted through joint ventures, where control may be exercised by or shared with unaffiliated third parties. we cannot control the actions of our joint venture partners, including any nonperformance, default or bankruptcy of joint venture partners. the joint ventures that we do not control may also lack financial reporting systems to provide adequate and timely information for our reporting purposes.
our joint venture partners may have different interests or goals than we do and may take actions contrary to our requests, policies or objectives. differences in views among the joint venture participants also may result in delayed decisions or in failures to agree on major matters, potentially adversely affecting the business and operations of the joint ventures and in turn our business and operations. we may develop a dispute with any of our partners over decisions affecting the venture that may result in litigation, arbitration or some other form of dispute resolution. if a joint venture participant acts contrary to our interest, it could harm our brand, business, results of operations and financial condition.
we cannot predict with certainty the extent of future costs under environmental, health and safety and other laws and regulations, and cannot guarantee they will not be material.
we may face liability arising out of the normal course of business, including alleged personal injury or property damage due to exposure to chemicals or other hazardous substances at our current or former facilities or chemicals that we manufacture, handle or own. in addition, because our products are components of a variety of other end-use products, we, along with other members of the chemical industry, are subject to potential claims related to those end-use products. any substantial increase in the success of these types of claims could negatively affect our operating results.
we (together with the industries in which we operate) are subject to extensive national, regional, state and local environmental laws, regulations, directives, rules and ordinances concerning:
many of these laws and regulations provide for substantial fines and potential criminal sanctions for violations. some of these laws and regulations are subject to varying and conflicting interpretations. in addition, some of these laws and regulations require us to meet specific financial responsibility requirements. any substantial liability for environmental damage could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
although we have compliance programs and other processes intended to ensure compliance with all such regulations, we are subject to the risk that our compliance with such regulations could be challenged. non-compliance with certain of these regulations could result in the incurrence of additional costs, penalties or assessments that could be material.
our industry is subject to extensive government regulation, and existing, or future regulations may restrict our operations, increase our costs of operations or require us to make additional capital expenditures.
compliance with regulatory requirements could result in higher operating costs, such as regulatory requirements relating to emissions, the security of our facilities, and the transportation, export or registration of our products. we generally expect that regulatory controls worldwide will become increasingly more demanding, but cannot accurately predict future developments.
increasingly strict environmental laws and inspection and enforcement policies, could affect the handling, manufacture, use, emission or disposal of products, other materials or hazardous and non-hazardous waste. stricter environmental, safety and health laws, regulations and enforcement policies could result in increased operating costs or capital expenditures to comply with such laws and regulations. additionally, we are required to have permits for our businesses and are subject to licensing regulations. these permits and licenses are subject to renewal, modification and in some circumstances, revocation. further, the permits and licenses are often difficult, time consuming and costly to obtain and could contain conditions that limit our operations.
we may incur substantial costs to comply with climate change legislation and related regulatory initiatives.
there has been a broad range of proposed or promulgated state, national and international laws focusing on greenhouse gas (Â“ghgÂ”) reduction. these proposed or promulgated laws apply or could apply in countries where we have interests or may have interests in the future. laws in this field continue to evolve and, while they are likely to be increasingly widespread and stringent, at this stage it is not possible to accurately estimate either a timetable for implementation or our future compliance costs relating to implementation. within the framework of the eu emissions trading scheme (Â“etsÂ”), we were allocated certain allowances of carbon dioxide for the affected plants of our european sites for the period from 2008 to 2012 (Â“ets ii periodÂ”). the ets ii period did not bring additional cost to us as the allowance allocation was sufficient to cover the actual emissions of the affected plants. we were able to build an allowance surplus during the ets ii period which has been banked to the scheme for the period from 2013 to 2020 (Â“ets iii periodÂ”). we expect to incur additional costs for the ets iii period, despite the allowance surplus accrued over the ets ii period, as allowance allocations have been reduced for the ets iii period and more of our plants are affected by the scheme. we maintain an active hedging strategy to cover these additional costs. we expect to incur additional costs in relation to future carbon or ghg emission trading schemes.
in the u.s., the environmental protection agency (the Â“epaÂ”) has promulgated federal ghg regulations under the clean air act affecting certain sources. the epa has issued mandatory ghg reporting requirements, requirements to obtain ghg permits for certain industrial plants and proposals for ghg performance standards for some facilities. the recent epa action could be a precursor to further federal regulation of carbon dioxide emissions and other greenhouse gases, and may affect the outcome of other climate change lawsuits pending in u.s. courts in a manner unfavorable to our industry. in any event, additional regulation may be forthcoming at the u.s. federal or state level with respect to ghg emissions, and such regulation could result in the creation of additional costs in the form of taxes or required acquisition or trading of emission allowances.
compliance with these or other changes in laws, regulations and obligations that create a ghg emissions trading scheme or ghg reduction policies generally could significantly increase our costs or reduce demand for products we produce. additionally, compliance with these regulations may result in increased permitting necessary for the operation of our business or for any of our growth plans. difficulties in obtaining such permits could have an adverse effect on our future growth. therefore, any future potential regulations and legislation could result in increased compliance costs, additional operating restrictions or delays in implementing growth projects or other capital investments, and could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
we may be required to record material charges against our earnings due to any number of events that could cause impairments to our assets.
we may be required to reduce production at or idle facilities for extended periods of time or exit certain businesses as a result of the cyclical nature of our industry. specifically, oversupplies of or lack of demand for particular products or high raw material prices may cause us to reduce production. we may choose to reduce production at certain facilities because we have off-take arrangements at other facilities, which make any reductions or idling unavailable at those facilities. any decision to permanently close facilities or exit a business likely would result in impairment and other charges to earnings.
temporary outages at our facilities can last for several quarters and sometimes longer. these outages could cause us to incur significant costs, including the expenses of maintaining and restarting these facilities. in addition, even though we may reduce production at facilities, we may be required to continue to purchase or pay for utilities or raw materials under take-or-pay supply agreements.
our business is capital intensive and we rely on cash generated from operations and external financing to fund our growth and ongoing capital needs. limitations on access to external financing could adversely affect our operating results.
we require significant capital to operate our current business and fund our growth strategy. moreover, interest payments, dividends and the expansion of our business or other business opportunities may require significant amounts of capital. we believe that our cash from operations currently will be sufficient to meet these needs. however, if we need external financing, our access to credit markets and pricing of our capital is dependent upon maintaining sufficient credit ratings from credit rating agencies and the state of the capital markets generally. there can be no assurances that we would be able to incur indebtedness on terms we deem acceptable, and it is possible that the cost of any financings could increase significantly, thereby increasing our expenses and decreasing our net income. if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow or raise adequate external financing, including as a result of significant disruptions in the global credit markets, we could be forced to restrict our operations and growth opportunities, which could adversely affect our operating results.
we may use our five-year, $2.5 billion revolving credit facility, which backs our commercial paper program, to meet our cash needs, to the extent available. as of december 31, 2016, we had no borrowings or letters of credit outstanding under the facility and $500 million outstanding under our commercial paper program, leaving an unused and available credit capacity of $1,973 million. we may also meet our cash needs by selling receivables under our $900 million u.s. accounts receivable securitization facility. in the event of a default under our credit facility or any of our senior notes, we could be required to immediately repay all outstanding borrowings and make cash deposits as collateral for all obligations the facility supports, which we may not be able to do. any default under any of our credit arrangements could cause a default under many of our other credit agreements and debt instruments. without waivers from lenders party to those agreements, any such default could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue to operate.
legislation and regulatory initiatives could lead to a decrease in demand for our products.
new or revised governmental regulations and independent studies relating to the effect of our products on health, safety and the environment may affect demand for our products and the cost of producing our products. initiatives by governments and private interest groups will potentially require increased toxicological testing and risk assessments of a wide variety of chemicals, including chemicals used or produced by us. for example, in the united states, the national toxicology program (Â“ntpÂ”) is a federal interagency program that seeks to identify and select for study chemicals and other substances to evaluate potential human health hazards. in the european union, the regulation on registration, evaluation, authorisation and restriction of chemicals (Â“reachÂ”) is regulation designed to identify the intrinsic properties of chemical substances, assess hazards and risks of the substances, and identify and implement the risk management measures to protect humans and the environment.
assessments under ntp, reach or similar programs or regulations in other jurisdictions may result in heightened concerns about the chemicals we use or produce and may result in additional requirements being placed on the production, handling, labeling or use of those chemicals. such concerns and additional requirements could also increase the cost incurred by our customers to use our chemical products and otherwise limit the use of these products, which could lead to a decrease in demand for these products. such a decrease in demand could have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations.
we are subject to and may in the future be subject to a variety of legal proceedings and claims that arise out of the ordinary conduct of our business. results of legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty. irrespective of its merits, litigation may be both lengthy and disruptive to our operations and may cause significant expenditure and diversion of management attention. we may be faced with significant monetary damages or injunctive relief against us that could materially adversely affect a portion of our business operations or materially and adversely affect our financial position and our results of operations should we fail to prevail in certain matters.
significant changes in pension fund investment performance or assumptions relating to pension costs may adversely affect the valuation of pension obligations, the funded status of pension plans, and our pension cost.
our pension cost is materially affected by the discount rates used to measure pension obligations, the level of plan assets available to fund those obligations at the measurement date and the expected long-term rates of return on plan assets. significant changes in investment performance or a change in the portfolio mix of invested assets may result in corresponding increases and decreases in the value of plan assets, particularly equity securities, or in a change of the expected rate of return on plan assets. any changes in key actuarial assumptions, such as the discount rate or mortality rate, would impact the valuation of pension obligations, affecting the reported funded status of our pension plans as well as the net periodic pension cost in the following fiscal years.
nearly all of our current pension plans have projected benefit obligations that exceed the fair value of the plan assets. as of december 31, 2016, the aggregate deficit was $942 million. any declines in the fair values of the pension plans assets could require additional payments by us in order to maintain specified funding levels.
our pension plans are subject to legislative and regulatory requirements of applicable jurisdictions, which could include, under certain circumstances, local governmental authority to terminate the plan.
item 7.   managementÂ’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.
general this discussion should be read in conjunction with the information contained in our consolidated financial statements, and the accompanying notes elsewhere in this report. when we use the terms Â“we,Â” Â“us,Â” Â“ourÂ” or similar words in this discussion, unless the context otherwise requires, we are referring to lyondellbasell industries n.v. and its consolidated subsidiaries.
overview earnings for 2016 were good despite a heavy schedule of planned maintenance and the challenges of several operational upsets at our houston refinery. our continued strong earnings and cash flow enabled us to increase the amount of our interim dividends and to continue the repurchase of our ordinary shares. during 2016, the global olefins and polyolefins industry benefitted from continued favorable supply and demand balances, while low crude oil and fuel prices negatively impacted margins for refining and oxyfuels and related products. strong results for our o&pÂ—eai and technology segments demonstrate continued global industry strength.
the completion of the expansion and turnaround of our corpus christi ethylene facility in the fourth quarter of 2016 marked the final step in our 2 billion pound north american ethylene expansion program. our completed ethylene expansion program, the start of site preparation for our 1.1 billion pound polyethylene facility and advancements on the design of our new po/tba plant, along with the completion of several major plant turnarounds this year position us favorably for the coming years.
significant items that affected 2016 results include:
Â•   lower refining margins and lower crude processing rates due primarily to planned and unplanned maintenance at our houston refinery;
Â•   lower intermediates and derivatives (Â“i&amp;dÂ”) segment results driven mainly by lower margins for most i&amp;d products; and
other noteworthy items during 2016 include the following:
Â•   we increased our revolving credit facility and commercial paper program from $2,000 million to $2,500 million in june 2016;
Â•   we sold our wholly owned argentine subsidiary for $184 million in february 2016, realizing net proceeds of $137 million and an increase in earnings of $78 million.
results of operations for the periods discussed in these Â“results of operationsÂ” are presented in the table below.
research and development expenses                             99                      102                      127
income from equity investments                               367                      339                      257
provision for income taxes                                 1,386                    1,730                    1,540
lower average sales prices driven by decreases in the prices of crude oil and other feedstocks led to revenue declines of 10% in 2016. lower sales volumes in our refining segment due to turnaround activities and unplanned outages, which were substantially offset by higher i&d segment sales volumes, led to a 1% volume-driven decline in revenues. the decline in revenues includes a $290 million impact from the sale of our wholly owned argentine subsidiary.
the decline in prices for crude oil and other feedstocks during 2015 was the primary contributing factor for lower average sales prices, which were responsible for 23% of the revenue decline in 2015 versus 2014. unfavorable translation impacts resulting from a significant decline in the euro/u.s. dollar exchange rate further reduced revenues by 5% during 2015.
sales volumes during 2015 were relatively unchanged from 2014. a decrease in sales due to lower crude processing rates in our refining segment was mostly offset by higher sales volumes for u.s. and european polyolefins, oxyfuels and related products and intermediate chemicals. revenues for each of our business segments are reviewed further in the Â“segment analysisÂ” section below.
fluctuations in our cost of sales are generally driven by changes in feedstock and energy costs, as all other material components remain relatively flat from year to year. feedstock and energy related costs generally represent approximately 75% to 80% of cost of sales, other variable costs account for approximately 10% of cost
of sales on an annual basis and fixed operating costs, consisting primarily of expenses associated with employee compensation, depreciation and amortization, and maintenance, range from approximately 10% to 15% in each annual period.
the decrease in cost of sales in 2016 was primarily due to lower feedstock and energy costs. raw material costs for crude oil, heavy liquids and natural gas liquids (Â“nglsÂ”) and other feedstocks were lower in 2016 compared to 2015. the sale of our wholly owned argentine subsidiary in 2016 also contributed approximately $230 million to the decline in 2016 cost of sales.
cost of sales in 2016 and 2015 also included noncash, pre-tax lower of cost or market (Â“lcmÂ”) inventory valuation charges totaling $29 million and $548 million, respectively. the 2016 adjustment is related to a drop in polypropylene prices in our o&pÂ—americas segment and the adjustments in 2015 affected all of our segments except technology. the 2015 adjustments were driven mainly by declines in the prices for crude oil, ethylene, propylene, benzene and etbe. during 2015, cost of sales also included $35 million of amortization expense associated with the expiration of emission allowance credits in our refining and i&d segments.
the decrease in cost of sales in 2015 was primarily due to lower feedstock and energy costs. in 2015, the raw material costs for crude oil, heavy liquids and natural gas liquids (Â“nglsÂ”) and other feedstocks were significantly lower relative to 2014.
cost of sales in 2015 included the $548 million pretax lcm inventory valuation charge and $35 million of amortization expense discussed above. cost of sales in 2014 included a $760 million charge related to an lcm inventory valuation adjustment driven by a decline in feedstock prices in our o&pÂ—americas segment and a $52 million benefit in our o&pÂ—eai segment associated with a settlement for certain existing and future environmental claims under a 2005 indemnification agreement.
operating income for 2016 reflects the impacts of the lcm inventory valuation adjustment discussed above and a $58 million pension settlement charge. operating income for 2015 reflects the lcm inventory valuation adjustment and the emission credit allowance amortization discussed above. including these impacts, 2016 operating income declined relative to 2015 by $863 million, $243 million and $166 million in our o&pÂ—americas, refining and i&d segments, respectively. these lower results were partially offset by a $185 million improvement in operating income for our o&pÂ—eai segment.
2015 versus 2014Â—operating income increased by $386 million in 2015, which includes the impact of the lcm inventory valuation adjustments, environmental settlement and emission credit allowances amortization discussed above.
including these impacts, operating income in 2015 for our o&pÂ—eai and refining segments reflect improvements of $425 million and $250 million, respectively. these improvements were offset in part by a $316 million decline in the results of our o&pÂ—americas segment.
operating results for each of our business segments are reviewed further in the Â“segment analysisÂ” section below.
2016 versus 2015Â—debt issuances of our 1.875% guaranteed notes due 2022 in march 2016 and our 4.625% senior notes due 2055 in march 2015 and reduced benefits from our fixed-for-floating interest rate swaps resulted in $42 million of higher interest expense in 2016. this increase was partially offset by a $22 million increase in capitalized interest and $7 million of lower bank and other fees.
2015 versus 2014Â—the decrease in interest expense in 2015 relative to 2014 was primarily due to favorable impacts of $85 million related to our fixed-for-floating interest rate swaps and cross-currency swaps. this decrease was offset in part by $46 million of higher interest charges related to the issuance of our 4.875% guaranteed notes due 2044 in february 2014 and our 4.625% senior notes due 2055 in march 2015.
for additional information related to our fixed-for-floating interest rate swaps and cross-currency swaps, see notes 12, 14 and 15.
income from equity investmentsÂ—our income from equity investments was $367 million in 2016, $339 million in 2015 and $257 million in 2014.
2016 versus 2015Â—the $28 million increase in income from equity investments in 2016 is largely due to improved results for our joint ventures in mexico, saudi arabia, poland and thailand.
2015 versus 2014Â—our 2015 income from equity investments increased by $82 million over 2014 largely due to improved results from our joint ventures in poland, korea and mexico, offset in part by lower results from our joint ventures in saudi arabia.
income taxesÂ—our effective income tax rates of 26.5% in 2016, 27.9% in 2015 and 27.0% in 2014 resulted in tax provisions of $1,386 million, $1,730 million and $1,540 million, respectively. our 2016 income tax provision includes $135 million of non-cash out of period adjustments from prior years, for further information on these adjustments, please see footnote 18, income taxes. our effective income tax rate fluctuates based on, among other factors, changes in pretax income in countries with varying statutory tax rates, the u.s. domestic production activity deduction, changes in valuation allowances, changes in foreign exchange gains/losses, the amount of exempt income, and changes in unrecognized tax benefits associated with uncertain tax positions. the companyÂ’s exempt income primarily includes interest income and equity earnings of joint ventures. the interest income is earned by certain of our european subsidiaries through intercompany financings and is either untaxed or taxed at rates substantially lower than the u.s. statutory rate. the equity earnings are attributable to our joint ventures and these earnings when paid through dividends to certain european subsidiaries are eligible for participation exemptions, which exempt the dividend payments from all or portions of normal statutory income tax rates. we currently anticipate the favorable treatment for the interest income and dividends to continue in the near term; however, this treatment is based on current law and tax rulings, which could change. the foreign exchange gains/losses have a permanent impact on our effective income tax rate that can cause unpredictable movement in our effective income tax rate. we continue to maintain valuation allowances in various jurisdictions totaling $96 million, which could impact our effective tax rate in the future. we believe our effective income tax rate for 2017 will be approximately 27%.
2016Â—the 2016 effective income tax rate, which was lower than the u.s. statutory tax rate of 35%, was favorably impacted by exempt income (-6.7%), earnings in various countries (notably in europe) with lower statutory tax rates (-3.0%), the impact of a change in non-u.s. tax law on our deferred tax liabilities (-1.0%) and the u.s. domestic production activity deduction (-0.8%). these favorable items were partially offset by the effects of non-cash out of period adjustments (2.5%) and u.s. state and local income taxes (0.5%).
2015Â—the 2015 effective income tax rate, which was lower than the u.s. statutory tax rate of 35%, was favorably impacted by exempt income (-5.1%), earnings in various countries (notably in europe) with lower statutory tax rates (-2.1%), and the u.s. domestic production activity deduction (-1.4%). these favorable items were partially offset by the effects of u.s. state and local income taxes (1.0%).
2014Â—the 2014 effective income tax rate, which was lower than the u.s. statutory tax rate of 35%, was favorably impacted by exempt income (-4.8%), the u.s. domestic production activity deduction (-1.9%), foreign exchange losses (-1.5%), and earnings in various countries (notably in europe) with lower statutory tax rates (-1.1%). these favorable items were partially offset by the effects of u.s. state and local income taxes (1.1%).
for further information related to our income taxes, see note 18 to the consolidated financial statements.
2016 versus 2015Â—in 2016, comprehensive income decreased on lower net income, the unfavorable impacts of financial derivative adjustments and the increase in actuarial losses related to our defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans recognized in 2016. these decreases were offset in part by the net favorable impact of unrealized net changes in foreign currency translation adjustments.
in 2016, we had a pre-tax gain of $43 million related to the effective portion of the unrealized gains of our financial instruments designated as net investment hedges. the cumulative effect of our derivatives designated as cash flow hedges in 2016 was a loss of $29 million. in 2016, cumulative losses associated with the strengthening of the euro versus the u.s. dollar in the first half of the year resulted in a pre-tax loss of $15 million related to our cross currency swaps. an unrealized loss of $17 million in 2016 related to forward-starting interest rate swaps was driven by decreases in benchmark interest rates during that period.
in 2016 and 2015, we recognized net actuarial losses of $188 million and $8 million, respectively. the $188 million net loss in 2016 reflects $279 million of losses due to pension and other postretirement benefit discount rate decreases, offset by $79 million of gains related to pension asset experience and $10 million due to favorable postretirement liability experience and other immaterial items. in 2015, the $8 million net loss was primarily attributable to $133 million of actual asset return less than the expected return. this loss was offset by gains due to $73 million of discount rate increases and, $50 million of gains due to favorable liability experience and healthcare assumptions. in 2016, we also recognized a $61 million reclassification adjustment related primarily to a voluntary lump sum program offered to certain former employees in select u.s. pension plans. total lump sum payments from these plans exceeded annual service and interest cost in 2016 resulting in this loss.
2015 versus 2014Â—in 2015, comprehensive income increased on higher net income, the reduction in actuarial losses related to our defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans recognized in 2015, the favorable impact of unrealized net changes in foreign currency translation adjustments and to a lesser extent, the benefit of favorable financial derivative adjustments.
in 2015 and 2014, we recognized net actuarial losses of $8 million and $493 million, respectively. the $493 million net loss in the prior year was caused primarily by pension and other postretirement benefit discount rate decreases and mortality assumption changes. in 2015, the $8 million net loss was primarily attributable to $133 million of actual asset return less than the expected return. this loss was offset by gains due to $73 million of discount rate increases and, $50 million of gains due to favorable liability experience and healthcare assumptions.
the predominant functional currency for our operations outside of the u.s. is the euro. relative to the u.s. dollar, the value of the euro decreased during 2015 and 2014, resulting in losses as reflected in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income.
in 2015, the cumulative effect of our derivatives designated as cash flow hedges was a gain of $279 million. cumulative gains in 2015 associated with the decline in the euro versus the u.s. dollar resulted in a pre-tax gain of $262 million related to our cross currency swaps. a $17 million gain in 2015 related to forward-starting interest rate swaps were driven by increases in benchmark interest rates during that period.
see Â“critical accounting policiesÂ” below and note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on the key assumptions included in calculating the discount rate and expected return on plan assets.
segment analysis we use earnings before interest, income taxes, and depreciation and amortization (Â“ebitdaÂ”) as our measure of profitability for segment reporting purposes. this measure of segment operating results is used by our chief operating decision maker to assess the performance of and allocate resources to our operating segments. intersegment eliminations and items that are not directly related or allocated to business operations are included in Â“other.Â” for additional information related to our operating segments, as well as a reconciliation of ebitda to its nearest generally accepted accounting principles (Â“gaapÂ”) measure, income from continuing operations before income taxes, see note 22, segment and related information, to our consolidated financial statements.
our continuing operations are divided into five reportable segments: o&pÂ—americas; o&pÂ—eai; i&d; refining; and technology. the following tables reflect selected financial information for our reportable segments.
technology segment                                        479                      465                      497
technology segment                                        221                      197                      171
technology segment                                         41                       46                       61
income (loss) from equity investments:
ebitda:
technology segment                                        262                      243                      232
olefins and polyolefinsÂ—americas segment overviewÂ—in calculating the impact of margin and volume on ebitda, consistent with industry practice, management offsets revenues and volumes related to ethylene co-products against the cost to produce ethylene. volume and price impacts of ethylene co-products are reported in margin. ethylene is a major building block of olefins and polyolefins and as such management assesses the performance of the segment based on ethylene sales volumes and prices and our internal cost of ethylene production.
2016 versus 2015Â—ebitda in 2016 reflects lower olefins and polyethylene results, partially offset by improved polypropylene results.
the benefit to 2016 ebitda from a $57 million gain on the sale of our wholly owned argentine subsidiary in february 2016 was offset in part by a $29 million non-cash lcm inventory valuation charge recognized in the fourth quarter due primarily to a drop in polypropylene prices. in 2015, volatility in the benchmark prices for heavy liquids and natural gas and certain correlated products, particularly ethylene and propylene, which continued during most of the year, led to net non-cash lcm inventory valuation adjustments totaling $160 million.
2015 versus 2014Â—segment results were lower in 2015 primarily due to a decline in olefins results partially offset by improved polyolefin results relative to 2014. olefins margins in 2015 continued to benefit from low-cost ethylene produced from ngls in north america, but to a lesser extent than in 2014. the cost advantage for this ethylene, compared to that produced from naphtha and other crude oil-based liquids in the rest of the world, declined due to the lower crude oil prices in 2015.
prices for heavy liquids, ngls and olefins declined significantly in the fourth quarter of 2014 to levels that had not been seen in recent years. these declines resulted in the recognition of the non-cash, lcm inventory adjustments totaling $279 million in 2014 discussed below. as discussed above, results for 2015 were also negatively impacted by a $160 million lcm inventory valuation adjustment.
ethylene raw materialsÂ—benchmark crude oil and natural gas prices generally have been indicators of the level and direction of the movement of raw material and energy costs for ethylene and its co-products in the o&pÂ—americas segment. ethylene and its co-products are produced from two major raw material groups:
although prices of these raw materials are generally related to crude oil and natural gas prices, during specific periods the relationships among these materials and benchmarks may vary significantly. in the u.s., we have significant capability to change the mix of raw materials used in the production of ethylene and its co-products to take advantage of the relative costs of heavy liquids and ngls.
production economics for the industry have favored ngls in recent years. although the decline in oil prices significantly reduced the cost of ethylene produced from heavy liquids in 2015, ngl prices also declined and they have continued to be preferred feedstocks. we produced between 87% and 90% of our u.s. ethylene production ngls during the past three years.
the following table sets forth selected financial information for the o&pÂ—americas segment including income from equity investments, which is a component of ebitda.
income from equity investments                    59                      42                      21
ebitda                                         2,877                   3,661                   3,911
2016 versus 2015Â—average sales prices for ethylene and polyethylene declined in 2016, consistent with feedstock prices that are correlated to the price of natural gas, which declined relative to 2015. these lower average sales prices led to a revenue decrease of 11% in that period. a 2% revenue increase resulted from the improvement in 2016 product sales volumes as higher olefins sales volume, supported by an increase in the level of purchases for resale during turnaround activities, were only partly offset by lower polyolefins volumes. the sale of our argentine subsidiary reduced 2016 revenues by $230 million.
2015 versus 2014Â—average sales prices declined for most products in 2015 resulting in a 31% revenue decrease compared to 2014. lower average olefin prices reflect the significant decline in prices for crude oil and correlated products relative to prices in 2014. the decline in average polyethylene and polypropylene sales prices followed the decline in the 2015 prices of their respective feedstocks, ethylene and propylene.
these decreases in revenues were offset in part by an increase in sales volumes, which gave rise to a 2% revenue increase in 2015, compared to 2014. ethylene sales volumes were higher due to increased production reflecting higher capacity following the completion of the expansion-related turnaround at our la porte, texas facility during 2014 and additional production related to less planned and unplanned downtime at our channelview, texas facility. polyethylene sales volumes improved in 2015, due to the completion of an expansion-related turnaround at our matagorda, texas facility in the first quarter of 2014 and continued healthy global demand.
ebitdaÂ—ebitda decreased by $784 million, or 21%, in 2016 compared to 2015 and by $250 million, or 6%, in 2015 compared to 2014.
2016 versus 2015Â—lower olefin and polyethylene margins in 2016 were partially offset by higher polypropylene margins. the decline in olefins margins reflected a 2 cents per pound decrease in average ethylene sales prices and an approximate 4 cents per pound increase in the cost of ethylene production driven by lower co-product prices and an increase in the cost of ngl feedstocks. polyethylene margins declined 4 cents per pound from very high levels in 2015 as average polyethylene sales prices caught up with the overall decline in the cost of ethylene feedstock, after lagging feedstock cost declines in 2015. a 4 cent per pound improvement in 2016 polypropylene margins reflects the benefits of lower propylene feedstock costs and tight market conditions. these olefin and polyethylene margin impacts led to a 17% decrease in ebitda during 2016. an additional 10% decline in 2016 ebitda is attributed to the impact of lower volumes related to lower ethylene production during the turnaround and expansion-related activities at our corpus christi, texas ethylene facility and a site-wide outage related to turnaround activities at our morris, illinois site.
these negative impacts were partially offset by a 6% increase in 2016 ebitda primarily due to a $131 million reduction in the unfavorable lcm adjustment recognized in 2016 versus 2015 and to the $57 million gain on the 2016 sale of our argentine subsidiary.
2015 versus 2014Â—the 6% decrease in ebitda reflected a 24% net margin decline as lower olefin margins were partly offset by higher polyethylene and polypropylene margins. this decrease in margins was
offset in part by a 14% increase related to higher volumes and a 3% increase related to the $119 million decline in the non-cash charges related to the lcm inventory valuation adjustments discussed above. improvements in our income from equity investments accounts for the remaining 1% increase in ebitda during 2015.
olefin margins declined in 2015 as a 19 cent per pound drop in the average sales price for ethylene outpaced the decrease in our cost of ethylene production. lower ngl and heavy liquids feedstock prices in 2015 outpaced the decline in selling prices of our co-products, which resulted in the decrease of our cost of ethylene production compared to the prior year.
polyethylene margins reflected a 5 cent per pound improvement in 2015 as demand remained strong and decreases in the cost of ethylene feedstock outpaced lower average sales prices relative to 2014. polypropylene margins, which increased by 7 cents per pound in 2015, benefited from lower propylene feedstock costs, which in part reflected the decline in crude oil prices, and higher average sales prices relative to propylene, driven by industry operating issues and increased demand.
sales volumes in 2015 increased as compared to the prior year as a result of downtime and expansion-related activities in 2014 and the increased demand discussed above.
olefins and polyolefinsÂ—europe, asia, international segment overviewÂ—in calculating the impact of margin and volume on ebitda, consistent with industry practice, management offsets revenues and volumes related to ethylene co-products against the cost to produce ethylene. volume and price impacts of ethylene co-products are reported in margin. ethylene is a major building block of our olefins and polyolefins and as such management assesses the performance of the segment based on ethylene sales volumes and prices and our internal cost of ethylene production.
2016 versus 2015Â—higher operating results in 2016 were largely the result of higher polyolefin margins, offset in part by lower olefins results and reductions in polyolefins volumes due to turnaround activity and unplanned downtime.
ebitda in 2016 reflects the benefit of a $21 million gain from the sale of our wholly owned argentine subsidiary and $11 million of gains from the sales of our joint venture in japan and idled assets in australia. ebitda in 2015 included a $30 million non-cash lcm inventory valuation adjustment driven by a decline in the prices of naphtha and polyolefins.
2015 versus 2014Â—operating results in 2015 reflect improved results for our european polyolefins and, to a lesser extent, higher results for olefins and better results for our joint ventures that are accounted for using the equity method.
at the end of the fourth quarter of 2015, lower feedstock and product prices resulted in market prices that were lower than the carrying value of our related inventories. accordingly, we recorded a $30 million non-cash, lcm inventory valuation charge related to olefins and polyolefins. this compares to the $44 million non-cash, lcm inventory valuation charge related to olefins that was recognized in the fourth quarter of 2014 as a result of the declining price of naphtha.
ethylene raw materialsÂ—in europe, heavy liquids are the primary raw materials for our ethylene production. in recent years, we have sourced increased amounts of advantaged ngls when the opportunity has arisen. in 2016, we continued to process advantaged feedstocks as market opportunities allowed.
the following table sets forth selected financial information for the o&pÂ—eai segment including income from equity investments, which is a component of ebitda.
income from equity investments                   302                     283                     229
ebitda                                         2,067                   1,825                   1,366
2016 versus 2015Â—the decline in 2016 revenues comprises a 7% decrease related to lower average sales prices, and a 2% reduction of sales volumes stemming from turnaround activities and unplanned outages.
in 2016, average sales prices for olefins and polyolefins fell following feedstock prices that declined in conjunction with the price of crude oil.
2015 versus 2014Â—the decline in 2015 revenues reflects decreases of 14% and 12% related to lower average sales prices and currency translation impacts, respectively. an increase in polyolefins volumes resulting from increased demand and higher operating rates, which was substantially offset by a decline in olefins volumes stemming from turnaround activities at our muÌˆnchsmuÌˆnster, germany facility and unplanned outages, was responsible for a 2% revenue increase in 2015.
in 2015, lower average sales prices for polypropylene were partially offset by higher average polyethylene prices. decreases in feedstock costs in 2015 led to the decline in polypropylene sales prices compared to 2014. the increase in polyethylene prices in 2015 reflect strong spread increases over ethylene, primarily in europe.
ebitdaÂ—ebitda increased by $242 million, or 13%, in 2016 compared to 2015 and by $459 million, or 34%, in 2015 compared to 2014.
2016 versus 2015Â—in 2016, higher european polyolefins margins stemming from declining ethylene and propylene feedstock costs outpaced falling product prices and led to an 11% increase in ebitda. this margin improvement in 2016 was partially offset by a 2% decrease in ebitda due largely to lower polyolefin volumes.
a 3% increase in 2016 ebitda is attributed to gains associated with the sales of a joint venture, idled assets and our wholly owned argentine subsidiary, as well as the absence of the 2015 lcm inventory valuation adjustment discussed above. income from our equity investments also led to a 1% increase in ebitda in 2016 due to higher polyolefin margins in our european joint venture and strong operating rates in our saudi joint ventures.
2015 versus 2014Â—improved margins in all major product groups and the increase in polyolefins volumes described above contributed 42% and 4%, respectively, to ebitda in 2015. polyolefins margins improved due to supply constraints as a result of several industry outages. olefins margins improved in 2015 as the lower cost of ethylene production, which was driven by lower feedstock prices, outpaced the decline in olefin product prices.
a 4% increase in ebitda associated with an improvement in income from equity investments in 2015, was mainly driven by improved margins relative to 2014 in certain joint ventures as a result of favorable market prices during 2015 and strong operating rates.
these increases were partially offset by a 13% decrease due to the translation of a weaker euro and a 3% decrease related to a net charge of $38 million discussed below. in 2015, ebitda included a $30 million charge related to the lcm adjustment previously discussed. in 2014, ebitda included a $52 million benefit associated
with a settlement for certain existing and future environmental claims under a 2005 indemnification agreement from an insurance settlement, which was offset in part by the $44 million lcm inventory valuation charge discussed above.
intermediates and derivatives segment overview
2016 versus 2015Â—operating results for 2016 were lower than in 2015, as margin compression for most products related to declining energy prices, higher industry production rates and additional industry capacity was only partly offset by the impact of higher volumes.
ebitda in 2015 was negatively impacted by the recognition of $181 million of lcm inventory valuation adjustments driven by the continued decline in prices for feedstocks, certain oxyfuels and related products, and intermediate chemical products to levels that were lower than the carrying value of our related inventories at reporting dates throughout the year.
2015 versus 2014Â—results in 2015 improved as higher margins in intermediate chemicals benefited from the favorable impact of product pricing and declining feedstock costs. this improvement was substantially offset by a decline in 2015 oxyfuels and related products results indicative of a decrease in energy prices compared to unusually high margins in 2014.
the following table sets forth selected financial information for the i&d segment including income from equity investments, which is a component of ebitda.
income from equity investments                     6                      14                       7
ebitda                                         1,333                   1,475                   1,459
revenuesÂ—revenues for 2016 decreased by $546 million, or 7%, compared to 2015 and by $2,358 million, or 23%, in 2015 compared to 2014.
2016 versus 2015Â—lower average sales prices in 2016 reflect the impacts of lower crude oil, lower gasoline prices and the decline in various feedstock prices. additional industry supply also negatively impacted the average sales prices for certain products during 2016. these lower sales prices in 2016 were responsible for an 11% revenue decrease.
2015 versus 2014Â—in 2015, the significant decline in crude oil and key feedstocks prices was the primary driver behind the overall decrease in average sales prices across most products. this decline in prices was offset in part by improved octane blend premiums for oxyfuels and related products and gasoline price spreads over crude oil that were strong in 2015. these lower average sales prices and the impact of currency translation impacts led to revenue decreases of 23% and 6%, respectively.
higher sales volumes for oxyfuels and related products and intermediate chemicals were largely responsible for a 6% volume driven revenue increase. sales volumes for oxyfuels and related products increased due to strong octane and gasoline demand. intermediate chemicals volumes increased due to increased feedstock supply and improved operating rates at our acetyls facilities.
ebitdaÂ—ebitda decreased by $142 million, or 10%, in 2016 compared to 2015 and increased by $16 million, or 1%, in 2015 compared to 2014.
2016 versus 2015Â—lower margins in most i&d products in 2016 resulted in a 30% decrease in ebitda. weaker gasoline markets drove oxyfuels and related product values lower relative to butane feedstock costs, and lower product prices in propylene oxide and derivatives and intermediate chemicals were driven largely by increased industry supply. lower income from our equity investments in 2016 also resulted in a 1% decrease in ebitda during that period.
an ebitda increase in 2016 of 9% related to the higher volumes discussed above, partially offset the negative margin impact. ebitda in 2016 also reflected an increase of 12% related to the absence of the lcm inventory valuation adjustment recognized in the 2015 comparison period.
2015 versus 2014Â—ebitda increased by $16 million, or 1%, in 2015 compared to 2014. higher sales volumes in 2015 as discussed above led to a volume-driven increase of 7% in ebitda.
lower oxyfuels and related products margins, substantially offset by an improvement in intermediate chemicals margins resulted in a 1% decrease in 2015 ebitda. oxyfuels and related products margins were lower in 2015 due to a significant decline in crude oil prices offset in part by strong gasoline price spreads over crude oil and octane blending value. margins for intermediate chemicals improved as styrene margins were favorably impacted by tight supply resulting from industry outages and feedstock prices that declined more rapidly than average sales prices.
ebitda was further reduced by 6% as a result of the $88 million incremental increase in the non-cash lcm inventory valuation adjustment recognized in 2015 over 2014. the remaining change in 2015 ebitda is attributable to a small improvement in income from our equity investments.
refining segment overview
2016 versus 2015Â—lower margins and reduced production due to planned and unplanned outages in 2016 as described below resulted in significantly lower results for our refining segment in 2016 as compared to 2015. ebitda in 2015 included charges totaling $177 million related to non-cash charges associated with lcm inventory valuation adjustments driven by a decline of nearly $20 per barrel in crude oil prices and corresponding reductions in refined product prices.
fourth quarter 2015 results declined significantly compared to the results in the prior three quarters of 2015 as refinery operating rates were significantly lower due to unplanned maintenance outages. the recognition of a $127 million non-cash, lcm inventory valuation adjustment resulted in a loss for the fourth quarter. operating results were higher in 2015 relative to 2014 as a result of improvements in refining margins and the favorable impact of the lower lcm adjustment recognized in 2015.
the following table sets forth selected financial information and heavy crude processing rates for the refining segment and the u.s. refining market margins for the applicable periods. Â“llsÂ” is a light crude oil, while Â“mayaÂ” is a heavy crude oil.
ebitda                                                                      72                   342                    65
heavy crude oil processing rates, thousands of barrels per day             201                   238                   259
market margins, dollars per barrel light crude oilÂ—2-1-1                                                   $10.73                $14.04                $13.32
2016 versus 2015Â—major refined product prices declined due to lower crude oil prices and to weakness relative to crude oil. the average per barrel price of benchmark maya crude oil declined $7.59 in 2016 compared to 2015. a 16% price-related revenue decline in 2016 versus 2015 reflected per barrel price declines of approximately $10.51 and $10.77 for gasoline and distillates, respectively.
the remaining 6% revenue decrease in 2016 is attributed to reduced processing rates. processing declines resulted from several unplanned outages, including a coker unit fire, downtime at crude units with reduced processing and several utility interruptions. planned turnaround activity on a crude unit and a coker unit processing train early in 2016 also contributed to lower throughput during 2016.
2015 versus 2014Â—total revenues decreased on significantly lower product prices due to the drop in crude oil prices and a reduction in sales volumes due to production limitations. the average crude oil price in 2015 declined by slightly over $40 per barrel compared to 2014 leading to lower product pricing. this decline in product pricing caused a 38% decrease in revenues compared to 2014. processing rates in 2015 reflect an 8% decrease from 2014 rates, driven by processing limits which were negatively impacted primarily by unplanned maintenance in the fourth quarter of 2015. this decline contributed to a 6% decrease in 2015 revenues.
ebitdaÂ—ebitda decreased by $270 million, or 79%, in 2016 compared to 2015 and decreased by $277 million, or 426%, in 2015 compared to 2014.
2016 versus 2015Â—a decline in refining margins in 2016 led to a 90% decrease in ebitda. the maya 2-1-1 benchmark refining spread declined in 2016 by approximately $3.10 per barrel relative to 2015. this decrease was driven by per barrel declines of approximately $3.15 and $3.40 in gasoline and diesel spreads, respectively, and an approximate $1.00 reduction in the price differential between brent and maya crude oils. the operating issues that drove lower crude throughput in 2016 also negatively impacted margins due to a less favorably priced crude oil mix and higher variable costs per barrel.
lower production stemming from a reduction in average heavy crude oil processing rates relative to 2015 led to a decrease in ebitda in 2016 of 41%. this reduction in rates was attributable to the unplanned outages, crude unit operating limitations and planned turnaround activities discussed above.
the absence of the $177 million lcm inventory valuation adjustment recognized in 2015 resulted in an ebitda increase of 52% in 2016 as compared to 2015.
2015 versus 2014Â—lcm inventory valuation adjustments of $177 million and $344 million were recognized in 2015 and 2014, respectively. this change in the 2015 lcm inventory valuation adjustment resulted in a 257% increase in ebitda. results improved by an additional 283% in 2015 due to an increase in refining margins. these improvements were offset in part by a 114% decline in ebitda due to lower processing rates.
the increase in refining margins in 2015 relative to 2014 was generated by improved by-product price spreads to crude oil and a 14% increase in purchases of crude oil at advantaged prices relative to the maya crude price benchmark. by-product spreads improved due to the decline in 2015 of the average per barrel price of crude oil relative to 2014. these factors more than offset the $2.13 per barrel decline in the maya 2-1-1 benchmark margin in 2015 versus 2014.
crude processing rates in 2015 reflect an 8% decline relative to 2014. this decline is mainly due to a number of unplanned outages for maintenance that began in the latter part of the third quarter and extended into early december. the average crude processing rate for the fourth quarter of 2015 was 206 thousands of barrels per day. processing rates returned to near full capacity by mid-december 2015.
technology segment overviewÂ—the technology segment recognizes revenues related to the sale of polyolefin catalysts and the licensing of chemical and polyolefin process technologies. these revenues are offset in part by the costs incurred in the production of catalysts, licensing and services activities and research and development (Â“r&dÂ”) activities. in 2016 and 2015, our technology segment incurred approximately 55% of all r&d costs while in 2014, it incurred approximately 65% of our r&d costs.
2016 versus 2015Â—ebitda in 2016 improved with higher catalyst margins. a small increase in licensing and services revenue was mostly offset by slightly lower catalyst sales volumes.
2015 versus 2014Â—ebitda in 2015 was relatively unchanged compared to 2014, reflecting improved catalyst results and lower r&d expenses, offset by lower licensing and services revenues.
the following table sets forth selected financial information for the technology segment.
ebitda                                       262                 243                 232
2016 versus 2015Â—higher average catalyst sales prices and higher revenues recognized on process licenses each led to a 2% increase in 2016 revenues. these increases were partly offset by a 1% revenue decrease resulting from lower catalyst sales volumes.
2015 versus 2014Â—the unfavorable currency translation impacts due to the significantly weaker euro versus the u.s. dollar and a decline in licensing and services revenues contributed 12% and 7% to the decrease in 2015 revenues. these declines were offset in part by revenue increases of 12% and 1%, respectively, related to higher catalyst sales volumes and higher average catalyst sales prices in 2015.
ebitdaÂ—ebitda in 2016 increased by $19 million, or 8%, compared to 2015 and by $11 million, or 5%, in 2015 compared to 2014.
2016 versus 2015Â—a 10% improvement in ebitda during 2016 due to higher catalyst margins and an increase in licensing and services revenue was partly offset by a 2% decrease in ebitda resulting from lower catalyst volumes.
2015 versus 2014Â—ebitda increased by $11 million, or 5%, in 2015 compared to 2014. improved catalyst volumes and margins, partly offset by unfavorable currency translation impacts, and lower r& d expenses were responsible for increases in ebitda of 7% and 9%, respectively. these increases were partly offset by an 11% decrease in ebitda due to lower licensing and services revenues.
financial condition operating, investing and financing activities of continuing operations, which are discussed below, are presented in the following table:
operating activities              $5,606                   $5,842                   $6,048
investing activities              (2,297   )               (1,051   )               (3,531   )
financing activities              (3,349   )               (4,850   )               (5,907   )
operating activitiesÂ—cash of $5,606 million generated in 2016 primarily reflected earnings adjusted for non-cash items and cash generated by the main components of working capitalÂ—accounts receivable, inventories and accounts payable. the non-cash items in 2016 included a $78 million gain related to the sale of our wholly owned argentine subsidiary with adjustments for related working capital and gains totaling $11 million related to sales of our joint venture in japan and idled assets in australia.
the main components of working capital generated cash of $123 million in 2016. higher product sales prices in the fourth quarter of 2016 across all segments combined with the impact of higher fourth quarter 2016 sales volumes in our o&pÂ—americas, refining and i&d segments led to an increase in accounts receivable. this increase in accounts receivable was offset by higher accounts payable, which was driven by the higher cost of crude oil and other feedstocks. the level of inventories fell in our o&pÂ—americas segment following the completion of turnaround activities in the fourth quarter of 2016 and in our refining segment, which had higher crude oil inventories at the end of 2015 due to operational issues during the fourth quarter.
cash of $5,842 million generated in 2015 primarily reflected earnings adjusted for non-cash items and cash used by the main components of working capital. the main components of working capital consumed cash of $246 million in 2015. the lower cost of crude oil and other feedstocks in 2015 led to a decline in accounts payable. preparation for the turnaround in 2016 at our corpus christi, texas facility and the unplanned maintenance outage at our houston refinery, which resulted in higher levels of u.s. olefins and crude oil inventories at year end, led to the increase in consolidated inventories in 2015. accounts receivable decreased on lower average product sales prices, reflective of the drop in 2015 crude oil prices.
cash of $6,048 million generated in 2014 primarily reflected earnings adjusted for non-cash items and refunds totaling $232 million for value added taxes related to prior periods that were received from italian tax authorities in 2014. these cash inflows were offset in part by cash used by the main components of working capital.
the increase in 2014 inventories primarily reflected higher olefins raw material inventories, offset in part by lower ethylene and propylene inventories due to turnaround activities at our la porte, texas facility, and higher levels of inventory for crude oil and work-in-process in our refining segment. lower feedstock costs led to the decrease in 2014 accounts payable. the decrease in accounts receivable primarily reflected lower ethylene prices in our o&pÂ—eai segment, lower prices for oxyfuels and related products in our i&d segment, lower average sales prices and year end volumes in north american polyolefins and lower prices for refining products. also contributing to the decline was a larger than usual accounts receivable balance at the end of 2013 attributable to customer remittance timing.
investing activitiesÂ—we invested cash of $2,297 million, $1,051 million and $3,531 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
we invest in investment-grade and other high-quality instruments that provide adequate flexibility to redeploy funds as needed to meet our cash flow requirements while maximizing yield. in 2016, 2015 and 2014, we invested $764 million, $2,073 million and $3,439 million, respectively, in securities that are classified as short-term investments. the majority of these investments are deemed available-for-sale; however, beginning in the third quarter of 2016, we invested in additional securities deemed held-to-maturity. we also invested $674 million, $397 million and $425 million in tri-party repurchase agreements in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. these investments are classified as short-term loans receivable except for a $101 million investment which was classified as a long-term loan receivable in 2015. we received proceeds upon the sale and maturity of certain of our available-for-sale securities and repurchase agreements of $674 million and $685 million, respectively, in 2016; $2,489 million and $350 million, respectively, in 2015; and $1,751 million and $75 million, respectively, in 2014. see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding these investments.
the following table summarizes our capital expenditures for continuing operations for the periods from 2014 through 2016:
capital expenditures by segment:
technology                                                              36                    24                    25
consolidated capital expenditures of continuing operations          $2,243                $1,440                $1,499
in 2017, we expect to spend approximately $2 billion, which includes contributions to our po joint venture assets. capital spending is projected to be lower in 2017 relative to 2016, which included the ethylene expansion and related turnaround of our corpus christi, texas facility and turnaround activities at other facilities.
in 2016 and 2015, capital expenditures included debottlenecks of certain assets to enhance production, turnaround activities and expansion projects at several sites, as well as other plant improvement projects and railcar purchases. the increased levels of capital expenditures in 2016 versus 2015 for our o&pÂ—americas, o&pÂ—eai and refining segments were largely due to debottleneck and turnaround activities.
financing activitiesÂ—financing activities used cash of $3,349 million, $4,850 million and $5,907 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
we made payments totaling $2,938 million, $4,656 million and $5,788 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, to acquire a portion of our outstanding ordinary shares. we also made dividend payments totaling $1,395 million, $1,410 million and $1,403 million to our shareholders in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. for additional information related to these share repurchases and dividend payments, see note 20 to the consolidated financial statements.
additional information related to our commercial paper program and the issuance of debt can be found in the liquidity and capital resources section below and in note 12 to the consolidated financial statements.
liquidity and capital resourcesÂ—as of december 31, 2016, we had $2,022 million of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities classified as short-term investments. we also held $369 million of tri-party repurchase agreements classified as prepaid expenses and other current assets at december 31, 2016. for additional information related to our purchases of marketable securities, which currently include time deposits, certificates of deposit, commercial paper, bonds and limited partnership investments, and our investments in tri-party repurchase agreements, see Â“investing activitiesÂ” above and note 14 to the consolidated financial statements.
at december 31, 2016, we held $556 million of cash in jurisdictions outside the u.s., principally in the united kingdom. there are currently no material legal or economic restrictions that would impede our transfers of cash.
we also had total unused availability under our credit facilities of $2,710 million at december 31, 2016, which included the following:
Â•                                                          $1,973 million under our $2,500 million revolving credit facility, which backs our $2,500 million commercial paper program. availability under this facility is net of outstanding borrowings, outstanding letters of credit provided under the facility and notes issued under our commercial paper program. a small portion of our availability under this facility is impacted by changes in the euro/u.s. dollar exchange rate. at december 31, 2016, we had $500 million of outstanding commercial paper, no outstanding letters of credit and no outstanding borrowings under the facility; and
Â•                                    $737 million under our $900 million u.s. accounts receivable securitization facility. availability under this facility is subject to a borrowing base of eligible receivables, which is reduced by outstanding borrowings and letters of credit, if any. this facility had no outstanding borrowings or letters of credit at december 31, 2016.
see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information related to our credit facilities.
in accordance with our current interest rate risk management strategy and subject to managementÂ’s evaluation of market conditions and the availability of favorable interest rates among other factors, we may from time to time enter into interest rate swap agreements to economically convert a portion of our fixed rate debt to variable rate debt or convert a portion of variable rate debt to fixed rate debt.
we have $451 million of outstanding letters of credit and bank guarantees issued under uncommitted credit facilities at december 31, 2016. at december 31, 2016, we had total debt, including current maturities, of $8,981 million.
in june 2016, the term of our existing $2,000 million revolving credit facility was extended for one year to june 2021 pursuant to a consent agreement. we also amended the revolving credit facility in june 2016 to increase its size from $2,000 million to $2,500 million. all other material terms of the agreement remained unchanged. the letters of credit sublimit of our senior revolving credit facility was reduced from $700 million to $500 million by agreement in september 2015.
in connection with the increase of our revolving credit facility, in june 2016 we increased the size of our 2014 commercial paper program to permit the issuance of privately placed, unsecured short-term promissory notes (Â“commercial paperÂ”) in an aggregate amount not to exceed $2,500 million. proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper may be used for general corporate purposes, including dividend payments and share repurchases. at december 31, 2016, we had $500 million of commercial paper outstanding.
in march 2016, our direct, 100% owned subsidiary, lyb international finance ii b.v., issued Â€750 million of 1.875% guaranteed notes due 2022 at a discounted price of 99.607%. proceeds from these notes were used for general corporate purposes, including repurchases of our ordinary shares. these unsecured notes, which are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by lyondellbasell industries n.v., rank equally in right of payment to all of lyb finance iiÂ’s existing and future unsecured indebtedness and to all of lyondellbasell n.v.Â’s existing and future unsubordinated indebtedness.
in august 2015, we amended our u.s. accounts receivable securitization facility, which, among other things, decreased the purchase limit from $1,000 million to $900 million, added a $300 million uncommitted accordion feature and extended the term of the facility to august 2018.
in march 2015, we issued $1,000 million of 4.625% notes due 2055 at a discounted price of 98.353%. proceeds from these notes were used for general corporate purposes, including repurchases of our ordinary shares. these unsecured notes rank equally in right of payment to all of lyondellbasell n.v.Â’s existing and future unsubordinated indebtedness.
in february 2014, our direct, 100% owned subsidiary, lyb international finance b.v., issued $1,000 million of 4.875% notes due 2044 at a discounted price of 98.831%. proceeds from these notes were used for general corporate purposes, including repurchases of our ordinary shares. these unsecured notes, which are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by lyondellbasell industries n.v., rank equally in right of payment to all of lyb international finance b.v.Â’s existing and future unsecured indebtedness and to all of lyondellbasellÂ’s existing and future unsubordinated indebtedness.
see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements, for additional information related to our credit facilities and notes discussed above, including terms of redemption.
in may 2016, our shareholders approved a proposal to authorize us to repurchase up to an additional 10%, or approximately 42.5 million, of our shares outstanding over the following eighteen months. our share repurchase program does not have a stated dollar amount, and purchases may be made through open market purchases, private market transactions or other structured transactions. repurchased shares could be retired or used for general corporate purposes, including for various employee benefit and compensation plans. as of december 31, 2016, we have purchased 21.3 million shares under this program for approximately $1,688 million. as of february 14, 2017, we had approximately 20 million shares remaining under the current authorization. the timing and amount of additional shares repurchased will be determined by our management board based on its evaluation of market conditions and other factors. for additional information related to our share repurchase programs, see note 20 to the consolidated financial statements.
in september 2016, we received proceeds of $72 million from the sale of our joint venture in japan. we also purchased a net additional 7.41% interest in our joint venture in korea for $36 million in september 2016. in february 2016, we received net proceeds of $137 million from the sale of our wholly owned argentine subsidiary.
we engaged an investment bank in 2016 to assist in testing the value of our houston refinery as part of our regular review of our asset portfolio and as a result of indications of interest in the refinery by third parties. following a thorough process, we have elected to retain the refinery in our asset portfolio.
we may repay or redeem our debt, including purchases of our outstanding bonds in the open market, using cash on hand, cash from operating activities, proceeds from the issuance of debt, proceeds from asset divestitures, or a combination thereof. in connection with any repayment or redemption of our debt, we may incur cash and non-cash charges, which could be material in the period in which they are incurred. we currently intend to refinance certain outstanding debt, subject to market conditions, in the first quarter of 2017. our current analyses indicate that the refinancing may result in charges of approximately $125 million based on current market conditions. the actual costs will depend on several factors, including interest rates and market conditions if and when the refinancing occurs.
we plan to fund our ongoing working capital, capital expenditures, debt service and other funding requirements with cash from operations, which could be affected by general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory, business and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. cash on hand, cash from operating activities, proceeds from the issuance of debt, or a combination thereof, may be used to fund the repurchase of shares under our share repurchase program.
we intend to continue to declare and pay quarterly dividends, with the goal of increasing the dividend over time, after giving consideration to our cash balances and expected results from operations.
we believe that our cash on hand, cash from operating activities and proceeds from our credit facilities provide us with sufficient financial resources to meet our anticipated capital requirements and obligations as they come due.
contractual and other obligationsÂ—the following table summarizes, as of december 31, 2016, our minimum payments for long-term debt, including current maturities, short-term debt, and contractual and other obligations for the next five years and thereafter:
advances from customers             69                22                    13                    15                     4                     Â—                        15
total debtÂ—our debt includes unsecured senior notes, guaranteed notes and various other u.s. and non-u.s. loans. see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of covenant requirements under the credit facilities and indentures and additional information regarding our debt facilities.
interest on total debtÂ—our debt and related party debt agreements contain provisions for the payment of monthly, quarterly or semi-annual interest at a stated rate of interest over the term of the debt.
pension and other postretirement benefitsÂ—we maintain several defined benefit pension plans, as described in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements. many of our u.s. and non-u.s. plans are subject to minimum funding requirements; however, the amounts of required future contributions for all our plans are not fixed and can vary significantly due to changes in economic assumptions, liability experience and investment return on plan assets. as a result, we have excluded pension and other postretirement benefit obligations from the contractual and other obligations table above. our annual contributions may include amounts in excess of minimum required funding levels. contributions to our non-u.s. plans in years beyond 2017 are not expected to be materially different than the expected 2017 contributions disclosed in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements. at december 31, 2016, the projected benefit obligation for our pension plans exceeded the fair value of plan assets by $942 million. subject to future actuarial gains and losses, as well as future asset earnings, we, together with our consolidated subsidiaries, will be required to fund the discounted obligation of $942 million in future years. we contributed $114 million, $107 million and $94 million to our pension plans in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. we provide other postretirement benefits, primarily medical benefits to eligible participants, as described in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements. we pay other unfunded postretirement benefits as incurred.
advances from customersÂ—we are obligated to deliver products in connection with long-term sales agreements under which advances from customers were received in prior years. these advances are treated as deferred revenue and will be amortized to earnings as product is delivered over the remaining terms of the respective contracts, which range predominantly from 2 to 8 years. the unamortized long-term portion of such advances totaled $47 million as of december 31, 2016.
otherÂ—other primarily consists of accruals for environmental remediation costs, obligations under deferred compensation arrangements, and anticipated asset retirement obligations. see Â“critical accounting policiesÂ” below for a discussion of obligations for environmental remediation costs.
deferred income taxesÂ—the scheduled settlement of the deferred tax liabilities shown in the table is based on the scheduled reversal of the underlying temporary differences. actual cash tax payments will vary depending upon future taxable income. see note 18 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information related to our deferred tax liabilities.
purchase obligationsÂ—we are party to various obligations to purchase products and services, principally for raw materials, utilities and industrial gases. these commitments are designed to assure sources of supply and are not expected to be in excess of normal requirements. the commitments are segregated into take-or-pay contracts and other contracts. under the take-or-pay contracts, we are obligated to make minimum payments whether or not we take the product or service. other contracts include contracts that specify minimum quantities; however, in the event that we do not take the contractual minimum, we are only obligated for any resulting economic loss suffered by the vendor. the payments shown for the other contracts assume that minimum quantities are purchased. for contracts with variable pricing terms, the minimum payments reflect the contract price at december 31, 2016.
operating leasesÂ—we lease various facilities and equipment under noncancelable lease arrangements for various periods. see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for related lease disclosures.
current business outlook in the past several months, the industry outlook for 2017 has steadily improved. healthy u.s. and global economic activity and ethylene project delays have led to an improved forecast for industry supply and demand dynamics. crude oil prices and ngl supply have stabilized at more favorable levels than during much of 2016. the u.s. regulatory landscape may change in ways that are generally favorable to our industry. while we will continue to watch these developments, we believe our significant investment in our 2016 maintenance programs favorably positions us for 2017.
related party transactions we have related party transactions with our joint venture partners. we believe that such transactions are effected on terms substantially no more or less favorable than those that would have been agreed upon by unrelated parties on an armÂ’s length basis. see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for additional related party disclosures.
critical accounting policies management applies those accounting policies that it believes best reflect the underlying business and economic events, consistent with accounting principles generally accepted in the u.s. (see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements). our more critical accounting policies include those related to the valuation of inventory, long-lived assets, the valuation of goodwill, accruals for long-term employee benefit costs such as pension and other postretirement costs, and accruals for taxes based on income. inherent in such policies are certain key assumptions and estimates made by management. management periodically updates its estimates used in the preparation of the financial statements based on its latest assessment of the current and projected business and general economic environment.
inventoryÂ—we account for our inventory using the last-in, first-out (Â“lifoÂ”) method of accounting.
the cost of raw materials, which represents a substantial portion of our operating expenses, and energy costs generally follow price trends for crude oil and/or natural gas. crude oil and natural gas prices are subject to many factors, including changes in economic conditions.
since our inventory consists of manufactured products derived from crude oil, natural gas, natural gas liquids and correlated materials, as well as the associated feedstocks and intermediate chemicals, our inventory market values are generally influenced by changes in benchmark crude oil and heavy liquid values and prices for manufactured finished goods. the degree of influence of a particular benchmark may vary from period to period, as the composition of the dollar value lifo pools change. due to natural inventory composition changes, variation in pricing from period to period does not necessarily result in a linear lcm impact. additionally, an lcm condition may arise due to a volumetric decline in a particular material that had previously provided a positive impact within a pool. as a result, market valuations and lcm conditions are dependent upon the composition and mix of materials on hand at the balance sheet date. in the measurement of an lcm adjustment, the numeric input value for determining the crude oil market price includes pricing that is weighted by volume of inventories held at a point in time, including wti, brent and maya crude oils.
as indicated above, fluctuation in the prices of crude oil, natural gas and correlated products from period to period may result in the recognition of charges to adjust the value of inventory to the lower of cost or market in periods of falling prices and the reversal of those charges in subsequent interim periods as market prices recover. accordingly, our cost of sales and results of operations may be affected by such fluctuations.
on may 1, 2010, upon emergence from bankruptcy, we recorded our inventory, which is primarily crude oil and correlated products derived therefrom, at fair value in accordance with the requirements of fresh-start accounting. the per barrel benchmark price of wti crude oil at that date was $86.15.
during 2014, we recorded lcm inventory valuation adjustments totaling $760 million driven primarily by the decline in the price of crude oil and related declines in the prices of heavy liquids and other correlated products. a $45 million charge was taken in the third quarter of 2014 which marked the beginning of a downward price trend. an additional $715 million of lcm inventory valuation adjustment was recognized in the fourth quarter of 2014 to reflect decreases of approximately 50% in the price indices for crude oil and other correlated products as compared to the third quarter of 2014. at december 31, 2014, representative prices for crude oil and heavy liquids were $47.59 per barrel and $45.20 per barrel, respectively. these price inputs were calculated using a weighted average of the materials held in inventory on that date.
the trend of falling hydrocarbon prices continued in 2015, leading to further lcm inventory valuation adjustments. in 2015, the cumulative charge related to lcm inventory valuation adjustments, which was driven by declines in crude oil, ethylene, propylene, benzene and etbe, was $548 million. representative prices used in the calculation of the cumulative lcm inventory adjustments recognized in 2015 were $30.22 per barrel for crude oil, 20 cents per pound for ethylene, 32 cents per pound for propylene, $2.14 per gallon for benzene and $1.66 per gallon for etbe.
a drop in polypropylene prices led to the recognition of a $29 million lcm adjustment in the fourth quarter of 2016.
further sustained price declines in our finished goods and raw materials could result in additional lcm inventory valuation charges during 2017. several of our lifo inventory pools are Â“at-riskÂ” for further adjustment as each impacted lifo pool is at, or close to, the calculated market value at the last balance sheet measurement date. Â“at-riskÂ” inventory accounts for $2.2 billion of our total inventory carrying value of $3.8 billion as of december 31, 2016. the extent to which further adjustment may occur is dependent on pool specific product prices and composition within each individual dollar value lifo pool at the balance sheet date.
long-lived assetsÂ—with respect to long-lived assets, which primarily include property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, key assumptions included estimates of useful lives and the recoverability of carrying values of fixed assets and other intangible assets, as well as the existence of any obligations associated with the retirement of fixed assets. such estimates could be significantly modified and/or the carrying values of the assets could be impaired by such factors as new technological developments, new chemical industry entrants with significant raw material or other cost advantages, uncertainties associated with the european, u.s. and other world economies, the cyclical nature of the chemical and refining industries, and uncertainties associated with regulatory governmental actions.
when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable, we evaluate definite lived intangible assets for impairment. long-lived assets are grouped at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets, which for us is generally at the plant group level (or, at times individual plants in certain circumstances where we have isolated production units with separately identifiable cash flows). when it is probable that the undiscounted cash flows of a tangible asset or asset group will not be sufficient to recover the carrying amount, the asset is written down to its estimated fair value. in-process research and development projects are impaired when abandoned.
the estimated useful lives of long-lived assets range from 3 to 30 years. depreciation and amortization of these assets, including amortization of capitalized plant turnaround costs, under the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives totaled $1,064 million in 2016. the useful lives of assets are assessed periodically and if determined to be shorter than originally estimated, depreciation and amortization charges would be accelerated over the revised useful life.
goodwillÂ—goodwill of $528 million at december 31, 2016 represents the tax effect of the differences between the tax and book bases of our assets and liabilities resulting from the revaluation of those assets and liabilities to fair value in connection with the companyÂ’s emergence from bankruptcy and adoption of fresh-start accounting. we evaluate the recoverability of the carrying value of goodwill annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the goodwill of a reporting unit may not be fully recoverable.
we have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. qualitative factors assessed for each of the reporting units include, but are not limited to, changes in long-term commodity prices, discount rates, competitive environments, planned capacity, cost factors such as raw material prices, and financial performance of the reporting units. if the qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, a two-step quantitative test is required.
we also have the option to proceed directly to the two-step quantitative impairment test. under the two-step impairment test, the fair value of each reporting unit is compared to its carrying value, including goodwill. for step one of the impairment test, the fair value of the reporting unit is calculated using a discounted cash-flow model. such a model inherently utilizes a significant number of estimates and assumptions, including operating margins, tax rates, discount rates, capital expenditures and working capital changes. step two of the impairment test would be performed should management conclude that the carrying value of a reporting unit, including goodwill, is in excess of its fair value. in step two of the impairment test, the carrying amount of a reporting unitÂ’s goodwill is compared to the implied fair value of its goodwill. valuation experts may be used in such an assessment. if the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, an impairment charge equal to the excess would be recognized.
for 2016 and 2015, management performed a qualitative impairment assessment of our reporting units which indicated that the fair value of our reporting units was greater than their carrying value. accordingly, a quantitative two-step goodwill impairment test was not required. accordingly, no goodwill impairment was recognized in 2016 or 2015.
long-term employee benefit costsÂ—our costs for long-term employee benefits, particularly pension and other postretirement medical and life insurance benefits, are incurred over long periods of time, and involve many uncertainties over those periods. the net periodic benefit cost attributable to current periods is based on several assumptions about such future uncertainties, and is sensitive to changes in those assumptions. it is managementÂ’s responsibility, often with the assistance of independent experts, to select assumptions that in its judgment represent its best estimates of the future effects of those uncertainties. it also is managementÂ’s responsibility to review those assumptions periodically to reflect changes in economic or other factors that affect those assumptions.
the current benefit service costs, as well as the existing liabilities, for pensions and other postretirement benefits are measured on a discounted present value basis. the discount rate is a current rate, related to the rate at which the liabilities could be settled. our assumed discount rate is based on yield information for high-quality corporate bonds with durations comparable to the expected cash settlement of our obligations. for the purpose of measuring the benefit obligations at december 31, 2016, we used a weighted average discount rate of 4.20% for the u.s. plans which reflects the different terms of the related benefit obligations. the weighted average discount rate used to measure obligations for non-u.s. plans at december 31, 2016 was 1.52%, reflecting market interest rates. the discount rates in effect at december 31, 2016 will be used to measure net periodic benefit cost during 2017.
the benefit obligation and the periodic cost of other postretirement medical benefits are also measured based on assumed rates of future increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits. as of december 31, 2016, the assumed rate of increase for our u.s. plans was 7.0%, decreasing to 4.5% in 2038 and
thereafter. a one percentage point change in the health care cost trend rate assumption as of december 31, 2016 would have resulted in a $21 million increase or $14 million decrease in the accumulated other postretirement benefit liability for our non-u.s. plans and would have resulted in an increase or decrease of less than $1 million for u.s. plans. due to limits on our maximum contribution level under the medical plan, there would have been no significant effect on either our benefit liability or net periodic cost.
the net periodic cost of pension benefits included in expense also is affected by the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption. investment returns that are recognized currently in net income represent the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets applied to a market-related value of plan assets which, for us, is defined as the market value of assets. the expected rate of return on plan assets is a longer term rate, and is expected to change less frequently than the current assumed discount rate, reflecting long-term market expectations, rather than current fluctuations in market conditions.
the weighted average expected long-term rate of return on assets in our u.s. plans of 8.00% is based on the average level of earnings that our independent pension investment advisor had advised could be expected to be earned over time and 3.37%, for our non-u.s. plan assets is based on an expectation and asset allocation that varies by region. the asset allocations are summarized in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements. the actual returns in 2016 were gains of 7.22% and 15.81% for our u.s. and non-u.s. plan assets, respectively.
the actual rate of return on plan assets may differ from the expected rate due to the volatility normally experienced in capital markets. managementÂ’s goal is to manage the investments over the long term to achieve optimal returns with an acceptable level of risk and volatility.
net periodic pension cost recognized each year includes the expected asset earnings, rather than the actual earnings or loss. along with other gains and losses, this unrecognized amount, to the extent it cumulatively exceeds 10% of the projected benefit obligation for the respective plan, is recognized as additional net periodic benefit cost over the average remaining service period of the participants in each plan.
the following table reflects the sensitivity of the benefit obligations and the net periodic benefit costs of our pension plans to changes in the actuarial assumptions:

projected benefit obligations at december 31, 2016   $276                    $67           $Â—                  $Â—
projected net periodic benefit costs in 2017                                               12                  6
additional information on the key assumptions underlying these benefit costs appears in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements.
accruals for taxes based on incomeÂ—the determination of our provision for income taxes and the calculation of our tax benefits and liabilities is subject to managementÂ’s estimates and judgments due to the complexity of the tax laws and regulations in the tax jurisdictions in which we operate. uncertainties exist with respect to interpretation of these complex laws and regulations.
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, and are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to reverse.
we recognize future tax benefits to the extent that the realization of these benefits is more likely than not. our current provision for income taxes is impacted by the recognition and release of valuation allowances related to net deferred assets in certain non-u.s. jurisdictions. further changes to these valuation allowances may impact our future provision for income taxes, which will include no tax benefit with respect to losses incurred and no tax expense with respect to income generated in these countries until the respective valuation allowance is eliminated.
we recognize the financial statement benefits with respect to an uncertain income tax position that we have taken or may take on an income tax return when we believe it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained with the tax authorities. for a position that is likely to be sustained, the benefit recognized in the financial statements is measured at the largest cumulative amount that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized.

item 1a. risk factors.
the following "risk factors" identify what the company believes to be the risks that could materially adversely affect the company's financial and/or operational performance. these risk factors should be considered and evaluated together with information incorporated by reference or otherwise included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k. additional risks not currently known to the company or that the company currently believes are immaterial also may impair the company's business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
the company may be subject to risks arising from uncertainty in worldwide and regional economic conditions.
the company's business is sensitive to global macro-economic conditions. slow economic growth persists in the economic regions in which the company conducts substantial operations. the continued effects of the global economic downturn and the rate of recovery may have an adverse effect on the business, results of operations and financial condition of the company and its distributors, customers and suppliers, and on the general economic activity in many of the industries and markets in which the company and its distributors, customers and suppliers operate. among the economic factors which may have such an effect are manufacturing and other end-market activity, currency exchange rates, air travel trends, difficulties entering new markets, and general economic conditions such as inflation, deflation, interest rates and credit availability. these factors may, among other things, negatively impact the level of purchases, capital expenditures, and creditworthiness of the company and its distributors, customers and suppliers, and, therefore, the company's revenues, operating profits, margins, and order rates.
the company has remained focused on maintaining its financial strength by adjusting its cost structure to reflect changing demand levels, maintaining a strong balance sheet and managing its cash. the company cannot predict changes in worldwide or regional economic conditions, as such conditions are highly volatile and beyond the company's control. if these conditions deteriorate or do not return to previous levels, however, the company's business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.
the company may be subject to risks relating to its non-u.s. operations.
the company's net sales derived from customers outside the united states were approximately 41% in 2016, 42% in 2015 and 44% in 2014. in addition, many of the company's manufacturing operations and suppliers are located outside the united states. the company expects net sales from non-u.s. markets to continue to represent a significant portion of its total net sales. the company's non-u.s. operations are subject to risks in addition to those facing its domestic operations, including:
•   limitations on ownership and on repatriation of earnings;
•   political, social and economic instability and disruptions;
•   the imposition of duties and tariffs and other trade barriers;
•   limitations on the company's ability to enforce legal rights and remedies;
if the company is unable to successfully manage the risks associated with expanding its global business or adequately manage operational fluctuations internationally, the risks could have a material adverse effect on the company's business, results of operations or financial condition.
the company regularly executes organizational changes such as acquisitions, divestitures and realignments to support its growth and cost management strategies. the company also engages in initiatives aimed to increase productivity, efficiencies and cash flow and to reduce costs. the company further commits significant resources to identify, develop and retain key employees to ensure uninterrupted leadership and direction. if the company is unable to successfully manage these and other organizational changes, the ability to complete such activities and realize anticipated synergies or cost savings as well as the company's results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. the company also cannot offer assurances that any of these initiatives will continue to be beneficial to the extent anticipated, or that the estimated efficiency improvements, incremental cost savings or cash flow improvements will be realized as anticipated or at all.
the company may be subject to risks relating to acquisitions and joint ventures.
the company expects to continue its strategy of identifying and acquiring businesses with complementary products and services, and entering into joint ventures, which it believes will enhance its operations and profitability. however, there can be no assurance that the company will be able to continue to find suitable businesses to purchase or joint venture opportunities or that it will be able to acquire such businesses or enter into such joint ventures on acceptable terms. in addition, there is no assurance that the company will be able to avoid acquiring or assuming unexpected liabilities, that the company will be able to integrate successfully any businesses that it purchases into its existing business or that any acquired businesses or joint ventures will be profitable. the successful integration of new businesses and the success of joint ventures depend on the company's
ability to manage these new businesses and cut excess costs. if the company is unable to avoid these risks, its results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.
the company may be subject to risks relating to its information technology systems.
the company relies extensively on information technology systems to manage and operate its business, some of which are managed by third parties. the security and functionality of these information technology systems, and the processing of data by these systems, are critical to our business operations. if these systems, or any part of the systems, are damaged, intruded upon, attacked, shutdown or cease to function properly (whether by planned upgrades, force majeure, telecommunications failures, hardware or software break-ins or viruses, or other cybersecurity incidents) and the company suffers any resulting interruption in its ability to manage and operate its business or if its products are effected, the company's results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.
the company may be subject to risks relating to changes in the demand for and supply of its products.
•   changes in business relationships with and purchases by or from major customers, suppliers or distributors, including delays or cancellations in shipments, disputes regarding contract terms or significant changes in financial condition, and changes in contract cost and revenue estimates for new development programs;
•   increased competition in the markets the company serves;
•   fluctuations in the availability or the prices of raw materials; and
the markets in which the company operates are characterized by rapidly changing technologies and frequent introductions of new products and services. the company's ability to develop new products based on technological innovation can affect its competitive position and often requires the investment of significant resources. if the company does not develop, or has difficulties or delays in the development of, innovative new and enhanced products and services, or fails to gain market or regulatory acceptance of new products and technologies, the company's revenues may be materially reduced and the company's competitive position could be materially adversely affected. in addition, the company may invest in research and development of products and services, or in acquisitions or other investments, that do not lead to significant revenue, which could adversely affect our profitability.
the company may be subject to risks arising from price and supply fluctuations in raw materials used in the company's production processes and by its suppliers of component parts.
the company's supply of raw materials for its businesses could be interrupted for a variety of reasons, including availability and pricing. prices for raw materials necessary for production have fluctuated significantly in the past and significant increases could adversely affect the company's results of operations and profit margins. although the company generally attempts to manage these fluctuations by, among other things, passing along increased raw material prices to its customers in the form of price increases, there may be a time delay between the increased raw material prices and the company's ability to increase the price of its products, or the company may be unable to increase the prices of its products due to pricing pressure, contract terms or other factors which could adversely impact results of operations and cash flows.
increase its prices commensurately with its increased costs. consequently, the company's results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected.
the company may be subject to risks arising from changes in the competitive environment in which it operates.
the company's operations are subject to competition from a wide variety of global, regional and local competitors, which could adversely affect the company's results of operations by creating downward pricing pressure and/or a decline in the company's margins or market shares. to compete successfully, the company must excel in terms of product quality and innovation, technological and engineering capability, manufacturing and distribution capability, delivery, price competitiveness, and customer service.
the company may be subject to risks relating to changes in its tax rates or exposure to additional income tax liabilities.
the company is subject to income taxes in the united states and various non-u.s. jurisdictions. the company's domestic and international tax liabilities are dependent upon the location of earnings among these different jurisdictions. the company's future results of operation could be adversely affected by changes in the company's effective tax rate as a result of changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in overall profitability, changes in generally accepted accounting principles, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets or changes in tax laws or regulations. in addition, the amount of income taxes paid by the company is subject to ongoing audits by united states federal, state and local tax authorities and by non-u.s. tax authorities. if these audits result in assessments different from amounts reserved, future financial results may include unfavorable adjustments to the company's tax liabilities, which could have a material adverse effect on the company's results of operations.
the company may be subject to product liability risks.
the company's businesses expose it to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the design, manufacture and sale of its products and the products of third-party vendors that the company uses or resells. significant product liability claims could have a material adverse effect on the company's financial condition, liquidity and results of operations. although the company currently maintains what it believes to be suitable and adequate product liability insurance, there can be no assurance that the company will be able to maintain its insurance on acceptable terms or that its insurance will provide adequate protection against all potential liabilities.
the company may be subject to risks arising from litigation, legal and regulatory proceedings and obligations.
from time to time, the company is subject to litigation or other commercial disputes and other legal and regulatory proceedings relating to its business. due to the inherent uncertainties of any litigation, commercial disputes or other legal or regulatory proceedings, the company cannot accurately predict their ultimate outcome, including the outcome of any related appeals. an unfavorable outcome could materially adversely impact the company's business, financial condition or results of operations. furthermore, as required by u.s. generally accepted accounting principles, the company establishes reserves based on its assessment of contingencies, including contingencies related to legal claims asserted against it. subsequent developments in legal proceedings may affect the company's assessment and estimates of the loss contingency recorded as a reserve and require the company to make payments in excess of our reserves, which could have an adverse effect on the company's results of operations.
the company is subject to national and international laws and regulations, such as the anti-corruption laws of the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act and the u.k. bribery act, relating to its business and its employees. despite the company's policies, procedures and compliance programs, its internal controls and compliance systems may not be able to protect the company from prohibited acts willfully committed by its employees, agents or business partners that would violate such applicable laws and regulations. any such improper acts could damage the company's reputation, subject it to civil or criminal judgments, fines or penalties, and could otherwise disrupt the company's business, and as a result, could materially adversely impact the company's business, financial condition or results of operations.
the company may be subject to risks relating to the preservation of its intellectual property.
protecting the company's intellectual property is critical to its innovation efforts. the company owns a number of patents, trade secrets, copyrights, trademarks, trade names and other forms of intellectual property in its products and services throughout the world. the company also has exclusive and non-exclusive rights to intellectual property owned by others. the company's intellectual property may be challenged or infringed upon by third parties or the company may be unable to maintain, renew or enter into new license agreements with third-party owners of intellectual property on reasonable terms. in addition, the global nature of the company's business increases the risk that the company's intellectual property may be subject to infringement or other unauthorized use by others. in some cases, the company's ability to protect its intellectual property
rights by legal recourse or otherwise may be limited, particularly in countries where laws or enforcement practices are inadequate or undeveloped. unauthorized use of the company's intellectual property rights or the company's inability to preserve existing intellectual property rights could adversely impact the company's competitive position and results of operations.
the company's operations necessitate the use and handling of hazardous materials and, as a result, it is subject to various united states federal, state and local laws and regulations, as well as non-u.s. laws, designed to protect the environment and to regulate the discharge of materials into the environment. these laws impose penalties, fines and other sanctions for non-compliance and liability for response costs, property damages and personal injury resulting from past and current spills, disposals or other releases of, or the exposure to, hazardous materials. among other laws, the company is subject to the united states federal "superfund" law, under which it has been designated as a "potentially responsible party" and may be liable for clean-up costs associated with various waste sites, some of which are on the united states environmental protection agency's superfund priority list. the company could incur substantial costs as a result of non-compliance with or liability for cleanup or other costs or damages under environmental laws, including the superfund law.
in addition, increased worldwide focus on climate change issues has led to recent legislative and regulatory efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions, including regulation of such emissions through a "cap-and-trade" system globally. increased regulation of greenhouse gas emissions and other climate changes concerns could subject the company to additional costs and restrictions, including increased energy and raw material costs. until definitive regulations are adopted, the company is not able to predict how such regulations would affect the company's business, operations or financial results.
the company may be subject to more stringent environmental laws in the future. if more stringent environmental laws are enacted in the future, these laws could have a material adverse effect on the company's business, results of operations and financial condition.
the company may be subject to risks relating to increasing costs of certain employee and retiree benefits.
the funding requirements and the amount of expenses recorded for the company's defined benefit pension plans are dependent on changes in market interest rates and the value of plan assets, which are dependent on actual plan asset returns. significant changes in market interest rates and decreases in the fair value of plan assets and investment losses on plan assets would increase funding requirements and expenses and may adversely impact the company's results of operations.
the company absorbs a portion of healthcare costs for its employees. if healthcare costs rise significantly and the company continues to absorb the majority of these costs, these increasing costs may adversely impact the company's future results of operations.
the company may be subject to risks arising from regulations applicable to companies doing business with the united states government.
in addition to the risks identified herein, doing business with the united states government subjects the company to unusual risks, including dependence on the level of government spending and compliance with and changes in governmental procurement regulations. agreements relating to the sale of products to government entities may be subject to termination, reduction or modification, either at the convenience of the government or for the company's failure to perform under the applicable contract. the company is subject to government investigations of business practices and compliance with government procurement regulations. if the company were charged with wrongdoing as a result of any such investigation, it could be suspended from bidding on or receiving awards of new government contracts, which could have a material adverse effect on the company's results of operations.
item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.
forward-looking statements forward-looking statements contained in this and other written and oral reports are made based on known events and circumstances at the time of release, and as such, are subject in the future to unforeseen uncertainties and risks. all statements regarding future performance, earnings projections, events or developments are forward-looking statements. it is possible that the future performance and earnings projections of the company, including its individual segments, may differ materially from current expectations, depending on economic conditions within its mobile, industrial and aerospace markets, and the company's ability to maintain and achieve anticipated benefits associated with announced realignment activities, strategic initiatives to improve operating margins, actions taken to combat the effects of the current economic environment, and growth, innovation and global diversification initiatives. a change in the economic conditions in individual markets may have a particularly volatile effect on segment performance.
•   changes in business relationships with and purchases by or from major customers, suppliers or distributors, including delays or cancellations in shipments, disputes regarding contract terms or significant changes in financial condition, changes in contract cost and revenue estimates for new development programs, and changes in product mix;
•   ability to identify acceptable strategic acquisition targets;
•   uncertainties surrounding timing, successful completion or integration of acquisitions and similar transactions;
•   the ability to successfully divest businesses planned for divestiture and realize the anticipated benefits of such divestitures;
•   the determination to undertake business realignment activities and the expected costs thereof and, if undertaken, the ability to complete such activities and realize the anticipated cost savings from such activities;
•   ability to implement successfully the company's capital allocation initiatives, including timing, price and execution of share repurchases;
•   the company's ability to manage costs related to insurance and employee retirement and health care benefits;

the company makes these statements as of the date of the filing of its annual report on form 10-k for the year ended june 30, 2016, and undertakes no obligation to update them unless otherwise required by law.
overview the company's order rates provide a near-term perspective of the company's outlook particularly when viewed in the context of prior and future order rates. the company publishes its order rates on a quarterly basis. the lead time between the time an order is received and revenue is realized generally ranges from one day to 12 weeks for mobile and industrial orders and from one day to 18 months for aerospace orders. the company believes the leading economic indicators of these markets that have a correlation to the company's future order rates are as follows:
•   purchasing managers index (pmi) on manufacturing activity specific to regions around the world with respect to most mobile and industrial markets;
•   global aircraft miles flown and global revenue passenger miles for commercial aerospace markets and department of defense spending for military aerospace markets; and
•   housing starts with respect to the north american residential air conditioning market and certain mobile construction markets.
a pmi above 50 indicates that the manufacturing activity specific to a region of the world in the mobile and industrial markets is expanding. a pmi below 50 indicates the opposite. recent pmi levels for some regions around the world were as follows:
united states                 53.2                  51.8                 53.5
global aircraft miles flown and global revenue passenger miles have both increased approximately six percent from their comparable 2015 level. the company anticipates that u.s. department of defense spending with regards to appropriations, and operations and maintenance for the u.s. government's fiscal year 2016 will increase by approximately one percent from the comparable fiscal 2015 level.
the company has remained focused on maintaining its financial strength by adjusting its cost structure to reflect changing demand levels, maintaining a strong balance sheet and managing its cash. the company continues to generate substantial cash flows from operations, has controlled capital spending and has proactively managed working capital. the company has been able to borrow needed funds at affordable interest rates and had a debt to debt-shareholders' equity ratio of 39.9 percent at june 30, 2016 compared to 39.3 percent at march 31, 2016 and 36.6 percent at june 30, 2015. net of cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities and other investments, the debt to debt-shareholders' equity ratio was 16.9 percent at june 30, 2016 compared to 18.6 percent at march 31, 2016 and 16.8 percent at june 30, 2015.
the company believes many opportunities for growth are available. the company intends to focus primarily on business opportunities in the areas of energy, water, food, environment, defense, life sciences, infrastructure and transportation.
the company believes it can meet its strategic objectives by:
•   serving the customer and continuously enhancing its experience with the company;
•   successfully executing its win strategy initiatives relating to premier customer service, financial performance and profitable growth;
•   maintaining its decentralized division and sales company structure;
•   engineering innovative systems and products to provide superior customer value through improved service, efficiency and productivity;
•   creating a culture of empowerment through its values, inclusion and diversity, accountability and teamwork.
acquisitions will be considered from time to time to the extent there is a strong strategic fit, while at the same time maintaining the company's strong financial position. the company will continue to assess its existing businesses and initiate efforts to divest businesses that are not considered to be a good long-term strategic fit for the company. future business divestitures could have a negative effect on the company's results of operations.
the discussion below is structured to separately discuss the financial statements presented in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k. the term "year" and references to specific years refer to the applicable fiscal year.
gross profit margin                                                            22.3   %            24.0   %            22.9   %
net sales in 2016 were 10.6 percent lower than 2015. acquisitions made in the last 12 months contributed approximately $42 million in sales in 2016 and the effect of currency rate changes decreased net sales in 2016 by approximately $403 million. excluding the effect of acquisitions and currency rate changes, net sales in 2016 were 7.8 percent lower than 2015 primarily due to a decrease in volume in the both the diversified industrial north american and diversified industrial international operations.
net sales in 2015 were 3.8 percent lower than 2014. acquisitions made in 2015 contributed approximately $14 million in sales in 2015 and the effect of currency rate changes decreased net sales in 2015 by approximately $547 million. excluding the effect of acquisitions and currency rate changes, net sales in 2015 were essentially unchanged from 2014 as an increase in volume experienced in the diversified industrial north american operations and the aerospace systems segment was offset by lower volume experienced in the diversified industrial international operations.
gross profit margin decreased in 2016 primarily due to both lower sales volume, resulting in manufacturing inefficiencies, and higher business realignment charges in the diversified industrial segment, partially offset by favorable product mix and lower engineering costs in the aerospace systems segment.  gross profit margin increased in 2015 primarily due to lower business realignment charges in the diversified industrial international operations and lower product support costs in the aerospace systems segment. foreign currency transaction (gain) loss (relating to cash, marketable securities and other investments and intercompany transactions) included in cost of sales for 2016, 2015 and 2014 were $22.7 million, $(77.8) million and $5.4 million, respectively. pension cost included in cost of sales in 2016, 2015 and 2014 were $172.4 million, $169.8 million and $174.8 million, respectively. included in cost of sales in 2016, 2015 and 2014 were business realignment charges of $76.2 million, $19.4 million and $63.6 million, respectively.
selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 12.0 percent in 2016 and decreased 5.5 percent in 2015. the decrease in 2016 was primarily due to lower research and development expenses, lower incentive compensation expense and lower stock compensation expense, partially offset by higher business realignment charges. the decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses in 2015 was primarily due to lower business realignment charges and stock compensation expense, partially offset by higher net expenses associated with the company's deferred compensation programs. the decrease in stock compensation expense in 2016 is primarily due to fewer stock awards granted. the decrease in stock compensation expense in 2015 is primarily due to a lower fair value calculated for 2015 stock awards as well as fewer stock awards granted. pension cost included in selling, general and administrative expenses in 2016, 2015 and 2014 were $74.4 million, $69.6 million and $64.2 million, respectively. included in selling, general and administrative expenses in 2016, 2015 and 2014 were business realignment charges of $21.1 million, $12.9 million and $38.9 million, respectively.
goodwill and intangible asset impairment related to the worldwide energy products division. refer to note 7 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for further discussion.
other (income), net in 2016, 2015 and 2014 includes $25.6 million, $23.2 million and $11.1 million of income, respectively, related to the company's equity interests in joint ventures.
effective tax rate in 2016 was favorably impacted by an increase of discrete tax benefits, an increase in the u.s. research and development credit, and an increase in the u.s. foreign tax credit. these benefits were partially offset by an unfavorable geographic mix of earnings. the effective tax rate in 2015 was favorably impacted by the re-enactment of the u.s. research and development credit, an increase in the federal manufacturing deduction and the absence of discrete tax costs incurred in the prior year. these benefits were partially offset by an unfavorable geographic mix of earnings.
discussion of business segment information the business segment information presents sales, operating income and assets on a basis that is consistent with the manner in which the company's various businesses are managed for internal review and decision-making.
sales in 2016 for the diversified industrial north american operations decreased 13.3 percent from 2015 compared to remaining relatively flat between 2014 and 2015. acquisitions completed within the last 12 months contributed approximately $8 million in sales in 2016 and the effect of currency exchange rates decreased sales in 2016 by $60 million. excluding acquisitions and the effect of currency rate changes, sales in 2016 in the diversified industrial north american operations decreased 12.4 percent from 2015 reflecting lower demand from distributors and end-users in most markets. the markets that
experienced the largest decline in end-user demand were the oil and gas, construction equipment and farm and agriculture equipment markets. excluding acquisitions and the effect of currency rate changes, sales in 2015 in the diversified industrial north american operations increased 1.2 percent from 2014 reflecting higher demand from distributors as well as from end-users in the car and light truck, heavy-duty truck, refrigeration and air conditioning and construction equipment markets, partially offset by lower demand in the farm and agriculture equipment market.
sales in the diversified industrial international operations decreased 12.6 percent in 2016 after a decrease of 10.3 percent from 2014 to 2015. acquisitions completed within the last 12 months contributed approximately $34 million in sales in 2016. the effect of currency rate changes decreased sales by $338 million, reflecting the strengthening of the u.s. dollar against most currencies. excluding acquisitions and the effect of currency rate changes, sales in 2016 in the diversified industrial international operations decreased 6.1 percent from 2015, primarily due to lower volume in all regions, with approximately 55 percent of the decrease occurring in europe and approximately 35 percent of the decrease occurring in the asia pacific region. within these regions, the largest decrease in sales was experienced from distributors and end-users in the oil and gas, marine, engine and construction equipment markets. excluding acquisitions and the effect of currency rate changes, sales in 2015 in the diversified industrial international operations decreased 1.3 percent from 2014 primarily due to higher volume in the asia pacific region being more than offset by lower volume in europe, approximately two-thirds of which was due to the absence of sales from divested businesses, and in latin america.
the decrease in operating margins in 2016 in the diversified industrial north american operations was primarily due to the lower sales volume and higher business realignment charges, partially offset by lower operating expenses primarily resulting from the company's simplification initiative. the decrease in operating margins in 2016 in the diversified industrial international operations was primarily due to the lower sales volume, an unfavorable product mix and higher business realignment charges, partially offset by lower operating expenses primarily resulting from the company's simplification initiative and prior-year restructuring activities. the increase in operating margins in 2015 in the diversified industrial north american operations was primarily due to the higher sales volume, a favorable product mix and manufacturing efficiencies, partially offset by higher warehouse, shipping, and manufacturing support costs, research and development expenses and raw material costs. diversified industrial north american margins in 2015 were also adversely affected by a voluntary retirement expense of $12.7 million. the increase in operating margins in 2015 in the diversified industrial international operations was primarily due to lower fixed overhead costs and lower business realignment charges in the current-year, partially offset by higher raw material costs due to changes in currency exchange rates.
the business realignment charges consist primarily of severance costs related to actions taken under the company's simplification initiative implemented by operating units throughout the world as well as plant closures. the majority of the diversified industrial international business realignment charges were incurred in europe. in addition to the business realignment charges presented in the table above, the company recognized $12 million of expense associated with enhanced retirement benefits in connection with a plant closure during 2016. the company anticipates that cost savings realized from the work force reduction measures taken during 2016 will increase 2017 operating income by approximately 11 percent in the diversified industrial north american business and by approximately 13 percent in the diversified industrial international business. in 2017, the company expects to continue to take actions necessary to structure appropriately the operations of the diversified industrial segment. such actions are expected to result in approximately $48 million in business realignment charges in 2017.
the decrease in total diversified industrial segment backlog in 2016 was primarily due to shipments exceeding orders primarily in north america and europe, with north america accounting for approximately 70 percent of the decrease and
europe accounting for approximately 30 percent of the decrease. the decrease in total diversified industrial segment backlog in 2015 was primarily due to shipments exceeding orders in all regions. backlog consists of written firm orders from a customer to deliver products and, in the case of blanket purchase orders, only includes the portion of the order for which a schedule or release date has been agreed to with the customer. the dollar value of backlog is equal to the amount that is expected to be billed to the customer and reported as a sale.
the decrease in total diversified industrial segment assets in 2016 was primarily due to the effect of currency rate fluctuations and a decrease in prepaid expenses, inventory, intangible assets, trade accounts receivable, net and plant and equipment, net, partially offset by an increase in marketable securities and other investments, cash and cash equivalents, deferred income taxes and goodwill. the decrease in total diversified industrial segment assets in 2015 was primarily due to the effect of currency rate fluctuations and a decrease in trade accounts receivable, net, non-trade and notes receivable and intangible assets, partially offset by an increase in cash and cash equivalents and other assets.
sales in 2016 were higher than the 2015 level as higher volume in the military original equipment manufacturer (oem) and commercial and military aftermarket businesses was partially offset by lower volume in the commercial oem business. sales in 2015 were higher than the 2014 level as higher volume in the commercial oem and aftermarket businesses was partially offset by lower volume in the military oem business.
the increase in backlog in 2016 was primarily due to orders exceeding shipments in the military oem and commercial and military aftermarket businesses, partially offset by shipments exceeding orders in the commercial oem business. the decrease in backlog in 2015 was primarily due to shipments exceeding orders in all businesses of the aerospace systems segment. backlog consists of written firm orders from a customer to deliver products and, in the case of blanket purchase orders, only includes the portion of the order for which a schedule or release date has been agreed to with the customer. the dollar value of backlog is equal to the amount that is expected to be billed to the customer and reported as a sale.
corporate general and administrative expenses were $173.2 million in 2016 compared to $215.4 million in 2015 and $181.9 million in 2014. as a percent of sales, corporate general and administrative expenses were 1.5 percent of sales compared to 1.7 percent in 2015 and 1.4 percent in 2014. the lower expense in 2016 was primarily due to a decrease in research and development expense and lower incentive compensation expense. the higher expense in 2015 was primarily due to an increase in incentive compensation expense and higher net expenses associated with the company's deferred compensation programs. corporate general and administrative expenses in 2015 included $3.1 million in voluntary retirement expense.
corporate assets decreased 12.5 percent in 2016 compared to a decrease of 10.8 percent from 2014 to 2015. the decrease in corporate assets in 2016 was primarily due to decreases in marketable securities and other investments, non-trade and notes receivable, cash and cash equivalents and the effect of currency rate fluctuations, partially offset by an increase in deferred income taxes. the decrease in corporate assets in 2015 was primarily due to the effect of currency rate fluctuations and changes in cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and other investments, non-trade and notes receivable, deferred income taxes and other assets.
divestitures and asset sales and writedowns       (11   )             4              (409   )
other items, net                                   (8   )             7                16
foreign currency transaction primarily relates to the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on cash, marketable securities and other investments and intercompany transactions. a significant portion of the foreign currency transaction gain in 2015 related to intercompany loans and was attributable to the swiss national bank lifting the cap on the fluctuation of the exchange rate used to measure the swiss franc against the euro. the company has since settled these particular intercompany loans. the decrease in stock compensation expense in 2016 is primarily due to fewer stock awards granted. the decrease in stock compensation expense in 2015 is primarily due to a lower fair value calculated for 2015 stock awards as well as fewer stock awards granted. included in divestitures and asset sales and writedowns for 2014 is a gain of approximately $413 million resulting from the deconsolidation of a subsidiary.

discussion of consolidated statement of cash flows the consolidated statement of cash flows reflects cash inflows and outflows from the company's operating, investing and financing activities.
operating activities                                          $1,170              $1,302              $1,388
investing activities                                            (265   )            (579   )            (646   )
financing activities                                            (802   )          (1,045   )            (958   )
cash flows from operating activities in 2016 reflects a decrease in net income from 2015 of $205 million and an increase of $120 million for cash provided by working capital items. cash flows from operating activities in 2015 reflects a reduction of $257 million for cash used by working capital items. cash flow from operating activities in 2014 benefited from a $294 million increase in cash provided by working capital items, partially offset by a $184 million decrease in net income after consideration of non-cash items, including a $413 million gain on the deconsolidation of a subsidiary and a $189 million impairment charge. the company also made voluntary cash contributions to the company's domestic qualified defined benefit plan of $200 million in 2016 and $75 million in 2014.
cash flows used in investing activities in 2016 and 2015 includes $51 million and $356 million, respectively, in net purchases of marketable securities and other investments. cash flows used in investing activities in 2014 includes $625 million in purchases of marketable securities and other investments and $202 million in proceeds from the sale of a 50 percent equity interest in a subsidiary related to the joint venture with ge aviation.
cash flows used in financing activities during 2015 includes the issuance of $1,500 million of medium-term notes and the repayment of commercial paper notes outstanding at the time of the debt issuance. the company repurchased 5.1 million common shares for $558 million during 2016 as compared to the repurchase of 11.1 million common shares for $1,394 million in 2015 and 1.7 million common shares for $200 million in 2014.
the company's goal is to maintain no less than an "a" rating on senior debt to ensure availability and reasonable cost of external funds. as a means of achieving this objective, the company has established a financial goal of maintaining a ratio of debt to debt-shareholders' equity of no more than 37 percent. from time to time, such as at june 30, 2016, fluctuations in cash flows from operations or capital deployment actions may cause the ratio of debt to debt-shareholders' equity to exceed the 37 percent goal. the company does not believe that its ability to borrow funds at affordable interest rates has been or will be impacted when the debt to debt-shareholders' equity ratio temporarily exceeds 37 percent.

as of june 30, 2016, the company had a line of credit totaling $2,000 million through a multi-currency revolving credit agreement with a group of banks, $1,696 million of which was available at june 30, 2016. refer to note 8 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for further discussion.
the company's credit agreements and indentures governing certain debt agreements contain various covenants, the violation of which would limit or preclude the use of the applicable agreements for future borrowings, or might accelerate the maturity of the related outstanding borrowings covered by the applicable agreements. the company is in compliance with all covenants and expects to remain in compliance during the term of the credit agreements and indentures.
contractual obligations - the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits, including interest, for uncertain tax positions was $152 million at june 30, 2016. payment of these obligations would result from settlements with worldwide taxing authorities. due to the difficulty in determining the timing of the settlements, these obligations are not included in the following summary of the company's fixed contractual obligations. references to notes are to the notes to the consolidated financial statements in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k.

critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. the policies discussed below are considered by management to be more critical than other policies because their application places the most significant demands on management's judgment.
revenue recognition - substantially all of the diversified industrial segment revenues are recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, product has shipped and the risks and rewards of ownership have transferred or services have been rendered, the price to the customer is fixed and determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured, which is generally at the time the product is shipped. the aerospace systems segment recognizes revenues primarily using the percentage-of-completion method and the extent of progress toward completion is primarily measured using the units-of-delivery method. the company estimates costs to complete long-term contracts for purposes of evaluating and establishing contract reserves. the estimation of these costs requires judgment on the part of management due to the duration of the contractual agreements as well as the technical nature of the products involved. adjustments to cost estimates are made on a consistent basis and a contract reserve is established when the estimated costs to complete a contract exceed the expected contract revenues.
impairment of goodwill and long-lived assets - goodwill is tested for impairment, at the reporting unit level, on an annual basis and between annual tests whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a reporting unit may exceed its fair value. for the company, a reporting unit is one level below the operating segment level. determining whether an impairment has occurred requires the valuation of the respective reporting unit, which the company has consistently estimated using primarily a discounted cash flow model. the company believes that the use of a discounted cash flow model
results in the most accurate calculation of a reporting unit's fair value since the market value for a reporting unit is not readily available. the discounted cash flow analysis requires several assumptions including future sales growth and operating margin levels as well as assumptions regarding future industry specific market conditions. each reporting unit regularly prepares discrete operating forecasts and uses these forecasts as the basis for the assumptions used in the discounted cash flow analysis. the company has consistently used a discount rate commensurate with its cost of capital, adjusted for inherent business risks, and an appropriate terminal growth factor. the company also reconciles the estimated aggregate fair value of its reporting units as derived from the discounted cash flow analysis to the company's overall market capitalization.
the results of the company's 2016 annual goodwill impairment test performed as of december 31, 2015 indicated that no goodwill impairment existed. during 2014, the company made a decision to restructure and change the strategic direction of its worldwide energy products division (epd). the company calculated the fair value of epd using assumptions reflecting the company's current strategic direction for this reporting unit, the results of which indicated that the carrying value of epd exceeded its fair value. as a result, the company estimated the implied fair value of epd's goodwill, which resulted in a non-cash impairment charge of $140 million. the fair value of epd was calculated using both a discounted cash flow analysis and estimated fair market values of comparable businesses.
the company continually monitors its reporting units for impairment indicators and updates assumptions used in the most recent calculation of the fair value of a reporting unit as appropriate. the company is unaware of any current market trends that are contrary to the assumptions made in the estimation of the fair value of any of its reporting units. if actual experience is not consistent with the assumptions made in the estimation of the fair value of the reporting units, especially assumptions regarding penetration into new markets and the recovery of the current economic environment, it is possible that the estimated fair value of certain reporting units could fall below their carrying value resulting in the necessity to conduct additional goodwill impairment tests.
long-lived assets held for use, which primarily includes finite-lived intangible assets and plant and equipment, are evaluated for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the undiscounted net cash flows to be generated by their use over their expected useful lives and eventual disposition are less than their carrying value. the long-term nature of these assets requires the estimation of their cash inflows and outflows several years into the future and only takes into consideration technological advances known at the time of the impairment test. during 2016, there were no events or circumstances that indicated that the carrying value of the company's long-lived assets held for use were not recoverable. during 2014, in connection with the goodwill impairment review discussed above, the company determined certain intangible assets of epd, primarily trademarks and customer lists, and plant and equipment were impaired resulting in a non-cash impairment charge of $49 million. the fair value of epd's intangible assets and plant and equipment were determined using the income approach for each asset.
pensions - the annual net periodic expense and benefit obligations related to the company's defined benefit plans are determined on an actuarial basis. this determination requires critical assumptions regarding the discount rate, long-term rate of return on plan assets, increases in compensation levels and amortization periods for actuarial gains and losses. assumptions are determined based on company data and appropriate market indicators, and are evaluated each year as of the plans' measurement date. changes in the assumptions to reflect actual experience as well as the amortization of actuarial gains and losses could result in a material change in the annual net periodic expense and benefit obligations reported in the financial statements. beginning in 2017, the company will change the method used to estimate the service and interest cost components of net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit costs. the new method uses the spot yield curve approach to estimate the service and interest costs by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used to determine the benefit obligations to relevant cash outflows. previously, these costs were determined using a single-weighted average discount rate. the change does not affect the measurement of the company's benefit obligations. the new method provides a more precise measure of service and interest costs by improving the correlation between projected benefit cash flows and the discrete spot yield curve rates and will be accounted for as a change in estimate prospectively beginning in the first quarter of 2017. annual net periodic pension expense in 2017 is expected to be lower by approximately $33 million compared to the previous method. annual net periodic postretirement cost is not expected to be materially different.
for the company's domestic qualified defined benefit plan, a 50 basis point change in the assumed long-term rate of return on plan assets is estimated to have a $12 million effect on annual pension expense and a 50 basis point decrease in the discount rate is estimated to increase annual pension expense by $31 million. as of june 30, 2016, $1,535 million of past years' net actuarial losses related to the company's domestic qualified defined benefit plan are subject to amortization in the future. these losses will generally be amortized over approximately eight years and will negatively affect earnings in the future. actuarial gains experienced in future years will help reduce the effect of the actuarial loss amortization. further information on pensions is provided in note 10 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k.
income taxes - significant judgment is required in determining the company's income tax expense and in evaluating tax positions. deferred income tax assets and liabilities have been recorded for the differences between the financial accounting and income tax basis of assets and liabilities. factors considered by the company in determining the probability of realizing deferred income tax assets include forecasted operating earnings, available tax planning strategies and the time period over which the temporary differences will reverse. the company reviews its tax positions on a regular basis and adjusts the balances as new information becomes available. for those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon examination by a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information will be recorded. for those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, no tax benefit has been recognized in the consolidated financial statements. further information on income taxes is provided in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k.
loss contingencies - the company has a number of loss exposures incurred in the ordinary course of business such as environmental claims, product liability and litigation reserves. establishing loss accruals for these matters requires management's estimate and judgment with regards to risk exposure and ultimate liability or realization. these loss accruals are reviewed periodically and adjustments are made to reflect the most recent facts and circumstances.
recently issued accounting pronouncements recently issued accounting pronouncements are described in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, included in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k.

item 1a. risk factors you should carefully consider the risks described below. if any of the risks and uncertainties described in the cautionary factors described below actually occurs, our business, financial condition and results of operations, and the trading price of our common stock could be materially and adversely affected. moreover, we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. new factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible to predict the impact of all these factors on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
•   economic conditions in the u.s. and international markets could adversely affect our business and financial results.
as a retailer that is dependent upon consumer discretionary spending, our results of operations are sensitive to changes in macro-economic conditions. our customers may have less money for discretionary purchases and may stop or reduce their purchases of our products or trade down to starbucks or competitors' lower priced products as a result of job losses, foreclosures, bankruptcies, increased fuel and energy costs, higher interest rates, higher taxes and reduced access to credit. decreases in customer traffic and/or average value per transaction will negatively impact our financial performance as reduced revenues without a corresponding decrease in expenses result in sales de-leveraging, which creates downward pressure on margins and also negatively impacts comparable store sales, net revenues, operating income and earnings per share. there is also a risk that if negative economic conditions persist for a long period of time or worsen, consumers may make long-lasting changes to their discretionary purchasing behavior, including less frequent discretionary purchases on a more permanent basis.
•   our success depends substantially on the value of our brands and failure to preserve their value, either through our actions or those of our business partners, could have a negative impact on our financial results.
we believe we have built an excellent reputation globally for the quality of our products, for delivery of a consistently positive consumer experience and for our corporate social responsibility programs. the starbucks brand is recognized throughout the world and we have received high ratings in global brand value studies. to be successful in the future, particularly outside of the u.s., where the starbucks brand and our other brands are less well-known, we believe we must preserve, grow and leverage the value of our brands across all sales channels. brand value is based in part on consumer perceptions on a variety of subjective qualities.
additionally, our business strategy, including our plans for new stores, foodservice, branded products and other initiatives, relies significantly on a variety of business partners, including licensee and joint venture relationships, particularly in our international markets, and third party manufacturers, distributors and retailers, particularly in our international channel development business. licensees and foodservice operators are often authorized to use our logos and provide branded food, beverage and other products directly to customers. we provide training and support to, and monitor the operations of, certain of these business partners, but the product quality and service they deliver may be diminished by any number of factors beyond our control, including financial pressures they may face. we believe customers expect the same quality of products and service from our licensees as they do from us and we strive to ensure customers receive the same quality of products and service experience whether they visit a company-operated store or a licensed store. we also source our food, beverage and other products from a wide variety of domestic and international business partners in our supply chain operations, and in certain cases such products are produced or sourced by our licensees directly. and although foodservice operators are authorized to use our logos and provide branded products as part of their foodservice business, we do not monitor the quality of non-starbucks products served in those locations.
business incidents, whether isolated or recurring and whether originating from us or our business partners, that erode consumer trust, such as actual or perceived breaches of privacy, contaminated food, store employees or other food handlers infected with communicable diseases, product recalls or other potential incidents discussed in this risk factors section, particularly if the incidents receive considerable publicity, including rapidly through social or digital media, or result in litigation, and failure to respond appropriately to these incidents, can significantly reduce brand value and have a negative impact on our financial
results. consumer demand for our products and our brand equity could diminish significantly if we or our licensees or other business partners fail to preserve the quality of our products, are perceived to act in an unethical or socially irresponsible manner, including with respect to the sourcing, content or sale of our products or the use of customer data, fail to comply with laws and regulations or fail to deliver a consistently positive consumer experience in each of our markets, including by failing to invest in the right balance of wages and benefits to attract and retain employees that represent the brand well. additionally, inconsistent uses of our brand and other of our intellectual property assets, as well as failure to protect our intellectual property, including from unauthorized uses of our brand or other of our intellectual property assets, can erode consumer trust and our brand value and have a negative impact on our financial results.
•   incidents involving food or beverage-borne illnesses, tampering, contamination or mislabeling, whether or not accurate, as well as adverse public or medical opinions about the health effects of consuming our products, could harm our business.
instances or reports, whether true or not, of unclean water supply or food-safety issues, such as food or beverage-borne illnesses, tampering, contamination or mislabeling, either during growing, manufacturing, packaging, storing or preparation, have in the past severely injured the reputations of companies in the food and beverage processing, grocery and quick-service restaurant sectors and could affect us as well. any report linking us to the use of unclean water, food or beverage-borne illnesses, tampering, contamination, mislabeling or other food or beverage-safety issues could damage our brand value and severely hurt sales of our food and beverage products and possibly lead to product liability claims, litigation (including class actions) or damages. clean water is critical to the preparation of coffee, tea and other beverages and our ability to ensure a clean water supply to our stores can be limited, particularly in some international locations. we are also continuing to incorporate more products in our food and beverage lineup that require freezing or refrigeration, including produce (such as fruits and vegetables in our salads and juices), dairy products (such as milk and cheeses), non-dairy alternative products (such as soymilk and almondmilk) and meats. additionally, we are evolving our product lineup to include more local or smaller suppliers for some of our products who may not have as rigorous quality and safety systems and protocols as larger or more national suppliers. if customers become ill from food or beverage-borne illnesses, tampering, contamination, mislabeling or other food or beverage-safety issues, we could be forced to temporarily close some stores and/or supply chain facilities, as well as recall products. in addition, instances of food or beverage-safety issues, even those involving solely the restaurants or stores of competitors or of suppliers or distributors (regardless of whether we use or have used those suppliers or distributors), could, by resulting in negative publicity about us or the foodservice industry in general, adversely affect our sales on a regional or global basis. a decrease in customer traffic as a result of food-safety concerns or negative publicity, or as a result of a temporary closure of any of our stores, product recalls or food or beverage-safety claims or litigation, could materially harm our business and results of operations.
some of our products contain caffeine, dairy products, sugar and other compounds and allergens, the health effects of which are the subject of public and regulatory scrutiny, including the suggestion that excessive consumption of caffeine, dairy products, sugar and other compounds can lead to a variety of adverse health effects. particularly in the u.s., there is increasing consumer awareness of health risks, including obesity, due in part to increased publicity and attention from health organizations, as well as increased consumer litigation based on alleged adverse health impacts of consumption of various food and beverage products. while we have a variety of beverage and food items, including items that are coffee-free and have reduced calories, an unfavorable report on the health effects of caffeine or other compounds present in our products, whether accurate or not, or negative publicity or litigation arising from certain health risks could significantly reduce the demand for our beverages and food products and could materially harm our business and results of operations.
•   the unauthorized access, theft or destruction of customer or employee personal, financial or other data or of starbucks proprietary or confidential information that is stored in our information systems or by third parties on our behalf could impact our reputation and brand and expose us to potential liability and loss of revenues.
our information technology systems, such as those we use for our point-of-sale, web and mobile platforms, including online and mobile payment systems and rewards programs, and for administrative functions, including human resources, payroll, accounting and internal and external communications, as well as the information technology systems of our third party business partners and service providers, can contain personal, financial or other information that is entrusted to us by our customers and employees. our information technology systems also contain starbucks proprietary and other confidential information related to our business, such as business plans, product development initiatives and designs. similar to many other retail companies and because of the prominence of our brand, we have experienced frequent attempts to compromise our information technology systems. to the extent we or a third party were to experience a material breach of our or such third party's information technology systems that result in the unauthorized access, theft, use or destruction of customers' or employees' data or that of the company stored in such systems, including through cyber-attacks or other external or internal methods, it could result in a material loss of revenues from the potential adverse impact to our reputation and brand, our ability to retain or attract new customers and the potential disruption to our business and plans. such security breaches also could result in a violation of applicable u.s. and international privacy and other laws, and subject us to private consumer or securities litigation and
governmental investigations and proceedings, any of which could result in our exposure to material civil or criminal liability. our reputation and brand and our ability to attract new customers could also be adversely impacted if we fail, or are perceived to have failed, to properly respond to these incidents. such failure to properly respond could also result in similar exposure to liability. significant capital investments and other expenditures could be required to remedy the problem and prevent future breaches, including costs associated with additional security technologies, personnel, experts and credit monitoring services for those whose data has been breached. these costs, which could be material, could adversely impact our results of operations in the period in which they are incurred and may not meaningfully limit the success of future attempts to breach our information technology systems.
media or other reports of existing or perceived security vulnerabilities in our systems or those of our third party business partners or service providers, even if no breach has been attempted or has occurred, can also adversely impact our brand and reputation and materially impact our business. additionally, the techniques and sophistication used to conduct cyber-attacks and breaches of information technology systems, as well as the sources and targets of these attacks, change frequently and are often not recognized until such attacks are launched or have been in place for a period of time. we continue to make significant investments in technology, third party services and personnel to develop and implement systems and processes that are designed to anticipate cyber-attacks and to prevent or minimize breaches of our information technology systems or data loss, but these security measures cannot provide assurance that we will be successful in preventing such breaches or data loss.
•   we rely heavily on information technology in our operations, and any material failure, inadequacy, interruption or security failure of that technology could harm our ability to effectively operate our business and could adversely affect our financial results.
we rely heavily on information technology systems across our operations, including for administrative functions, point-of-sale processing and payment in our stores and online, management of our supply chain, starbucks cards, online business, mobile technology, including mobile payments and ordering apps, reloads and loyalty functionality and various other processes and transactions, and many of these systems are interdependent on one another for their functionality. our ability to effectively manage our business and coordinate the production, distribution, administration and sale of our products depends significantly on the reliability, integrity and capacity of these systems. we also rely on third party providers and platforms for some of these information technology systems and support. additionally, our systems hardware, software and services provided by third party service providers are not fully redundant within a market or across our markets. although we have operational safeguards in place, they may not be effective in preventing the failure of these systems or platforms to operate effectively and be available. such failures may be caused by various factors, including power outages, catastrophic events, inadequate or ineffective redundancy, problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems or platforms, flaws in third party software or services, errors by our employees or third party service providers, or a breach in the security of these systems or platforms, including through cyber-attacks discussed in more detail in this risk factors section. if our incident response, disaster recovery and business continuity plans do not resolve these issues in an effective manner they could cause material negative impacts to our product availability and sales, the efficiency of our operations and our financial results.
•   we may not be successful in implementing important strategic initiatives or effectively managing growth, which may have an adverse impact on our business and financial results.
there is no assurance that we will be able to implement important strategic initiatives in accordance with our expectations, which may result in an adverse impact on our business and financial results. these strategic initiatives are designed to create growth, improve our results of operations and drive long-term shareholder value, and include:
•   being an employer of choice and investing in employees to deliver a superior customer experience;
•   building our leadership position around coffee, including through the development of starbucks reserve® roasteries and starbucks reserve® stores;
•   increasing the scale of the starbucks store footprint with disciplined global expansion and introducing flexible and unique store formats;
•   creating new occasions in stores across all dayparts with new product offerings, including our growing lunch food and beverage product lineup;
•   continuing the global growth of our channel development business;
•   delivering continued growth in our tea business through the teavana brand; and
•   driving convenience and brand engagement through our mobile, loyalty and digital capabilities.
in addition to other factors listed in this risk factors section, factors that may adversely affect the successful implementation of these initiatives, which could adversely impact our business and financial results, include the following:
•   increases in labor costs, both domestically and internationally, such as general market and minimum wage levels and investing in competitive compensation, increased health care and workers' compensation insurance costs and other
benefits to attract and retain high quality employees with the right skill sets, whether due to regulatory mandates, changing industry practices or our expansion into new channels or technology dependent operations;
•   increasing competition in channels in which we operate or seek to operate from new and existing large competitors that sell high-quality specialty coffee beverages;
•   construction cost increases associated with new store openings and remodeling of existing stores; delays in store openings for reasons beyond our control or a lack of desirable real estate locations available for lease at reasonable rates, either of which could keep us from meeting annual store opening targets in the u.s. and internationally;
•   not successfully scaling our supply chain infrastructure as our product offerings increase and as we continue to expand;
•   the ability of our licensee partners to implement our growth platforms and product innovation;
•   lack of customer acceptance of new products (including due to price increases necessary to cover the costs of new products or higher input costs), brands (such as the global expansion of teavana) and platforms (such as mobile technology), or customers reducing their demand for our current offerings as new products are introduced;
•   the degree to which we enter into, maintain, develop and are able to negotiate appropriate terms and conditions of, and enforce, commercial and other agreements;
•   not successfully consummating favorable strategic transactions or integrating acquired businesses; and
•   the deterioration in our credit ratings, which could limit the availability of additional financing and increase the cost of obtaining financing to fund our initiatives.
additionally, our channel development business is also in part dependent on the level of support our retail business partners provide our products, and in some markets there are only a few retailers. if our retail business partners do not provide sufficient levels of support for our products, which is at their discretion, it could limit our ability to grow our channel development business. also, a relatively small number of licensee partners own a large number of licensed stores. if such licensee partners are not able to access sufficient funds or financing, or are otherwise unable to successfully operate and grow their businesses, including their licensed stores, it could adversely affect our results in the markets in which they operate their licensed stores.
effectively managing growth can be challenging, particularly as we continue to expand into new channels outside the retail store model, increase our focus on our channel development and teavana businesses, and expand into new markets internationally where we must balance the need for flexibility and a degree of autonomy for local management against the need for consistency with our goals, philosophy and standards. growth can make it increasingly difficult to ensure a consistent supply of high-quality raw materials, to locate and hire sufficient numbers of key employees, to maintain an effective system of internal controls for a globally dispersed enterprise and to train employees worldwide to deliver a consistently high quality product and customer experience. furthermore, if we are not successful in implementing these strategic initiatives, we may be required to evaluate whether certain assets, including goodwill and other intangibles, have become impaired. in the event we record an impairment charge, it could have a material impact on our financial results.
•   we face intense competition in each of our channels and markets, which could lead to reduced profitability.
the specialty coffee market is intensely competitive, including with respect to product quality, innovation, service, convenience, and price, and we face significant and increasing competition in all these areas in each of our channels and markets. accordingly, we do not have leadership positions in all channels and markets. in the u.s., the ongoing focus by large competitors in the quick-service restaurant sector on selling high-quality specialty coffee beverages could lead to decreases in customer traffic to starbucks® stores and/or average value per transaction adversely affecting our sales and results of operations. similarly, continued competition from well-established competitors in our international markets could hinder growth and adversely affect our sales and results of operations in those markets. increased competition in the u.s. packaged coffee and tea and single-serve and ready-to-drink coffee beverage markets, including from new and large entrants to this market, could adversely affect the profitability of the channel development segment. additionally, declines in general consumer demand for specialty coffee products for any reason, including due to consumer preference for other products, could have a negative effect on our business.
•   we are highly dependent on the financial performance of our americas operating segment.
our financial performance is highly dependent on our americas operating segment, as it comprised approximately 69% of consolidated total net revenues in fiscal 2016. if the americas operating segment revenue trends slow or decline, especially in our u.s. and canada markets, our other segments may be unable to make up any significant shortfall and our business and financial results could be adversely affected. and because the americas segment is relatively mature and produces the large majority of our operating cash flows, such a slowdown or decline could result in reduced cash flows for funding the expansion of our international business and other initiatives and for returning cash to shareholders.
•   we are increasingly dependent on the success of certain international markets in order to achieve our growth targets.
our future growth increasingly depends on the growth and sustained profitability of certain international markets. some or all of our international market business units ("mbus"), which we generally define by the countries in which they operate, may not be successful in their operations or in achieving expected growth, which ultimately requires achieving consistent, stable net revenues and earnings. the performance of these international operations may be adversely affected by economic downturns in one or more of the countries in which our large mbus operate. in particular, both our china and japan mbus contribute meaningfully to both consolidated and cap net revenues and earnings. a decline in performance of one or more of our significant international mbus could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results.
additionally, some factors that will be critical to the success of our international operations are different than those affecting our u.s. stores and licensees. tastes naturally vary by region, and consumers in some mbus may not embrace our products to the same extent as consumers in the u.s. or other international markets. occupancy costs and store operating expenses can be higher internationally than in the u.s. due to higher rents for prime store locations or costs of compliance with country-specific regulatory requirements. because many of our international operations are in an early phase of development, operating expenses as a percentage of related revenues are often higher compared to more developed operations, such as in the u.s. additionally, our international joint venture partners or licensees may face capital constraints or other factors that may limit the speed at which they are able to expand and develop in a certain market.
our international operations are also subject to additional inherent risks of conducting business abroad, such as:
•   foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, or requirements to transact in specific currencies;
•   changes or uncertainties in economic, legal, regulatory, social and political conditions in our markets;
•   interpretation and application of laws and regulations;
•   restrictive actions of foreign or u.s. governmental authorities affecting trade and foreign investment, especially during periods of heightened tension between the u.s. and such foreign governmental authorities, including protective measures such as export and customs duties and tariffs, government intervention favoring local competitors, and restrictions on the level of foreign ownership;
•   import or other business licensing requirements;
•   the enforceability of intellectual property and contract rights;
•   limitations on the repatriation of funds and foreign currency exchange restrictions due to current or new u.s. and international regulations;
•   in developing economies, the growth rate in the portion of the population achieving sufficient levels of disposable income may not be as fast as we forecast;
•   difficulty in staffing, developing and managing foreign operations and supply chain logistics, including ensuring the consistency of product quality and service, due to governmental actions affecting supply chain logistics, distance, language and cultural differences, as well as challenges in recruiting and retaining high quality employees in local markets;
•   local laws that make it more expensive and complex to negotiate with, retain or terminate employees;
•   delays in store openings for reasons beyond our control, competition with locally relevant competitors or a lack of desirable real estate locations available for lease at reasonable rates, any of which could keep us from meeting annual store opening targets and, in turn, negatively impact net revenues, operating income and earnings per share; and
•   disruption in energy supplies affecting our markets.
moreover, many of the foregoing risks are particularly acute in developing countries, which are important to our long-term growth prospects.
•   increases in the cost of high-quality arabica coffee beans or other commodities or decreases in the availability of high-quality arabica coffee beans or other commodities could have an adverse impact on our business and financial results.
we purchase, roast and sell high-quality whole bean arabica coffee beans and related coffee products. the price of coffee is subject to significant volatility and has and may again increase significantly due to one or more of the factors described below. the high-quality arabica coffee of the quality we seek tends to trade on a negotiated basis at a premium above the "c" price. this premium depends upon the supply and demand at the time of purchase and the amount of the premium can vary significantly. increases in the "c" coffee commodity price do increase the price of high-quality arabica coffee and also impact our ability to enter into fixed-price purchase commitments. we frequently enter into supply contracts whereby the quality, quantity, delivery period, and other negotiated terms are agreed upon, but the date, and therefore price, at which the base "c" coffee commodity price component will be fixed has not yet been established. these are known as price-to-be-fixed contracts. the supply and price of coffee we purchase can also be affected by multiple factors in the producing countries, including
weather, natural disasters, crop disease, general increase in farm inputs and costs of production, inventory levels and political and economic conditions, as well as the actions of certain organizations and associations that have historically attempted to influence prices of green coffee through agreements establishing export quotas or by restricting coffee supplies. speculative trading in coffee commodities can also influence coffee prices. because of the significance of coffee beans to our operations, combined with our ability to only partially mitigate future price risk through purchasing practices and hedging activities, increases in the cost of high-quality arabica coffee beans could have an adverse impact on our profitability. in addition, if we are not able to purchase sufficient quantities of green coffee due to any of the above factors or to a worldwide or regional shortage, we may not be able to fulfill the demand for our coffee, which could have an adverse impact on our profitability.
we also purchase significant amounts of dairy products, particularly fluid milk, to support the needs of our company-operated retail stores. additionally, and although less significant to our operations than coffee or dairy, other commodities, including but not limited to tea and those related to food and beverage inputs, such as cocoa, produce, baking ingredients, meats, eggs and energy, as well as the processing of these inputs, are important to our operations. increases in the cost of dairy products and other commodities, or lack of availability, whether due to supply shortages, delays or interruptions in processing, or otherwise, especially in international markets, could have an adverse impact on our profitability.
•   our financial condition and results of operations are sensitive to, and may be adversely affected by, a number of factors, many of which are largely outside our control.
our operating results have been in the past and will continue to be subject to a number of factors, many of which are largely outside our control. any one or more of the factors listed below or described elsewhere in this risk factors section could adversely impact our business, financial condition and/or results of operations:
•   increases in real estate costs in certain domestic and international markets;
•   adverse outcomes of litigation; and
•   especially in our larger or fast growing markets, labor discord, war, terrorism (including incidents targeting us), political instability, boycotts, social unrest, and natural disasters, including health pandemics that lead to avoidance of public places or restrictions on public gatherings such as in our stores.
•   interruption of our supply chain could affect our ability to produce or deliver our products and could negatively impact our business and profitability.
any material interruption in our supply chain, such as material interruption of roasted coffee supply due to the casualty loss of any of our roasting plants, interruptions in service by our third party logistic service providers or common carriers that ship goods within our distribution channels, trade restrictions, such as increased tariffs or quotas, embargoes or customs restrictions, or natural disasters that cause a material disruption in our supply chain could negatively impact our business and our profitability.
additionally, our food, beverage and other products are sourced from a wide variety of domestic and international business partners in our supply chain operations, and in certain cases are produced or sourced by our licensees directly. we rely on these suppliers and vendors to provide high quality products and to comply with applicable laws. our ability to find qualified suppliers and vendors who meet our standards and supply products in a timely and efficient manner is a significant challenge, especially with respect to goods sourced from outside the u.s., especially countries or regions with diminished infrastructure, developing or failing economies or experiencing political instability or social unrest. for certain products, we may rely on one or very few suppliers or vendors. a vendor's or supplier's failure to meet our standards, provide products in a timely and efficient manner, or comply with applicable laws is beyond our control. these issues, especially for those products for which we rely on one or few suppliers or vendors, could negatively impact our business and profitability.
•   failure to meet market expectations for our financial performance and fluctuations in the stock market as a whole will likely adversely affect the market price and volatility of our stock.
failure to meet market expectations going forward, particularly with respect to operating margins, earnings per share, comparable store sales, operating cash flows, and net revenues, will likely result in a decline and/or increased volatility in the market price of our stock. in addition, price and volume fluctuations in the stock market as a whole may affect the market price of our stock in ways that may be unrelated to our financial performance.
•   the loss of key personnel or difficulties recruiting and retaining qualified personnel could adversely impact our business and financial results.
much of our future success depends on the continued availability and service of senior management personnel. the loss of any of our executive officers or other key senior management personnel could harm our business. we must continue to recruit, retain and motivate management and other employees sufficiently, both to maintain our current business and to execute our
strategic initiatives, some of which involve ongoing expansion in business channels outside of our traditional company-operated store model. our success also depends substantially on the contributions and abilities of our retail store employees whom we rely on to give customers a superior in-store experience and elevate our brand. accordingly, our performance depends on our ability to recruit and retain high quality employees to work in and manage our stores, both domestically and internationally. if we are unable to recruit, retain and motivate employees sufficiently to maintain our current business and support our projected growth, our business and financial performance may be adversely affected.
•   failure to comply with applicable laws and changing legal and regulatory requirements could harm our business and financial results.
our policies and procedures are designed to comply with all applicable laws, accounting and reporting requirements, tax rules and other regulations and requirements, including those imposed by the sec, nasdaq, and foreign countries, as well as applicable trade, labor, healthcare, privacy, food and beverage, labeling, anti-bribery and corruption and merchandise laws. the complexity of the regulatory environment in which we operate and the related cost of compliance are both increasing due to additional or changing legal and regulatory requirements, our ongoing expansion into new markets and new channels, and the fact that foreign laws occasionally conflict with domestic laws. in addition to potential damage to our reputation and brand, failure by us or our business partners to comply with the various laws and regulations, as well as changes in laws and regulations or the manner in which they are interpreted or applied, may result in litigation, civil and criminal liability, damages, fines and penalties, increased cost of regulatory compliance and restatements of our financial statements.
item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general our fiscal year ends on the sunday closest to september 30. the fiscal year ended on october 2, 2016 included 53 weeks, with the extra week falling in our fourth fiscal quarter. fiscal years ended on september 27, 2015 and september 28, 2014 both included 52 weeks. comparable store sales percentages below are calculated excluding the 53rd week. all references to store counts, including data for new store openings, are reported net of related store closures, unless otherwise noted.
financial highlights
•   global comparable store sales grew 5% driven by a 4% increase in average ticket and a 1% increase in the number of transactions.
•   consolidated operating income increased to $4.2 billion in fiscal 2016 compared to operating income of $3.6 billion in fiscal 2015. fiscal 2016 operating margin was 19.6% compared to 18.8% in fiscal 2015. operating margin expansion in fiscal 2016 was primarily driven by sales leverage and lower commodity costs, partially offset by investments in partners (employees) and digital platforms.
•   earnings per share ("eps") for fiscal 2016 increased to $1.90 and included $0.06 per share for the extra week in fiscal 2016. fiscal 2015 eps was $1.82 and included $0.26 per share from the gain on the fair value adjustment of our preexisting equity interest in starbucks japan upon acquisition.
•   cash flows from operations were $4.6 billion in fiscal 2016 compared to $3.7 billion in fiscal 2015. the change was primarily due to increased earnings, the lapping of the non-cash acquisition related gain for starbucks japan and the timing of our cash payments for income taxes.
•   capital expenditures were $1.4 billion in fiscal 2016 compared to $1.3 billion in fiscal 2015.
overview starbucks results for fiscal 2016 continued to demonstrate the strength of our global business model, and our ability to successfully make disciplined investments in our business and our partners (employees). our net revenues grew 11% over fiscal 2015, and consolidated operating margin expanded 80 basis points from 18.8% in fiscal 2015 to 19.6% in fiscal 2016, largely driven by sales leverage and lower commodity costs, partially offset by investments in our partners and digital platforms.
the americas segment continued to perform well in fiscal 2016, with revenues growing 11% to $14.8 billion, primarily driven by comparable store sales growth of 6%, comprised of a 5% increase in average ticket and a 1% increase in number of transactions, incremental revenues from 804 net new store openings over the last 12 months and the impact of the extra week in fiscal 2016. growth in our iced beverages, including coffee, tea and espresso, paired with beverage innovation and the success of our food offerings, drove the increase in comparable store sales. americas operating margin grew 110 basis points to 25.3% in fiscal 2016, primarily driven by sales leverage and lower commodity costs, partially offset by investments in our store partners and digital platforms.
our fiscal 2016 china/asia pacific segment results reflected higher revenues from the opening of 981 net new stores over the past year, incremental revenues associated with the ownership change in starbucks japan, a 3% increase in comparable store sales and the impact of the extra week in fiscal 2016. operating margin expanded 60 basis points to 21.5%, driven by sales leverage, higher income from our joint venture operations and favorability from changes to certain business tax structures in china. this favorability was partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation and the impact of our ownership change in starbucks japan. we now operate 6,443 stores in 15 countries in our china/asia pacific segment with continued strong performance, reinforcing our confidence in the long-term growth potential of this market.
as we continue to execute our strategy of achieving the appropriate balance between company-operated and licensed stores, our emea segment revenues declined 8% to $1.1 billion in fiscal 2016 compared to a year ago. the decline in revenues was primarily driven by lower company-operated store revenues due to the shift to more licensed stores in the region and unfavorable foreign currency translation. partially offsetting lower company-operated store revenues were higher licensed store sales, primarily resulting from the opening of 294 net new licensed stores and the transfer of 200 company-operated stores to licensed stores over the past 12 months, and the impact of the extra week in fiscal 2016. compared to fiscal 2015, emea operating margin declined 30 basis points to 13.5% primarily due to sales deleverage at certain company-operated stores and
unfavorable foreign currency exchange, partially offset by sales leverage driven by the shift in the portfolio towards more licensed stores.
the channel development segment revenues grew 12% to $1.9 billion in fiscal 2016, primarily due to higher sales of premium single-serve products, driven by sales of starbucks® k-cup® portion packs, the impact of the extra week in fiscal 2016 and increased foodservice and packaged coffee sales. operating margin increased 400 basis points to 41.8%, primarily driven by strong performance from our north american coffee partnership joint venture, lower coffee costs and leverage on cost of sales. as seen through our channel development segment results for fiscal 2016, we continue to expand customer occasions outside of our retail stores and through our developing international presence.
fiscal 2017 - the view ahead turning to fiscal 2017, we expect continued strength in our revenue, operating margin and earnings per share results in comparison to fiscal 2016. these results are expected to be driven by our 7 strategies for growth, which include:
•   be the employer of choice
•   grow the store portfolio
•   create new customer occasions
•   extend digital engagement in fiscal 2017, through our 7 strategies for growth, we plan to expand our footprint by opening new stores and enhancing the mix and types of stores in our portfolio. expansion of our store portfolio is expected to be coupled with continued customer attachment through our morning and lunch dayparts. and, our management team continues to align our leadership with our evolving businesses, including the development of our global roastery and starbucks reserve® branded stores. as a result of these efforts, we expect consolidated revenue growth to be approximately 8% in fiscal 2017 when compared to our 53-week results in fiscal 2016. after excluding the approximately $400 million of additional revenue attributed to the extra week in fiscal 2016, we expect consolidated revenue growth to be approximately 10% for fiscal 2017 based on a comparable 52-week year. revenue growth is expected to be driven by comparable store sales in the mid-single digits and the opening of approximately 2,100 net new stores globally.
additionally, for fiscal 2017, we expect to continue investing in our partners and digital platforms. these investments provide enhanced wages and benefits and also focus on mobile and loyalty programs. we expect partner and digital investments to increase by approximately $250 million versus an increase of approximately $160 million in fiscal 2016, further demonstrating the importance of and value creation realized from these efforts.
we plan for our consolidated operating margin to increase slightly in fiscal 2017 when compared to fiscal 2016. sales leverage and cost savings initiatives will offset investments in our business and partners. for fiscal 2017, we expect an effective tax rate of about 34%, and diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $2.09 to $2.11.
capital expenditures in fiscal 2017 are expected to be approximately $1.6 billion, primarily for new stores and store renovations, as well as for other investments to support our ongoing growth initiatives.

total net revenues increased $2.2 billion, or 11%, over fiscal 2015, primarily due to increased revenues from company-operated stores (contributing $1.6 billion). the growth in company-operated store revenues was primarily driven by 5% growth in comparable store sales ($793 million), incremental revenues from 693 net new starbucks® company-operated store openings over the past 12 months ($724 million), the impact of the extra week in fiscal 2016 ($324 million) and incremental revenues from the impact of our ownership change in starbucks japan ($105 million). partially offsetting these increases was the absence of revenue from the conversion of certain company-operated stores to licensed stores ($151 million) and the impact of unfavorable foreign currency translation ($99 million).
licensed store revenue growth contributed $292 million to the increase in total net revenues, primarily resulting from higher product sales to and royalty revenues from our licensees ($285 million), largely due to the opening of 1,372 net new starbucks® licensed stores, the transfer of 200 company-operated stores to licensed stores over the past 12 months and improved comparable store sales, as well as the impact of the extra week in fiscal 2016 ($41 million). partially offsetting these increases was the impact of unfavorable foreign currency translation ($33 million) and a decrease in licensed store revenues resulting from the impact of our ownership change in starbucks japan ($6 million).

interest income and other, net increased $65 million, primarily due to higher income recognized on unredeemed stored value card balances ($21 million), net favorable foreign exchange fluctuations ($11 million) and gains on our trading securities portfolio ($8 million).
our tax rate is affected by recurring items, such as tax rates in foreign jurisdictions and the relative amounts of income we earn in those jurisdictions, as well as discrete items that may occur in any given year, but are not consistent from year to year. the effective tax rate for fiscal 2016 was 32.9% compared to 29.3% for fiscal 2015. the increase in the rate for fiscal 2016 was primarily due to the 3.7% impact of the gain in the prior year associated with the remeasurement of our preexisting 39.5% ownership interest in starbucks japan upon acquisition, which was almost entirely non-taxable.

discussion of our china/asia pacific segment results below reflects the impact of fully consolidating starbucks japan due to the ownership change from an equity method joint venture to a company-operated market since the acquisition date of october 31, 2014. under the joint venture model, we recognized royalties and product sales within revenue and related product cost of sales as well as our proportionate share of starbucks japan's net earnings, which we recognized within income from equity investees. this resulted in a lower gross margin and a very high operating margin. under the company-operated ownership model, starbucks japan's operating results are reflected in most income statement lines of this segment and have an operating margin more in line with that of our other retail businesses.
revenues china/asia pacific total net revenues for fiscal 2015 increased $1.3 billion, or 112%, largely due to increased revenues from company-operated stores ($1.3 billion). the increase in company-operated store revenues was primarily driven by incremental revenues from the acquisition of starbucks japan ($1.1 billion). also contributing were incremental revenues from the opening of 247 net new company-operated stores over the past 12 months ($160 million) and a 9% increase in comparable store sales ($74 million).
licensed store revenues decreased $6 million, primarily due to our ownership change in starbucks japan to mostly company-operated stores ($45 million). this decrease was partially offset by increased product sales to and royalty revenues from licensees ($27 million), resulting from the opening of 520 net new licensed store openings over the past 12 months, improved comparable store sales, and incremental revenues from the ownership changes in australia and malaysia ($17 million) in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014.
operating expenses cost of sales including occupancy costs as a percentage of total net revenues decreased 380 basis points, primarily due to the impact of our ownership change in starbucks japan (approximately 230 basis points) and the shift in our cost of sales mix resulting from growth of company-operated stores, which have a higher gross margin (approximately 50 basis points). sales leverage (approximately 40 basis points) also contributed.
store operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenues increased 590 basis points. as a percentage of company-operated store revenues, store operating expenses increased 300 basis points, primarily driven by the impact of our ownership change in starbucks japan (approximately 410 basis points), partially offset by the sale of our australia retail operations in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 (approximately 70 basis points) and sales leverage (approximately 50 basis points).
other operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenues decreased 160 basis points. excluding the impact of company-operated store revenues, other operating expenses increased 540 basis points, primarily due to the impact of our ownership change in starbucks japan (approximately 350 basis points) as well as increased salaries and benefits largely due to increased headcount to support growth in our china market (approximately 150 basis points).
depreciation and amortization expenses as a percentage of total revenues increased 220 basis points, primarily due to the impact of our ownership change in starbucks japan (approximately 210 basis points).
general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues decreased 20 basis points, primarily due to sales leverage (approximately 40 basis points) and the impact of the sale of our australia retail operations in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 (approximately 20 basis points), which includes lapping professional fees associated with the sale. the impact of our ownership change in starbucks japan contributed unfavorably (approximately 60 basis points).
income from equity investees decreased $44 million, primarily due to the impact of our ownership change in starbucks japan and absence of income from our malaysia joint venture sold in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, partially offset by improved performance from our china joint venture. as a percentage of total net revenues, income from equity investees declined 950 basis points, primarily due to the impact of our ownership change in starbucks japan (approximately 870 basis points).
the overall decrease in operating margin of 1,210 basis points over fiscal 2014 was primarily driven by the impact of our ownership change in starbucks japan (approximately 1,410 basis points), partially offset by 200 basis points of margin expansion driven by the other items discussed above.

revenues emea total net revenues for fiscal 2015 decreased $78 million, or 6%. the decrease was primarily due to a decline in company-operated store revenues ($103 million), which was largely due to unfavorable foreign currency translation ($94 million). also contributing to the decrease in company-operated revenues was the shift to more licensed stores in the region, which includes net store closures as well as the absence of revenues from the conversion of certain stores in the u.k. from company-operated to licensed. this decline was partially offset by 4% growth in comparable store sales.
licensed store revenues increased $19 million, or 8%, primarily due to higher product sales to and royalty revenues from our licensees ($45 million), resulting from the opening of 238 net new licensed stores over the past 12 months and improved comparable store sales, partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation ($22 million).
operating expenses cost of sales including occupancy costs as a percentage of total net revenues decreased 210 basis points, primarily due to favorable foreign currency exchange (approximately 130 basis points). we buy and sell products, primarily roasted coffee, in multiple currencies throughout the region depending on the functional currency of each market. differences in those rates generated favorable foreign currency exchange for fiscal 2015 resulting in a benefit in cost of sales. sales leverage(approximately 40 basis points) also contributed to the decrease.
store operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenues decreased 290 basis points. as a percentage of company-operated store revenues, store operating expenses decreased 220 basis points primarily due to gains on the sales of certain store
assets in the region (approximately 150 basis points) as well as decreased expenses, largely salaries and benefits, driven by the shift to more licensed stores (approximately 40 basis points).
other operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenues increased 60 basis points. excluding the impact of company-operated store revenues, other operating expenses decreased 20 basis points, primarily driven by the gains on the sales of certain assets in the region (approximately 40 basis points) and improved collection results (approximately 20 basis points). these decreases were partially offset by increased costs to grow our non-retail operations in the region (approximately 50 basis points), largely driven by higher marketing costs.
the combination of these changes resulted in an overall increase in operating margin of 460 basis points over fiscal 2014.

financial condition, liquidity and capital resources cash and investment overview our cash and investments were $3.4 billion and $1.9 billion as of october 2, 2016 and september 27, 2015, respectively. we actively manage our cash and investments in order to internally fund operating needs, make scheduled interest and principal payments on our borrowings, make acquisitions, and return cash to shareholders through common stock cash dividend payments and share repurchases. our investment portfolio primarily includes highly liquid available-for-sale securities, including corporate debt securities, government treasury securities (foreign and domestic), mortgage and asset-backed securities, state and local government obligations and agency obligations. as of october 2, 2016, approximately $1.6 billion of cash and investments were held in foreign subsidiaries.
borrowing capacity in the first quarter of fiscal 2016, we replaced our 2013 credit facility with our new $1.5 billion unsecured, revolving 2016 credit facility (the "credit facility") with various banks, of which $150 million may be used for issuances of letters of credit.
the credit facility is available for working capital, capital expenditures and other corporate purposes, including acquisitions and share repurchases, and is currently set to mature on november 6, 2020. starbucks has the option, subject to negotiation and agreement with the related banks, to increase the maximum commitment amount by an additional $750 million. borrowings under the credit facility will bear interest at a variable rate based on libor, and, for u.s. dollar-denominated loans under certain circumstances, a base rate (as defined in the credit facility), in each case plus an applicable margin. the applicable margin is based on the better of (i) the company's long-term credit ratings assigned by moody's and standard & poor's rating agencies and (ii) the company's fixed charge coverage ratio, pursuant to a pricing grid set forth in the credit agreement. the current applicable margin is 0.565% for eurocurrency rate loans and 0.00% (nil) for base rate loans. the credit facility contains provisions requiring us to maintain compliance with certain covenants, including a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio, which measures our ability to cover financing expenses. as of october 2, 2016, we were in compliance with all applicable covenants. no amounts were outstanding under our credit facility as of october 2, 2016.
under our commercial paper program, we may issue unsecured commercial paper notes up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of $1 billion, with individual maturities that may vary but not exceed 397 days from the date of issue. amounts outstanding under the commercial paper program are required to be backstopped by available commitments under our credit facility discussed above. the proceeds from borrowings under our commercial paper program may be used for working capital needs, capital expenditures and other corporate purposes, including, but not limited to, business expansion, payment of cash dividends on our common stock and share repurchases.  as of october 2, 2016, we had no borrowings under our commercial paper program.
in may 2016, we issued long-term debt in an underwritten registered public offering, which consisted of $500 million of 10-year 2.450% senior notes (the "2026 notes") due june 2026. we will use the net proceeds from the offering to enhance our sustainability programs around coffee supply chain management through eligible sustainability projects. interest on the 2026 notes is payable semi-annually on june 15 and december 15 of each year, commencing on december 15, 2016.
in february 2016, we issued long-term debt in an underwritten registered public offering, which consisted of $500 million of 5-year 2.100% senior notes (the "2021 notes") due february 2021. in may 2016, we reopened this offering with the same terms and issued an additional $250 million of senior notes (collectively, the "2021 notes") for an aggregate amount outstanding of $750 million. interest on the 2021 notes is payable semi-annually on february 4 and august 4 of each year, commencing on august 4, 2016.
see note 9, debt, to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of part ii of this 10-k for details of the components of our long-term debt.
the indentures under which all of our senior notes were issued require us to maintain compliance with certain covenants, including limits on future liens and sale and leaseback transactions on certain material properties. as of october 2, 2016, we were in compliance with all applicable covenants.
use of cash we expect to use our available cash and investments, including, but not limited to, additional potential future borrowings under the credit facility and commercial paper program, to invest in our core businesses, including capital expenditures, new product innovations, related marketing support and partner and digital investments, return cash to shareholders through common stock cash dividend payments and share repurchases, as well as other new business opportunities related to our core businesses. further, we may use our available cash resources to make proportionate capital contributions to our investees. we may also seek strategic acquisitions to leverage existing capabilities and further build our business in support of our growth agenda. acquisitions may include increasing our ownership interests in our investees. any decisions to increase such ownership interests will be driven by valuation and fit with our ownership strategy.
we believe that future cash flows generated from operations and existing cash and investments both domestically and internationally will be sufficient to finance capital requirements for our core businesses in those respective markets as well as shareholder distributions for the foreseeable future. significant new joint ventures, acquisitions and/or other new business opportunities may require additional outside funding. we have borrowed funds domestically and continue to believe we have the ability to do so at reasonable interest rates; however, additional borrowings would result in increased interest expense in the future.
we consider the majority of undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries and equity investees as of october 2, 2016 to be indefinitely reinvested, and, accordingly, no u.s. income and foreign withholding taxes have been provided on such earnings. we have not, nor do we anticipate the need to, repatriate funds to the u.s. to satisfy domestic liquidity needs; however, in the event that we need to repatriate all or a portion of our foreign cash to the u.s., we would be subject to additional u.s. income taxes, which could be material. we do not believe it is practicable to calculate the potential tax impact of repatriation, as there is a significant amount of uncertainty around the calculation, including the availability and amount of foreign tax credits at the time of repatriation, tax rates in effect and other indirect tax consequences associated with repatriation.
during each of the first three quarters of fiscal 2015, we declared and paid a cash dividend to shareholders of $0.16 per share. in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 and each of the first three quarters of fiscal 2016 we declared a cash dividend of $0.20 per share. cash returned to shareholders through dividends in fiscal 2016 and 2015 totaled $1,178.0 million and $958.7 million, respectively. in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, we declared a cash dividend of $0.25 per share to be paid on december 2, 2016 with an expected payout of approximately $365.1 million.
during fiscal years 2016 and 2015, we repurchased 34.9 million and 29.0 million shares of common stock, respectively, or $2.0 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively, under our ongoing share repurchase program. on april 21, 2016, we announced that our board of directors approved an increase of 100 million shares to the program. including this additional authorization of 100 million shares, the number of remaining shares authorized for repurchase at october 2, 2016 totaled 117.8 million.
other than normal operating expenses, cash requirements for fiscal 2017 are expected to consist primarily of capital expenditures for new company-operated stores; remodeling and refurbishment of, and equipment upgrades for, existing company-operated stores; systems and technology investments in our stores and in the support infrastructure; and additional investments in manufacturing capacity. total capital expenditures for fiscal 2017 are expected to be approximately $1.6 billion.
cash flows cash provided by operating activities was $4.6 billion for fiscal 2016, compared to $3.7 billion for fiscal 2015. the change was primarily due to increased earnings, the lapping of the non-cash acquisition related gain for starbucks japan and the timing of our cash payments for income taxes.
cash used by investing activities totaled $2.2 billion for fiscal 2016, compared to $1.5 billion for fiscal 2015. the change was primarily due to the increase in purchases of investments, primarily government treasury securities and corporate debt securities, partially offset by the lapping of cash used to acquire sazaby's 39.5% ownership interest in starbucks japan.
cash used by financing activities for fiscal 2016 totaled $1.8 billion, compared to $2.3 billion for fiscal 2015. the change was primarily due to the lapping of long-term debt redemption in fiscal 2015, higher incremental proceeds from long-term debt issued in february and may 2016 over prior year's issuance and lapping of cash used to fund the second tender offer step of the starbucks japan acquisition. these reductions in cash used were partially offset by increased cash returned to shareholders through higher share repurchases and dividend payments compared to fiscal 2015.
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations and borrowings as of october 2, 2016, and the timing and effect that such commitments are expected to have on our liquidity and capital requirements in future periods (in millions):
(1)   income tax liabilities for uncertain tax positions were excluded as we are not able to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period of related future payments. as of october 2, 2016, we had $154.2 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions, which includes accrued interest and penalties.
(3)   purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on starbucks and that specify all significant terms. green coffee purchase commitments comprise 90% of total purchase obligations.
(4)   other obligations include other long-term liabilities primarily consisting of asset retirement obligations and hedging instruments.
starbucks currently expects to fund these commitments primarily with operating cash flows generated in the normal course of business.
off-balance sheet arrangements off-balance sheet arrangements relate to operating lease and purchase commitments detailed in the footnotes to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of part ii of this 10-k.
commodity prices, availability and general risk conditions commodity price risk represents starbucks primary market risk, generated by our purchases of green coffee and dairy products, among other items. we purchase, roast and sell high-quality arabica coffee and related products and risk arises from the price volatility of green coffee. in addition to coffee, we also purchase significant amounts of dairy products to support the needs of our company-operated stores. the price and availability of these commodities directly impacts our results of operations, and we expect commodity prices, particularly coffee, to impact future results of operations. for additional details see product supply in item 1, as well as risk factors in item 1a of this 10-k.
financial risk management market risk is defined as the risk of losses due to changes in commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates, equity security prices and interest rates. we manage our exposure to various market-based risks according to a market price risk management policy. under this policy, market-based risks are quantified and evaluated for potential mitigation strategies, such as entering into hedging transactions. the market price risk management policy governs how hedging instruments may be used to mitigate risk. risk limits are set annually and prohibit speculative trading activity. we also monitor and limit the amount of associated counterparty credit risk, which we consider to be low. in general, hedging instruments do not have maturities in excess of three years. refer to note 1, summary of significant accounting policies, and note 3, derivative financial instruments, to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of part ii of this 10-k for further discussion of our hedging instruments.
the sensitivity analyses disclosed below provide only a limited, point-in-time view of the market risk of the financial instruments discussed. the actual impact of the respective underlying rates and price changes on the financial instruments may differ significantly from those shown in the sensitivity analyses.
commodity price risk we purchase commodity inputs, primarily coffee, dairy products, diesel and other commodities, that are used in our operations and are subject to price fluctuations that impact our financial results. we use a combination of pricing features embedded within supply contracts, such as fixed-price and price-to-be-fixed contracts for coffee purchases, and financial derivatives to manage our commodity price risk exposure.
the following table summarizes the potential impact as of october 2, 2016 to starbucks future net earnings and other comprehensive income ("oci") from changes in commodity prices. the information provided below relates only to the hedging instruments and does not represent the corresponding changes in the underlying hedged items (in millions):

foreign currency exchange risk the majority of our revenue, expense and capital purchasing activities are transacted in u.s. dollars. however, because a portion of our operations consists of activities outside of the u.s., we have transactions in other currencies, primarily the canadian dollar, japanese yen, chinese renminbi, british pound, south korean won and euro. to reduce cash flow volatility from foreign currency fluctuations, we enter into derivative instruments to hedge portions of cash flows of anticipated intercompany royalty payments, inventory purchases, intercompany borrowing and lending activities and certain other transactions in currencies other than the functional currency of the entity that enters into the arrangements, as well as the translation risk of certain balance sheet items. see note 3, derivative financial instruments, to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of part ii of this 10-k for further discussion.
the following table summarizes the potential impact as of october 2, 2016 to starbucks future net earnings and other comprehensive income from changes in the fair value of these derivative financial instruments due to a change in the value of the u.s. dollar as compared to foreign exchange rates. the information provided below relates only to the hedging instruments and does not represent the corresponding changes in the underlying hedged items (in millions):

equity security price risk we have minimal exposure to price fluctuations on equity mutual funds and equity exchange-traded funds within our trading securities portfolio. trading securities are recorded at fair value with unrealized holding gains and losses recorded in interest income and other, net in the consolidated statements of earnings. our trading securities portfolio approximates a portion of our liability under our management deferred compensation plan ("mdcp"), which is included in accrued compensation and related costs, within accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. changes in our mdcp liability are recorded in general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of earnings.
we performed a sensitivity analysis based on a 10% change in the underlying equity prices of our investments as of october 2, 2016 and determined that such a change would not have a significant impact on the fair value of these instruments.
interest rate risk long-term debt we utilize short-term and long-term financing and may use interest rate hedges to manage our overall interest expense related to our existing fixed-rate debt, as well as to hedge the variability in cash flows due to changes in benchmark interest rates related to anticipated debt issuances. see note 3, derivative financial instruments and note 9, debt, to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of part ii of this 10-k for further discussion of our interest rate hedge agreements and details of the components of our long-term debt, respectively, as of october 2, 2016.
the following table summarizes the impact of a change in interest rates as of october 2, 2016 on the fair value of starbucks debt (in millions):

available-for-sale securities our available-for-sale securities comprise a diversified portfolio consisting mainly of investment-grade debt securities. the primary objective of these investments is to preserve capital and liquidity. available-for-sale securities are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. we do not hedge the interest rate exposure on our available-for-sale securities. we performed a sensitivity analysis based on a 100 basis point change in the underlying interest rate of our available-for-sale securities as of october 2, 2016 and determined that such a change would not have a significant impact on the fair value of these instruments.
application of critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are those that management believes are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and require the most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies may result in materially different amounts being reported under different conditions or using different assumptions.
our significant accounting policies are discussed in note 1, summary of significant accounting policies, to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of part ii of this 10-k. we believe that of our significant accounting policies, the following policies involve a higher degree of judgment and/or complexity.
we consider financial reporting and disclosure practices and accounting policies quarterly to ensure that they provide accurate and transparent information relative to the current economic and business environment. during the past three fiscal years, we have not made any material changes to the accounting methodologies used to assess the areas discussed below, unless noted otherwise.
property, plant and equipment and other finite-lived assets we evaluate property, plant and equipment and other finite-lived assets for impairment when facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying values of such assets may not be recoverable. when evaluating for impairment, we first compare the carrying value of the asset to the asset's estimated future undiscounted cash flows. if the estimated undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset, we determine if we have an impairment loss by comparing the carrying value of the asset to the asset's estimated fair value and recognize an impairment charge when the asset's carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value. the adjusted carrying amount of the asset becomes its new cost basis and is depreciated over the asset's remaining useful life.
long-lived assets are grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. for company-operated store assets, the impairment test is performed at the individual store asset group level. the fair value of a store's assets is estimated using a discounted cash flow model. for other long-lived assets, fair value is determined using an approach that is appropriate based on the relevant facts and circumstances, which may include discounted cash flows, comparable transactions, or comparable company analyses.
our impairment calculations contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate future cash flows and asset fair values. key assumptions used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values include projected revenue growth and operating expenses, as well as forecasting asset useful lives and selecting an appropriate discount rate. for company-operated stores, estimates of revenue growth and operating expenses are based on internal projections and consider the store's historical performance, the local market economics and the business environment impacting the store's performance. the discount rate is selected based on what we believe a buyer would assume when determining a purchase price for the store. these estimates are subjective and our ability to realize future cash flows and asset fair values is affected by factors such as ongoing maintenance and improvement of the assets, changes in economic conditions, and changes in operating performance.
during fiscal 2016, there were no significant changes in any of our estimates or assumptions that had a material impact on the outcome of our impairment calculations. however, as we periodically reassess estimated future cash flows and asset fair values, changes in our estimates and assumptions may cause us to realize material impairment charges in the future.
goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets we evaluate goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually during our third fiscal quarter, or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate that impairment may exist. when evaluating these assets for impairment, we may first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit or intangible asset group is impaired. if we do not perform a qualitative assessment, or if we determine that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit or intangible asset group exceeds its carrying amount, we calculate the estimated fair value of the reporting unit using discounted cash flows.
when assessing goodwill for impairment, our decision to perform a qualitative impairment assessment for an individual reporting unit in a given year is influenced by a number of factors, inclusive of the size of the reporting unit's goodwill, the significance of the excess of the reporting unit's estimated fair value over carrying value at the last quantitative assessment date, the amount of time in between quantitative fair value assessments and the date of acquisition. if we perform a quantitative assessment of an individual reporting unit's goodwill, our impairment calculations contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment when estimating future cash flows and asset fair values, including projected revenue growth and operating expenses related to existing businesses, product innovation and new store concepts, as well as selecting an appropriate discount rate. estimates of revenue growth and operating expenses are based on internal projections considering the reporting unit's past performance and forecasted growth, strategic initiatives, local market economics and the local business environment impacting the reporting unit's performance. the discount rate is selected based on the estimated cost of capital for a market participant to operate the reporting unit in the region. these estimates are highly subjective, and our ability to realize the future cash flows used in our fair value calculations is affected by factors such as the success of strategic initiatives, changes in economic conditions, changes in our operating performance and changes in our business strategies, including retail initiatives and international expansion.
when assessing indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment, where we perform a qualitative assessment, we evaluate if changes in events or circumstances have occurred that indicate that impairment may exist. if we do not perform a qualitative impairment assessment or if changes in events and circumstances indicate that a quantitative assessment should be performed, management is required to calculate the fair value of the intangible asset group. the fair value calculation includes estimates of revenue growth, which are based on past performance and internal projections for the intangible asset group's forecasted growth, and royalty rates, which are adjusted for our particular facts and circumstances. the discount rate is selected based on the estimated cost of capital that reflects the risk profile of the related business. these estimates are highly subjective, and our ability to achieve the forecasted cash flows used in our fair value calculations is affected by factors such as the success of
strategic initiatives, changes in economic conditions, changes in our operating performance and changes in our business strategies, including retail initiatives and international expansion.
for fiscal 2016, we determined the fair value of our material reporting units and intangible asset groups were significantly in excess of their carrying values. accordingly, we did not recognize any material impairment charges during the current fiscal year. during fiscal 2016, there were no significant changes in any of our estimates or assumptions that had a material impact on the outcome of our impairment calculations. however, as we periodically reassess estimated future cash flows and asset fair values, changes in our estimates and assumptions may cause us to realize material impairment charges in the future.
income taxes we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the respective tax bases of our assets and liabilities. deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using current enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which we expect the temporary differences to reverse. we routinely evaluate the likelihood of realizing the benefit of our deferred tax assets and may record a valuation allowance if, based on all available evidence, we determine that some portion of the tax benefit will not be realized. changes in tax laws and rates may affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities and our effective tax rate in the future; however, we do not expect changes from recently enacted tax laws to be material to the consolidated financial statements.
in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets within the jurisdiction from which they arise, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax-planning strategies, and results of operations. in projecting future taxable income, we consider historical results and incorporate assumptions about the amount of future state, federal and foreign pretax operating income adjusted for items that do not have tax consequences. our assumptions regarding future taxable income are consistent with the plans and estimates we use to manage our underlying businesses. in evaluating the objective evidence that historical results provide, we consider three years of cumulative operating income/(loss).
in addition, our income tax returns are periodically audited by domestic and foreign tax authorities. these audits include review of our tax filing positions, including the timing and amount of deductions taken and the allocation of income between tax jurisdictions. we evaluate our exposures associated with our various tax filing positions and recognize a tax benefit only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the relevant taxing authorities, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of our position. for uncertain tax positions that do not meet this threshold, we record a related liability. we adjust our unrecognized tax benefit liability and income tax expense in the period in which the uncertain tax position is effectively settled, the statute of limitations expires for the relevant taxing authority to examine the tax position or when new information becomes available. as discussed in note 13, income taxes, to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of part ii of this 10-k, there is a reasonable possibility that our unrecognized tax benefit liability will be adjusted within 12 months due to the expiration of a statute of limitations and expected consent from taxing authorities.
we have generated income in certain foreign jurisdictions that has not been subject to u.s. income taxes. we intend to reinvest these earnings for the foreseeable future. while we do not expect to repatriate cash to the u.s. to satisfy domestic liquidity needs, if these amounts were distributed to the u.s., in the form of dividends or otherwise, we would be subject to additional u.s. income taxes, which could be material. determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred income tax liabilities on these earnings is not practicable because such liability, if any, is dependent on circumstances existing if and when remittance occurs.
our income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities and liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits reflect management's best assessment of estimated current and future taxes to be paid. deferred tax asset valuation allowances and our liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits require significant management judgment regarding applicable statutes and their related interpretation, the status of various income tax audits and our particular facts and circumstances. although we believe that the judgments and estimates discussed herein are reasonable, actual results could differ, and we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material. to the extent we prevail in matters for which a liability has been established or are required to pay amounts in excess of our established liability, our effective income tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially affected.

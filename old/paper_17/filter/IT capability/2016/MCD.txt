item 1a. risk factors and cautionary statement regarding forward-looking statements the information in this report includes forward-looking statements about future events and circumstances and their effects upon revenues, expenses and business opportunities. generally speaking, any statement in this report not based upon historical fact is a forward-looking statement. forward-looking statements can also be identified by the use of forward-looking words, such as "may," "will," "expect," "believe" and "plan" or similar expressions. in particular, statements regarding our plans, strategies, prospects and expectations regarding our business and industry are forward-looking statements. they reflect our expectations, are not guarantees of performance and speak only as of the date of this report. except as required by law, we do not undertake to update them. our expectations (or the underlying assumptions) may change or not be realized, and you should not rely unduly on forward-looking statements. our business results are subject to a variety of risks, including those that are reflected in the following considerations and factors, as well as elsewhere in our filings with the sec. if any of these considerations or risks materialize, our expectations may change and our performance may be adversely affected.
if we do not successfully design and execute against our new business strategies within our new organization structure, we may not be able to increase operating income or market share.
to drive future results, we must design business strategies that are effective in delivering operating income growth. whether these strategies are successful depends mainly on our system's ability to:
•   continue to innovate and differentiate the mcdonald's experience in a way that balances value and convenience to our customers with profitability;
•   reinvest in our restaurants and identify and develop restaurant sites consistent with our plans for net growth of systemwide restaurants;
•   provide clean and friendly environments that deliver a consistent mcdonald's experience and demonstrate high service levels;
•   drive restaurant improvements that achieve optimal capacity, particularly during peak mealtime hours; and
•   manage the complexity of our restaurant operations.
if we are delayed or unsuccessful in executing our strategies, or if our strategies do not yield the desired results, our business, financial condition and results of operations may suffer.
the implementation of our turnaround plan may intensify the risks we face and may not be successful in achieving improved performance.
our turnaround plan includes an accelerated pace of refranchising, cost savings initiatives and global restructuring. as we continue to implement our plans, the existing risks we face in our business may be intensified. our efforts to reduce costs and capital expenditures depend, in part, upon our refranchising efforts, which, in turn, depend upon our ability to select qualified and capable franchisees and licensees. our cost savings initiatives also depend upon our ability to achieve efficiencies through the consolidation of global, back-office functions. therefore, if our turnaround-related initiatives are not successful, take longer to complete than initially projected, or are not well executed, or if our cost reduction efforts adversely impact our effectiveness, our business operations, financial results and results of operations could be adversely affected.
our investments to enhance the customer experience, including through technology, may not generate the expected returns.
we will continue to build upon our investments in experience of the future ("eotf"), which focus on restaurant modernization and technology and digital engagement in order to transform the restaurant experience. as we accelerate our pace of converting restaurants to eotf, we are placing renewed emphasis on our improving our service model and strengthening relationships with customers, in part through digital channels and loyalty initiatives. we may not fully realize the intended benefits of these significant investments and therefore our business results may suffer.
we face intense competition in our markets, which could hurt our business.
we compete primarily in the "informal eating out" (ieo) segment, which is highly competitive. we are facing sluggish restaurant industry trends in several key markets, including the u.s. we also face sustained, intense competition from traditional, fast casual and other competitors, which may include many non-traditional market participants such as convenience stores, grocery stores and coffee shops. we expect our environment to continue to be highly competitive, and our results in any particular reporting period may be impacted by new or continuing actions of our competitors, which may have a short- or long-term impact on our results.
we compete on the basis of product choice, quality, affordability, service and location. in particular, we believe our ability to compete successfully in the current market environment depends on our ability to improve existing products, develop new products, price our products appropriately, deliver a relevant customer experience, manage the complexity of our restaurant operations and respond effectively to our competitors' actions. recognizing these dependencies, we have intensified our focus in recent periods on strategies to achieve these goals, including the turnaround plan described above, and we will likely continue to modify our strategies and implement new strategies in the future. there can be no assurance these strategies will be effective, and some strategies may be effective at improving some metrics while adversely affecting other metrics.
if we do not anticipate and address evolving consumer preferences, our business could suffer.
our continued success depends on our system's ability to anticipate and respond effectively to continuously shifting consumer demographics, and trends in food sourcing, food preparation and consumer preferences in the ieo segment. in order to deliver a relevant experience for our customers amidst a highly competitive, value-driven operating environment, we must implement initiatives to adapt at an aggressive pace. there is no assurance that these initiatives will be successful and, if they are not, our financial results could be adversely impacted.
if pricing, promotional and marketing plans are not effective, our results may be negatively impacted.
our results depend on the impact of pricing, promotional and marketing plans across the system, and the ability to adjust these plans to respond quickly and effectively to evolving customer preferences, as well as shifting economic and competitive conditions. existing or future pricing strategies, and the value proposition they represent, are expected to continue to be important components of our business strategy; however, they may not be successful and could negatively impact sales and margins. further, the promotion of menu offerings may yield results below the desired levels.
additionally, we operate in a complex and costly advertising environment. our marketing and advertising programs may not be successful, and we may fail to attract and retain customers. our success depends in part on whether the allocation of our advertising and marketing resources across different channels allows us to reach our customers effectively. if the advertising and marketing programs are not successful, or are not as successful as those of our competitors, our sales, guest counts and market share could decrease.
failure to preserve the value and relevance of our brand could have a negative impact on our financial results.
to be successful in the future, we believe we must preserve, enhance and leverage the value of our brand. brand value is based in part on consumer perceptions. those perceptions are affected by a variety of factors, including the nutritional content and preparation of our food, the ingredients we use, our business practices and the manner in which we source the commodities we use. consumer acceptance of our offerings is subject to change for a variety of reasons, and some changes can occur rapidly. for example, nutritional, health and other scientific studies and conclusions, which constantly evolve and may have contradictory implications, drive popular opinion, litigation and regulation (including initiatives intended to drive consumer behavior) in ways that affect the ieo segment or perceptions of our brand generally or relative to available alternatives. consumer perceptions may also be affected by third parties presenting or promoting adverse commentary or portrayals of the quick-service category of the ieo segment, our brand and/or our operations, our suppliers or our franchisees. if we are unsuccessful in addressing such adverse commentary or portrayals, our brand and our financial results may suffer.
additionally, the ongoing relevance of our brand may depend on the success of our sustainability initiatives, which require system-wide coordination and alignment. if we are not effective in addressing social responsibility matters or achieving relevant sustainability goals, consumer trust in our brand may suffer. in particular, business incidents that erode consumer trust or confidence, particularly if such incidents receive considerable publicity or result in litigation, can significantly reduce brand value and have a negative impact on our financial results.
unfavorable general economic conditions could adversely affect our business and financial results.
our results of operations are substantially affected by economic conditions, which can vary significantly by market and can impact consumer disposable income levels and spending habits. economic conditions can also be impacted by a variety of factors including hostilities, epidemics and actions taken by governments to manage national and international economic matters, whether through austerity or stimulus measures or trade measures, and initiatives intended to control wages, unemployment, credit availability, inflation, taxation and other economic drivers. continued adverse economic conditions or adverse changes in economic conditions in our markets could pressure our operating performance, and our business and financial results may suffer.
our results of operations are also affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates, which may adversely affect reported earnings.
supply chain interruptions may increase costs or reduce revenues.
we depend on the effectiveness of our supply chain management to assure reliable and sufficient product supply, including on favorable terms. although many of the products we sell are sourced from a wide variety of suppliers in countries around the world, certain products have limited suppliers, which may increase our reliance on those suppliers. supply chain interruptions, including shortages and transportation issues, and price increases can adversely affect us as well as our suppliers and franchisees whose performance may have a significant impact on our results. such shortages or disruptions could be caused by factors beyond the control of our suppliers, franchisees or us. if we experience interruptions in our system's supply chain, our costs could increase and it could limit the availability of products critical to our system's operations.
4 mcdonald's corporation 2016 annual report food safety concerns may have an adverse effect on our business.
our ability to increase sales and profits depends on our system's ability to meet expectations for safe food and on our ability to manage the potential impact on mcdonald's of food-borne illnesses and food or product safety issues that may arise in the future. food safety is a top priority, and we dedicate substantial resources to ensure that our customers enjoy safe food products, including as our menu evolves. however, food safety events, including instances of food-borne illness, have occurred in the food industry in the past, and could occur in the future. instances of food tampering, food contamination or food-borne illness, whether actual or perceived, could adversely affect our brand and reputation as well as our revenues and profits.
our franchise business model presents a number of risks.
our success increasingly relies on the financial success and cooperation of our franchisees, yet we have limited influence over their operations. our restaurant margins arise from two sources: fees from franchised restaurants (e.g., rent and royalties based on a percentage of sales) and, to a lesser degree, sales from company-operated restaurants. our franchisees manage their businesses independently, and therefore are responsible for the day-to-day operation of their restaurants. the revenues we realize from franchised restaurants are largely dependent on the ability of our franchisees to grow their sales. if our franchisees do not experience sales growth, our revenues and margins could be negatively affected as a result. also, if sales trends worsen for franchisees, their financial results may deteriorate, which could result in, among other things, restaurant closures or delayed or reduced payments to us. our refranchising effort will increase that dependence and the effect of those factors.
our success also increasingly depends on the willingness and ability of our independent franchisees to implement major initiatives, which may include financial investment, and to remain aligned with us on operating, promotional and capital-intensive reinvestment plans. franchisees' ability to contribute to the achievement of our plans is dependent in large part on the availability to them of funding at reasonable interest rates and may be negatively impacted by the financial markets in general or by the creditworthiness of our franchisees or the company. our operating performance could also be negatively affected if our franchisees experience food safety or other operational problems or project an image inconsistent with our brand and values, particularly if our contractual and other rights and remedies are limited, costly to exercise or subjected to litigation. if franchisees do not successfully operate restaurants in a manner consistent with our required standards, the brand's image and reputation could be harmed, which in turn could hurt our business and operating results.
our ownership mix also affects our results and financial condition. the decision to own restaurants or to operate under franchise or license agreements is driven by many factors whose interrelationship is complex and changing. our ability to achieve the benefits of our refranchising strategy, which involves a shift to a greater percentage of franchised restaurants, in a timely manner or at all, will depend on various factors, including our ability to timely and effectively select franchisees and/or licensees that meet our rigorous standards and/or to complete transactions on favorable terms and to manage associated risks. it will also depend on the performance of our franchisees, and whether the resulting ownership mix supports our financial objectives.
challenges with respect to talent management could harm our business.
effective succession planning is important to our long-term success. failure effectively to identify, develop and retain key personnel, recruit high-quality candidates and ensure smooth management and personnel transitions could disrupt our business and adversely affect our results.
our success depends in part on our system's ability to recruit, motivate and retain a qualified workforce to work in our restaurants in an intensely competitive environment. increased costs associated with recruiting, motivating and retaining qualified employees to work in our company-operated restaurants could have a negative impact on our company-operated margins. similar concerns apply to our franchisees.
we are also impacted by the costs and other effects of compliance with u.s. and international regulations affecting our workforce, which includes our staff and employees working in our company-operated restaurants. these regulations are increasingly focused on employment issues, including wage and hour, healthcare, immigration, retirement and other employee benefits and workplace practices. our potential exposure to reputational and other harm regarding our workplace practices or conditions or those of our independent franchisees or suppliers (or perceptions thereof) could have a negative impact on consumer perceptions of us and our business. additionally, economic action, such as boycotts, protests, work stoppages or campaigns by labor organizations, could adversely affect us (including our ability to recruit and retain talent) or the franchisees and suppliers that are also part of the mcdonald's system and whose performance may have a material impact on our results.
changes in commodity and other operating costs could adversely affect our results of operations.
the profitability of our company-operated restaurants depends in part on our ability to anticipate and react to changes in commodity costs, including food, paper, supply, fuel, utilities, distribution and other operating costs. any volatility in certain commodity prices could adversely affect our operating results by impacting restaurant profitability. the commodity markets for some of the ingredients we use, such as beef and chicken, are particularly volatile due to factors such as seasonal shifts, climate conditions, industry demand, international commodity markets, food safety concerns, product recalls and government regulation, all of which are beyond our control and, in many instances, unpredictable. we can only partially address future price risk through hedging and other activities, and therefore increases in commodity costs could have an adverse impact on our profitability.
the global scope of our business subjects us to risks that could negatively affect our business.
we encounter differing cultural, regulatory and economic environments within and among the more than 100 countries where mcdonald's restaurants operate, and our ability to achieve our business objectives depends on the system's success in these environments. meeting customer expectations is complicated by the risks inherent in our global operating environment, and our global success is partially dependent on our system's ability to leverage operating successes across markets. planned initiatives may not have appeal across multiple markets with mcdonald's customers and could drive unanticipated changes in customer perceptions and guest counts.
disruptions in operations or price volatility in a market can also result from governmental actions, such as price, mcdonald's corporation 2016 annual report 5
foreign exchange or changes in trade-related tariffs or controls, government-mandated closure of our, our franchisees' or our suppliers' operations, and asset seizures. the cost and disruption of responding to governmental investigations or inquiries, whether or not they have merit, may impact our results and could cause reputational or other harm. our international success depends in part on the effectiveness of our strategies and brand-building initiatives to reduce our exposure to such governmental investigations or inquiries.
additionally, challenges and uncertainties are associated with operating in developing markets, which may entail a relatively higher risk of political instability, economic volatility, crime, corruption and social and ethnic unrest. such challenges may be exacerbated in many cases by a lack of an independent and experienced judiciary and uncertainties in how local law is applied and enforced, including in areas most relevant to commercial transactions and foreign investment. an inability to manage effectively the risks associated with our international operations could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.
we may also face challenges and uncertainties in developed markets. for example, as a result of the u.k.'s decision to leave the european union through a negotiated exit over a period of time, it is possible that there will be increased regulatory complexities, as well as potential referenda in the u.k. and/or other european countries, that could cause uncertainty in european or worldwide economic conditions. in the short term, the decision created volatility in certain foreign currency exchange rates, and the resulting depression in those exchange rates may continue. any of these effects, and others we cannot anticipate, could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
changes in tax laws and unanticipated tax liabilities could adversely affect the taxes we pay and our profitability.
we are subject to income and other taxes in the united states and foreign jurisdictions, and our operations, plans and results are affected by tax and other initiatives around the world. in particular, we are affected by the impact of changes to tax laws or policy or related authoritative interpretations, including to the extent that corporate tax reform becomes a key component of budgetary initiatives in the united states or elsewhere. we are also impacted by settlements of pending or any future adjustments proposed by taxing authorities outside of the u.s. or the irs in connection with our tax audits, all of which will depend on their timing, nature and scope. any increases in income tax rates, changes in income tax laws or unfavorable resolution of tax matters could have a material adverse impact on our financial results.
information technology system failures or interruptions or breaches of network security may interrupt our operations.
we are increasingly reliant on technological systems, such as point-of-sale and other in-store systems or platforms, as well as technologies that facilitate communication and collaboration internally, with affiliated entities, or with independent third parties to conduct our business, including technology-enabled solutions provided to us by third parties. any failure of these systems could significantly impact our operations and customer perceptions.
despite the implementation of security measures, those technology systems and solutions could become vulnerable to damage, disability or failures due to theft, fire, power loss, telecommunications failure or other catastrophic events. the third party solutions also present the risks faced by the third party's business. if those systems or solutions were to fail or otherwise be unavailable, and we were unable to recover in a timely way, we could experience an interruption in our operations.
furthermore, security breaches involving our systems, the systems of the parties we communicate or collaborate with, or those of third party providers may occur, such as unauthorized access, denial of service, computer viruses and other disruptive problems caused by hackers. our information technology systems contain personal, financial and other information that is entrusted to us by our customers and employees as well as financial, proprietary and other confidential information related to our business. an actual or alleged security breach could result in system disruptions, shutdowns, theft or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. the occurrence of any of these incidents could result in adverse publicity, loss of consumer confidence, reduced sales and profits, and criminal penalties or civil liabilities.
increasing regulatory complexity may adversely affect restaurant operations and our financial results.
our regulatory environment worldwide exposes us to complex compliance and similar risks that could affect our operations and results in material ways. in many of our markets, we are subject to increasing regulation, which has increased our cost of doing business. we are affected by the cost, compliance and other risks associated with the often conflicting and highly prescriptive regulations we face, including where inconsistent standards imposed by multiple governmental authorities can adversely affect our business and increase our exposure to litigation or governmental investigations or proceedings.
our success depends in part on our ability to manage the impact of new, potential or changing regulations that can affect our business plans and operations. these regulations include product packaging, marketing, the nutritional content and safety of our food and other products, labeling and other disclosure practices; and compliance efforts may be affected by ordinary variations in food preparation among our own restaurants and the need to rely on the accuracy and completeness of information from third-party suppliers (particularly given varying requirements and practices for testing and disclosure).
additionally, we are working to manage the risks and costs to us, our franchisees and our supply chain of the effects of climate change, greenhouse gases, and diminishing energy and water resources. these risks include the increased public focus, including by governmental and nongovernmental organizations, on these and other environmental sustainability matters, such as packaging and waste, animal health and welfare, deforestation and land use. these risks also include the increased pressure to make commitments, set targets or establish additional goals and take actions to meet them. these risks could expose us to market, operational and execution costs or risks. if we are unable to effectively manage the risks associated with our complex regulatory environment, it could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.
we are subject to increasing legal complexity and could be party to litigation that could adversely affect us.
increasing legal complexity will continue to affect our operations and results in material ways. we could be subject to legal proceedings that may adversely affect our business, including class actions, administrative proceedings, government investigations, employment and personal injury claims, landlord/tenant disputes, disputes with current or former suppliers, claims by current or former franchisees and intellectual property claims (including claims that we infringed another party's trademarks, copyrights or patents).
6 mcdonald's corporation 2016 annual report inconsistent standards imposed by governmental authorities can adversely affect our business and increase our exposure to regulatory proceedings or litigation.
litigation involving our relationship with franchisees and the legal distinction between our franchisees and us for employment law purposes, if determined adversely, could increase costs, negatively impact the business prospects of our franchisees and subject us to incremental liability for their actions. similarly, although our commercial relationships with our suppliers remain independent, there may be attempts to challenge that independence, which, if determined adversely, could also increase costs, negatively impact the business prospects of our suppliers, and subject us to incremental liability for their actions. we are also subject to legal and compliance risks and associated liability, such as in the areas of privacy and data collection, protection and management, as it relates to information we collect and share when we provide optional technology-related services and platforms to third parties.
•   the relative level of our defense costs, which vary from period to period depending on the number, nature and procedural status of pending proceedings;
•   the cost and other effects of settlements, judgments or consent decrees, which may require us to make disclosures or take other actions that may affect perceptions of our brand and products;
•   adverse results of pending or future litigation, including litigation challenging the composition and preparation of our products, or the appropriateness or accuracy of our marketing or other communication practices; and
a judgment significantly in excess of any applicable insurance coverage or third party indemnity could materially adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations. further, adverse publicity resulting from these claims may hurt our business.
we may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property or adequately ensure that we are not infringing the intellectual property of others, which could harm the value of the mcdonald's brand and our business.
the success of our business depends on our continued ability to use our existing trademarks and service marks in order to increase brand awareness and further develop our branded products in both domestic and international markets. we rely on a combination of trademarks, copyrights, service marks, trade secrets, patents and other intellectual property rights to protect our brand and branded products.
we have registered certain trademarks and have other trademark registrations pending in the united states and certain foreign jurisdictions. the trademarks that we currently use have not been registered in all of the countries outside of the united states in which we do business or may do business in the future and may never be registered in all of these countries. the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property in the united states and foreign countries may not be adequate. in addition, the steps we have taken may not adequately ensure that we do not infringe the intellectual property of others, and third parties may claim infringement by us in the future. in particular, we may be involved in intellectual property claims, including often aggressive or opportunistic attempts to enforce patents used in information technology systems, which might affect our operations and results. any claim of infringement, whether or not it has merit, could be time-consuming, result in costly litigation and harm our business.
we cannot ensure that franchisees and other third parties who hold licenses to our intellectual property will not take actions that hurt the value of our intellectual property.
changes in accounting standards or the recognition of impairment or other charges may adversely affect our future operations and results.
new accounting standards or changes in financial reporting requirements, accounting principles or practices, including with respect to our critical accounting estimates, could adversely affect our future results. we may also be affected by the nature and timing of decisions about underperforming markets or assets, including decisions that result in impairment or other charges that reduce our earnings. in assessing the recoverability of our long-lived assets, we consider changes in economic conditions and make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors. these estimates are highly subjective and can be significantly impacted by many factors such as global and local business and economic conditions, operating costs, inflation, competition, consumer and demographic trends, and our restructuring activities. if our estimates or underlying assumptions change in the future, we may be required to record impairment charges. if we experience any such changes, they could have a significant adverse effect on our reported results for the affected periods.
a decrease in our credit ratings or an increase in our funding costs could adversely affect our profitability.
our credit ratings may be negatively affected by our results of operations or changes in our debt levels.  as a result, our interest expense, the availability of acceptable counterparties, our ability to obtain funding on favorable terms, collateral requirements and our operating or financial flexibility could all be negatively affected, especially if lenders impose new operating or financial covenants.
our operations may also be impacted by regulations affecting capital flows, financial markets or financial institutions, which can limit our ability to manage and deploy our liquidity or increase our funding costs. if any of these events were to occur, they could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.
trading volatility and price of our common stock may be adversely affected by many factors.
many factors affect the volatility and price of our common stock in addition to our operating results and prospects. the most important of these factors, some of which are outside our control, are the following:
•   the continuing unpredictable global economic and market conditions;
•   governmental action or inaction in light of key indicators of economic activity or events that can significantly influence financial markets, particularly in the united states, which is the principal trading market for our common stock, and media reports and commentary about economic or other matters, even when the matter in question does not directly relate to our business;
•   trading activity in our common stock or trading activity in derivative instruments with respect to our common stock or debt securities, which can be affected by market commentary (including commentary that may be unreliable or incomplete); unauthorized disclosures about our performance, plans or expectations about our business; our actual performance and creditworthiness; investor confidence, driven in part by expectations about our mcdonald's corporation 2016 annual report 7
performance; actions by shareholders and others seeking to influence our business strategies; portfolio transactions in our stock by significant shareholders; or trading activity that results from the ordinary course rebalancing of stock indices in which mcdonald's may be included, such as the s&p 500 index and the dow jones industrial average;
•   the impact on our results of corporate actions and market and third-party perceptions and assessments of such actions, such as those we may take from time to time as we implement our strategies in light of changing business, legal and tax considerations and evolve our corporate structure.
our results and prospects can be adversely affected by events such as severe weather conditions, natural disasters, hostilities and social unrest, among others.
severe weather conditions, natural disasters, hostilities and social unrest, terrorist activities, health epidemics or pandemics (or expectations about them) can adversely affect consumer spending and confidence levels and supply availability and costs, as well as the local operations in impacted markets, all of which can affect our results and prospects. our receipt of proceeds under any insurance we maintain with respect to some of these risks may be delayed or the proceeds may be insufficient to cover our losses fully.
item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview description of the business the company franchises and operates mcdonald's restaurants. of the 36,899 restaurants in 120 countries at year-end 2016, 31,230 were franchised (reflects 21,559 franchised to conventional franchisees, 6,300 licensed to developmental licensees and 3,371 licensed to foreign affiliates ("affiliates")-primarily japan) and 5,669 were operated by the company.
under mcdonald's conventional franchise arrangement, franchisees provide a portion of the capital required by initially investing in the equipment, signs, seating and décor of their restaurant business, and by reinvesting in the business over time. the company generally owns the land and building or secures long-term leases for both company-operated and conventional franchised restaurant sites. this maintains long-term occupancy rights, helps control related costs and assists in alignment with franchisees enabling restaurant performance levels that are among the highest in the industry. in certain circumstances, the company participates in the reinvestment for conventional franchised restaurants in an effort to accelerate implementation of certain initiatives.
under mcdonald's developmental license arrangement, licensees provide capital for the entire business, including the real estate interest, and the company generally has no capital invested. in addition, the company has an equity investment in a limited number of affiliates that invest in real estate and operate or franchise restaurants within a market.
mcdonald's is primarily a franchisor and believes franchising is paramount to delivering great-tasting food, locally-relevant customer experiences and driving profitability. franchising enables an individual to be his or her own employer and maintain control over all employment-related matters, marketing and pricing decisions, while also benefiting from the financial strength and global experience of mcdonald's. however, directly operating restaurants is important to being a credible franchisor and provides company personnel with restaurant operations experience. in company-operated restaurants, and in collaboration with franchisees, mcdonald's further develops and refines operating standards, marketing concepts and product and pricing strategies, so that only those that the company believes are most beneficial are introduced in the restaurants. mcdonald's continually reviews its mix of company-operated and franchised restaurants to help optimize overall performance, with a goal to be approximately 95% franchised over the long term.
the company's revenues consist of sales by company-operated restaurants and fees from restaurants operated by franchisees. revenues from conventional franchised restaurants include rent and royalties based on a percent of sales along with minimum rent payments, and initial fees. revenues from restaurants licensed to affiliates and developmental licensees include a royalty based on a percent of sales, and generally include initial fees. fees vary by type of site, amount of company investment, if any, and local business conditions. these fees, along with occupancy and operating rights, are stipulated in franchise/license agreements that generally have 20-year terms.
the business is structured into the following segments that combine markets with similar characteristics and opportunities for growth, and reflect how management reviews and evaluates operating performance:
•   international lead markets - established markets including australia, canada, france, germany, the u.k. and related markets.
•   high growth markets - markets that the company believes have relatively higher restaurant expansion and franchising potential including china, italy, korea, the netherlands, poland, russia, spain, switzerland and related markets.
•   foundational markets &amp; corporate - the remaining markets in the mcdonald's system, each of which the company believes have the potential to operate under a largely franchised model. corporate activities are also reported within this segment.
for the year ended december 31, 2016, the u.s., international lead markets and high growth markets accounted for 34%, 29% and 25% of total revenues, respectively.
in analyzing business trends, management reviews results on a constant currency basis and considers a variety of performance and financial measures which are considered to be non-gaap, including comparable sales and comparable guest count growth, systemwide sales growth, return on incremental invested capital ("roiic"), free cash flow and free cash flow conversion rate, as described below.
•   constant currency results exclude the effects of foreign currency translation and are calculated by translating current year results at prior year average exchange rates. management reviews and analyzes business results in constant currencies and bases most incentive compensation plans on these results because the company believes this better represents its underlying business trends.
•   comparable sales and comparable guest counts are key performance indicators used within the retail industry and are indicative of the impact of the company's initiatives as well as local economic and consumer trends. increases or decreases in comparable sales and comparable guest counts represent the percent change in sales and transactions, respectively, from the same period in the prior year for all restaurants, whether operated by the company or franchisees, in operation at least thirteen months, including those temporarily closed. some of the reasons restaurants may be temporarily closed include reimaging or remodeling, rebuilding, road construction and natural disasters. comparable sales exclude the impact of currency translation. comparable sales are driven by changes in guest counts and average check, which is affected by changes in pricing and product mix. typically, pricing has a greater impact on average check than product mix. the goal is to achieve a relatively balanced contribution from both guest counts and average check.
•   systemwide sales include sales at all restaurants. while franchised sales are not recorded as revenues by the company, management believes the information is important in understanding the company's financial performance because these sales are the basis on which the company calculates and records franchised revenues and are indicative of the financial health of the franchisee base.
•   roiic is a measure reviewed by management over one-year and three-year time periods to evaluate the overall profitability of the markets, the effectiveness of capital deployed and the future allocation of capital. the return is calculated by dividing the change in operating income plus depreciation and amortization (numerator) by the cash used for investing activities (denominator), primarily capital expenditures. the calculation uses a constant average mcdonald's corporation 2016 annual report 13
foreign exchange rate over the periods included in the calculation.
•   free cash flow, defined as cash provided by operations less capital expenditures, and free cash flow conversion rate, defined as free cash flow divided by net income, are measures reviewed by management in order to evaluate the company's ability to convert net profits into cash resources, after reinvesting in the core business, that can be used to pursue opportunities to enhance shareholder value.
strategic direction and financial performance the strength of the alignment among the company, its franchisees and suppliers (collectively referred to as the "system") is key to mcdonald's long-term success. by leveraging the system, mcdonald's is able to identify, implement and scale ideas that meet customers' changing needs and preferences. mcdonald's continually builds on its competitive advantages of system alignment and geographic diversification to deliver consistent, yet locally-relevant restaurant experiences to customers as an integral part of their communities.
progress on the company's turnaround the turnaround plan, introduced in 2015, represented a significant step change in how mcdonald's operates and a recommitment to putting customers first. with an aspiration of being recognized by customers as a modern and progressive burger company, the company prioritized fewer, more strategic initiatives that focused on running better restaurants, driving operational growth, returning excitement to the brand and enhancing financial value.
building on these initial steps, the company made purposeful changes in 2016. the company continued to right-size the organization and put the appropriate talent in place by blending executives with deep mcdonald's experience with new executives to generate fresh energy and innovative ideas, while successfully executing against the key elements of its turnaround plan. as reflected by improved customer satisfaction measures across most of the major markets, customers have taken notice.
in addition to the customer-relevant changes in the restaurants, the company has enhanced financial value through its refranchising efforts, cost savings initiatives and cash return to shareholders, as follows:
•   refranchising - the company expects to achieve its refranchising target of 4,000 restaurants by the end of 2017, a full year ahead of the original target date, with a long-term goal to become approximately 95% franchised. since 2015, the company has pursued its refranchising goal through the expansion of its conventional franchisee base and the addition of new developmental licensees that bring strong strategic capabilities and financial resources that will enable accelerated expansion and innovation.
moving to a more heavily franchised business model will benefit the company's performance over the long term, as the rent and royalty income received from franchisees will provide a more predictable and stable revenue stream with significantly lower operating costs and risks. this model is less capital intensive as franchisees are responsible for reinvesting capital in their businesses.
•   cost savings - the company made meaningful progress towards its goal of reducing net g&amp;a levels by $500 million by the end of 2018 from the company's g&amp;a base of $2.6 billion at the beginning of 2015. actions taken in 2015 and 2016, including the redesign of the organization to eliminate layers and increase spans of control, more centralization of non-customer facing business processes and execution against its refranchising targets, have resulted in savings of more than $200 million.
•   cash return to shareholders - the strength and reliability of the company's significant and growing free cash flow, strong investment grade credit rating and continued access to credit provide the flexibility to fund capital expenditures as well as return cash to shareholders. by the end of 2016, the company achieved its three-year target of $30 billion cash return to shareholders. optimization of the company's capital structure by adding a meaningful amount of additional debt was instrumental in meeting this target.
2016 financial performance the company's progress in executing the turnaround plan is evident by its stronger business results, including the highest comparable sales growth since 2011. in mcdonald's heavily franchised business model, growing comparable sales is key to increasing operating income and returns. in 2016, global comparable sales increased 3.8%, including positive comparable sales across all segments. comparable guest counts were negative 0.3%, as positive guest traffic in the foundational markets and international lead markets was more than offset by negative guest traffic in the u.s. and high growth markets.
•   comparable sales in the u.s. increased 1.7%, due in part to a higher average check, while comparable guest counts declined 2.1% amidst continued industry softness. the growth in comparable sales was supported by all-day breakfast and everyday value under the mcpick 2 platform.
•   comparable sales in the international lead markets increased 3.4% and comparable guest counts increased 1.5%, reflecting solid comparable sales performance across most of the segment, led by the u.k.
•   in the high growth markets, comparable sales increased 2.8%, while comparable guest counts declined 0.8%. the increase in comparable sales reflected positive results across most of the segment, led by china.
•   comparable sales in the foundational markets increased 10.0% and comparable guest counts increased 1.9%, led by very strong performance in japan and certain markets in latin america, as well as solid results across the remainder of the segment.
in addition to improved comparable sales performance, the company achieved the following financial results in 2016:
•   consolidated revenues decreased 3% (flat in constant currencies) due to the impact of refranchising, partly offset by positive comparable sales.
•   capital expenditures of $1.8 billion were allocated mainly to reinvestment in existing restaurants and, to a lesser extent, to new restaurant openings. across the system, about 900
•   free cash flow was $4.2 billion and the company's free cash flow conversion rate was 90% (see reconciliation in exhibit 12).
•   one-year roiic was 62.7% and three-year roiic was 5.1% for the period ended december 31, 2016 (see reconciliation in exhibit 12).
•   the company increased its quarterly cash dividend per share by 6% to $0.94 for the fourth quarter, equivalent to an annual dividend of $3.76 per share.
•   the company returned $14.2 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases for the year, achieving the company's targeted return of $30 billion for the three-year period ended 2016.
strategic direction building on the momentum established in 2016, the company is beginning to shift focus from revitalizing the business to longer-term growth. the company will move with increased velocity to drive sustainable guest count growth, a reliable long-term measure of the company's strength that is vital to growing the company's sales and shareholder value.
in order to drive guest count growth in an ever-changing customer environment, the company developed a customer-centric growth strategy for 2017 and beyond, informed by deep customer research across multiple markets. the company's greatest opportunities are at the heart of the brand - in its food, value and customer experience - and within defined customer groups. this strategy is built on the following three pillars, which will position mcdonald's as a modern and progressive burger company that "makes delicious, feel good moments easy for everyone."
•   retaining existing customers. the company will renew its focus on areas where the company already has a strong foothold in the ieo, including family occasions and food-led breakfast.
•   regaining lost customers. the company plans to regain customers by recommitting to areas of historic strength, namely quality, convenience and value.
•   converting casual to committed customers. the company will focus on building stronger relationships with customers so they visit more often, by elevating and leveraging the mccafé coffee brand and enhancing snack and treat offerings.
the company will continue to build upon its investments in experience of the future ("eotf"), which focuses on restaurant modernization and technology, in order to transform the restaurant service experience. the company is also accelerating its pursuit of the following two initiatives designed to further drive growth.
•   digital. as the company accelerates its pace of converting restaurants to eotf, it is placing renewed emphasis on improving its existing service model (i.e., eat in, take out, or drive-thru) and strengthening its relationships with customers through technology. by evolving the technology platform, the company will simplify how customers order, pay and are served through additional functionality on its global mobile app, self-order kiosks and technology-driven models that enable table service and curb-side pick-up.
•   delivery. the company is accelerating its focus and investment on its delivery platform as a way to expand the convenience customers expect from mcdonald's. the company is conducting various pilot tests in the u.s., europe and asia and plans to scale quickly based on results of these pilots.
areas of focus by segment u.s.
while the u.s. has begun to build sales momentum, its greatest opportunity is guest count growth, by focusing on actions that collectively transform the customer experience.
a focus on food taste and quality will remain a key priority, including offering the company's best tasting burger. in 2017, the u.s. is planning to introduce its signature crafted offering, a premium platform focused on authentic ingredients that allows customers to customize their sandwiches. in addition, the u.s. will remain focused on strengthening its customer-relevant value proposition.
the u.s. expects to launch its mobile order and pay functionality as well as curbside pick-up across all traditional restaurants in the fourth quarter 2017. further, most of the system's traditional restaurants are expected to be converted to eotf by 2020. in addition, the u.s. will continue to test its delivery platform.
international lead markets the international lead markets are deepening their connection with customers and meeting their changing needs with meaningful enhancements in menu, accessibility and experience.
the segment is focused on providing quality, great taste, value and choice across the entire menu. entry-level value programs appeal to teens and young adults, while other platforms provide budget-conscious customers affordable meal bundles. programs across the segment are energizing the core menu, and every market has successfully extended into premium chicken and beef with locally relevant offerings. all of this is supported by modernized cooking and service platforms that expand capacity and enable hotter, fresher products. the segment will also remain focused on enhancing and expanding the mccafé coffee brand and pastry offerings.
the international lead markets continues to lead the mcdonald's system in the development and deployment of eotf.
high growth markets mcdonald's high growth markets have leveraged learnings from the international lead markets to enhance the customer experience through design, digital, people, menu innovation and value.
in addition to driving operational growth in existing restaurants, targeted new restaurant development and refranchising initiatives are top priorities. in early 2017, the company announced the planned sale of its businesses in china and hong kong to a developmental licensee.
foundational markets the foundational markets is a diverse group of markets that share common goals of enhancing the critical elements that differentiate mcdonald's - the menu and the customer experience. the segment is committed to running great restaurants and increasing convenience to customers, including through drive-thru and delivery. the foundational markets continue to pursue refranchising opportunities, including the sale of certain markets to developmental licensees. in early 2017, the company announced the planned sale of its businesses in the nordic markets (denmark, finland, norway and sweden) to a developmental licensee.
2017 outlook the following global and certain segment-specific information is provided to assist in forecasting the company's future results.
•   changes in systemwide sales are driven by comparable sales and net restaurant unit expansion. the company expects net restaurant additions to add approximately 1 percentage point to 2017 systemwide sales growth (in constant currencies).
•   the company does not generally provide specific guidance on changes in comparable sales. however, as a perspective, assuming no change in cost structure, a 1 percentage point change in comparable sales for either the u.s. or the international lead segment would change annual diluted earnings per share by about 4 to 5 cents.
•   with about 75% of mcdonald's grocery bill comprised of 10 different commodities, a basket of goods approach is the most comprehensive way to look at the company's commodity costs. for the full-year 2017, costs for the total basket of goods are expected to increase about 0.5-1.5% in the u.s. and increase about 2.0% in the international lead segment.
•   the company expects full-year 2017 selling, general and administrative expenses to decrease about 7-8%, in constant currencies with fluctuations expected between the quarters. this includes incentive-based compensation costs of less than $300 million.
•   based on current interest and foreign currency exchange rates, the company expects interest expense for the full-year 2017 to increase about 5-10% compared with 2016 due to higher average debt balances.
•   a significant part of the company's operating income is generated outside the u.s., and about 35% of its total debt is denominated in foreign currencies. accordingly, earnings are affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly the euro, british pound, australian dollar and canadian dollar. collectively, these currencies represent approximately 70% of the company's operating income outside the u.s. if all four of these currencies moved by 10% in the same direction, the company's annual diluted earnings per share would change by about 25 cents.
•   the company expects the effective income tax rate for the full-year 2017 to be in the 31-33% range. some volatility may result in a quarterly tax rate outside of the annual range.
•   the company expects capital expenditures for 2017 to be approximately $1.7 billion, about one-third of which will be used to open new restaurants. the company expects to open about 900 restaurants, including about 500 restaurants in affiliated and developmental licensee markets where the company generally does not fund any capital expenditures. the company expects net additions of about 400 restaurants. the remaining two-thirds of capital will be used to reinvest in existing locations, including about 650 reimages in the u.s. when combined with previously modernized restaurants that will be updated with eotf elements in 2017, we expect to have about 2,500 eotf restaurants in the u.s. by the end of 2017.
•   the company expects to refranchise about 4,000 restaurants in the three-year period ending 2017, with a long-term goal to become approximately 95% franchised.
•   the company expects to realize net annual g&amp;a savings of about $500 million from its g&amp;a base of $2.6 billion at the beginning of 2015. through the end of 2016, the company realized cumulative savings of more than $200 million and expects to realize the majority of its savings target by the end of 2017. beyond its $500 million reduction, the company expects to further reduce g&amp;a by 5-10% from the remaining g&amp;a base by the end of 2019. these targets exclude the impact of foreign currency changes.
•   the company expects capital expenditures to decline by approximately $500 million from the 2017 level of $1.7 billion, once the u.s. restaurant modernization work is substantially completed.
•   the company expects to return between $22 and $24 billion to shareholders for the three-year period ending 2019. this new target contemplates proceeds from future restaurant sales expected under its ongoing refranchising initiative. as the business grows, the company also expects to modestly increase its debt levels, while maintaining its credit metrics within current ranges.
long-term financial targets the company has established the following long-term, average annual (constant currency) financial targets, beginning in 2019, with variability expected during 2017 and 2018 due to the impact of refranchising:
•   earnings per share growth in the high-single digits; and

n/m not meaningful impact of foreign currency translation on reported results while changes in foreign currency exchange rates affect reported results, mcdonald's mitigates exposures, where practical, by purchasing goods and services in local currencies, financing in local currencies and hedging certain foreign-denominated cash flows.
foreign currency translation had a negative impact on consolidated operating results in each of the last three years. in 2016, results were negatively impacted by the weaker british pound as well as many other currencies. in 2015, results were negatively impacted by the weaker euro, australian dollar, russian ruble and most other currencies. in 2014, results were negatively impacted by the weaker russian ruble, australian dollar and certain other currencies, partly offset by the stronger british pound.

net income and diluted earnings per common share in 2016, net income increased 3% (6% in constant currencies) to $4.7 billion and diluted earnings per common share increased 13% (16% in constant currencies) to $5.44. foreign currency translation had a negative impact of $0.11 on diluted earnings per share.
in 2015, net income decreased 5% (increased 5% in constant currencies) to $4.5 billion and diluted earnings per common share was relatively flat (increased 10% in constant currencies) at $4.80. foreign currency translation had a negative impact of $0.50 on diluted earnings per share.
results in 2016 benefited from stronger operating performance and higher gains on sales of restaurant businesses, mostly in the u.s., while results in 2015 benefited from higher franchised margins and a gain on the strategic sale of a unique restaurant property in the u.s.
both 2016 and 2015 results were partly offset by net pre-tax impairment and other charges of $342 million and $307 million, respectively, primarily related to goodwill impairment and other asset write-offs in conjunction with the company's refranchising initiatives, restructuring and incremental restaurant closings. the 2015 charges combined with the gain on the strategic sale of a unique restaurant property in the u.s. had a net negative impact on diluted earnings per share of $0.18 in 2015, while the 2016 charges had a net negative impact on diluted earnings per share of $0.28 in 2016.
the company repurchased 92.3 million shares of its stock for $11.1 billion in 2016 and 61.8 million shares of its stock for $6.2 billion in 2015, driving reductions in weighted-average shares outstanding on a diluted basis in both periods, which positively benefited earnings per share.
revenues the company's revenues consist of sales by company-operated restaurants and fees from restaurants operated by franchisees. revenues from conventional franchised restaurants include rent and royalties based on a percent of sales, minimum rent payments and initial fees. revenues from franchised restaurants that are licensed to foreign affiliates and developmental licensees include a royalty based on a percent of sales, and generally include initial fees.
the company continues to accelerate the pace of refranchising to optimize its restaurant ownership mix, generate more stable and predictable revenue and cash flow streams, and operate with a less resource-intensive structure. the shift to a greater percentage of franchised restaurants negatively impacts consolidated revenues as company-operated sales are replaced by franchised sales, where the company receives rent and/or royalty revenue based on a percentage of sales.
in 2016, revenues decreased 3% (flat in constant currencies) due to the impact of refranchising, partly offset by positive comparable sales. in 2015, revenues decreased 7% (increased 3% in constant currencies), partly due to foreign currency translation. in constant currencies, revenue growth was driven by positive comparable sales and the benefit from expansion.

•   us: in 2016, the decrease in revenues reflected the impact of refranchising, partly offset by modestly positive comparable sales. in 2015, the decrease reflected the impact of refranchising.
•   international lead markets: in 2016, the decrease in revenues was due to the impact of refranchising, partly offset by strong comparable sales growth across most of the segment. in 2015, revenues decreased due to foreign currency translation. in constant currencies, revenues increased due to positive comparable sales performance, primarily in the u.k., australia and canada, partly offset by the impact of refranchising.
•   high growth markets: in 2016 and 2015, revenue growth was negatively impacted by foreign currency translation. in constant currencies, 2016 revenues increased due to positive comparable sales growth in china and most other markets, and continued expansion in russia. in constant currencies, 2015 revenues increased due to expansion and positive comparable sales, primarily driven by russia and china.

franchised margins franchised margin dollars represent revenues from franchised restaurants less the company's occupancy costs (rent and depreciation) associated with those sites. franchised margin dollars represented about 75% of the combined restaurant margins in 2016, 2015 and 2014.
in 2016, franchised margin dollars increased $331 million or 5% (6% in constant currencies). in 2015, franchised margin dollars decreased $297 million or 4% (increased 4% in constant currencies), due to foreign currency translation. for both 2016 and 2015, the constant currency increases were due to positive comparable sales performance, expansion and refranchising.
in connection with the company's refranchising initiatives, the company expects to refranchise about 4,000 restaurants for the three-year period ending 2017. while this refranchising activity may have a dilutive effect on the franchised margin percent, it typically results in higher franchised margin dollars.

•   u.s.: in 2016, the increase in the company-operated margin percent was due to a higher average check and lower commodity costs, partly offset by the impact of negative guest counts and higher labor costs. in 2015, the decrease was primarily due to the incremental investment in wages and benefits for eligible company-operated restaurant employees, effective july 1, 2015, designed to improve restaurant performance and enhance our employment proposition.
•   international lead markets: in 2016 and 2015, the increases in the company-operated margin percent were primarily due to positive comparable sales, partly offset by higher labor and occupancy costs. in 2015, the margin percent also benefited from refranchising efforts.
•   high growth markets: in 2016, the increase in the company-operated margin percent was primarily due to positive comparable sales and improved restaurant profitability in china, which benefited from recent value-added tax ("vat") reform, partly offset by higher labor costs across the segment. in 2015, the decrease was primarily due to the negative impact from currency and inflationary pressures in russia, and higher labor and occupancy costs across the segment. this was partly offset by the benefit from recovery in china from a 2014 supplier issue.

selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of systemwide sales was 2.8% in 2016, 2.9% in 2015 and 2.8% in 2014. management believes that analyzing selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of systemwide sales is meaningful because these costs are incurred to support the overall mcdonald's business.
in connection with our turnaround plan, the company established a net selling, general and administrative savings target of $500 million to be achieved by the end of 2018, excluding the effects of any foreign currency changes. these savings represent a reduction of about 20% from our selling, general and administrative base of $2.6 billion at the beginning of 2015. this base included incentive-based compensation of approximately $330 million, which assumed achievement of planned operating performance. in 2014, the lower incentive-based compensation reflected nominal payouts for the company's short-term cash bonus program.

(1)   primarily corporate equipment and other office-related expenditures new restaurant investments in all years were concentrated in markets with strong returns or opportunities for long-term growth. average development costs vary widely by market depending on the types of restaurants built and the real estate and construction costs within each market. these costs, which include land, buildings and equipment, are managed through the use of optimally-sized restaurants, construction and design efficiencies, and leveraging best practices. although the company is not responsible for all costs for every restaurant opened, total development costs (consisting of land, buildings and equipment) for new traditional mcdonald's restaurants in the u.s. averaged approximately $3.4 million in 2016.
the company owned approximately 45% of the land and about 70% of the buildings for restaurants in its consolidated markets at year-end 2016 and 2015.
share repurchases and dividends in 2016, the company returned $14.2 billion to shareholders through a combination of shares repurchased and dividends paid, marking the achievement of the company's targeted return of $30 billion for the three-year period ended 2016.

in december 2015, the company's board of directors approved a $15 billion share repurchase program, effective january 1, 2016, with no specified expiration date. in 2016, approximately 92.3 million shares were repurchased for $11.1 billion under the program.
the company has paid dividends on its common stock for 41 consecutive years and has increased the dividend amount every year. the 2016 full year dividend of $3.61 per share reflects the quarterly dividend paid for each of the first three quarters of $0.89 per share, with an increase to $0.94 per share paid in the fourth quarter. this 6% increase in the quarterly dividend equates to a $3.76 per share annual dividend and reflects the company's confidence in the ongoing strength and reliability of its cash flow. as in the past, future dividend amounts will be considered after reviewing profitability expectations and financing needs, and will be declared at the discretion of the company's board of directors.
financial position and capital resources total assets and returns total assets decreased $6.9 billion or 18% in 2016 primarily due to lower cash and equivalents. nearly 85% of total assets were in the u.s., international lead markets and high growth markets at year-end 2016. net property and equipment decreased $1.9 billion in 2016, primarily due to the impact of depreciation and the reclass of the assets of china, hong kong, and taiwan markets to assets of businesses held for sale, partly offset by capital expenditures. net property and equipment represented about 70% of total assets at year end.
operating income and month-end asset balances are used to compute return on average assets. for the years ended 2016, 2015 and 2014, return on average assets was 23.0%, 20.9% and 21.8%, respectively.
in 2016, return on average assets increased due to higher operating income and lower average assets. in 2015, return on average assets decreased primarily due to the negative impact of foreign currency translation on operating income, partly offset by lower average assets. operating income does not include interest income; however, cash balances are included in average assets. the inclusion of cash balances in average assets reduced return on average assets by about three percentage points for all years presented.
financing and market risk the company generally borrows on a long-term basis and is exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations. debt obligations at december 31, 2016 totaled $26.0 billion, compared with $24.1 billion at december 31, 2015. the net increase in 2016 was primarily due to net long-term issuances of $2.7 billion.

in managing the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations, the company uses interest rate swaps and finances in the currencies in which assets are denominated. the company uses foreign currency debt and derivatives to hedge the foreign currency risk associated with certain royalties, intercompany financings and long-term investments in foreign subsidiaries and affiliates. this reduces the impact of fluctuating foreign currencies on cash flows and shareholders' equity. total foreign currency-denominated debt was $8.9 billion and $7.0 billion for the years ended december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. in addition, where practical, the company's restaurants purchase goods and services in local currencies resulting in natural hedges. see the summary of significant accounting policies note to the consolidated financial statements related to financial instruments and hedging activities for additional information regarding the accounting impact and use of derivatives.
the company does not have significant exposure to any individual counterparty and has master agreements that contain netting arrangements. certain of these agreements also require each party to post collateral if credit ratings fall below, or aggregate exposures exceed, certain contractual limits. at december 31, 2016, the company was required to post an immaterial amount of collateral due to negative fair value of certain
24 mcdonald's corporation 2016 annual report derivative positions. the company's counterparties were not required to post collateral on any derivative position, other than on hedges of certain of the company's supplemental benefit plan liabilities where the counterparties were required to post collateral on their liability positions.
the company's net asset exposure is diversified among a broad basket of currencies. the company's largest net asset exposures (defined as foreign currency assets less foreign currency liabilities) at year end were as follows:
foreign currency net asset exposures in millions of u.s. dollars        2016            2015
british pounds sterling           1,340           1,333
the company prepared sensitivity analyses of its financial instruments to determine the impact of hypothetical changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates on the company's results of operations, cash flows and the fair value of its financial instruments. the interest rate analysis assumed a one percentage point adverse change in interest rates on all financial instruments, but did not consider the effects of the reduced level of economic activity that could exist in such an environment. the foreign currency rate analysis assumed that each foreign currency rate would change by 10% in the same direction relative to the u.s. dollar on all financial instruments; however, the analysis did not include the potential impact on revenues, local currency prices or the effect of fluctuating currencies on the company's anticipated foreign currency royalties and other payments received from the markets. based on the results of these analyses of the company's financial instruments, neither a one percentage point adverse change in interest rates from 2016 levels nor a 10% adverse change in foreign currency rates from 2016 levels would materially affect the company's results of operations, cash flows or the fair value of its financial instruments.
liquidity the company has significant operations outside the u.s. where we earn about 60% of our operating income. a significant portion of these historical earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested in foreign jurisdictions where the company has made, and will continue to make, substantial investments to support the ongoing development and growth of our international operations. accordingly, no u.s. federal or state income taxes have been provided on these undistributed foreign earnings. the company's cash and equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries totaled approximately $663 million as of december 31, 2016. we do not intend, nor do we foresee a need, to repatriate these funds.
consistent with prior years, we expect existing domestic cash and equivalents, domestic cash flows from operations, annual repatriation of a portion of the current period's foreign earnings, and the issuance of domestic debt to continue to be sufficient to fund our domestic operating, investing, and financing activities. we also continue to expect existing foreign cash and equivalents and foreign cash flows from operations to be sufficient to fund our foreign operating, investing, and financing activities.
in the future, should we require more capital to fund activities in the u.s. than is generated by our domestic operations and is available through the issuance of domestic debt, we could elect to repatriate a greater portion of future periods' earnings from foreign jurisdictions. this could also result in a higher effective tax rate in the future.
while the likelihood is remote, to the extent foreign cash is available, the company could also elect to repatriate earnings from foreign jurisdictions that have previously been considered to be indefinitely reinvested. upon distribution of those earnings in the form of dividends or otherwise, the company may be subject to additional u.s. income taxes (net of an adjustment for foreign tax credits), which could result in a use of cash. this could also result in a higher effective tax rate in the period in which such a determination is made to repatriate prior period foreign earnings. refer to the income taxes note to the consolidated financial statements for further information related to our income taxes and the undistributed earnings of the company's foreign subsidiaries.
contractual obligations and commitments the company has long-term contractual obligations primarily in the form of lease obligations (related to both company-operated and franchised restaurants) and debt obligations. in addition, the company has long-term revenue and cash flow streams that relate to its franchise arrangements. cash provided by operations (including cash provided by these franchise arrangements) along with the company's borrowing capacity and other sources of cash will be used to satisfy the obligations. the following table summarizes the company's contractual obligations and their aggregate maturities as well as future minimum rent payments due to the company under existing franchise arrangements as of december 31, 2016. see discussions of cash flows and financial position and capital resources as well as the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further details.
(1)   includes future minimum lease payments for businesses in markets considered held for sale as of the date of the company's filing of this report on form 10-k. these lease payments per year (in millions) are as follows: 2017- $251.1; 2018- $206.7; 2019- $178.6; 2020- $157.3; 2021- $136.4; thereafter- $593.3.
(2)   the maturities include reclassifications of short-term obligations to long-term obligations of $2.5 billion, as they are supported by a long-term line of credit agreement expiring in december 2019. debt obligations do not include the impact of noncash fair value hedging adjustments, deferred debt costs, and accrued interest.
(3)   includes future gross minimum rent payments due to the company from businesses in markets considered held for sale as of the date of the company's filing of this report on form 10-k. these rent payments per year (in millions) are as follows: 2017- $91.8; 2018- $90.6; 2019- $87.2; 2020- $84.5; 2021- $81.3; thereafter- $589.2.
in the u.s., the company maintains certain supplemental benefit plans that allow participants to (i) make tax-deferred contributions and (ii) receive company-provided allocations that cannot be made under the qualified benefit plans because of internal revenue service ("irs") limitations. at december 31, 2016, total liabilities for the supplemental plans were $465 million.
in addition, total liabilities for gross unrecognized tax benefits were $924 million at december 31, 2016.
there are certain purchase commitments that are not recognized in the consolidated financial statements and are primarily related to construction, inventory, energy, marketing and other service related arrangements that occur in the normal course of business, and timing of such payments are not mcdonald's corporation 2016 annual report 25
estimable or determinable. the amounts related to these commitments are not significant to the company's financial position. such commitments are generally shorter term in nature and will be funded from operating cash flows.
other matters critical accounting policies and estimates management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon the company's consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the u.s. the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses as well as related disclosures. on an ongoing basis, the company evaluates its estimates and judgments based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. actual results may differ from these estimates.
the company reviews its financial reporting and disclosure practices and accounting policies quarterly to ensure that they provide accurate and transparent information relative to the current economic and business environment. the company believes that of its significant accounting policies, the following involve a higher degree of judgment and/or complexity:
•   property and equipment property and equipment are depreciated or amortized on a straight-line basis over their useful lives based on management's estimates of the period over which the assets will generate revenue (not to exceed lease term plus options for leased property). the useful lives are estimated based on historical experience with similar assets, taking into account anticipated technological or other changes. the company periodically reviews these lives relative to physical factors, economic factors and industry trends. if there are changes in the planned use of property and equipment, or if technological changes occur more rapidly than anticipated, the useful lives assigned to these assets may need to be shortened, resulting in the accelerated recognition of depreciation and amortization expense or write-offs in future periods.
•   businesses held for sale assets and liabilities of businesses held for sale on the consolidated balance sheet primarily consist of balances related to businesses in china and hong kong. in december 2016, the company's board of directors approved an agreement for the company to sell its existing businesses in china and hong kong, which comprise over 2,600 restaurants, to a developmental licensee organization. under the terms of the agreement, the company will retain a 20% ownership in the business. the company expects to complete the sale and licensing transaction mid-year 2017, subject to satisfaction of customary conditions, including receipt of any regulatory approvals.
based on approval by the board of directors, the company concluded that these markets were "held for sale" as of december 31, 2016 in accordance with the requirements of asc 360 "property, plant and equipment". accordingly, the company has ceased recording depreciation expense with respect to the assets of the china and hong kong markets effective january 1, 2017. as of december 31, 2016, total assets relating to businesses in china and hong kong were $1.3 billion, of which $217 million was current, and total liabilities were $592 million, most of which was current.
as a result of this sale, the company expects to record a gain of approximately $700-$900 million reflecting the difference between the net book value of the businesses and an estimated $1.5 billion of cash proceeds to be received at closing, subject to adjustments.
•   share-based compensation the company has a share-based compensation plan which authorizes the granting of various equity-based incentives including stock options and restricted stock units ("rsus") to employees and nonemployee directors. the expense for these equity-based incentives is based on their fair value at date of grant and generally amortized over their vesting period. the company estimates forfeitures when determining the amount of compensation costs to be recognized in each period.
the fair value of each stock option granted is estimated on the date of grant using a closed-form pricing model. the pricing model requires assumptions, which impact the assumed fair value, including the expected life of the stock option, the risk-free interest rate, expected volatility of the company's stock over the expected life and the expected dividend yield. the company uses historical data to determine these assumptions and if these assumptions change significantly for future grants, share-based compensation expense will fluctuate in future years. the fair value of each rsu granted is equal to the market price of the company's stock at date of grant less the present value of expected dividends over the vesting period.
•   long-lived assets impairment review long-lived assets (including goodwill) are reviewed for impairment annually in the fourth quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. in assessing the recoverability of the company's long-lived assets, the company considers changes in economic conditions and makes assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors. estimates of future cash flows are highly subjective judgments based on the company's experience and knowledge of its operations. these estimates can be significantly impacted by many factors including changes in global and local business and economic conditions, operating costs, inflation, competition, and consumer and demographic trends. a key assumption impacting estimated future cash flows is the estimated change in comparable sales. if the company's estimates or underlying assumptions change in the future, the company may be required to record impairment charges. based on the annual goodwill impairment test, conducted in the fourth quarter, approximately 5-10% of goodwill may be at risk of future impairment as the fair values of certain reporting units were not substantially in excess of their carrying amounts.
•   litigation accruals in the ordinary course of business, the company is subject to proceedings, lawsuits and other claims primarily related to competitors, customers, employees, franchisees, government agencies, intellectual property, shareholders and suppliers. the company is required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses. a determination of the amount of accrual required, if any, for these contingencies is made after careful analysis of each matter. the required accrual may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in approach such as a change in settlement strategy in dealing with these matters. the company does not believe that any such matter currently being reviewed will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations.
•   income taxes the company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred assets will not be realized. while the company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax strategies, including the sale of appreciated assets, in assessing the need for the valuation allowance, if these estimates and assumptions change in the future, the company may be required to adjust its valuation allowance. this could result in a charge to, or an increase in, income in the period such determination is made.
the company operates within multiple taxing jurisdictions and is subject to audit in these jurisdictions. the company records accruals for the estimated outcomes of these audits, and the accruals may change in the future due to new developments in each matter.
in 2016, the company increased the balance of unrecognized tax benefits related to tax positions taken in prior years by $150 million. in 2015, the company decreased the balance of unrecognized tax benefits related to settlements with taxing authorities by $258 million. see the income taxes footnote in the consolidated financial statements for the related tax reconciliations. the most significant new developments in 2015 and 2016 are described below.
in 2015, the company received an unfavorable decision related to its procedural efforts to appeal a prior year unfavorable lower tax court ruling in a foreign tax jurisdiction related to exempt income matters. as a result of this new information, the company agreed to settle the issue for 2003-2008 with the tax authorities and the unrecognized tax benefits were reduced by $143 million. no cash payment was made related to this settlement in 2015 as the company had previously made a payment to the taxing authority. the settlement did not have a material impact on the company's cash flows, results of operations or financial position. in 2016, the unrecognized tax benefits related to this issue for 2009-2010 were reduced by $57 million as a result of the lapsing of the statute of limitations.
in 2015, the internal revenue service ("irs") issued a revenue agent report for certain agreed adjustments related to the company's u.s. federal income tax returns for 2009 and 2010 and the balance of unrecognized tax benefits was reduced by $102 million. also in 2015, the company filed a protest with the irs appeals office related to certain disagreed transfer pricing matters related to the company's u.s. federal income tax returns for 2009 and 2010. as of december 31, 2016, the company had not yet received a response to this protest from the irs. the company expects resolution on these issues in either 2017 or 2018. in addition, the company's 2011 and 2012 u.s. federal income tax returns are currently under examination and the completion of the field audit is expected in 2017.
in 2016, the company received new information during the progression of tax audits in multiple foreign tax jurisdictions. as a result of this new information, the company changed its judgment on the measurement of the related unrecognized tax benefits and recorded an increase in the gross unrecognized tax benefits of $125 million.
in december 2015, the european commission opened a formal investigation directly with the luxembourg government to examine whether decisions by the tax authorities in luxembourg with regard to the corporate income tax paid by certain of our subsidiaries comply with european union rules on state aid. if this matter is adversely resolved, luxembourg may be required to assess, and the company may be required to pay, additional amounts with respect to current and prior periods and our taxes in the future could increase. as of december 31, 2016, no decision has been published with respect to this investigation.
while the company cannot predict the ultimate resolution of the aforementioned tax matters, we believe that the liabilities recorded are appropriate and adequate as determined in accordance with topic 740 - income taxes of the accounting standards codification ("asc").
deferred u.s. income taxes have not been recorded for temporary differences totaling $16.0 billion related to investments in certain foreign subsidiaries and corporate affiliates. the temporary differences consist primarily of undistributed earnings that are considered permanently invested in operations outside the u.s. if management's intentions change in the future, deferred taxes may need to be provided.
effects of changing prices-inflation the company has demonstrated an ability to manage inflationary cost increases effectively. this ability is because of rapid inventory turnover, the ability to adjust menu prices, cost controls and substantial property holdings, many of which are at fixed costs and partly financed by debt made less expensive by inflation.

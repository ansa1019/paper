item 1a risk factors forward-looking statements and risk factors this annual report on form 10-k contains forward-looking statements. all statements in this report, other than statements that are purely historical, are forward-looking statements. words such as "expect," "anticipate," "intend," "plan," "believe," "forecast," "estimate," "seek," and similar expressions also identify forward-looking statements. in this report, forward-looking statements include, without limitation, the following:
•   our expectations and beliefs regarding future conduct and growth of the business;
•   our beliefs and expectations regarding seasonality, competition and other trends that affect our business;
•   our expectation that we will solve problems faster and more efficiently for our growing base of customers by moving to more open platforms with application programming interfaces that enable the contributions of end users and third-party developers;
•   our expectation that we will continue to invest significant resources in our product development, marketing and sales capabilities;
•   our expectation that we will continue to invest significant management attention and resources in our information technology infrastructure and in our privacy and security capabilities;

•   our belief that our cash and cash equivalents, investments and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our seasonal working capital needs, capital expenditure requirements, contractual obligations, debt service requirements and other liquidity requirements associated with our operations for at least the next 12 months;
•   our assessments and beliefs regarding the future outcome of pending legal proceedings and inquiries by regulatory authorities, the liability, if any, that intuit may incur as a result of those proceedings and inquiries, and the impact of any potential losses associated with such proceedings or inquiries on our financial statements.
tables of contents we caution investors that forward-looking statements are only predictions based on our current expectations about future events and are not guarantees of future performance. we encourage you to read carefully all information provided in this report and in our other filings with the sec before deciding to invest in our stock or to maintain or change your investment. these forward-looking statements are based on information as of the filing date of this annual report, and we undertake no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statement for any reason.
because forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, there are important factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. these factors include the following:
we face intense competitive pressures that may harm our operating results.
we face intense competition in all of our businesses, and we expect competition to remain intense in the future. our competitors and potential competitors range from large and established entities to emerging start-ups. our competitors may introduce superior products and services, reduce prices, have greater technical, marketing and other resources, have greater name recognition, have larger installed bases of customers, have well-established relationships with our current and potential customers, advertise aggressively or beat us to market with new products and services. in addition, we may face competition from existing companies, with large established consumer user-bases and broad-based platforms, who may change or expand the focus of their business strategies and marketing to target our customers, including small businesses and tax customers. we also face intensified competition from providers of free accounting, tax, payments, and other financial services. in order to compete, we have also introduced free offerings in several categories, but we may not be able to attract customers or effectively monetize all of these offerings, and customers who have formerly paid for intuit's products and services may elect to use free offerings instead. these competitive factors may diminish our revenue and profitability, and harm our ability to acquire and retain customers.
our consumer tax business also faces significant competition from the public sector, where we face the risk of federal and state taxing authorities developing software or other systems to facilitate tax return preparation and electronic filing at no charge to taxpayers. these or similar programs may be introduced or expanded in the future, which may cause us to lose customers and revenue. although the free file alliance has kept the federal government from being a direct competitor to intuit's tax offerings, it has fostered additional online competition and may cause us to lose significant revenue opportunities. the current agreement with the free file alliance is scheduled to expire in october 2020. we anticipate that governmental encroachment at both the federal and state levels may present a continued competitive threat to our business for the foreseeable future.
future revenue growth depends upon our ability to adapt to technological change as well as global trends in the way customers access consumer software offerings and successfully introduce new and enhanced products, services and business models.
online offerings, desktop software and mobile technology industries are characterized by rapidly changing technology, evolving industry standards and frequent new product introductions. as we continue to grow our online, mobile, and other offerings, we must continue to innovate and develop new products and features to meet changing customer needs and attract and retain talented software developers. we need to continue to develop our skills, tools and capabilities to capitalize on existing and emerging technologies, which require us to devote significant resources.
our consumer and professional tax businesses depend significantly on revenue from customers who return each year to use our updated tax preparation and filing software and services. as our existing products mature, encouraging customers to purchase product upgrades becomes more challenging unless new product releases provide features and functionality that have meaningful incremental value. if we are not able to develop and clearly demonstrate the value of new or upgraded products or services to our customers, our revenues may be harmed. in addition, as we continue to introduce and expand our new business models, including offerings that are free to end users, we may be unsuccessful in monetizing or increasing customer adoption of these offerings.
the number of people who access products and services through devices other than personal computers, including mobile phones, smartphones, and handheld computers such as tablets, continues to increase. we have devoted significant resources to develop products and services for users of these alternative devices, but the versions of our products and services developed for these devices may not be compelling to users. even if we are able to attract new users through these mobile offerings, the amount of revenue that we derive per user from mobile offerings may be less than the revenue that we have historically derived from users of personal computers. as new devices and new platforms are continually being released, it is difficult to predict the problems we may encounter in developing versions of our products and services for use on these alternative devices and we may need to devote significant resources to the creation, support, and maintenance of such offerings. if we are slow to develop products and technologies that are compatible with these alternative devices, or if our competitors are able to achieve those
tables of contents results more quickly than us, we will fail to capture a significant share of an increasingly important portion of the market for online services, which could adversely affect our business.
in some cases, we may expend a significant amount of resources and management attention on offerings that do not ultimately succeed in their markets. we have encountered difficulty in launching new products and services in the past. if we misjudge customer needs in the future, our new products and services may not succeed and our revenues and earnings may be harmed. we have also invested, and in the future expect to invest, in new business models, geographies, strategies and initiatives. such endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties, including distraction of management from current operations, expenses associated with the initiatives and inadequate return on investments. because these new initiatives are inherently risky, they may not be successful and may harm our financial condition and operating results.
business interruption or failure of our information technology and communication systems may impair the availability of our products and services, which may damage our reputation and harm our future financial results.
as we continue to transition our business to more connected services, we become more dependent on the continuing operation and availability of our information technology and communication systems and those of our external service providers, including, for example, third-party internet-based or "cloud" computing services. we do not have redundancy for all of our systems, many of our critical applications reside in only one of our data centers, and our disaster recovery planning may not account for all eventualities. in the event of significant system disruption we may experience loss of data or processing capabilities, which may cause us to lose customers and may materially harm our reputation and our operating results. in addition, we are in the process of updating our customer facing applications and the supporting information technology infrastructure to meet our customers' expectations for continuous service availability. any difficulties in upgrading these applications or infrastructure or failure of our systems or those of our third-party service providers may result in interruptions in our service, which may reduce our revenues and profits, cause us to lose customers and damage our reputation. any prolonged interruptions at any time may result in lost customers, additional refunds of customer charges, negative publicity and increased operating costs, any of which may significantly harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.
our turbotax business must effectively handle extremely heavy customer demand during critical peak periods from january until april of each year. we face significant risks in maintaining adequate service levels during these peak periods where we derive a substantial portion of our overall revenue from the turbotax business. any interruptions in our online tax preparation or electronic filing service at any time during the tax season, particularly during a peak period, could result in significantly decreased revenue, lost customers, additional refunds of customer charges, negative publicity and increased operating costs, any of which could significantly harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.
we are in the process of migrating our applications and infrastructure to new data centers and to third-party hosted environments. if we do not execute the transition to these new environments in an effective manner, we may experience unplanned service disruptions or unforeseen increases in costs which may harm our operating results and our business.
our business operations, data centers, information technology and communications systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from natural disasters, human error, malicious attacks, fire, power loss, telecommunications failures, computer viruses, computer denial of service attacks, terrorist attacks and other events beyond our control. the majority of our activities, our corporate headquarters, our principal information technology systems, and other critical business operations are located near major seismic faults. we do not carry earthquake insurance for direct quake-related losses. our future financial results may be materially harmed in the event of a major earthquake or other natural or man-made disaster.
we rely on internal systems and external systems maintained by manufacturers, distributors and other service providers to take and fulfill customer orders, handle customer service requests and host certain online activities. any interruption or failure of our internal or external systems may prevent us or our service providers from accepting and fulfilling customer orders or cause company and customer data to be unintentionally disclosed. our continuing efforts to upgrade and expand our network security and other information systems as well as our high-availability capabilities may be costly, and problems with the design or implementation of system enhancements may harm our business and our results of operations.
a security breach resulting in third-party access to our sensitive customer and employee information and data could materially disrupt our businesses, result in the disclosure of confidential information, significantly damage our reputation, subject us to costly litigation and cause material losses.
we host, collect, use and retain large amounts of sensitive and personal customer and employee information and data, including credit card information, tax return information, bank account numbers and passwords, personal and business financial data and transactions, social security numbers, healthcare information and payroll information. we and our vendors use commercially
tables of contents available security technologies to protect this information and data, and we also use security and business controls to limit access to and use of such sensitive and personal customer information and data. however, such measures cannot provide absolute security, and we have experienced instances in the past where criminals, using stolen identity information obtained outside of our systems, have gained unauthorized and illegal access to our customers' data. as the accessibility of stolen identity information increases, we may experience additional instances of unauthorized and illegal access to our systems using our customers' stolen identity information in the future. in addition, third parties may fraudulently induce employees, customers, or users to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to our data or customers' data. the security measures that we implement may not be able to prevent access to our systems from unauthorized users who have fraudulently obtained our customers' personal information. in addition, because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access change frequently and may be difficult to detect for long periods of time, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventive measures. a major breach of our security measures or those of third parties that provide hosting services or have access to our sensitive and personal customer information may have serious negative consequences for our businesses, including possible litigation, fines, penalties and damages, material harm to our reputation and brands, further regulation and oversight by federal or state agencies, and loss of our ability to provide financial transaction services or accept and process customer credit card orders or tax returns.
our technologies, systems, and networks and our customers' devices have been subject to, and are likely to continue to be the target of, cyber-attacks, computer viruses, worms, phishing attacks, malicious software programs and other information security breaches that could result in the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss or destruction of our customers' or employees' sensitive and personal information and data, or otherwise disrupt our or our customers' or other third parties' business operations, and customers that fail to update theirs systems, continue to run software that we no longer support or that fail to install security patches on a timely basis make it more difficult for us to detect and prevent these kinds of attacks. although this is an industry-wide problem that affects software across platforms, it is increasingly affecting our offerings because cybercriminals tend to focus their efforts on well-known offerings that are popular among customers, and we expect them to continue to do so. if these cybercriminals are able to circumvent our security measures, exploit vulnerabilities in our customers' devices or customers' behavior, or if we are unable to detect an intrusion into our systems and contain such intrusion in a reasonable amount of time, our customers' sensitive and personal information and data may be compromised, which could lead to litigation with our customers, fines, penalties and other damages.
in addition, our employees, contractors, temporary and seasonal employees may have access to sensitive and personal information of our customers and employees. while we conduct background checks of our employees and these other individuals and limit access to systems and data, it is possible that one or more of these individuals may circumvent these controls, resulting in accidental or intentional disclosure or misuse of our customers' or employees' data. in addition, we rely on third-party vendors to host certain of our sensitive and personal information and data. while we conduct due diligence on these third-party partners with respect to their security and business controls, we may not have the ability to effectively monitor or oversee the implementation of these controls measures, and, in any event, individuals or third parties may be able to circumvent these security and business controls and/or exploit vulnerabilities that may exist in these controls, resulting in the disclosure or misuse of sensitive and personal customer or employee information and data.
privacy and cybersecurity concerns relating to online offerings, including our offerings specifically, as well as the external environment generally, could damage our reputation and deter current and potential customers from adopting our products and services.
from time to time, we detect, or receive notices from customers or public or private agencies that they have detected, actual or perceived vulnerabilities in our servers, our software or third-party software components that are distributed with our products or fraudulent activity by unauthorized persons utilizing our products with stolen customer identity information. the existence of such vulnerabilities or fraudulent activity, even if they do not result in a security breach, may undermine customer confidence as well as the confidence of government agencies that regulate our offerings. as we further transition our businesses to online and connected services, continue to collect more personal and sensitive information, and operate in more countries, the risk that perceived vulnerabilities of our systems could seriously harm our business by tarnishing our reputation and brand and/or limiting the adoption of our products and services is likely to increase.
in addition, the continued occurrence of cyber-attacks and data breaches on governments, businesses and consumers in general, indicates we operate in an external environment where cyber-attacks and data breaches are becoming increasingly common. if the global cybersecurity environment worsens, and there are increased instances of security breaches of third-party offerings where consumers' data and sensitive information is compromised, consumers may be less willing to use online offerings, particularly offerings like ours where customers often share sensitive financial data. this could damage our reputation and deter current and potential customers from adopting our products and services or lead customers to cease using online and connected software products to transact financial business altogether.
tables of contents if we are unable to develop, manage and maintain critical third-party business relationships, our business may be adversely affected.
our growth is dependent on the strength of our business relationships and our ability to continue to develop, maintain and leverage new and existing relationships. we rely on various third-party partners, including software and service providers, suppliers, vendors, manufacturers, distributors, contractors, financial institutions, core processors, licensing partners and development partners, among others, in many areas of our business in order to deliver our offerings and operate our business. we also rely on third parties to support the operation of our business by maintaining our physical facilities, equipment, power systems and infrastructure. in certain instances, these third-party relationships are sole source or limited source relationships and can be difficult to replace or substitute depending on the level of integration of the third party's products or services into, or with, our offerings and/or the general availability of such third party's products and services. in addition, there may be few or no alternative third-party providers or vendors in the market. further, there can be no assurance that we will be able to adequately retain third-party contractors engaged to help us operate our business. the failure of third parties to provide acceptable and high quality products, services and technologies or to update their products, services and technologies may result in a disruption to our business operations and our customers, which may reduce our revenues and profits, cause us to lose customers and damage our reputation. alternative arrangements and services may not be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or we may experience business interruptions upon a transition to an alternative partner.
in particular, we have relationships with banks, credit unions and other financial institutions that support certain critical services we offer to our customers. if macroeconomic conditions or other factors cause any of these institutions to fail, consolidate, stop providing certain services or institute cost-cutting efforts, our business and financial results may suffer and we may be unable to offer those services to our customers.
we have also started to increasingly utilize the distribution platforms of third parties like apple's app store and google's play store for the distribution of certain of our product offerings. although we benefit from the strong brand recognition and large user base of these distribution platforms to attract new customers, the platform owners have wide discretion to change the pricing structure, terms of service and other policies with respect to us and other developers. any adverse changes by these third parties could adversely affect our financial results.
increased government regulation of our businesses may harm our operating results.
the company is subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations that affect the company's activities, including, without limitation, areas of labor, advertising, tax, financial services, data privacy and security requirements, digital content, consumer protection, real estate, billing, e-commerce, promotions, quality of services, intellectual property ownership and infringement, import and export requirements, anti-corruption, foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions, anti-competition, environmental, health and safety. there have been significant new regulations and heightened focus by the government on many of these areas, as well as in areas such as insurance and healthcare (including, for example, the affordable care act). recent legal developments in the european union have created compliance uncertainty and increased complexity regarding certain transfers of information from europe to the u.s. in addition, governmental authorities around the world are considering a number of of legislative and regulatory proposals concerning data protection. due to the uncertain international environment, we could acquire additional compliance obligations that could cause us to incur costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business. as we expand our products and services and revise our business models, both domestically and internationally, we may become subject to additional government regulation or increased regulatory scrutiny. further, regulators may adopt new laws or regulations or their interpretation of existing laws or regulations may differ from ours as well as the laws of other jurisdictions in which we operate. these regulatory requirements could impose significant limitations, require changes to our business, require notification to customers or employees of a security breach, restrict our use or storage of personal information, or cause changes in customer purchasing behavior which may make our business more costly, less efficient or impossible to conduct, and may require us to modify our current or future products or services, which may harm our future financial results. for example, as our business continues to expand to new industry segments that may be more highly regulated for privacy and data security, and to countries outside the united states that have more strict data protection laws, our compliance requirements and costs may increase. we have incurred - and may continue to incur - significant expenses to comply with mandatory privacy and security standards and protocols imposed by law, regulation, industry standards or contractual obligations.
the tax preparation industry continues to receive heightened attention from federal and state governments. new legislation, regulation, public policy considerations, changes in the cybersecurity environment, litigation by the government or private entities, or new interpretations of existing laws may result in greater oversight of the tax preparation industry, restrict the types of products and services that we can offer or the prices we can charge, or otherwise cause us to change the way we operate our
tables of contents tax businesses or offer our tax products and services. we may not be able to respond quickly to such regulatory, legislative and other developments, and these changes may in turn increase our cost of doing business and limit our revenue opportunities. in addition, if our practices are not consistent with new interpretations of existing laws, we may become subject to lawsuits, penalties, and other liabilities that did not previously apply. we are also required to comply with a variety of state revenue agency standards in order to successfully operate our tax preparation and electronic filing services. changes in state-imposed requirements by one or more of the states, including the required use of specific technologies or technology standards, may significantly increase the costs of providing those services to our customers and may prevent us from delivering a quality product to our customers in a timely manner.
if we fail to process transactions effectively or fail to adequately protect against disputed or potential fraudulent activities, our revenue and earnings may be harmed.
our operations process a significant volume and dollar value of transactions on a daily basis, especially in our payroll and payments businesses. due to the size and volume of transactions that we handle, effective processing systems and controls are essential to ensure that transactions are handled appropriately. despite our efforts, it is possible that we may make errors or that funds may be misappropriated due to fraud. the systems supporting our business are comprised of multiple technology platforms that are difficult to scale. if we are unable to effectively manage our systems and processes we may be unable to process customer data in an accurate, reliable and timely manner, which may harm our business. in our payments processing service business if merchants for whom we process payment transactions are unable to pay refunds due to their customers in connection with disputed or fraudulent merchant transactions, we may be required to pay those amounts and our payments may exceed the amount of the customer reserves we have established to make such payments.
if we are unable to effectively combat the increasing amount and sophistication of fraudulent activities by third parties using our offerings, we may suffer losses, which may be substantial, and lose the confidence of our customers and government agencies and our revenues and earnings may be harmed.
the online tax preparation, payroll administration and online payments industries have been experiencing an increasing amount of fraudulent activities by third parties, and those fraudulent activities are becoming increasingly sophisticated. although we do not believe that any of this activity is uniquely targeted at our products or business, this type of fraudulent activity may adversely impact our consumer tax, payroll, and payments businesses. in addition to any losses that may result from such fraud, which may be substantial, a loss of confidence by our customers or by governmental agencies in our ability to prevent fraudulent activity that is perpetrated through our offerings may seriously harm our business and damage our brand. if we cannot adequately combat such fraudulent activity that is perpetrated through our tax offerings, governmental authorities may refuse to allow us to continue to offer such services, which could include federal or state tax authorities refusing to allow us to process our customers' tax returns electronically, resulting in a significant adverse impact on our earnings and revenue. as fraudulent activities become more pervasive and increasingly sophisticated, and fraud detection and prevention measures must become correspondingly more complex to combat them across the various industries in which we operate, we may implement risk control mechanisms that could make it more difficult for legitimate customers to obtain and use our products, which could result in lost revenue and negatively impact our earnings.
we may become increasingly subject to infringement claims, including patent, copyright, trade secret, and trademark infringement claims. litigation may be necessary to determine the validity and scope of the intellectual property rights of others. we have received a number of allegations of intellectual property infringement claims in the past and expect to receive more claims in the future based on allegations that our offerings infringe upon the intellectual property held by third parties. some of these claims are the subject of pending litigation against us and against some of our customers. these claims may involve patent holding companies or other adverse intellectual property owners who have no relevant product revenues of their own, and against whom our own intellectual property may provide little or no deterrence. the ultimate outcome of any allegation is uncertain and, regardless of outcome, any such claim, with or without merit, may be time consuming to defend, result in costly litigation, divert management's time and attention from our business, require us to stop selling, delay shipping or redesign our products, or require us to pay monetary damages for royalty or licensing fees, or to satisfy indemnification obligations that we have with some of our customers. our failure to obtain necessary license or other rights, or litigation arising out of intellectual property claims may harm our business.
many of our products and services include intellectual property of third parties, which we license under agreements that may need to be renewed or renegotiated from time to time. we may not be able to obtain licenses to these third-party technologies or
tables of contents content on reasonable terms, or at all. if we are unable to obtain the rights necessary to use this intellectual property in our products and services, we may not be able to sell the affected offerings and customers who are currently using the affected product may be disrupted, which may in turn harm our future financial results, damage our brand, and result in customer loss. also, we and our customers have been and may continue to be subject to infringement claims as a result of the third-party intellectual property incorporated in to our offerings. although we try to mitigate this risk and we may not be ultimately liable for any potential infringement, pending claims require us to use significant resources, require management attention and could result in loss of customers.
some of our offerings include third-party software that is licensed under so-called "open source" licenses, some of which may include a requirement that, under certain circumstances, we make available, or grant licenses to, any modifications or derivative works we create based upon the open source software. although we have established internal review and approval processes to mitigate these risks, we may not be sure that all open source software is submitted for approval prior to use in our products. many of the risks associated with usage of open source may not be eliminated, and may, if not properly addressed, harm our business.
our intellectual property rights are valuable, and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of our products, services, and brand.
our patents, trademarks, trade secrets, copyrights and other intellectual property rights are important assets for us. we aggressively protect our intellectual property rights by relying on federal, state and common law rights in the u.s. and internationally, as well as a variety of administrative procedures. we also rely on contractual restrictions to protect our proprietary rights in products and services. the efforts that we take to protect our proprietary rights may not always be sufficient or effective. protecting our intellectual property rights is costly and time consuming and may not be successful in every location. any significant impairment of our intellectual property rights could harm our business, our brand and our ability to compete.
policing unauthorized use and copying of our products is difficult, expensive, and time consuming. current u.s. laws that prohibit copying give us only limited practical protection from software piracy and the laws of many other countries provide very little protection. we frequently encounter unauthorized copies of our software being sold through online marketplaces. although we continue to evaluate and put in place technology solutions to attempt to lessen the impact of piracy and engage in efforts to educate consumers and public policy leaders on these issues and cooperate with industry groups in their efforts to combat piracy, we expect piracy to be a persistent problem that results in lost revenues and increased expenses.
because competition for our key employees is intense, we may not be able to attract, retain and develop the highly skilled employees we need to support our planned growth.
much of our future success depends on the continued service and availability of skilled personnel, including members of our executive team, and those in technical, marketing and staff positions. experienced personnel in the software, mobile technologies, data science, data security, and software as a service industries are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense, especially in california and india, where the majority of our employees are located. also, as we strive to continue to adapt to technological change and introduce new and enhanced products and business models, we must be able to secure, maintain and develop the right quality and quantity of engaged and committed talent. although we strive to be an employer of choice, we may not be able to continue to successfully attract, retain and develop key personnel which may cause our business to suffer.
the nature of our products and services necessitates timely product launches and if we experience significant product quality problems or delays, it may harm our revenue, earnings and reputation.
all of our tax products and many of our non-tax products have rigid development timetables that increase the risk of errors in our products and the risk of launch delays. our tax preparation software product development cycle is particularly challenging due to the need to incorporate unpredictable tax law and tax form changes each year and because our customers expect high levels of accuracy and a timely launch of these products to prepare and file their taxes by the tax filing deadline. due to the complexity of our products and the condensed development cycles under which we operate, our products sometimes contain glitches that may unexpectedly interfere with the operation of the software. the complexity of our products may also make it difficult for us to consistently deliver offerings that contain the features, functionality and level of accuracy that our customers expect. when we encounter problems we may be required to modify our code, distribute patches to customers who have already purchased the product and recall or repackage existing product inventory in our distribution channels. if we encounter development challenges or discover errors in our products late in our development cycle it may cause us to delay our product launch date. any major defects or launch delays may lead to loss of customers and revenue, negative publicity, customer and employee dissatisfaction, reduced retailer shelf space and promotions, and increased operating expenses, such as inventory
tables of contents replacement costs, legal fees or payments resulting from our commitment to reimburse penalties and interest paid by customers due solely to calculation errors in our consumer tax preparation products.
our consumer tax business is highly seasonal and our quarterly results could fluctuate significantly.
our consumer tax offerings have significant seasonal patterns. revenue from income tax preparation products and services is heavily concentrated during november through april. this seasonality has caused significant fluctuations in our quarterly financial results. our financial results may also fluctuate from quarter to quarter and year to year due to a variety of factors, including factors that may affect the timing of revenue recognition. these include changes to our offerings that result in the inclusion or exclusion of ongoing services; changes in product pricing strategies or product sales mix; the timing of the availability of federal and state tax forms from taxing agencies and the ability of those agencies to receive electronic tax return submissions; changes in consumer behavior; and the timing of our discontinuation of support for older product offerings. other factors that may affect our quarterly or annual financial results include the timing of acquisitions, divestitures, and goodwill and acquired intangible asset impairment charges. any fluctuations in our operating results may adversely affect our stock price.
we are frequently a party to litigation and regulatory inquiries which could result in an unfavorable outcome and have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operation and cash flows.
we are subject to various legal proceedings (including class action lawsuits), claims and regulatory inquiries that have arisen out of the ordinary conduct of our business and are not yet resolved and additional claims and inquiries may arise in the future. the number and significance of these claims and inquiries have increased as our businesses have evolved. any proceedings, claims or inquiries initiated by or against us, whether successful or not, may be time consuming; result in costly litigation, damage awards, consent decrees, injunctive relief or increased costs of business; require us to change our business practices or products; require significant amounts of management time; result in diversion of significant operations resources; or otherwise harm our business and future financial results.
adverse global economic conditions could harm our business and financial condition.
adverse macroeconomic developments could negatively affect our business and financial condition. adverse global economic events have caused, and could, in the future, cause disruptions and volatility in global financial markets and increased rates of default and bankruptcy, and could impact consumer and small business spending. in particular, because the majority of our revenue is derived from sales within the u.s., economic conditions in the u.s. have an even greater impact on us than companies with a more diverse international presence. challenging economic times could cause potential new customers not to purchase or to delay purchasing of our products and services, and could cause our existing customers to discontinue purchasing or delay upgrades of our existing products and services, thereby negatively impacting our revenues and future financial results. decreased consumer spending levels could also reduce credit and debit card transaction processing volumes causing reductions in our payments revenue. poor economic conditions and high unemployment have caused, and could in the future cause, a significant decrease in the number of tax returns filed, which may have a significant effect on the number of tax returns we prepare and file. in addition, weakness in the end-user consumer and small business markets could negatively affect the cash flow of our distributors and resellers who could, in turn, delay paying their obligations to us, which could increase our credit risk exposure and cause delays in our recognition of revenue or future sales to these customers. any of these events could harm our business and our future financial results.
we regularly invest resources to update and improve our internal information technology systems and software platforms. should our investments not succeed, or if delays or other issues with new or existing internal technology systems and software platforms disrupt our operations, our business could be harmed.
we rely on our network and data center infrastructure and internal technology systems for many of our development, marketing, operational, support, sales, accounting and financial reporting activities. we are continually investing resources to update and improve these systems and environments in order to meet existing, as well as the growing and changing requirements of our business and customers. if we experience prolonged delays or unforeseen difficulties in updating and upgrading our systems and architecture, we may experience outages and may not be able to deliver certain offerings and develop new offerings and enhancements that we need to remain competitive. such improvements and upgrades are often complex, costly and time consuming. in addition such improvements can be challenging to integrate with our existing technology systems, or may uncover problems with our existing technology systems. unsuccessful implementation of hardware or software updates and improvements could result in outages, disruption in our business operations, loss of revenue or damage to our reputation.
tables of contents our international operations are subject to increased risks which may harm our business, operating results, and financial condition.
in addition to uncertainty about our ability to generate revenues from our foreign operations and expand into international markets, there are risks inherent in doing business internationally, including:
•   different or more restrictive privacy, data protection, data localization, and other laws that could require us to make changes to our products, services and operations, such as mandating that certain types of data collected in a particular country be stored and/or processed within that country;
•   difficulties in developing, staffing, and simultaneously managing a large number of varying foreign operations as a result of distance, language, and cultural differences;
•   credit risk and higher levels of payment fraud;
•   profit repatriation restrictions, and foreign currency exchange restrictions;
•   geopolitical events, including natural disasters, acts of war and terrorism;
•   compliance with u.s. laws such as the foreign corrupt practices act, and local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to government officials;
•   antitrust and competition regulations;
•   potentially adverse tax developments;
•   trade barriers and changes in trade regulations;
•   political or social unrest, economic instability, repression, or human rights issues; and
•   risks related to other government regulation or required compliance with local laws.
violations of the rapidly evolving and complex foreign and u.s. laws and regulations that apply to our international operations may result in fines, criminal actions or sanctions against us, our officers or our employees, prohibitions on the conduct of our business and damage to our reputation. although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to promote compliance with these laws, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors or agents will not violate our policies. these risks inherent in our international operations and expansion increase our costs of doing business internationally and may result in harm to our business, operating results, and financial condition.
if actual product returns exceed returns reserves our future financial results may be harmed.
we ship more desktop software products to our distributors and retailers than we expect them to sell, in order to reduce the risk that distributors or retailers may run out of products. this is particularly true for our consumer tax products, which have a short selling season and for which returns occur primarily in our fiscal third and fourth quarters. like many software companies that sell their products through distributors and retailers, we have historically accepted significant product returns. we establish reserves against revenue for product returns in our financial statements based on estimated returns and we closely monitor product sales and inventory in the retail channel in an effort to maintain adequate reserves. in the past, returns have not differed significantly from these reserves. however, if we experience actual returns that significantly exceed reserves, it may result in lower net revenue.
unanticipated changes in our income tax rates may affect our future financial results.
our future effective income tax rates may be favorably or unfavorably affected by unanticipated changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, or by changes in tax laws or their interpretation. in addition, we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities. we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. these continuous examinations may result in unforeseen tax-related liabilities, which may harm our future financial results.
tables of contents amortization of acquired intangible assets and impairment charges may cause significant fluctuation in our net income.
our acquisitions have resulted in significant expenses, including amortization and impairment of acquired technology and other acquired intangible assets, and impairment of goodwill. total costs and expenses in these categories were $34 million in fiscal 2016; $339 million in fiscal 2015, of which $149 million was classified as discontinued operations; and $25 million in fiscal 2014. although under current accounting rules goodwill is not amortized, we may incur impairment charges related to the goodwill already recorded and to goodwill arising out of future acquisitions. we test the impairment of goodwill annually in our fourth fiscal quarter or more frequently if indicators of impairment arise. the timing of the formal annual test may result in charges to our statement of operations in our fourth fiscal quarter that may not have been reasonably foreseen in prior periods. the total costs and expenses for fiscal 2015 included goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges of $297 million, of which $149 million was classified as discontinued operations. at july 31, 2016, we had $1.3 billion in goodwill and $44 million in net acquired intangible assets on our balance sheet, both of which may be subject to impairment charges in the future. new acquisitions, and any impairment of the value of acquired intangible assets, may have a significant negative impact on our future financial results.
our acquisition and divestiture activities may disrupt our ongoing business, may involve increased expenses and may present risks not contemplated at the time of the transactions.
we have acquired and may continue to acquire companies, products and technologies that complement our strategic direction. acquisitions involve significant risks and uncertainties, including:
•   inability to successfully integrate the acquired technology, data assets and operations into our business and maintain uniform standards, controls, policies, and procedures;
•   inability to realize synergies expected to result from an acquisition;
•   disruption of our ongoing business and distraction of management;
•   challenges retaining the key employees, customers, resellers and other business partners of the acquired operation;
•   the internal control environment of an acquired entity may not be consistent with our standards and may require significant time and resources to improve;
•   unidentified issues not discovered in our due diligence process, including product or service quality issues, intellectual property issues and legal contingencies;
•   failure to successfully further develop an acquired business or technology and any resulting impairment of amounts currently capitalized as intangible assets;
•   in the case of foreign acquisitions and investments, the impact of particular economic, tax, currency, political, legal and regulatory risks associated with specific countries.
we have divested and may in the future divest certain assets or businesses that no longer fit with our strategic direction or growth targets. divestitures involve significant risks and uncertainties, including:
•   inability to find potential buyers on favorable terms;
•   failure to effectively transfer liabilities, contracts, facilities and employees to buyers;
•   requirements that we retain or indemnify buyers against certain liabilities and obligations;
•   the possibility that we will become subject to third-party claims arising out of such divestiture;
•   challenges in identifying and separating the intellectual properties and data to be divested from the intellectual properties and data that we wish to retain;
•   inability to reduce fixed costs previously associated with the divested assets or business;
•   challenges in collecting the proceeds from any divestiture;
•   disruption of our ongoing business and distraction of management;
•   loss of key employees who leave the company as a result of a divestiture;
•   if customers or partners of the divested business do not receive the same level of service from the new owners, our other businesses may be adversely affected, to the extent that these customers or partners also purchase other products offered by us or otherwise conduct business with our retained business.
tables of contents because acquisitions and divestitures are inherently risky, our transactions may not be successful and may, in some cases, harm our operating results or financial condition. although we typically fund our acquisitions through cash available from operations, if we were to use debt to fund acquisitions or for other purposes, our interest expense and leverage would increase significantly, and if we were to issue equity securities as consideration in an acquisition, current shareholders' percentage ownership and earnings per share would be diluted.
we have $1 billion in debt outstanding and may incur other debt in the future, which may adversely affect our financial condition and future financial results.
in fiscal 2007 we issued $500 million in senior unsecured notes due in march 2017. as the debt matures, we will have to expend significant resources to either repay or refinance these notes. if we decide to refinance the notes, we may be required to do so on different or less favorable terms or we may be unable to refinance the notes at all, both of which may adversely affect our financial condition.
on february 1, 2016 we entered into a master credit agreement with certain institutional lenders for a new five-year credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of $1.5 billion. the master credit agreement includes a $500 million unsecured term loan and a $1 billion unsecured revolving credit facility that will expire on february 1, 2021. as of july 31, 2016, $500 million was outstanding on the term loan and no amounts were outstanding under the revolving credit facility. we may use the proceeds of any advances against the credit facility for general corporate purposes, including future acquisitions and share repurchases.
this debt may adversely affect our financial condition and future financial results by, among other things:
•   increasing our vulnerability to downturns in our business, to competitive pressures and to adverse economic and industry conditions;
•   requiring the dedication of a portion of our expected cash from operations to service our indebtedness, thereby reducing the amount of expected cash flow available for other purposes, including capital expenditures and acquisitions; and
•   limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our businesses and our industries.
our current revolving credit facility imposes restrictions on us, including restrictions on our ability to create liens on our assets and the ability of our subsidiaries to incur indebtedness, and require us to maintain compliance with specified financial ratios. our ability to comply with these ratios may be affected by events beyond our control. in addition, our short- and long-term debt includes covenants that may adversely affect our ability to incur certain liens or engage in certain types of sale and leaseback transactions. if we breach any of the covenants under our short- and long-term debt or our revolving credit facility and do not obtain a waiver from the lenders, then, subject to applicable cure periods, any outstanding indebtedness may be declared immediately due and payable.
in addition, changes by any rating agency to our credit rating may negatively impact the value and liquidity of both our debt and equity securities. if our credit ratings are downgraded or other negative action is taken, the interest rate payable by us under our revolving credit facility may increase. in addition, any downgrades in our credit ratings may affect our ability to obtain additional financing in the future and may affect the terms of any such financing.
we are subject to risks associated with information disseminated through our services.
the laws relating to the liability of online services companies for information such as online content disseminated through their services are subject to frequent challenges. in spite of settled law in the u.s., claims are made against online services companies by parties who disagree with the content. where our online content is accessed on the internet outside of the u.s., challenges may be brought under foreign laws which do not provide the same protections for online services companies as in the u.s. these challenges in either u.s. or foreign jurisdictions may rise to legal claims alleging defamation, libel, invasion of privacy, negligence, copyright or trademark infringement, or other theories based on the nature and content of the materials disseminated through the services. certain of our services include content generated by users of our online services. although this content is not generated by us, claims of defamation or other injury may be made against us for that content. any costs incurred as a result of this potential liability may harm our business.
our stock price may be volatile and your investment could lose value.
our stock price is subject to changes in recommendations or earnings estimates by financial analysts, changes in investors' or analysts' valuation measures for our stock, our credit ratings and market trends unrelated to our performance. furthermore, speculation in the press or investment community about our strategic position, financial condition, results of operations, business or security of our products, can cause changes in our stock price. these factors, as well as general economic and
tables of contents political conditions and the timing of announcements in the public market regarding new products, product enhancements or technological advances by our competitors or us, and any announcements by us of acquisitions, major transactions, or management changes may adversely affect our stock price. further, any changes in the amounts or frequency of share repurchases or dividends may also adversely affect our stock price. a significant drop in our stock price could expose us to the risk of securities class actions lawsuits, which may result in substantial costs and divert management's attention and resources, which may adversely affect our business.
our business depends on our strong reputation and the value of our brands.
developing and maintaining awareness of our brands is critical to achieving widespread acceptance of our existing and future products and services and is an important element in attracting new customers. adverse publicity (whether or not justified) relating to events or activities attributed to us, our employees or agents may tarnish our reputation and reduce the value of our brands. damage to our reputation and loss of brand equity may reduce demand for our products and services and thus have an adverse effect on our future financial results, as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation and restore the value of the brands.
item 7
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations our management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (md&a) includes the following sections:
•   executive overview that discusses at a high level our operating results and some of the trends that affect our business.
•   critical accounting policies and estimates that we believe are important to understanding the assumptions and judgments underlying our financial statements.
•   liquidity and capital resources which discusses key aspects of our statements of cash flows, changes in our balance sheets and our financial commitments.
you should note that this md&a discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. please see the section entitled "forward-looking statements and risk factors" at the beginning of item 1a for important information to consider when evaluating such statements.
you should read this md&a in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes in item 8 of this annual report. in fiscal 2014 we acquired check inc. we have included their results of operations in our consolidated results of operations from the date of acquisition.
in fiscal 2014 we completed the sales of our intuit financial services (ifs) and intuit health businesses. in fiscal 2016 we completed the sales of our demandforce, quickbase, and quicken businesses. we accounted for all of these businesses as discontinued operations and have therefore reclassified our statements of operations for all periods presented to reflect them as such. we have also segregated the net assets of our demandforce, quickbase, and quicken businesses from continuing operations on our balance sheet at july 31, 2015. because the cash flows of these discontinued operations were not material for any period presented, we have not segregated them on our statements of cash flows. see "results of operations - non-operating income and expense - discontinued operations" later in this item 7 for more information. unless otherwise noted, the following discussion pertains to our continuing operations.
executive overview this overview provides a high level discussion of our operating results and some of the trends that affect our business. we believe that an understanding of these trends is important in order to understand our financial results for fiscal 2016 as well as our future prospects. this summary is not intended to be exhaustive, nor is it intended to be a substitute for the detailed discussion and analysis provided elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k.
industry trends and seasonality industry trends the industry in which we operate is dynamic and highly competitive, and we expect it to remain so in the future. the markets for software and related services, especially highly-available connected services, are characterized by rapid technological change, shifting customer needs, and frequent new product introductions and enhancements. competitive interest and expertise
tables of contents in many of the markets we serve have grown markedly over the past few years and we expect this trend to continue. there are also large, cloud-based service companies who innovate quickly and serve small businesses and consumers. while today our competition with such companies may be limited, as we and those companies grow, our competition with them may increase. in recent years the widespread availability of the internet, the emergence of mobile devices, and the explosion of social media have accelerated the pace of change and revolutionized the way that people throughout the world manage important financial tasks. the result is a global market that is shifting from traditional services that are paper-based, human-produced, and brick-and-mortar bound, to one where people understand, demand, and embrace the benefits of connected services. this trend toward connected services is the primary driver of the strategies in all of our businesses.
seasonality our consumer tax offerings have significant seasonal patterns. as a result, during each of the last three fiscal years the total revenue for our third quarter ended april 30 has represented nearly half of our total revenue for those years. we expect the seasonality of our consumer tax business to continue to have a significant impact on our quarterly financial results in the future.
key challenges and risks our growth strategy depends upon our ability to initiate and embrace disruptive technology trends, to enter new markets, and to drive broad adoption of the products and services we develop and market. our future growth also increasingly depends on the strength of our third-party business relationships and our ability to continue to develop, maintain, and strengthen new and existing relationships. to remain competitive and continue to grow, we are investing significant resources in our product development, marketing, and sales capabilities, and we expect to continue to do so in the future.
as we continue transitioning to offer more connected services, the ongoing operation and availability of our information technology and communication systems and those of our external service providers is becoming increasingly important. because we help customers manage their financial lives, we face risks associated with the hosting, collection, use, and retention of personal customer information and data. we are investing significant management attention and resources in our information technology infrastructure and in our privacy and security capabilities, and we expect to continue to do so in the future.
beginning in early calendar year 2015, state taxing authorities, the irs, and the tax preparation industry experienced an increase in attempts by criminals using stolen identity information to file fraudulent tax returns and claim refunds at the federal level and expanding into the state level. we implemented additional security measures in our products and began working with state governments to share information regarding suspicious filings while continuing to share such information with the federal government. we continue to invest in security and to work with the broader industry and government to protect our customers against this type of fraud.
for a complete discussion of the most significant risks and uncertainties affecting our business, please see "forward-looking statements and risk factors" in item 1a of this report.
overview of financial results the most important financial indicators that we use to assess our business are revenue growth for the company as a whole, for each reportable segment, and for product lines within each reportable segment; operating income growth and operating income margins for the company as a whole and for each reportable segment; earnings per share; and cash flow from operations. we also track certain non-financial drivers of revenue growth and, when material, identify them in the applicable discussions of segment results below. these non-financial drivers include, for example, customer growth and retention for all of our businesses and transaction volume for our payment processing business. total credit and debit card transaction volume correlates strongly with the macroeconomic environment and is one of the key drivers of revenue growth in our payment processing business. customers for our connected services offerings have generally grown faster than those for our traditional desktop software offerings, reflecting our strategic focus on connected services over the past few years. connected services (total service and other revenue) generated $3.4 billion or 73% of our total revenue in fiscal 2016, compared with about 50% of our total revenue eight years ago. we expect connected services revenue as a percentage of our total revenue to continue to grow in the future.
total net revenue for fiscal 2016 was $4.7 billion, an increase of 12% compared with fiscal 2015. total net revenue results were affected by changes we made to our desktop software offerings in fiscal 2015. starting with the release of quickbooks desktop 2015 in the first quarter of fiscal 2015, and for all subsequent versions, we began delivering ongoing enhancements and certain connected services for our quickbooks desktop software products. we plan to continue to provide ongoing enhancements and certain connected services for all future versions of these products. as a result of these changes, we recognize revenue for these quickbooks desktop software products as services are provided over approximately three years. revenue in our small business segment increased 9% compared with fiscal 2015 due to growth in small business online ecosystem revenue and the impact of the changes to our quickbooks desktop software products. the changes to our desktop software offerings also
tables of contents affected our proconnect segment, whose revenue increased 51% to $428 million in fiscal 2016. in fiscal 2015 we began delivering ongoing enhancements and certain connected services for our proconnect desktop software products and we plan to continue to provide them for all future versions of those products. due to these changes, we recognize revenue for these offerings as services are provided through the end of each calendar year. prior to these changes, we recognized a substantial portion of the revenue for these offerings during our third fiscal quarters ended april 30. revenue in our consumer tax segment increased 10% compared with fiscal 2015 due to 12% growth in u.s. federal turbotax units.
operating income from continuing operations increased 68% in fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015 due in part to the increase in revenue described above. higher revenue was partially offset by higher costs and operating expenses, including higher spending for staffing, depreciation, advertising and other marketing programs, and share-based compensation. we also recorded goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges of $148 million to operating expense in fiscal 2015.
net income from continuing operations increased 95% in fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015 due to the increase in operating income and a lower effective tax rate in fiscal 2016. diluted net income per share from continuing operations for fiscal 2016 increased 110% to $3.04 as a result of the increase in net income and the decline in weighted average diluted common shares compared with fiscal 2015.
we ended fiscal 2016 with cash, cash equivalents and investments totaling $1.1 billion. in fiscal 2016 we generated cash from operations, net sales of investments, proceeds from our term loan, the sales of our demandforce, quickbase, and quicken businesses, and the issuance of common stock under employee stock plans. during the same period we used cash for the repurchase of shares of our common stock under our stock repurchase programs, the payment of cash dividends, and capital expenditures, including the purchase of certain previously leased facilities. at july 31, 2016, we had authorization from our board of directors to expend up to an additional $360 million for stock repurchases through may 19, 2019. on august 19, 2016 our board approved a new stock repurchase program under which we are authorized to repurchase up to an additional $2 billion of our common stock.
critical accounting policies and estimates in preparing our consolidated financial statements in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles (gaap), we are required to make estimates, assumptions, and judgments that can have a significant impact on our net revenue, operating income or loss and net income or loss, as well as on the value of certain assets and liabilities on our balance sheet. we believe that the estimates, assumptions, and judgments involved in the following accounting policies have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements, so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies:
•   revenue recognition
•   business combinations
•   goodwill, acquired intangible assets, and other long-lived assets - impairment assessments
•   accounting for share-based compensation plans
•   accounting for income taxes - estimates of deferred taxes, valuation allowances, and uncertain tax positions our senior management has reviewed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and their disclosure in this annual report on form 10-k with the audit and risk committee of our board of directors.
revenue recognition we derive revenue from the sale of software subscriptions, hosted services, packaged software products, financial supplies, technical support plans, transaction fees, merchant services hardware, and multiple element arrangements that may include a combination of these items. we follow the appropriate revenue recognition rules for each type of revenue. for additional information, see "revenue recognition" in note 1 to the financial statements in item 8 of this annual report. we generally recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, we have delivered the product or performed the service, the fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility is probable. however, determining whether and when some of these criteria have been satisfied often involves exercising judgment and using estimates that can have a significant impact on the timing and amount of revenue we report. for example, for multiple element arrangements containing only software and software-related elements, we must exercise judgment and use estimates in order to (1) allocate the total price among the various elements we must deliver; (2) determine whether undelivered services are essential to the functionality of the delivered products and services; (3) determine whether vendor-specific evidence of fair value exists for each undelivered element; and (4) determine whether and when each element has been delivered. for multiple element arrangements containing non-software elements, we must exercise judgment and use estimates in order to (1) determine whether and when each element has been delivered; (2)
tables of contents determine the fair value of each element using the selling price hierarchy of vendor-specific evidence of fair value (vsoe) if available, third-party evidence (tpe) if vsoe is not available, and estimated selling price (esp) if neither vsoe nor tpe is available; and (3) allocate the total price among the various elements based on the relative selling price method. if we were to change any of these judgments or estimates, it could cause a material increase or decrease in the amount of revenue that we report in a particular period. amounts for fees collected or invoiced and due relating to arrangements where revenue cannot be recognized are reflected on our balance sheet as deferred revenue and recognized when the applicable revenue recognition criteria are satisfied.
business combinations as described in "description of business and summary of significant accounting policies - business combinations," in note 1 to the financial statements in item 8 of this annual report, under the acquisition method of accounting we generally recognize the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interests in an acquiree at their fair values as of the date of acquisition. we measure goodwill as the excess of consideration transferred, which we also measure at fair value, over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. the acquisition method of accounting requires us to exercise judgment and make significant estimates and assumptions regarding the fair values of the elements of a business combination as of the date of acquisition, including the fair values of identifiable intangible assets, deferred tax asset valuation allowances, liabilities related to uncertain tax positions, and contingencies. this method also requires us to refine these estimates over a one-year measurement period to reflect new information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that, if known, would have affected the measurement of the amounts recognized as of that date. if we are required to retroactively adjust provisional amounts that we have recorded for the fair values of assets and liabilities in connection with acquisitions, these adjustments could materially decrease our operating income and net income and result in lower asset values on our balance sheet.
significant estimates and assumptions that we must make in estimating the fair value of acquired technology, customer lists, and other identifiable intangible assets include future cash flows that we expect to generate from the acquired assets. if the subsequent actual results and updated projections of the underlying business activity change compared with the assumptions and projections used to develop these values, we could record impairment charges. in addition, we have estimated the economic lives of certain acquired assets and these lives are used to calculate depreciation and amortization expense. if our estimates of the economic lives change, depreciation or amortization expenses could be accelerated or slowed.
goodwill, acquired intangible assets and other long-lived assets - impairment assessments we estimate the fair value of acquired intangible assets and other long-lived assets that have finite useful lives whenever an event or change in circumstances indicates that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. we test for potential impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives annually in our fourth fiscal quarter or whenever indicators of impairment arise. the timing of the annual test may result in charges to our statement of operations in our fourth fiscal quarter that could not have been reasonably foreseen in prior periods.
as described in "description of business and summary of significant accounting policies - goodwill, acquired intangible assets and other long-lived assets," in note 1 to the financial statements in item 8 of this annual report, in order to estimate the fair value of goodwill we use a weighted combination of a discounted cash flow model (known as the income approach) and comparisons to publicly traded companies engaged in similar businesses (known as the market approach). the income approach requires us to use a number of assumptions, including market factors specific to the business, the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows to be generated by the business over an extended period of time, long-term growth rates for the business, and a rate of return that considers the relative risk of achieving the cash flows and the time value of money. we evaluate cash flows at the reporting unit level. although the assumptions we use in our discounted cash flow model are consistent with the assumptions we use to generate our internal strategic plans and forecasts, significant judgment is required to estimate the amount and timing of future cash flows from each reporting unit and the relative risk of achieving those cash flows. when using the market approach, we make judgments about the comparability of publicly traded companies engaged in similar businesses. we base our judgments on factors such as size, growth rates, profitability, risk, and return on investment. we also make judgments when adjusting market multiples of revenue, operating income, and earnings for these companies to reflect their relative similarity to our own businesses. we had a total of $1.3 billion in goodwill on our balance sheet at july 31, 2016. see note 5 to the financial statements in item 8 of this annual report for a summary of goodwill by reportable segment.
we estimate the recoverability of acquired intangible assets and other long-lived assets that have finite useful lives by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the future undiscounted cash flows that we expect the asset to generate. in order to estimate the fair value of those assets, we estimate the present value of future cash flows from those assets. the key assumptions that we use in our discounted cash flow model are the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows to be generated by the asset over an extended period of time and a rate of return that considers the relative risk of achieving the cash flows and the time value of money. significant judgment is required to estimate the amount and timing of future cash flows and
tables of contents the relative risk of achieving those cash flows. we also make judgments about the remaining useful lives of acquired intangible assets and other long-lived assets that have finite lives. we had a total of $44 million in net acquired intangible assets on our balance sheet at july 31, 2016.
assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives are complex and often subjective. they can be affected by a variety of factors, including external factors such as industry and economic trends, and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts. for example, if our future operating results do not meet current forecasts or if we experience a sustained decline in our market capitalization that is determined to be indicative of a reduction in fair value of one or more of our reporting units, we may be required to record future impairment charges for goodwill and acquired intangible assets. impairment charges could materially decrease our future net income and result in lower asset values on our balance sheet.
during the fourth quarters of fiscal 2016, fiscal 2015, and fiscal 2014 we performed our annual goodwill impairment tests. using the methodology described in "description of business and summary of significant accounting policies - goodwill, acquired intangible assets and other long-lived assets," in note 1 to the financial statements in part 8 of this annual report, we determined that the estimated fair values of all of our reporting units exceeded their carrying values and that they were not impaired. in addition, during this analysis we concluded that the estimated fair values of all of our reporting units substantially exceeded their carrying values.
during the third quarter of fiscal 2015 there was a significant decline in the revenue and operating income forecast for our consumer ecosystem reporting unit. as a result of this development, we performed an interim impairment test of goodwill and acquired intangible assets for that reporting unit. we concluded that the carrying value of goodwill associated with our consumer ecosystem reporting unit was impaired and we recorded an impairment charge of $263 million that reduced the carrying value of goodwill to $211 million as of april 30, 2015. see "fair value measurements - assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis," in note 2 to the financial statements in item 8 of this annual report for more information.
during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 management approved a plan to sell our quicken business, which was part of our consumer ecosystem reporting unit, and we accounted for it as discontinued operations. as a result, we reclassified a portion of the goodwill impairment charge that we recorded in the third quarter of fiscal 2015 to discontinued operations based on the relative fair values of quicken and the remaining components of our consumer ecosystem reporting unit. in the third quarter of fiscal 2016 we completed the sale of our quicken business for cash consideration that was not significant.
accounting for share-based compensation plans at july 31, 2016, there was $585 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested share-based compensation arrangements granted under all equity compensation plans which we will amortize to expense in the future. total unrecognized compensation cost will be adjusted for future changes in estimated forfeitures. we expect to recognize that cost over a weighted average vesting period of 2.4 years.
we use a lattice binomial model and the assumptions described in note 11 to the financial statements in item 8 of this annual report to estimate the fair value of stock options granted. we estimate the expected term of options granted based on implied exercise patterns using a binomial model. we estimate the volatility of our common stock at the date of grant based on the implied volatility of publicly traded one-year and two-year options on our common stock. our decision to use implied volatility is based upon the availability of actively traded options on our common stock and our assessment that implied volatility is more representative of future stock price trends than historical volatility. we base the risk-free interest rate that we use in our option valuation model on the implied yield in effect at the time of option grant on constant maturity u.s. treasury issues with equivalent remaining terms. we use an annualized expected dividend yield in our option valuation model. we estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. we use historical data to estimate pre-vesting option forfeitures and record share-based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest. we amortize the fair value of options on a straight-line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards, which are generally the vesting periods. we may elect to use different assumptions under our option valuation model in the future, which could materially affect our net income or loss and net income or loss per share.
restricted stock units (rsus) granted typically vest based on continued service. we value these time-based rsus at the date of grant using the intrinsic value method, adjusted for estimated forfeitures. we amortize the fair value of time-based rsus on a straight-line basis adjusted for estimated forfeitures over the service period. certain rsus granted to senior management vest based on the achievement of pre-established performance or market goals. we estimate the fair value of performance-based rsus at the date of grant using the intrinsic value method and the probability that the specified performance criteria will be met, adjusted for estimated forfeitures. each quarter we update our assessment of the probability that the specified performance criteria will be achieved and adjust our estimate of the fair value of the performance-based rsus if necessary. we amortize the fair values of performance-based rsus over the requisite service period adjusted for estimated forfeitures for each separately
tables of contents vesting tranche of the award. we estimate the fair value of market-based rsus at the date of grant using a monte carlo valuation methodology and amortize those fair values over the requisite service period adjusted for estimated forfeitures for each separately vesting tranche of the award. the monte carlo methodology that we use to estimate the fair value of market-based rsus at the date of grant incorporates into the valuation the possibility that the market condition may not be satisfied. provided that the requisite service is rendered, the total fair value of the market-based rsus at the date of grant must be recognized as compensation expense even if the market condition is not achieved. however, the number of shares that ultimately vest can vary significantly with the performance of the specified market criteria. all of the rsus we grant have dividend rights that are subject to the same vesting requirements as the underlying equity awards, so we do not adjust the intrinsic (market) value of our rsus for dividends. see note 11 to the financial statements in item 8 of this annual report for more information.
legal contingencies we are subject to certain legal proceedings, as well as demands, claims and threatened litigation that arise in the normal course of our business. we review the status of each significant matter quarterly and assess our potential financial exposure. if the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated, we record a liability and an expense for the estimated loss. if we determine that a loss is possible and the range of the loss can be reasonably determined, then we disclose the range of the possible loss. significant judgment is required in the determination of whether a potential loss is probable, reasonably possible, or remote as well as in the determination of whether a potential exposure is reasonably estimable. our accruals are based on the best information available at the time. as additional information becomes available, we reassess the potential liability related to our pending claims and litigation and may revise our estimates. potential legal liabilities and the revision of estimates of potential legal liabilities could have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations.
accounting for income taxes - estimates of deferred taxes, valuation allowances, and uncertain tax positions we estimate our income taxes based on the various jurisdictions where we conduct business. significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax provision. the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax rules and the potential for future adjustment of our uncertain tax positions by the united states internal revenue service or other taxing jurisdictions. we estimate our current tax liability and assess temporary differences that result from differing treatments of certain items for tax and accounting purposes. these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which we show on our balance sheet. we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be realized. to the extent we believe that realization is not likely, we establish a valuation allowance. when we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in an accounting period, we record a corresponding tax expense in our statement of operations.
at july 31, 2016, we had net deferred tax assets of $132 million which included a valuation allowance of $40 million for loss and tax credit carryforwards related to state tax credits, foreign losses, and state capital and operating losses. we recorded the valuation allowance to reflect uncertainties about whether we will be able to utilize some of our deferred tax assets before they expire. while we believe our current valuation allowance is sufficient, we could in the future be required to increase the valuation allowance to take into account additional deferred tax assets that we may be unable to realize. we assess the need for an adjustment to the valuation allowance on a quarterly basis. the assessment is based on our estimates of future sources of taxable income for the jurisdictions in which we operate and the periods over which our deferred tax assets will be realizable. see note 10 to the financial statements in item 8 of this annual report for more information.
we recognize and measure benefits for uncertain tax positions using a two-step approach. the first step is to evaluate the tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon audit, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes. for tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement. significant judgment is required to evaluate uncertain tax positions. we evaluate our uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. our evaluations are based upon a number of factors, including changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, correspondence with tax authorities during the course of audits and effective settlement of audit issues. changes in the recognition or measurement of uncertain tax positions could result in material increases or decreases in our income tax expense in the period in which we make the change, which could have a material impact on our effective tax rate and operating results.

fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015
total net revenue increased $502 million or 12% in fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015. total net revenue results were affected by the fiscal 2015 changes we made to our desktop software offerings described in "executive overview - overview of financial results" earlier in this item 7. revenue in our small business segment increased 9% due to growth in small business online ecosystem revenue and the impact of the changes to our quickbooks desktop software products. the fiscal 2015 changes to our desktop software offerings also affected our proconnect segment, whose revenue increased 51% to $428 million in fiscal 2016. revenue in our consumer tax segment increased 10% due to 12% growth in u.s. federal turbotax units. see "segment results" later in this item 7 for more information.
operating income from continuing operations increased 68% in fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015 due in part to the increase in revenue described above. higher revenue was partially offset by higher costs and operating expenses. total operating expenses increased about $28 million for staffing, about $26 million for depreciation, about $10 million for advertising and other marketing programs, and about $34 million for share-based compensation. in fiscal 2015, we recorded goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges of $148 million for our consumer ecosystem reporting unit in operating expense. see "operating expenses" later in this item 7 for more information.
net income from continuing operations increased 95% in fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015 due to the increase in operating income and a lower effective tax rate in the fiscal 2016 period. see "non-operating income and expenses - income taxes" later in this item 7 for more information. diluted net income per share from continuing operations for fiscal 2016 increased 110% to $3.04 as a result of the increase in net income and the decline in weighted average diluted common shares compared with fiscal 2015.
fiscal 2015 compared with fiscal 2014
total net revenue decreased $51 million or 1% in fiscal 2015 compared with fiscal 2014 due to the fiscal 2015 changes we made to our desktop software offerings described in "executive overview - industry trends and seasonality" earlier in this item 7. revenue in our small business segment decreased 2% due to the impact of these changes on our quickbooks desktop offerings, which more than offset quickbooks online revenue growth. the fiscal 2015 changes to our desktop software offerings also affected our proconnect segment, whose revenue decreased 33% to $284 million in fiscal 2015. revenue in our consumer tax segment increased 8% due to 7% growth in u.s. federal turbotax units. see "segment results" later in this item 7 for more information.
operating income from continuing operations decreased 43% in fiscal 2015 compared with fiscal 2014 due to the impact of the changes we made to our desktop software offerings on fiscal 2015 revenue and due to higher costs and operating expenses. total operating expenses were $407 million higher in the fiscal 2015 period, including increases of about $96 million for staffing, about $57 million for share-based compensation, and about $38 million for outside services. we also recorded goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges of $148 million for our consumer ecosystem reporting unit in operating expense in fiscal 2015. see "cost of revenue" and "operating expenses" later in this item 7 for more information.
net income from continuing operations decreased 52% in fiscal 2015 compared with fiscal 2014 due to the decrease in operating income and a higher effective tax rate that related to the goodwill impairment charge in the fiscal 2015 period. see "non-operating income and expenses - income taxes" later in this item 7 for more information. diluted net income per share from continuing operations for fiscal 2015 decreased 51% to $1.45, in line with the decrease in net income for that period.
segment results the information below is organized in accordance with our three reportable segments. all of our segments operate primarily in the united states and sell primarily to customers in the united states. international total net revenue was less than 5% of consolidated total net revenue for all periods presented.
tables of contents segment operating income is segment net revenue less segment cost of revenue and operating expenses. segment expenses do not include certain costs, such as corporate selling and marketing, product development, and general and administrative expenses and share-based compensation expenses, which are not allocated to specific segments. these unallocated costs totaled $1.15 billion in fiscal 2016, $1.01 billion in fiscal 2015, and $870 million in fiscal 2014. unallocated costs increased in fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015 and in fiscal 2015 compared with fiscal 2014 due to increases in corporate product development and selling and marketing expenses in support of the growth of our businesses and to higher share-based compensation expenses. segment expenses also do not include amortization of acquired technology, amortization of other acquired intangible assets, and goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges. see note 14 to the financial statements in item 8 of this annual report for reconciliations of total segment operating income to consolidated operating income from continuing operations for each fiscal year presented.

fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015
small business segment total net revenue increased $185 million or 9% in fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015 due to growth in small business online ecosystem revenue and the impact of the fiscal 2015 changes we made to our quickbooks desktop offerings described in "executive overview - overview of financial results" earlier in this item 7. small business online ecosystem revenue grew 25%, driven by customer acquisition. quickbooks online subscribers grew 41% and online payroll customers grew 17%. active online payments customers grew 6% and online payments charge volume grew 15%. in our small business desktop ecosystem, revenue increased 4%. quickbooks desktop revenue increased due to 8% unit growth and the impact of the fiscal 2015 changes we made to our quickbooks desktop offerings. quickbooks enterprise revenue grew 27%. desktop payments revenue decreased 10% in fiscal 2016 as we focused resources on core offerings for quickbooks merchants and deemphasized certain non-quickbooks payments offerings.
small business segment operating income as a percentage of related revenue increased in fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015. the increase was due to the higher revenue described above and relatively stable spending during fiscal 2016.
fiscal 2015 compared with fiscal 2014
small business segment total net revenue decreased $50 million or 2% in fiscal 2015 compared with fiscal 2014 due to the impact of the fiscal 2015 changes we made to our quickbooks desktop offerings described in "executive overview - overview of financial results" earlier in this item 7, which more than offset small business online ecosystem revenue growth. small business online ecosystem revenue grew 25%, driven by customer acquisition. quickbooks online customers grew 57% and online payroll customers grew 18%. active online payments customers grew 5% and online payments charge
tables of contents volume grew 19%. in our small business desktop ecosystem, revenue declined 10%. quickbooks desktop unit sales were 22% lower as we continued to emphasize quickbooks online while quickbooks enterprise revenue grew 29%.
small business segment operating income as a percentage of related revenue decreased in fiscal 2015 compared with fiscal 2014. the decrease was due to the impact of the fiscal 2015 changes to our desktop software offerings on segment revenue and cost of revenue. we expense costs of product revenue as they are incurred for delivered software and we do not defer any of these costs when product revenue is deferred. small business segment operating income was also affected by higher expenses for data center hosting and facilities and outside services.

fiscal 2015 compared with fiscal 2014
total operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenue increased to 65% in fiscal 2015 from 55% in fiscal 2014 primarily due to the decrease in revenue during fiscal 2015. revenue decreased $51 million or 1% and total operating expenses increased $259 million, excluding the goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges in fiscal 2015. total net revenue results were affected by the fiscal 2015 changes we made to our desktop software offerings described in "executive overview - overview of financial results" earlier in this item 7. staffing expenses increased about $96 million due to higher headcount. operating expenses also increased about $38 million for outside services and about $57 million for share-based compensation expenses. general and administrative expenses were partially offset by a $32 million pre-tax net gain on the sale of certain assets related to our payments business. share-based compensation expenses were higher in fiscal 2015 due to our assumption of certain equity awards in connection with recent business combinations. share-based compensation expenses have also been increasing over time because the market price of our common stock has generally been increasing. as described in "critical accounting policies and estimates" earlier in this item 7, we also recorded $148 million in goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges for our consumer ecosystem reporting unit to operating expense in fiscal 2015.
non-operating income and expenses interest expense interest expense of $35 million in fiscal 2016 consisted primarily of interest on our senior notes, unsecured term loan, and unsecured revolving credit facilities. interest expense of $27 million in fiscal 2015 and $31 million in fiscal 2014 consisted primarily of interest on our senior notes. see note 8 and note 9 to the financial statements in item 8 of this annual report for more information.

interest income in fiscal 2016 was lower compared with fiscal 2015 due to lower average interest rates and lower average invested balances. higher average interest rates and stable average invested balances resulted in higher interest income in fiscal 2015 compared with fiscal 2014. in accordance with authoritative guidance, we record gains and losses associated with executive deferred compensation plan assets in interest and other income and gains and losses associated with the related liabilities in operating expenses. the total amounts recorded in operating expenses for each period are approximately equal to the total amounts recorded in interest and other income in those periods.
in fiscal 2014 we sold an available-for-sale equity security for $26 million and recorded the gain of $21 million in interest and other income on our statement of operations.
income taxes effective tax rate our effective tax rates for fiscal 2016, fiscal 2015, and fiscal 2014 were approximately 33%, 42%, and 34%. excluding discrete tax items primarily related to the goodwill impairment charge, our effective tax rate for fiscal 2015 was approximately 36%. the differences between these effective tax rates and the federal statutory rate of 35% were primarily related to the tax benefit received from the domestic production activities deduction and the federal research and experimentation credit, partially offset by state income taxes. see note 10 to the financial statements in item 8 of this annual report for more information about our effective tax rates.
net deferred tax assets at july 31, 2016, we had net deferred tax assets of $132 million which included a valuation allowance of $40 million for loss and tax credit carryforwards related to state tax credits, foreign losses, and state capital and operating losses. we recorded the valuation allowance to reflect uncertainties about whether we will be able to utilize some of our deferred tax assets before they expire. while we believe our current valuation allowance is sufficient, we could in the future be required to increase the valuation allowance to take into account additional deferred tax assets that we may be unable to realize. we assess the need for an adjustment to the valuation allowance on a quarterly basis. the assessment is based on our estimates of future sources of taxable income for the jurisdictions in which we operate and the periods over which our deferred tax assets will be realizable. see "critical accounting policies and estimates" earlier in this item 7 and note 10 to the financial statements in item 8 of this annual report for more information.
discontinued operations we have reclassified our statements of operations for all periods presented to reflect the businesses below as discontinued operations. see note 7 to the financial statements in item 8 of this annual report for a more complete description of these discontinued operations and the impact that they have had on our statements of operations for the fiscal periods presented.
in the third quarter of fiscal 2016 we sold our demandforce, quickbase, and quicken businesses for $463 million in cash. we recorded a pre-tax gain of $354 million and a net gain of $173 million on the disposal of these three businesses in fiscal 2016.
we sold our intuit financial services business in the first quarter of fiscal 2014 for $1.025 billion in cash. we recorded a $44 million pre-tax gain on disposal that was partially offset by a related income tax provision of approximately $8 million, resulting in a net gain on disposal of approximately $36 million. in the first quarter of fiscal 2014 we also sold our intuit health business for cash consideration that was not significant. we recorded a $4 million pre-tax loss on disposal that was more than offset by a related income tax benefit of approximately $14 million, resulting in a net gain on disposal of approximately $10 million.
tables of contents liquidity and capital resources overview at july 31, 2016, our cash, cash equivalents and investments totaled $1.1 billion, a decrease of $617 million from july 31, 2015 due to the factors described in "statements of cash flows" below. our primary sources of liquidity have been cash from operations, which entails the collection of accounts receivable for products and services, and borrowings under our credit facilities. our primary uses of cash have been for research and development programs, selling and marketing activities, capital projects, acquisitions of businesses, debt service costs, repurchases of our common stock under our stock repurchase programs, and the payment of cash dividends. as discussed in "executive overview - industry trends and seasonality" earlier in this item 7, our business is subject to significant seasonality. the balance of our cash, cash equivalents and investments generally fluctuates with that seasonal pattern. we believe the seasonality of our business is likely to continue in the future.
the following table summarizes selected measures of our liquidity and capital resources at the dates indicated:

we have historically generated significant cash from operations and we expect to continue to do so during fiscal 2017. our cash, cash equivalents, and investments totaled $1.1 billion at july 31, 2016, none of those funds were restricted, and approximately 82% of those funds were located in the u.s. our unsecured revolving credit facility is available to us for general corporate purposes, including future acquisitions and stock repurchases. at july 31, 2016, no amounts were outstanding under the revolving credit facility. see note 8 to the financial statements in item 8 of this annual report for more information.
we evaluate, on an ongoing basis, the merits of acquiring technology or businesses, or establishing strategic relationships with and investing in other companies. our strong liquidity profile enables us to respond nimbly to these kinds of opportunities.
based on past performance and current expectations, we believe that our cash and cash equivalents, investments, and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet anticipated seasonal working capital needs, capital expenditure requirements, contractual obligations, commitments, debt service requirements, and other liquidity requirements associated with our operations for at least the next 12 months. we expect to return excess cash generated by operations to our stockholders through repurchases of our common stock and payment of cash dividends, after taking into account our operating and strategic cash needs.

audit committee members: safra a. catz, d. jeremy darroch, francis a. desouza and derica w. rice (chair)
the audit committee is responsible for, among other things, overseeing the company's financial statements, internal controls, compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, internal audit function and company's relationship with its independent auditor. the committee also oversees cybersecurity and data security risks and mitigation strategies. the committee reviews the company's policies and practices with respect to risk assessment and risk management. the committee met 9 times during fiscal 2023. all of the members of the committee are independent within the meaning of sec regulations, the listing standards of the new york stock exchange and the company's corporate governance guidelines. the board has determined that all members of the committee, ms. catz, mr. darroch, mr. desouza and mr. rice, are qualified as audit committee financial experts within the meaning of sec regulations and that they have accounting and related financial management expertise within the meaning of the listing standards of the new york stock exchange. the board has determined that mr. rice's simultaneous service on the audit committees of more than three public companies will not impair his ability to effectively serve on the committee. in fiscal 2024, the board appointed mr. darroch to the committee and, following the annual meeting, mr. desouza will no longer be a member of the board.
corporate governance documents the board has adopted corporate governance guidelines, which set forth a flexible framework within which the board, assisted by its committees, directs the affairs of the company. the corporate governance guidelines address, among other things, the composition and functions of the board, director independence, stock ownership by and compensation of directors, management succession and review, board leadership, board committees and selection of new directors.
the company has standards of business conduct, which are applicable to all employees of the company, including the principal executive officer, the principal financial officer and the principal accounting officer. the board has a separate code of business conduct and ethics for directors, which contains provisions specifically applicable to directors.
each standing committee of the board is governed by a charter adopted by the board.
the corporate governance guidelines, the standards of business conduct, the code of business conduct and ethics for directors and each of the audit, compensation and governance and nominating committee charters are available on the company's investor relations website under the "corporate governance" heading at www.disney.com/investors and in print to any shareholder who requests them from the company's secretary. if the company amends or waives the code of business conduct and ethics for directors or the standards of business conduct with respect to the principal executive officer, principal financial officer or principal accounting officer, it will post the amendment or waiver at the same location on its website.
director selection process working closely with the full board, the governance and nominating committee develops criteria for open board positions. applying these criteria, the committee considers candidates for board membership suggested by committee members, other board members, management and shareholders. the committee retains third-party executive search firms to identify and review candidates and generate candidate pools consistent with the criteria below, upon request of the committee from time to time.
once the committee has identified a prospective nominee - including prospective nominees recommended by shareholders - it determines whether to conduct a full evaluation. the committee may request the third-party search firm to gather additional information about the prospective nominee's background and experience and to report its findings. the committee then evaluates the prospective nominee against the specific criteria that it has established for the position, as well as the standards and qualifications set out in the company's corporate governance guidelines, including but not limited to:
•the ability of the prospective nominee to represent the interests of the shareholders of the company;
•the ability of the prospective nominee to dedicate sufficient time, energy and attention to ensure the diligent performance of the prospective nominee's duties, including by attending shareholder meetings and meetings of the board and committees of the board of which such prospective nominee would be a member, and by reviewing in advance all meeting materials;
•the extent to which the prospective nominee contributes to the range of talent, skill and expertise appropriate for the board; and
•the extent to which the prospective nominee helps the board reflect the diversity of the company's shareholders, employees, customers and guests and the communities in which it operates.
after completing this evaluation and an interview, the committee makes a recommendation to the full board, which makes the final determination whether to nominate or appoint the new director after considering the committee's report.
in selecting director nominees, the board seeks to achieve a mix of members who together bring experience and personal backgrounds relevant to the company's strategic priorities and the scope and complexity of the company's business. the current nominees' qualifications set forth in their individual biographies under the section titled "directors" sets out how each of the current nominees (comprised of all current directors, other than mr. desouza, and mr. gorman) contributes to the mix of experience and qualifications the board seeks. the board also considers the tenure policy under the corporate governance guidelines, pursuant to which the board will not nominate for re-election any non-management director that completed fifteen years of service as a member of the board on or prior to the date of election or that turned 75 years of age or older in the calendar year preceding the related annual meeting, in each case, unless the board concludes that such director's continuing service would better serve the best interests of the shareholders. in addition, the board seeks candidates whose service on other boards will not adversely affect their ability to dedicate the requisite time to service on the board. the board believes that directors who are executive officers of public companies should not serve on more than two public company boards (including the board of the company) at a time, and that other directors should not serve on more than four public company boards (including the board of the company).
the committee regularly assesses the composition of the board and considers the extent to which the board continues to reflect the criteria set forth above. the committee identifies any gaps in skill sets to inform the search process. based on such assessment, the committee will recommend to the board the nomination for election or re-election of existing directors at the annual shareholders meeting. the board will review the committee's recommendation and evaluate which candidates to nominate for election or re-election.
as a result of a comprehensive search for directors that reflect its selection criteria discussed above, the board appointed two new directors: james gorman and jeremy darroch. recommendations: those who identified mr. gorman for consideration as a candidate included a third-party search firm and a non-management director. those who identified mr. darroch for consideration as a candidate included a third-party search firm, a non-management director, the chief executive officer ("ceo") and another executive officer.
a shareholder who wishes to recommend a prospective nominee for the board should notify the company's secretary or any member of the governance and nominating committee in writing with whatever supporting material the shareholder considers appropriate. the governance and nominating committee will also consider whether to nominate any person nominated by a shareholder pursuant to the provisions of the company's bylaws relating to shareholder nominations.

director compensation for fiscal 2023
the following table sets forth compensation earned during fiscal 2023 by each person who served as a non-employee director during the year.
fees earned or paid in cash. "fees earned or paid in cash" includes the annual board retainer and annual committee and committee-chair retainers, whether paid currently or deferred by the director to be paid in cash or shares after service ends. directors are permitted to elect each year to receive all or part of their retainers in disney stock and, whether paid in cash or stock, to defer all or part of their retainers until after service as a director ends. directors who elect to receive deferred compensation in cash receive a credit each quarter and the balance in their deferred cash account earns interest at an annual rate equal to 120% of the applicable long-term federal interest rate, as determined from time to time by the united states internal revenue service. for fiscal 2023, the average interest rate was 5.30%.
the following table sets forth the form of fees received by each director. the number of stock units awarded is equal to the dollar amount of fees accruing each quarter divided by the average over the last ten trading days of the quarter of the average of the high and low trading price for shares of company common stock on each day in the ten-day period. stock units distributed currently were accumulated throughout the year and distributed as shares following december 31, 2023.

stock awards. "stock awards" sets forth the market value of the deferred stock unit grants to directors and the amount reported is equal to the market value of the company's common stock on the date of the award times the number of shares underlying the units. units are awarded at the end of each quarter and the number of units is determined by dividing the amount payable with respect to the quarter by the average over the last ten trading days of the quarter of the average of the high and low trading price for shares of the company common stock on each day in the ten-day period. each director other than ms. everson, mr. parker and ms. arnold was awarded 2,721 units in fiscal 2023. ms. everson was awarded 2,346 units as she served only a portion of fiscal 2023. mr. parker and ms. arnold, who both served as independent chairman for a portion of fiscal 2023, were awarded 3,141 units and 1,731 units, respectively, in fiscal 2023 due to the annual retainer for independent chairman.
unless a director elects to defer receipt of shares until after the director's service ends, shares with respect to annual deferred stock unit grants are normally distributed to the director on the second anniversary of the award date, whether or not the director is still a director on the date of distribution.
at the end of any quarter in which dividends are distributed to shareholders, directors receive additional stock units with a value (based on the average of the high and low trading prices of the company common stock averaged over the last ten trading days of the quarter) equal to the amount of dividends they would have received on all stock units held by them at the end of the prior quarter. shares with respect to these additional units are distributed when the underlying units are distributed. units awarded in respect of dividends are included in the fair value of the stock units when the units are initially awarded and therefore are not included in the tables above, but they are included in the total units held at the end of the fiscal year in the table below.
the following table sets forth all stock units held by each non-management director serving during fiscal 2023, as of the end of fiscal 2023. all stock units are fully vested when granted, but shares are distributed with respect to the units only later, as described above. stock units in this table are included in the stock ownership table in item 12. security ownership of certain beneficial owners and management and related stockholder matters - "stock ownership" except to the extent they may have been distributed as shares and sold prior to the date of the stock ownership table.

the company's corporate governance guidelines encourage directors to own or acquire, within three years of first becoming a director, shares of company common stock (including stock units received as director compensation) having a market value of at least five times the amount of the annual board retainer for the director. unless the board exempts a director, each director is also required to retain stock representing no less than 50% of the after-tax value of exercised options and shares received upon distribution of deferred stock units until such director meets the stock holding guideline described above.
•the incremental cost to the company of perquisites and other personal benefits for ms. arnold, including security charges and product familiarization and travel benefits. in fiscal 2023, the company provided security services and equipment to ms. arnold totaling $20,185. except for ms. arnold, the value of perquisites and other benefits, including product familiarization and travel benefits, for each director is not included in the table as permitted by sec rules because the aggregate incremental cost to the company did not exceed $10,000 for such director.
•reimbursement of tax liabilities associated with the product familiarization and travel benefits. the reimbursement of associated tax liabilities was $1,681 for ms. arnold, $34,061 for ms. chang, $16,274 for mr. desouza, $13,394 for mr. froman, $7,903 for ms. lagomasino, $13,652 for mr. mcdonald, $7,533 for mr. parker and $9,224 for mr. rice.

executive compensation compensation discussion and analysis fiscal 2023 performance highlights as described in more detail under "executive compensation - compensation discussion and analysis - individual compensation decisions" below, our named executive officers ("neos") who remain with the company showed strong performance and leadership both in managing the company and in driving a transformation of our businesses, building long-term value. over the past century, we have built a strong foundation of creative excellence and innovation, which has only been reinforced by the important restructuring and cost efficiency work we've done this year. our new structure is restoring creativity to the center of our company. our results reflect the significant progress we've made on our priorities over the past year and while we still have work to do to continue improving performance, our progress has allowed us to move beyond this period of fixing and begin building our businesses again.
fiscal 2023 share price performance was challenging for the company. as we look forward, our leadership team remains focused on building long-term value for our shareholders, and our compensation committee remains committed to an executive compensation program that motivates executives to achieve these goals and aligns pay outcomes with company performance.
fiscal 2023 compensation practices executive compensation objectives and methods we maintain an integrated approach to attract and retain high-caliber executives in a competitive market for talent, while adhering to key corporate governance best practices summarized below.
shareholder engagement and responsiveness       independent members of the board and investor relations regularly engage in investor outreach. with regard to executive compensation, the compensation committee has addressed shareholder feedback and made changes to compensation for fiscal 2023, including:•upon hire, set the ceo's total direct compensation below the market median of our peers. in connection with his contract extension, mr. iger's target bonus increased to 500% of base salary, in order to align his target total direct compensation with the median. •utilized the structure of 60% of the ceo's fiscal 2023 equity award as performance-based restricted stock units ("pbus"), in response to feedback to prioritize pay for performance.•as financial uncertainties related to the pandemic have decreased, the portion of fiscal 2023 pbus vesting subject to return on invested capital ("roic") performance have a single 3-year performance period. in fiscal 2020 - 2022, pbus vesting subject to roic performance had three 1-year performance periods. •for the fiscal 2023 annual bonus plan, significantly increased the required adjusted revenue, adjusted segment operating income and adjusted after-tax free cash flow amounts to achieve target-level payouts year-over-year. specifically, targets were raised 10%, 35% and more than 100%, respectively. in addition, performance ranges were adjusted to further incentivize performance.•the compensation committee adopted a cash severance policy pursuant to which any cash severance payment will not exceed 2.99 times the sum of base salary plus target bonus for section 16 officers without shareholder approval of such payment.
incentive plan non-financial metrics            fiscal 2023 bonus plan maintains incorporation of diversity and inclusion, creativity and innovation and collaboration as key strategic objectives.
equity retention guidelines                     neos must hold a meaningful amount of the company's stock. the ceo must hold equity valued at five times his salary within five years of becoming ceo. other neos must hold equity valued at three times their salary within five years of becoming an executive officer.
compensation at risk                            a majority of neo compensation is tied to either short- or long-term company performance. for mr. iger in fiscal 2023, 96% of his total target compensation (including 60% of his annual equity grant, comprised of pbus) was tied to financial performance, contributions towards organization goals, equity compensation or stock price performance.
annual risk assessment                       each year, the compensation committee's compensation consultant completes a risk assessment of the company's compensation programs. based on this assessment for fiscal 2023, the compensation committee determined that risks arising from the company's policies and practices are not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the company.
clawback policies                            the company is required to recoup certain incentive-based compensation erroneously awarded to a current or former neo or other section 16 officers based on financial reporting measures that are required to be restated. in addition, under the 2011 stock incentive plan, equity awards pursuant to the plan may be clawed back where there is reputational or financial harm to the company.
disallow hedging and pledging                board members, neos and all other section 16 filers are prohibited from hedging and pledging the company's securities.
no option re-pricing or cash buyouts         the company does not allow re-pricing or cash buyouts of underwater stock options without shareholder approval.
independent compensation consultant          the compensation committee has retained a compensation consultant whose relationship with the company was confirmed to be independent for fiscal 2023.
ceo security &amp; aircraft usage            given the unique security risks posed by the position, the company pays the cost of security services and equipment for the ceo in an amount that the board believes is reasonable in light of the security needs and, in the interest of security, requires the ceo to use corporate aircraft for all personal travel.
executive compensation program structure - objectives and methods we design our executive compensation program to drive the creation of long-term shareholder value. we do this by linking compensation payouts to the achievement of preset performance goals that promote the creation of sustainable shareholder value and by designing compensation to attract and retain high-caliber executives in a competitive market for talent. we aim to provide compensation opportunities that take into account compensation levels and practices of our peers. for a more detailed description of the peer groups we use for compensation purposes, see the discussion under the heading, "executive compensation - other compensation information - peer groups," set forth below. total direct compensation comprises a mix of variable and fixed compensation that is heavily weighted toward variable performance-based compensation. our performance-based compensation includes a short-term annual performance-based bonus and longer-term equity awards that deliver value based on stock price performance. our performance-based compensation also includes pbus, which vest only upon meeting performance targets. as prospective performance targets are central to our business strategy, for competitive reasons we do not publicly disclose them for either the short-term annual performance-based bonus plan or the long-term incentive plan. the company enters into employment agreements with our senior executives when the compensation committee determines that it is appropriate to attract or retain an executive or where an employment agreement is consistent with our practices with respect to other similarly situated executives.
the following table sets forth the elements of total direct compensation in fiscal 2023 and the objectives and key features of each element:
objectives and key features salaryobjectives:the compensation committee sets salaries to reflect job responsibilities and to provide competitive fixed pay to balance performance-based risks.key features:•minimum salaries set in employment agreement•committee discretion to adjust annually based on changes in experience, nature and responsibility of the position, competitive considerations and ceo recommendation (except in the case of the ceo)
performance-based bonusobjectives:the compensation committee structures the bonus program to incentivize performance at the high end of the financial performance measure ranges that it establishes each year. the committee believes that incentivizing performance in this fashion will lead to long-term, sustainable gains in shareholder value.key features:•target bonus for each neo set by the committee early in the fiscal year in light of employment agreement provisions, competitive considerations, ceo recommendation (except targets for the ceo) and other factors the committee deems appropriate; bonus opportunity normally limited to 200% of target bonus•unless otherwise adjusted downward by the committee, payout on 70% of target is formulaic and determined by performance against financial performance ranges developed by the committee early in the fiscal year•unless otherwise determined by the committee, payout on 30% of target determined by company-wide other performance factors and the committee's assessment of individual performance based both on other performance objectives and on ceo recommendation (except the payouts for the ceo)
equity awardsobjectives:the compensation committee structures equity awards to directly reward long-term gains in shareholder value. equity awards carry vesting terms that now extend for three years and include pbus whose value depends on company performance, including performance relative to the s&amp;p 500. these awards provide incentives to create and sustain long-term growth in shareholder value.key features:•combined value of options, performance units and time-based units determined by the committee in light of employment agreement provisions, competitive market conditions, evaluation of executive's performance and ceo recommendation (except awards for the ceo)•allocation of annual awards for ceo: 60% pbus and 40% stock options•allocation of annual awards for other neos (other than the interim cfo and senior executive vice president &amp; chief human resources officer, as their awards relate to their prior roles) in fiscal 2023 (based on award value): 50% pbus; 25% time-based restricted stock units; 25% stock options annual performance-based restricted stock unitskey features:•pbus reward executives only if preset performance targets are met•pbus vest subject to the level of achievement under multi-year performance tests. starting with fiscal 2022 awards, payout ranges from 0% if performance is under threshold to up to 200% if performance is at maximum•half of awards vest based on three-year cumulative total shareholder return ("tsr") relative to the s&amp;p 500 (two years for mr. iger in fiscal 2023); the other half vest based on three-year roic performance (two years for mr. iger in fiscal 2023). awards as described in the section titled "executive compensation - compensation tables - fiscal 2023 grants of plan based awards table"
stock option awardskey features:•exercise price equal to average of the high and low trading prices on day of award•option re-pricing without shareholder approval is prohibited•ten-year term•vest one-third per year annual time-based restricted stock unitskey features:•vest one-third per year•for fiscal 2023, mr. iger did not receive time-based rsus compensation at risk the compensation committee believes that most of the compensation for neos should be at risk and tied to a combination of long-term and short-term company performance. in fiscal 2023, our neos consisted of mr. iger, mr. lansberry, mr. gutierrez, ms. schake, ms. coleman, mr. chapek and ms. mccarthy.
in establishing a mix of fixed to variable compensation, the composition of equity awards, target bonus levels, grant date equity award values and performance ranges, the committee seeks to maintain its goal of making compensation overwhelmingly tied to performance, while also providing compensation opportunities that are competitive with alternatives available to the executive. in particular, the committee expects that performance at the high-end of ranges will result in overall compensation that is sufficiently attractive relative to compensation available at successful competitors and that performance at the low-end of ranges will result in overall compensation that is less than that available from competitors with more successful performance.
the following charts show the percentage of the target total direct annual compensation for first, mr. iger, and second, all neos other than mr. iger and mr. chapek, that is variable or at risk versus being fixed with respect to fiscal 2023. at risk compensation includes both the target performance-based cash bonus and equity awards while the only fixed component of pay is base salary.
*target mix for fiscal 2023 compensation, including the proration of mr. iger's fiscal 2023 target annual incentive. mr. iger's target fiscal 2024 compensation will be 97% at risk compensation: 3% base salary, 16% target annual incentive, 49% pbus and 32% stock options.         ** target mix for fiscal 2023 compensation. includes target compensation for all neos other than mr. iger and mr. chapek.
beginning in fiscal 2022, the compensation committee determined to increase pbus from 30% to 50% of the overall long-term incentive grant value for the neos other than the ceo, who already had 50% in the form of pbus (and who has 60% in the form of pbus for fiscal 2023). this shift reflects a meaningful increase in performance-based compensation and was directly responsive to shareholder feedback. the below table reflects the annual pbu grants vesting over the last five years, all of which resulted in below target payouts:
value of a $100.00 pbu grant, as of vest date1                   $133.58               $95.87               $64.37               $30.49               $35.85
1assumes stock purchase was made at the closing price of the grant date and sold on the third anniversary of grant date (or the nearest trading date if third anniversary falls on a non-trading day) and then adjusted for the actual % payout. awards vested in 2019 were granted on december 21, 2016; awards vested in 2020 were granted on december 19, 2017; awards vested in 2021 were granted on december 19, 2018; awards vested in 2022 were granted on december 17, 2019; awards vested in 2023 were granted on december 17, 2020.
for awards granted in fiscal 2021 (december 2020) and vested in fiscal 2024 (december 2023), tsr performance relative to the s&p 500 was below threshold and therefore no payout was earned for 50% of the award. for the 50% of the award that vested subject to roic performance, there were three one-year performance periods for fiscal 2021, fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2023 with payout at the following percentages:
•fiscal 2023: 103.38% of target fiscal 2023 had a threshold, target and maximum of 3.1%, 5.6% and 6.9%, respectively. actual fiscal 2023 performance was just over 5.7%, resulting in a 103.38% payout for the fiscal 2023 portion. overall, the fiscal 2021 pbus vested at 66.9%, underscoring the committee's belief that this pbu structure strongly aligns pay and performance.
the fiscal 2023 roic test also applied to the outstanding pbu grants made in fiscal 2022 (december 2021). for these awards, maximum payout increased from 150% to 200% of target, consistent with market practice. actual fiscal 2023 roic performance was just over 5.7%, which resulted in a 106.75% payout for the fiscal 2023 portion of the december 2021 roic test.
roic for the company is calculated by dividing annual after-tax operating performance by the average of invested capital at the end of such fiscal year and the end of the immediately prior fiscal year. annual after-tax operating performance is calculated as the sum of segment operating income for each segment and corporate and unallocated shared expenses, minus tax at 21% on segment operating income and corporate and unallocated shared expenses. invested capital is defined as the remainder of disney's total assets at fiscal year end minus the sum of: (i) disney's cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash as the last day of the fiscal year, (ii) disney's deferred tax assets and (iii) disney's non-interest bearing liabilities. roic for the company is adjusted (i) to exclude the effect of extraordinary, unusual and/or nonrecurring items and (ii) to reflect such other factors, as the committee deems appropriate to fairly reflect roic for the applicable fiscal year.
compensation process the following table outlines the process for determining annual compensation awards for neos:
salaries                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  performance-based bonus

•administers those programs and policies as directed by the committee;
•provides an ongoing review of the effectiveness of the compensation programs, including competitiveness and alignment with the company's objectives; and
•recommends changes to compensation programs if needed to help achieve program objectives.
the committee meets regularly in executive session without management present to discuss compensation decisions and matters relating to the design and operation of the executive compensation program.
compensation consultant the compensation committee retained pay governance llc as the compensation consultant for fiscal 2023. the consultant assists the committee's development and evaluation of compensation policies and practices and the committee's determinations of compensation awards through various services, including providing third-party data, advice and expertise on proposed executive compensation awards and plan designs; reviewing briefing materials prepared by management and outside advisers; and advising the committee on the matters included in these materials and preparing its own analysis of compensation matters.
the committee considers input from the consultant as one factor in making decisions on compensation matters, along with information and analyses it receives from management and its own judgment and experience.
the committee has adopted a policy requiring its consultant to be independent of company management. the committee performs an annual assessment of the consultant's independence to determine whether the consultant is independent. the committee assessed pay governance llc's independence in november 2023 and confirmed that the firm's work has not raised any conflict of interest and the firm is independent. pay governance llc does not provide any services to the company other than the services provided to the compensation committee.
fiscal 2023 compensation decisions this section discusses the specific decisions made by the compensation committee in fiscal 2023. these decisions were made taking into consideration shareholder feedback received as members of management and the board engaged in outreach to shareholders. the board took several actions in response to the shareholder feedback received.
2023 annual incentive plan performance goals the compensation committee normally develops performance goals for each fiscal year early in that year and evaluates performance against those goals after the fiscal year has ended to arrive at its compensation decisions.
annual incentive goals annual incentive financial performance in november 2022, the compensation committee reviewed the annual performance-based bonus program. the committee determined to retain the financial measures and relative weights for calculating the portion of the neos bonuses that is based on financial performance as follows:
the committee also developed performance ranges for each of the measures in november 2022. these ranges are used to determine the multiplier that is applied to 70% of each neo's target bonus. the overall financial performance multiple is equal to the weighted average of the performance multiples for each of these three measures. the performance multiple for each measure is zero if performance is below the bottom of the range and varies from 35% at the low end of the range to a maximum of 200% at the top end of the range. the committee believes the top of each range represents extraordinary performance and the bottom represents satisfactory performance, below which no award would be provided. in addition, 30% of each neo's target bonus is based on performance against key strategic goals for the company, called "other performance factors." we believe the mix between key financial and strategic factors is appropriate, given the majority of the bonus opportunity is focused on company financial performance, while still recognizing the importance that other performance factors have on establishing a successful culture that supports the company's strategic goals.
with our desire to deliver strong results for our shareholders for fiscal 2023, the committee meaningfully increased performance targets year-over-year for all three financial metrics (increases were 10% for adjusted revenue, 35% for adjusted segment operating income and more than 100% for adjusted after-tax free cash flow). in addition, in order to further drive performance in fiscal 2023, the committee: (i) expanded the width of the performance range (i.e., the difference between the maximum performance and threshold performance) for adjusted after-tax free cash flow and (ii) increased the maximum performance and threshold performance for adjusted segment operating income and adjusted revenue, respectively. the following table shows the performance ranges approved by the committee for fiscal 2023 and actual performance (dollars in millions):

*    for purposes of the annual performance-based bonuses, "adjusted segment operating income" was defined as total segment operating income and reflects adjustments, if any, described under "evaluating performance" below. "total segment operating income" consists of the total of segment operating income from each of our segments, which is equivalent to income from continuing operations before income taxes, adjusted for corporate and unallocated shared expenses, restructuring and impairment charges, a+e gain, net other income, net interest expense and amortization of tfcf corporation ("tfcf") and hulu intangible assets and fair value step-up on film and television costs.
**    for purposes of the annual performance-based bonuses, "adjusted after-tax free cash flow" was defined as cash provided by operations less investments in parks, resorts and other properties, all on a consolidated basis and reflects the adjustments described under "evaluating performance" below.
other performance factors for fiscal 2023, the other performance factors for the fiscal 2023 annual bonus, developed by the compensation committee during the fiscal year, continued to emphasize the importance of diversity and inclusion, which had the highest weighting among the other performance factors. the committee established the following factors based on the strategic objectives of the company:
•diversity & inclusion - actively engage in creating a culture of respect for everyone, everywhere, at every level. work to grow the diversity of our executives and managers to reflect the guests and audiences we serve. support broadly resonant entertainment and experiences that reflect the world around us and help us develop meaningful relationships with our consumers.
•collaboration on strategic priorities - actively promote collaboration and synergy on key strategic priorities of the company with a one-company mindset and drive clear accountabilities and partnership across all lines of business, in support of developing content and product for our key franchises, accelerating our direct-to-consumer initiatives and enabling the success of creative, operating and corporate teams.
•efforts towards creativity & innovation - drive company growth through innovation and the creation of potential new sources of revenue while ensuring strong controls on costs and operational efficiencies.
evaluating performance the compensation committee reviewed the overall operating results of the company in fiscal 2023, evaluating them against the bonus plan performance ranges developed by the committee early in the fiscal year. the compensation committee approved no adjustments to actual fiscal 2023 total segment operating income and revenue. after-tax free cash flow performance for incentive purposes was overall adjusted downward to exclude the content spend benefit of the writers guild of america and sag-aftra work stoppages and the deferral in the timing of income tax payments as well as non-recurring items, such as restructuring payments.
in fiscal 2023, the company achieved strong financial growth for all three financial metrics, even after ranges were significantly increased for fiscal 2023 and after-tax free cash flow was adjusted as discussed above. the financial performance achieved included: total segment operating income of $12,863 million, revenue of $88,898 million and adjusted after-tax free cash flow of $2,449 million. based on these adjusted results and due to the increase in targets, the weighted financial performance factor was 99% in fiscal 2023 compared to a weighted financial performance factor of 159% in fiscal 2022. as referenced above, and in order to responsibly assess performance, management suggested, and the committee decided, to adjust after-tax free cash flow downward to exclude the content spend benefit of the writers guild of america and sag-aftra work stoppages and the deferral in the timing of income tax payments. had the committee not opted to adjust for these one-time events, after-tax free cash flow would have been $5,209 million and that portion of the bonus plan would have paid out at 200%. overall, the weighted financial performance factor would have been 116%. additional details regarding the performance of the company are set forth in our annual report on form 10-k for fiscal 2023.
with respect to the other performance factors, the committee recognizes that while we still have more work ahead of us, the neos delivered results on these key strategic objectives, including:

•the company expanded efforts to increase diverse representation, which helped produce year-over-year growth, especially at the executive and management levels. representation for women increased 0.1 and 0.5 percentage points at the executive and management levels, respectively. representation for people of color increased 1.0 percentage points at each of the executive and management levels. for more detailed results, please see our diversity dashboard on the "esg reporting" page of our impact website. the diversity dashboard includes our commitment to further disclosures in the future.

2023 equity awards the compensation committee structures equity awards to directly reward long-term gains in shareholder value. equity awards carry vesting terms that now extend for three years and include pbus whose value depends on company performance, including performance relative to the s&p 500. these awards provide incentives to create and sustain long-term growth in shareholder value.
•combined value of options, performance units and time-based units determined by the committee in light of employment agreement provisions, competitive market conditions, evaluation of executive's performance and ceo recommendation (except awards for the ceo)
•allocation of annual awards for ceo: 60% pbus and 40% stock options
•allocation of annual awards for other neos in fiscal 2023 (based on award value): 50% pbus; 25% time-based restricted stock units ("rsus"); 25% stock options. for most equity recipients other than the executive officers, the fiscal 2023 annual grant was split into two equal installments, with the first half being granted on december 15, 2022 and the second half being granted on july 17, 2023. as both mr. lansberry and ms. coleman were not serving as executive officers at the time of the first installment of the annual grant, consistent with the treatment for most equity recipients other than the executive officers, they received their fiscal 2023 equity awards in two equal installments. as fiscal 2023 awards relate to time in their prior roles, mr. lansberry and ms. coleman received their equity in the allocation typical of executives at their respective levels. mr. lansberry's award was allocated as 70% rsus and 30% stock options (i.e. the standard executive vice president allocation) and ms. coleman's award was allocated as 100% rsus (i.e. the standard senior vice president allocation). ms. coleman received a promotion award in june in connection with her promotion to senior executive vice president and chief human resources officer, which was delivered with the same allocation as other neos: 50% pbus; 25% rsus; 25% stock options.
time-based restricted stock units
•rsus provide retention value to our senior executives and align interests with our shareholders.
•in fiscal 2023, mr. iger did not receive rsus as part of his equity allocation. other neos receive 25% of their total equity value in rsus.
stock options
•stock options incentivize sustained growth in long-term stock appreciation and align interests with our shareholders.
•option re-pricing without shareholder approval is prohibited.
•options have a ten-year term from the grant date.
•options vest one-third per year.
•mr. iger receives 40% of his total equity value in stock options. other neos receive 25% of their total equity value in stock options.
performance-based restricted stock units
•pbus align pay and performance by ensuring that shares are only earned when certain performance criteria are met. 50% of pbus vest based on tsr performance relative to the s&p 500; 50% of pbus vest based on roic performance.
•performance is measured over a three-year performance period (two-year performance period for mr. iger in fiscal 2023). as financial uncertainties related to the pandemic have mostly abated, the portion of fiscal 2023 pbus vesting subject to roic performance have a single 3-year performance period. in fiscal 2020 - 2022, pbus vesting subject to roic performance had three 1-year performance periods.
•starting with fiscal 2022 awards, payout ranges from 0% if performance is under threshold to up to 200% if performance is at maximum.
•for the portion vesting subject to tsr relative to the s&p 500, payout at target requires performance at the 55th percentile of the s&p 500.
payout as a % of target        performance - tsr percentile relative to s&amp;p 500
•as pay-for-performance alignment is key to the committee, pbus are weighted the highest of the three equity vehicles. mr. iger receives 60% of his total equity value in pbus. other neos receive 50% of their total equity value in pbus.
for awards granted in fiscal 2020 (december 2019) and vested in fiscal 2023 (december 2022), tsr performance relative to the s&p 500 was below threshold and therefore no payout was earned for 50% of the award. for the 50% of the award that vested subject to roic performance, there were three one-year performance periods for fiscal 2020, fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2022. overall, fiscal 2020 pbus paid out at:
•total payout: 49.7% of target the below-target payout underscores the committee's belief that this pbu structure strongly aligns pay and performance.
for awards granted in fiscal 2021 (december 2020) and vested in fiscal 2024 (december 2023), tsr performance relative to the s&p 500 was below threshold and therefore no payout was earned for 50% of the award. for the 50% of the award that vested subject to roic performance, there were three one-year performance periods for fiscal 2021, fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2023. overall, fiscal 2021 pbus paid out at:
•total payout: 66.9% of target the below-target payout underscores the committee's belief that this pbu structure strongly aligns pay and performance.
individual compensation decisions annual compensation decisions the following table summarizes annual compensation decisions made by the compensation committee with respect to each of the neos. the committee established the salary and performance-based bonus target multiple of salary for each of the neos early in the fiscal year following the processes described above. the final bonus award was calculated after the fiscal year ended using the financial performance factor of 99% described above. given the enterprise-wide nature of the other performance factors and the contributions of each currently employed neo, the committee established an other performance factor for the neos listed in the following table below.

the compensation set forth above and described below differs from the total compensation reported in the summary compensation table as follows:
•the compensation set forth above does not include the change in pension value and non-qualified deferred compensation earnings, as these items do not reflect decisions made by the committee during the fiscal year.
•the compensation set forth above does not include perquisites and benefits and other compensation, as these items are generally determined by contract and do not reflect decisions made by the committee during the fiscal year.
the compensation committee's determination on each of these matters was based on the recommendation of mr. iger (except in the case of his own compensation), the parameters established by the executive's employment agreement and the factors described below. in determining equity awards, the committee considered its overall long-term incentive guidelines for all executives, which, in the context of the competitive market for executive talent, attempt to balance the benefits of incentive compensation tied to performance of the company's common stock with the dilutive effect of equity compensation awards.

other compensation information risk management considerations the compensation committee believes that the following features of performance-based bonus and equity programs appropriately incentivize the creation of long-term shareholder value while discouraging behavior that could lead to excessive risk:
•financial performance measures. the financial metrics used to determine the amount of an executive's bonus are measures the committee believes drive long-term shareholder value. the ranges set for these measures are intended to reward success without encouraging excessive risk-taking.
•limit on bonus. the overall bonus opportunity is not expected to exceed two times the target amount, no matter how much financial performance exceeds the ranges established at the beginning of the fiscal year.
•equity vesting periods. performance-based stock units generally vest in three years. time-based stock units and options vest annually for up to four years and options remain exercisable for ten years. these periods are designed to reward sustained performance over several periods, rather than performance in a single period.
•equity retention guidelines. neos are required to acquire within five years of becoming an executive officer and hold as long as they are executive officers of the company, shares (including restricted stock units) having a value of at least three times their base salary amounts, or five times in the case of the chief executive officer. if these levels have not been reached, these officers are required to retain ownership of shares representing at least 75% of the net after-tax gain (100% in the case of the chief executive officer) realized on exercise of options for a minimum of twelve months.
•no hedging or pledging. the company's insider trading compliance program prohibits members of the board of directors, neos and all other employees subject to the company's insider trading compliance program from entering into any transaction designed to hedge, or having the effect of hedging, the economic risk of owning the company's securities and prohibits certain persons, including members of the board of directors and the neos, from pledging company securities.
•clawback policy. in connection with the sec's and nyse's recently-approved rules requiring adoption of a clawback policy applicable to incentive-based compensation for section 16 officers of listed companies, the company has adopted the walt disney company clawback policy, and current section 16 officers of the company have agreed in writing that employment agreements and other compensation agreements and plans are subject to the policy. under such policy, if the company is required to restate its financial results due to material noncompliance with financial reporting requirements under the securities laws, the company will recoup any erroneously awarded incentive-based compensation from the company's current and former executive officers. further, under the 2011 stock incentive plan approved at the company's 2020 annual meeting, equity awards pursuant to the plan may be clawed back where there is reputational or financial harm to the company, even in the absence of a restatement.
equity awards are generally approved on dates the compensation committee meets. committee meetings are normally scheduled well in advance and are not scheduled with an eye to announcements of material information regarding the company. the committee may make an award with an effective date in the future, including awards contingent on commencement of employment, execution of a new employment agreement or some other subsequent event, or may act by unanimous written consent on the date of such an event when the proposed issuances have been reviewed by the committee prior to the date of the event.
at the compensation committee's request, management conducted its annual assessment of the risk profile of our compensation programs in november 2023. the assessment included an inventory of the compensation programs at each of the company's segments and an evaluation of whether any program contained elements that created risks that could have a material adverse impact on the company. management provided the results of this assessment to pay governance llc, the committee's compensation consultant, which evaluated the findings and reviewed them with the committee. as a result of this review, the committee determined that the risks arising from the company's policies and practices are not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the company.
peer groups summary of peer groups the following graph summarizes the three distinct peer groups we use for three distinct purposes and the companies that met these criteria and were included at the beginning of fiscal 2023, described in more detail below:
performance peers s&amp;p 500
•alphabet, inc.•amazon.com, inc.•apple, inc.•at&amp;t inc.•charter communications, inc.         •comcast corporation•ibm corporation•meta platforms, inc.•microsoft corporation•netflix, inc.•nike, inc.       •oracle corporation•paramount global•verizon communications inc.•warner bros. discovery, inc.
•alphabet, inc.•amazon.com, inc.•apple, inc.                                                    •comcast corporation•meta platforms, inc.                                                                      •netflix, inc.•paramount global•warner bros. discovery, inc.
media industry peers the media industry peer group helps evaluate compensation levels for the neos. the compensation committee believes that there is a limited pool of talent with the set of creative and organizational skills needed to run a global creative organization like the company. the committee also understands that executives with the background needed to manage a company such as ours have career options with compensation opportunities that normally exceed those available in most other industries, and that compensation levels within the peer group are driven by the dynamics of compensation in the entertainment industry and not the ownership structure of a particular company. accordingly, the market for executive talent to lead the company, and the group against which to compare our executive compensation, is best represented by the companies in our media industry peer group.
general industry peers the general industry peer group helps evaluate general compensation structure, policies and practices. the compensation committee believes that the features of the company's overall compensation structure, policies and practices should normally be consistent for all executives. because our operations span multiple industries, the committee believes that a consistent approach across the breadth of the company's operations with respect to features of our overall executive compensation structure is best achieved by reference to a group of general industry peers that is broader than the media industry peers.
the peer group used for establishing compensation structure, policies and practices consists of companies that have:
•a consumer orientation and/or strong brand recognition;
•as a general matter, a market capitalization in the range of approximately one-quarter to four times our market capitalization.
additionally, the general industry peer group includes companies that do not meet the revenue or market cap test, but that are included in the peer groups used by one or more of the media industry peers.
performance peers the performance peers help evaluate relative economic performance of the company. the overall financial performance of the company is driven by the company's diverse businesses, which compete in multiple sectors of the overall market. the compensation committee believes that, given the span of the company's businesses, the best measure of relative performance is how the company's diverse businesses have fared in the face of the economic trends that impact companies in the overall market and that the best benchmark for measuring such success is the company's relative performance compared to that of the companies comprising the s&p 500. accordingly, the committee has selected the s&p 500 to set the context for evaluating the company's performance and to measure relative performance for pbu awards.
the committee will continue to monitor the competitive landscapes in which the company's various business units operate and implement changes to the peer group as it deems appropriate.
deductibility of compensation for taxable years commencing after 2017, section 162(m) of the internal revenue code generally disallows a tax deduction to public corporations for compensation over $1 million paid to any person whose compensation was required to be included in this report for any fiscal year after 2016 because such person was either the company's chief executive officer or chief financial officer or was one of the company's three other most highly compensated executive officers for such fiscal year. accordingly, to the extent that compensation in excess of $1 million is payable to any such person in any fiscal year after fiscal 2018, such excess amount is likely to be non-deductible by the company for federal income tax purposes. however, section 162(m) exempts qualifying performance-based compensation paid after fiscal 2018 pursuant to a binding written agreement in effect on november 2, 2017. thus, performance-based awards that were outstanding on that date or awarded thereafter pursuant to a binding written agreement can be exempt from the deduction limit if applicable requirements are met. for fiscal 2023, none of the executive officers served under employment agreements that were in place without amendment prior to november 2, 2017.
however, awards to executive officers under the annual performance-based bonus program and the long-term incentive program that were (i) granted prior to november 2, 2017, or (ii) may continue to qualify for the exemption because they were granted pursuant to a binding written agreement in effect on such date, have been or will be made payable or vest subject to achievement of a performance test based on adjusted net income in order to qualify for the exemption from section 162(m), to the extent available. if this test is satisfied, the additional performance tests described in the compensation discussion and analysis are applied to determine the actual payout of such bonuses and awards, which in order to remain deductible may not be more than the maximum level funded based on achievement of the section 162(m) test. adjusted net income means net income adjusted, as appropriate, to exclude the following items or variances: change in accounting principles; acquisitions; dispositions of a business; asset impairments; restructuring charges; extraordinary, unusual or infrequent items; and extraordinary litigation costs and insurance recoveries. for fiscal 2023, the adjusted net income target was $3.5 billion and the company achieved adjusted net income of $6.9 billion. net income was adjusted to account for transaction purchase accounting, restructuring and impairment charges, gain on sale of equity investments, content license early termination and legal compliance.
therefore, we believe the section 162(m) test was satisfied with respect to restricted stock units vesting based on fiscal 2023 results.
compensation committee report the compensation committee has:
1.reviewed and discussed the compensation discussion and analysis required by item 402(b) of regulation s-k with management; and
2.based on this review and discussion, recommended to the board of directors that the compensation discussion and analysis be included in the company's annual report on form 10-k, amendment to its annual report on form 10-k/a and proxy statement relating to the 2024 annual meeting of shareholders.

stock awards for each fiscal year include awards subject to performance conditions that were valued based on the probability that performance targets will be achieved. for mr. iger, mr. gutierrez, ms. schake, mr. chapek and ms. mccarthy, fiscal 2023 includes $1,103,364, $556,679, $3,712, $1,324,503 and $953,844, respectively, related to the portion of awards from fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2022 having roic targets, which were established on november 29, 2022. assuming the highest level of performance conditions are achieved, the grant date stock awards values are outlined below:
in fiscal 2020, mr. iger served as chief executive officer until february 24, 2020, when he was appointed executive chairman. mr. chapek was appointed chief executive officer on february 24, 2020 and served as chief executive officer until november 20, 2022, at which time mr. iger again assumed the role of chief executive officer. in fiscal 2022, mr. chapek was entitled to receive compensation under the annual performance-based bonus program pursuant to his employment agreement because his termination occurred after the end of the fiscal year. for details on the treatment of mr. chapek's equity awards following his separation from the company, please see the section titled "executive compensation - compensation tables - potential payments and rights on termination or change in control - termination pursuant to company termination right other than for cause or by executive for good reason" below.
ms. mccarthy began a leave of absence on july 1, 2023, at which point she ceased to serve as senior executive vice president and chief financial officer, and began serving as strategic advisor. on july 1, 2023, mr. lansberry began serving as interim cfo, remaining in this role through the end of fiscal 2023 and until hugh johnston joined the company on december 4, 2023.
mr. gutierrez joined the company on february 1, 2022. in connection with his hiring, mr. gutierrez received a cash sign-on bonus of $2,000,000, primarily to replace forgone compensation from his previous employer.
ms. schake joined the company on april 1, 2022 as executive vice president, global communications. in connection with her hiring, ms. schake received a cash sign-on bonus of $1,500,000 given her outstanding qualifications and extraordinary experience in both the public and private sectors, and to secure her acceptance of employment with the company. on june 29, 2022, ms. schake was promoted to senior executive vice president and chief communications officer.
salary. this column sets forth the base salary earned during each fiscal year. on july 1, 2023, ms. mccarthy began a leave of absence and started serving in her new role as strategic advisor. in her capacity as strategic advisor, for fiscal 2023 she received $517,500.
stock awards. this column sets forth the grant date fair value of the restricted stock unit awards granted to the neos during each fiscal year as part of the company's long-term incentive compensation program. the grant date fair value of these awards was calculated by multiplying the number of units awarded by the average of the high and low trading price of the company's common stock on the grant date, subject to valuation adjustments for restricted stock unit awards subject to vesting conditions other than, with respect to certain legacy awards to ms. mccarthy, the test to assure deductibility under section 162(m) of the internal revenue code. the valuation adjustments for performance-based awards reflect the fact that the number of shares received on vesting varies based on the level of performance achieved and were determined using a monte carlo simulation that determines the probability that the performance targets will be achieved. the grant date fair value of the restricted stock unit awards granted during fiscal 2023 is also included in the fiscal 2023 grants of plan based awards table.
option awards. this column sets forth the grant date fair value of options to purchase shares of the company's common stock granted to the neos during each fiscal year. the grant date fair value of these options was calculated using a binomial option pricing model. the assumptions used in estimating the fair value of these options are set forth in footnote 12 to the company's audited financial statements for fiscal 2023. the grant date fair value of the options granted during fiscal 2023 is also included in the fiscal 2023 grants of plan based awards table.
non-equity incentive plan compensation. this column sets forth the amount of compensation earned by the neos under the company's annual performance-based bonus program during each fiscal year. a description of the company's annual performance-based bonus program is included in the section "executive compensation - compensation discussion and analysis - executive compensation program structure-objectives and methods" and the determination of performance-based bonuses for fiscal 2023 is described in the section "executive compensation - compensation discussion and analysis - fiscal 2023 compensation decisions."
change in pension value and non-qualified deferred compensation earnings. this column reflects the aggregate change in the actuarial present value of each neo's accumulated benefits under all defined benefit plans, including supplemental plans, during each fiscal year. the amounts reported in this column vary with a number of factors, including the discount rate applied to determine the value of future payment streams, the neo's age and additional earned benefits as a result of an additional year of service. the discount rate used pursuant to pension accounting rules to calculate the present value of future payments for fiscal 2021 was 2.88%, for fiscal 2022 was 5.44% and for fiscal 2023 was 5.94%. neither increases nor decreases in pension value resulting from changes in the discount rate result in any increase or decrease in benefits payable to participants under the plan. as mr. gutierrez and ms. schake joined the company in 2022, they are not eligible for the company's defined benefit pension. for mr. iger and ms. mccarthy, their age factors drove the change in pension value for such year to be negative (-$1,337,423 and -$118,908, respectively). mr. lansberry, mr. chapek and ms. mccarthy were credited with earnings on deferred compensation as disclosed below under "executive compensation - compensation tables - fiscal 2023 non-qualified deferred compensation table." these earnings were at rates that were not above market rates and therefore are not reported in this column.
all other compensation. this column sets forth all of the compensation for each fiscal year that we could not properly report in any other column of the table, including:
•the incremental cost to the company of perquisites and other personal benefits;
•the amount of company contributions to employee savings plans;
•the dollar value of insurance premiums paid by the company with respect to excess liability insurance for the neos; and
•the dollar amount of matching charitable contributions made to charities pursuant to the company's charitable gift matching program, which is available to all regular u.s. employees with at least one year of service.
the dollar amount of matching charitable contributions in fiscal 2023 was $50,000 for mr. iger, $12,250 for mr. gutierrez, $3,100 for ms. coleman, $40,000 for mr. chapek and $50,000 for ms. mccarthy.
the dollar amount the company contributed to both the disney retirement savings plan (for mr. gutierrez, ms. schake and mr. iger) and key employee retirement savings plan (for mr. iger) in fiscal 2023 was $104,850 for mr. iger, $9,900 for mr. gutierrez and $9,900 for ms. schake. the retirement savings plan is a defined contribution plan for eligible salaried employees funded by the company. after a year of service, the company will make quarterly contributions based on a combination of age and years of service and eligible pay. the key employee retirement savings plan is a defined contribution plan funded by the company. the plan is a non-qualified plan under irs regulations that is intended to restore or replace certain benefits that cannot be provided under the qualified retirement savings plan due to irs compensation limits.
upon his retirement on december 31, 2021, the consulting period established under mr. iger's then current employment agreement with the company commenced. in connection with his consulting agreement, mr. iger received quarterly payments of $500,000 for each quarter he served in this capacity; for fiscal 2023 he received $271,739.
on november 20, 2022, the board decided to exercise its right to terminate mr. chapek's employment without cause. in connection with this termination, mr. chapek received cash termination payments in fiscal 2023 of $6,527,397 in remaining base salary through the scheduled expiration date of his amended employment agreement and $1,027,397 in the form of a pro-rated target bonus.
in accordance with the sec's interpretations of its rules, this column also sets forth the incremental cost to the company of certain items that are provided to the neos for business purposes but which may not be considered integrally related to their duties. the following table sets forth the incremental cost to the company of each other perquisite and other personal benefit that exceeded the greater of $25,000 or 10% of the total amount of perquisites and personal benefits for an neo in fiscal 2023.
personal air travel        security             relocation                other               total robert a. iger                $793,993                   $1,236,703           $-                  $15,244          $2,045,940
the incremental cost to the company of the items specified above was determined as follows:
•personal air travel: the actual catering costs, landing and ramp fees, fuel costs and lodging costs incurred by flight crew plus a per hour charge based on the average hourly maintenance costs for the aircraft during the year for flights that were purely personal in nature, and a pro-rata portion of catering costs where personal guests accompanied an neo on flights that were business in nature. where a personal flight coincided with the repositioning of an aircraft following a business flight, only the incremental costs of the flight compared to an immediate repositioning of the aircraft are included. our ceo is required for security reasons to use corporate aircraft for all personal travel.
•security: the actual costs incurred by the company for providing security services and equipment.
•relocation: the actual amount provided to accommodate the cost expended by mr. lansberry and ms. schake with regard to their relocations.
the "other" column in the table above reflects the incremental cost to the company of vehicle benefits including a fixed monthly payment to offset the costs of owning and maintaining an automobile, personal air travel (except for personal air travel that is separately identified in the "personal air travel" column in the table above), reimbursement of up to $1,000 per calendar year for wellness-related purposes such as fitness and nutrition management and reimbursement of expenses for financial consulting.
the company provides employees with benefits and perquisites based on competitive market conditions. all salaried employees, including the neos, receive the following benefits: (i) health care coverage; (ii) life and disability insurance protection; (iii) reimbursement of certain educational expenses; (iv) access to favorably priced group insurance coverage; (v) company matching of gifts of up to $25,000 per employee (and $50,000 per senior executive vice president and chairman directly reporting to the ceo) each calendar year to qualified charitable organizations; and (vi) complimentary streaming subscription for the ad-supported disney bundle. additionally, employees at the vice president level and above, including neos, receive the following benefits, each of which involved no incremental cost to the company: (i) complimentary access to the company's theme parks and some resort facilities; (ii) discounts on company merchandise and resort facilities; and (iii) personal use of tickets acquired by the company for business entertainment when they become available because no business use has been arranged.
fiscal 2023 grants of plan based awards table the following table provides information concerning the range of awards available to the neos under the company's annual performance-based bonus program for fiscal 2023 and information concerning the option grants and restricted stock unit awards made to the neos during fiscal 2023. additional information regarding the amounts reported in each column follows the table.

stock awards for fiscal 2023 subject to performance conditions were valued based on the probability that performance targets will be achieved. assuming the highest level of performance conditions are achieved, the grant date stock award values would be $33,073,344, $7,154,615, $1,686,956, $861,192, $2,351,227 and $12,660,170 for mr. iger, mr. gutierrez, ms. schake, ms. coleman, mr. chapek and ms. mccarthy, respectively, for the performance-based awards made on november 20, 2022 (for mr. iger), november 29, 2022 (for mr. iger, mr. gutierrez, ms. schake, mr. chapek and ms. mccarthy), december 15, 2022 (for mr. gutierrez, ms. schake and ms. mccarthy) and june 23, 2023 (for ms. coleman).
mr. chapek separated from the company effective november 20, 2022. while he was not with the company at the time, awards shown reflect roic portions of awards from previous fiscal years granted on november 29, 2022, which mr. chapek will continue to vest in, as further discussed in the section "executive compensation - potential payments and rights on termination or change in control" below.
grant date. the compensation committee made the annual grant of stock options and restricted stock unit awards for fiscal 2023 on december 15, 2022 for those executives (other than mr. iger) serving as neos at that date. mr. iger's awards for fiscal year 2023 were made on november 20, 2022, the date he recommenced his employment with the company. as roic targets for fiscal 2023 were set on november 29, 2022, for purposes of the above chart for fiscal 2021 and 2022 roic portions were considered granted on that date. a portion of the fiscal 2023 pbus granted on december 15, 2022 are subject to the roic performance test, as described below. based on the company's fiscal 2023 roic, 103.38% of the reported portion of fiscal 2021 awards will vest and 106.75% of the reported portion of fiscal 2022 awards will vest. the roic target for fiscal 2024 was set in november 2023 for the remaining portion of those grants, and the grant date values for the remaining portions of those grants will be reported for the appropriate fiscal year when the applicable targets are established. for most equity recipients other than the executive officers, the fiscal 2023 annual grant was split into two equal installments, with the first half being granted on december 15, 2022 and the second half being granted on july 17, 2023. as both mr. lansberry and ms. coleman were not serving as executive officers at the time of the first portion of the annual grant, consistent with the treatment for most equity recipients other than the executive officers, they received their annual equity awards in two equal installments. in addition, ms. coleman received a promotion grant on june 23, 2023.
estimated future payouts under non-equity incentive plan awards. as described in the section "executive compensation - compensation discussion and analysis," the compensation committee sets the target bonus opportunity for the neos at the beginning of the fiscal year as a percentage of fiscal year-end salary, and the actual bonuses for the neos may, except in special circumstances such as unusual challenges or extraordinary successes, range from 35% to 200% of the target level based on the compensation committee's evaluation of financial and other performance factors for the fiscal year. the bonus amount may be zero if actual performance is below the specified threshold levels or less than the calculated amounts if the compensation committee otherwise decides to reduce the bonus. as addressed in the discussion of "executive compensation - compensation discussion and analysis," the employment agreements of each executive officer require that the target used to calculate the bonus opportunity (but not the actual bonus awarded) be at least the amount specified in each agreement. as mr. lansberry served as interim cfo for a portion of fiscal 2023 on an at-will basis, his target is prorated between his previous bonus and interim cfo bonus amount based on the portion of the year he served in either role. this column shows the range of potential bonus payments for each neo from the threshold to the maximum based on the target range set at the beginning of the fiscal year. the actual bonus amounts received for fiscal 2023 are set forth in the "non-equity incentive plan compensation" column of the "fiscal 2023 summary compensation table."
estimated future payouts under equity incentive plan awards. this column sets forth the number of restricted stock units awarded to the neos during fiscal 2023 that are subject to performance tests as described below. these include units awarded to each of the neos then serving as an executive officer as part of the annual grant in december 2022 and, for mr. iger, mr. gutierrez, ms. schake, mr. chapek and ms. mccarthy, when fiscal 2023 roic targets were set with respect to fiscal 2021 and 2022 grants in november 2022. in addition, in connection with her promotion, ms. coleman received a promotion award including pbus on june 23, 2023. the vesting dates for all of the outstanding restricted stock unit awards held by the neos as of the end of fiscal 2023 are set forth in the "fiscal 2023 outstanding equity awards at fiscal year-end table" below.
all units in row (a) are subject to the following vesting conditions: half of the units subject to the performance test are subject to a tsr test and half of the units are subject to an roic test.
•for the half of the units subject to the tsr performance test:
◦none of the units related to this measure vest if the company's tsr is below the 25th percentile of the s&p 500 for that measure.
◦if the company's tsr is at or above the 25th percentile of the s&p 500 for the related measure, the number of units related to that measure that vest will vary from 50% of the target number related to that measure (at the 25th percentile) to 100% of the target number related to that measure (at the 55th percentile) to 200% of the target number related to that measure (at or above the 75th percentile) (in each case, plus dividend equivalent units).
•for the half of the units subject to the roic performance test:
◦none of the units related to this measure vest if the company's fiscal year roic performance in the applicable performance period is below the threshold of target roic.
◦if the company's roic is above the threshold in the two-year period with respect to the award made november 20, 2022 and the three-year period for awards made on december 15, 2022 and june 23, 2023, the number of units related to that measure for that year that vest will vary from 50% of the target number related to that measure (equals threshold) to 200% of the target number related to that measure (exceeds maximum) (in each case, plus dividend equivalent units).
all units in row (b) are subject to a roic test.
•none of the units related to this measure will vest if the company's fiscal year roic performance in each of the applicable performance periods is below the threshold of target roic.
•if the company's roic is above the threshold in any fiscal year, the number of units related to that measure for that year that vest will vary from 50% of the target number related to that measure (equals threshold) to 200% of the target number related to that measure for fiscal 2022 and 150% for fiscal 2021(exceeds maximum) (in each case, plus dividend equivalent units).
see "executive compensation - compensation discussion and analysis - executive compensation program structure - objectives and methods - compensation at risk" above for a discussion of how roic for the company is calculated.
when dividends are distributed to shareholders, dividend equivalents are credited in an amount equal to the dollar amount of dividends on the number of units held on the dividend record date divided by the fair market value of the company's shares of common stock on the dividend distribution date. dividend equivalents vest only when, if and to the extent that the underlying units vest.
all other stock awards: number of shares of stock or units. this column sets forth the number of restricted stock units awarded to the neos during fiscal 2023. for all executive officers that received restricted stock units, awards were made on december 15, 2022. for most equity recipients other than the executive officers, the fiscal 2023 annual grant was split into two equal installments, with the first half being granted on december 15, 2022 and the second half being granted on july 17, 2023. as both mr. lansberry and ms. coleman were not serving as executive officers at the time of the first portion of the annual grant, consistent with the treatment for most equity recipients other than the executive officers, they received their annual equity awards in two equal installments. in addition, in connection with her promotion, ms. coleman received a promotion award including restricted stock units on june 23, 2023. the vesting dates for these options are set forth in the "fiscal 2023 outstanding equity awards at fiscal year-end table" below.
all other option awards: number of securities underlying options. this column sets forth the options to purchase shares of the company's common stock granted to the neos then serving as an executive officer as part of the annual grant in december 2022. as previously discussed, mr. lansberry received his annual grants of options in two equal installments on december 15, 2022 and july 17, 2023. in addition, in connection with her promotion, ms. coleman received a promotion award including options on june 23, 2023. the vesting dates for these options are set forth in the "fiscal 2023 outstanding equity awards at fiscal year-end table" below. these options are scheduled to expire ten years after the date of grant.
exercise or base price of option awards; grant date closing price of shares underlying options. these columns set forth the exercise price for each option grant and the closing price of the company's common stock on the date of grant. the exercise price is equal to the average of the high and low trading price on the grant date, which may be higher or lower than the closing price on the grant date.
grant date fair value of stock and option awards. this column sets forth the grant date fair value of the stock and option awards granted during fiscal 2023 calculated in accordance with applicable accounting requirements. the grant date fair value of all restricted stock unit awards and options is determined as described in the section "grant date" above.

vesting of equity options and restricted stock units continue to vest beyond retirement (and options remain exercisable) if (1) they were awarded at least one year prior to the date of an employee's retirement and (2) the employee was age 60 or older and had at least ten years of service on the date such employee retired. in these circumstances:
•options continue to vest following retirement according to the original vesting schedule. they remain exercisable for up to five years following retirement. options do not, however, remain exercisable beyond the original expiration date of the option.
•restricted stock units continue to vest following retirement according to the original vesting schedule, but vesting remains subject to any applicable performance conditions (except, in some cases, the test to ensure that the compensation is deductible pursuant to section 162(m)).
the extended vesting and exercisability is not available to certain employees outside the united states.
options and restricted stock units awarded to executive officers with employment agreements also continue to vest (and options remain exercisable) beyond termination of employment if the executive's employment is terminated by the company without cause or by the executive with good reason. in this case, options and restricted stock units continue to vest (and options remain exercisable) as though the executive remained employed through the end of the stated term of the employment agreement. if the executive would be age 60 or older and have at least ten years of service as of the end of the stated term of the employment agreement, the options and restricted stock units awarded at least one year prior to the end of the stated term of the agreement would continue to vest (and options remain exercisable) beyond the stated term of the employment agreement.
fiscal 2023 option exercises and stock vested table the following table provides information concerning the exercise of options and vesting of restricted stock unit awards held by the neos during fiscal 2023.
option awards                                                                                                                                stock awards number of shares acquired on exercise        value realized on exercise             number of shares acquired on vesting        value realized on vesting robert a. iger                -                                            $-                                                                   32,261            $2,898,206
the value realized on the exercise of options is equal to the amount per share at which the neo sold shares acquired on exercise (all of which occurred on the date of exercise) minus the exercise price of the option times the number of shares acquired on exercise of the options. the value realized on the vesting of stock awards is equal to the closing market price of the company's common stock on the date of vesting times the number of shares acquired upon vesting. the number of shares and value realized on vesting includes shares that were withheld at the time of vesting to satisfy tax withholding requirements.
equity compensation plans the following table summarizes information, as of september 30, 2023, relating to equity compensation plans of the company pursuant to which grants of options, restricted stock, restricted stock units or other rights to acquire shares of the company's common stock may be granted from time to time.

these plans are the company's amended and restated 2011 stock incentive plan, the walt disney company/pixar 2004 equity incentive plan (the "disney/pixar plan", which was assumed by the company in connection with the acquisition of pixar) and the walt disney company/tfcf 2013 equity incentive plan (the "disney/tfcf plan", which was assumed by the company in connection with the acquisition of tfcf). the disney/tfcf plan expired on october 18, 2023 and these shares are no longer able to be granted.
includes an aggregate of 24,191,694 time-based restricted stock units and pbus. includes an aggregate of 11,640 restricted stock units granted under the disney/pixar plan, which was approved by the shareholders of pixar prior to the company's acquisition.
assumes shares issued upon vesting of pbus vest at 100% of target number of units. for awards granted in fiscal 2021, the actual number of shares issued on vesting of pbus could be zero to 150% of the target number of pbus. for awards granted in fiscal 2022 and 2023, the actual number of shares issued on vesting of pbus could be zero to 200% of the target number of pbus.
reflects the weighted average exercise price of outstanding options; excludes restricted stock units and pbus.
includes 382,356 securities available for future issuance under the disney/pixar plan, which was approved by the shareholders of pixar prior to the company's acquisition. includes 27,720,535 securities available for future issuance under the disney/tfcf plan, which was approved by the shareholders of tfcf prior to the company's acquisition and has since expired on october 18, 2023. no shares remain available for future issuance under the disney/tfcf plan. assumes all awards are made in the form of options. each award of one restricted stock unit under the 2011 stock incentive plan reduces the number of shares available under the plan by two, so the number of securities available for issuance will be smaller to the extent awards are made as restricted stock units.
pension benefits the company maintains a tax-qualified, noncontributory retirement plan, called the disney salaried pension plan d, for salaried employees who commenced employment before january 1, 2012. benefits are based on a percentage of total average monthly compensation multiplied by years of credited service. for service years after 2012, average monthly compensation includes overtime, commission and regular bonus and is calculated based on the highest five consecutive years of compensation during the ten-year period prior to termination of employment or retirement, whichever is earlier. for service years prior to 2012, average monthly compensation considers only base salary, benefits were based on a somewhat higher percentage of average monthly compensation and benefits included a flat dollar amount based solely on years and hours of service. retirement benefits are non-forfeitable after three years of vesting service (five years of vesting service prior to 2012) or at age 65 after one year of service. actuarially reduced benefits are paid to participants whose benefits are non-forfeitable and who retire before age 65 but on or after age 55. the early retirement reduction is 50% at age 55, decreasing to 0% at age 65.
in calendar year 2023, the maximum compensation limit under a tax-qualified plan was $330,000 and the maximum annual benefit that may be accrued under a tax-qualified defined benefit plan was $265,000. the company maintains a supplemental non-qualified, unfunded plan, the amended and restated key plan, which provides to key salaried employees the retirement benefits that cannot be provided under our tax-qualified plans because of these limitations and certain other limitations applicable to qualified plans. under this plan, benefits are calculated in the same manner as under the disney salaried pension plan d (with the amounts payable offset by the benefits that are provided under the qualified plans), including the differences in benefit determination for years before and after january 1, 2012, described above, except as follows:
•starting on january 1, 2017, average annual compensation used for calculating benefits under the plans for any participant was capped at the greater of $1,000,000 or the participant's average annual compensation determined as of january 1, 2017; and
•benefits for persons who were neos on january 1, 2012 are limited to the amount the executive officer would have received had the plan in effect prior to its january 1, 2012 amendment continued without change.
company employees who either transferred to the company from abc, inc. after the company's acquisition of abc or worked for a legacy abc company (e.g., espn) are also eligible to receive benefits under the disney salaried pension plan a (formerly known as the abc, inc. retirement plan) and a benefit equalization plan, which, like the amended and restated key plan, provides eligible participants retirement benefits in excess of the compensation limits and maximum benefit accruals that apply to tax-qualified plans. mr. iger received credited years of service under those plans for the years prior to the company's acquisition of abc, inc. a term of the 1995 purchase agreement between abc, inc. and the company provides that employees transferring employment to coverage under a disney pension plan will receive an additional benefit under disney plans equal to (a) the amount the employee would receive under the disney pension plans if all of the employee's abc service were counted under the disney pension less (b) the combined benefits the employee receives under the abc plan (for service prior to the transfer) and the disney plan (for service after the transfer). mr. iger transferred from abc and, as such, receives a pension benefit under the disney plans to bring his total benefit up to the amount he would have received if all his years of service had been credited under the disney plans. the effect of these benefits is reflected in the present value of benefits under the disney plans in the table below.
the company also maintains the disney associated companies' retirement plan for certain hourly, union employees. prior to 2005, hourly non-union employees could participate if they satisfied the participant requirements. benefits under the disney associated companies' retirement plan are determined by a participant's credited years of service and credited hours of service according to the schedule which applies to their employee group. mr. lansberry had 2 years of service, with 2,389 hours, under the disney associated companies' retirement plan from 1986 to 1988 before becoming eligible for the disney salaried plan d.
as of the end of fiscal 2023, mr. lansberry was eligible for early retirement; ms. mccarthy was eligible for retirement and mr. chapek's separation constituted early retirement. mr. iger initially retired from the company on december 31, 2021, at which point his accrued benefits were finalized.
fiscal 2023 pension benefits table the following table sets forth the present value of the accumulated pension benefits that each neo is eligible to receive under each of the plans described above.
name                                                                          plan name         number of years of credited service at fiscal year-end                                        present value of accumulated benefit at fiscal year-end1   payments during last fiscal year1

these present values assume that each neo retires at age 65 (or their age on september 30, 2023, if older) for purposes of the disney salaried pension plan d and the amended and restated key plan, and age 62 (or their age on september 30, 2023, if older) for purposes of the disney salaried pension plan a and the benefit equalization plan of abc, inc. age 65 is the normal retirement age under each of the plans and is also the age at which unreduced benefits are payable, except the earliest age at which unreduced benefits are payable under the abc plans is age 62 for service years prior to 2012. the values also assume a straight life-annuity payment for an unmarried participant. participants may elect other actuarially reduced forms of payment, such as joint and survivor benefits and payment of benefits for a period certain irrespective of the death of the participant. the present values were calculated using the 5.94% discount rate assumption set forth in footnote 10 to the company's audited financial statements for fiscal 2023 and using actuarial factors including pri-2012 annuitant mortality table, projected generationally with a modified version of the mp-2021 scale for males and females. the present values reported in the table are not available as lump sum payments under the plans.
fiscal 2023 non-qualified deferred compensation table under the company's non-qualified deferred compensation plan, u.s.-based executives at the level of vice president or above may defer a portion of their compensation and applicable taxes with an opportunity to earn a tax-deferred return on the deferred amounts. the plan gives eligible executives the opportunity to defer up to 50% of their base salary and up to 100% of their annual performance-based bonus award until retirement or termination of employment or, at the executive's election, until an earlier date at least five years following the date the compensation is earned. the company also has the option to make a contribution into an executive's deferred compensation account on terms and subject to any conditions (such as vesting conditions) the company chooses. amounts in an executive's deferred account earn a return based on the executive's election among a series of mutual funds designated by the company, which are generally the same funds available under the company's qualified deferred compensation plans. returns on the funds available for the deferred account ranged from 0.75% to 26.49% for the year ended september 30, 2023.
the deferred amounts and any deemed earnings on the amounts are not actual investments and are obligations of the company. ms. mccarthy participated in this plan in fiscal 2023 and her contributions and aggregate earnings during the fiscal year and aggregate balance at the end of the fiscal year are reflected in the table below. ms. mccarthy's contributions represent deferred salary in the amount of $1,025,577 and bonus in the amount of $2,868,993. mr. lansberry and mr. chapek had positive returns on the year, but did not make a contribution in fiscal 2023.
the key employees retirement savings plan is a defined contribution plan funded by the company. the plan is a non-qualified plan under irs regulations that is intended to restore or replace certain benefits that cannot be provided under the qualified retirement savings plan due to irs compensation limits. eligible pay under the key employees retirement savings plan includes base salary, regular bonuses, overtime pay and commissions up to a $1,000,000 annual limit. the company contributes 3%, 6% or 9% of eligible pay that exceeds the annual irs compensation limit based on age and years of service as of the end of the plan year. mr. iger began participating in the plan when he was re-hired by the company on november 20, 2022 and based on his age and service he is eligible for a 9% contribution.
executive contributions in last fiscal year        company contributions in last fiscal year           aggregate earnings in last fiscal year   aggregate withdrawals in last fiscal year           aggregate balance at last fiscal year-end robert a. iger                $-                                                 $62,550                                                            ($749.1)                  $-                                                                    $61,801
because the earnings accrued under these programs were not "above market" or preferential, these amounts are not reported in the "fiscal 2023 summary compensation table." a portion of the aggregate balances at last fiscal year-end were however included in the summary compensation table since fiscal 2021, as follows:
amount included in summary compensation table fiscal year   salary              non-equity incentive plan        all other compensation        total robert a. iger              2023   $-                  $-                               $62,550                       $62,550
potential payments and rights on termination or change in control our neos may receive compensation in connection with termination of their employment. this compensation is payable pursuant to (a) the terms of compensation plans applicable by their terms to all participating employees and (b) the terms of employment agreements with each of our neos (with the exception of mr. lansberry, who is employed on an at-will basis). during fiscal 2023, the employment agreements with our applicable neos had the following end dates: december 31, 2026 for mr. iger, december 31, 2024 for mr. gutierrez, june 29, 2026 for ms. schake, april 7, 2026 for ms. coleman, june 30, 2025 for mr. chapek and june 30, 2024 for ms. mccarthy. as mr. chapek exited the company as chief executive officer before fiscal year end, he was not entitled to termination payments as of september 30, 2023. in fiscal 2023, the company entered into a new employment agreement with mr. iger as chief executive officer with an end date of december 31, 2024. in july 2023, the board agreed to extend mr. iger's employment agreement to december 31, 2026, noting that the extension of mr. iger's employment agreement provides continuity of leadership during the company's ongoing transformation and allows more time to execute a transition plan for ceo succession, which remains a priority for the board. in fiscal 2024, the company entered into an amendment to mr. gutierrez's employment agreement, pursuant to which the term of the agreement was extended to december 31, 2026.
on november 20, 2022 (after the commencement of fiscal 2023), the board decided to exercise its right to terminate mr. chapek's employment without cause. in connection with this termination, in the event that mr. chapek successfully completed all of the terms of his post-employment consulting agreement and did not violate the terms of the employment agreement that survive his termination or the general release, mr. chapek's severance would strictly conform to the terms of his employment agreement such that he would be entitled to the following cash termination payments:
•$1,027,397 equivalent to a pro-rated target bonus for fiscal 2023.
the treatment of the equity awards held by mr. chapek at his termination date under his employment agreement is described below in the section titled "executive compensation - compensation tables - potential payments and rights on termination of change in control -termination pursuant to company termination right other than for cause or by executive for good reason."
in june 2023, in connection with her leave of absence, which commenced on july 1, 2023, ms. mccarthy and the company entered into an amendment to ms. mccarthy's employment agreement, pursuant to which ms. mccarthy ceased to serve as senior executive vice president and chief financial officer and has the title "strategic advisor" during her leave of absence. ms. mccarthy's duties as strategic advisor are to assist the company with the transition of duties to the company's chief financial officer and the last day of ms. mccarthy's leave and employment with the company will be june 30, 2024. the terms of ms. mccarthy's compensation are unchanged, and she did not receive an equity grant in fiscal 2024.
the termination provisions included in our executive officers' employment agreements serve a variety of purposes, including: providing the benefits of equity incentive plans to the executive and the executive's family in case of death or disability; defining when the executive may be terminated with cause and receive no further compensation; and clearly defining rights in the event of a termination in other circumstances. the availability, nature and amount of compensation on termination differ depending on whether employment terminates because of:
•death or disability;
•the company's termination of the executive for cause; or
in december 2023, the compensation committee adopted a cash severance policy pursuant to which the company will not enter into any new agreement that provides, or amend any existing agreement to provide, any section 16 officer of the company the right to any cash severance payment that would exceed 2.99 times the sum of base salary plus target bonus for such officer unless such cash payment is approved by the company's shareholders.
it is important to note that the amounts of compensation set forth in the tables below are based on the specific assumptions noted and do not predict the actual compensation that our neos would receive. actual compensation received would be a function of a number of factors that are unknowable at this time, including: the date of the executive's termination of employment; the executive's base salary at the time of termination; the executive's age and service with the company at the time of termination; and, because many elements of the compensation are performance-based pursuant to the company's compensation philosophy described in "executive compensation - compensation discussion and analysis" above, the future performance of the company.
moreover, the option and restricted stock unit acceleration amounts in case of a termination without cause or by the executive for good reason assume that these awards immediately accelerate, which is not the case in the absence of a change in control. rather, options and units continue to vest over time and in most cases are subject to the same performance measures that apply as if there had been no termination. (there is a deemed performance measure for vesting of restricted stock unit awards when termination is due to death or disability and the test to assure deductibility under section 162(m) does not apply if it is not necessary to preserve deductibility.)
in each of the circumstances described below, our neos are eligible to receive earned, unpaid salary through the date of termination and benefits that are unconditionally accrued as of the date of termination pursuant to policies applicable to all employees. this includes the deferred compensation and earnings on these deferred amounts as described under the "fiscal 2023 non-qualified deferred compensation table." this earned compensation is not described or quantified below because these amounts represent earned, vested benefits that are not contingent on the termination of employment, but we do describe and quantify benefits that continue beyond the date of termination that are in addition to those provided for in the applicable benefit plans. the executive's accrued benefits include the pension benefits described under "executive compensation - compensation tables - pension benefits," which become payable to all participants who have reached retirement age. because they have reached early retirement or retirement age under the plans, mr. lansberry and ms. mccarthy would have been eligible to receive these benefits if their employment had terminated at the end of fiscal 2023, and mr. iger is already receiving these benefits. because the pension benefits do not differ from those described under "executive compensation - compensation tables - pension benefits" except in ways that are equally applicable to all salaried employees, the nature and amount of their pension benefits are not described or quantified below.
death and disability the employment agreement of each neo provides for payment of any unpaid bonus for any fiscal year that had been completed at the time of the executive's death or termination of employment due to disability. the amount of the bonus will be determined by the compensation committee using the same criteria used for determining a bonus as if the executive remained employed. as mr. lansberry served as interim cfo on an at-will basis, he is not due a cash payment at the time of death or termination of employment due to disability.
in addition to the compensation and rights in employment agreements, the 2011 stock incentive plan and award agreements thereunder provide that all options awarded to a participant (including the neos) become fully exercisable upon the death or disability of the participant. following the death or disability of the participant, options terminate on the earlier of (a) the scheduled expiration date and (b) in the case of death, 18 months and in the case of disability, 12 months. with respect to performance-based restricted stock units, if the performance measurement has not been made at the time of death or disability, all restricted stock units awarded to the participant under the 2011 stock incentive plan will, to the extent the units had not previously been forfeited, fully vest (and deemed to have been satisfied at the 50th percentile of comparative performance) and become payable upon the death or disability of the participant. if a performance measurement has been made at the time of death or disability with respect to restricted stock units, the restricted stock units will vest and accelerate based on the performance measurement. time-based restricted stock units become fully vested or payable upon death or disability to the extent not previously forfeited.
the following table sets forth the value of the estimated payments and benefits each of our neos (other than mr. chapek who exited the company in november 2022) would have received under our compensation plans and their employment agreements if their employment had terminated at the close of business on the last day of fiscal 2023 as a result of death or disability. the value of option acceleration is equal to the difference between the $81.05 closing market price of shares of the company's common stock on september 29, 2023 (the last trading day in fiscal 2023) and the weighted average exercise price of options with an exercise price less than the market price times the number of shares subject to such options that would accelerate as a result of termination. the value of restricted stock unit acceleration is equal to the $81.05 closing market price of shares of the company's common stock on september 29, 2023 multiplied by the number of units that would accelerate as a result of termination, which, for pbus, is equal to the target number of units.
cash payment   option acceleration             restricted stock unit acceleration robert a. iger                   $2,140,000          $-                                       $17,536,870
this amount is equal to the bonus awarded to the neos with respect to fiscal 2023 and set forth in the "non-equity incentive plan compensation" column of the "fiscal 2023 summary compensation table."
effective december 21, 2023, mr. gutierrez entered into an amended employment agreement with an end date of december 31, 2026. the above values reflect values calculated using a december 31, 2024 contract end date, which was the date in effect at the end of the fiscal year.
termination pursuant to company termination right other than for cause or by executive for good reason the employment agreement with each neo provides that the executive officer will receive a bonus for any fiscal year that had been completed at the time of termination of employment if the executive officer's employment is terminated by the company pursuant to the company's termination right other than for cause (as described below) or by the neo with good reason (as described below). the amount of the bonus will be determined by the compensation committee using the same criteria used for determining a bonus if the executive remained employed.
in addition, each neo's employment agreement provides that the neo will receive the following compensation and rights conditioned on the neo executing a general release of claims and, except for mr. iger (who has a separate consulting arrangement), agreeing to provide the company with consulting services (the "consulting agreement") for a period of six months after the neo's termination (or, if shorter, until the employment agreement expiration date):
•a lump sum payment equal to the base salary the neo would have earned had the neo remained employed during the term of the neo's consulting agreement (or, in the case of mr. iger, for up to six months), paid six months and one day after termination of employment.
•if the employment agreement expiration date is later than the end of the term of the neo's consulting agreement (or, in the case of mr. iger, six months after his employment termination date), a further lump sum payment equal to the base salary the neo would have earned had the neo remained employed after such period and until the termination of the neo's consulting agreement (subject to compliance with the terms of the consulting agreement).
•a bonus for the year in which the neo is terminated equal to a pro-rata portion of a target bonus amount determined in accordance with the employment agreement.
•all options that had vested as of the termination date or were scheduled to vest no later than three months after the employment agreement expiration date will remain or become exercisable as though the neo were employed until that date. the options will remain exercisable until the earlier of (a) the scheduled expiration date of the options and (b) three months after the employment agreement expiration date. in addition, as is true for all employees, options awarded at least one year before termination will continue to vest and will remain exercisable until the earlier of the expiration date of the option and five years after the termination date if the officer would have attained age 60 and have completed at least ten years of service as of that date. pursuant to employment agreements with each of the neos, the termination date for these purposes will be deemed to be the employment agreement expiration date. for any employee that is eligible for immediate retirement benefits, options awarded within, but less than, one year of termination will vest to the extent they are scheduled to vest within three months of termination and will remain exercisable for 18 months following termination.
•all restricted stock units that were scheduled to vest prior to the employment agreement expiration date will vest as though the neo were employed until that date to the extent applicable performance tests are met (but any test to assure deductibility of compensation under section 162(m) will be waived for any units scheduled to vest after the fiscal year in which the termination of employment occurs unless application of the test is necessary to preserve deductibility). as is true for all employees, restricted stock units awarded at least one year before termination will continue to vest through the end of the vesting schedule to the extent applicable performance criteria are met if the officer would be over 60 years of age and have at least ten years of service as of the termination date. pursuant to employment agreements with each of the neos, the termination date for these purposes will be deemed to be the employment agreement expiration date. based on these provisions, all of the equity awards held by mr. chapek at the date of his termination, including the grants made on december 14, 2021, have continued to vest in accordance with the applicable vesting schedules.
the employment agreements provide that the company has the right to terminate the neo's employment subject to payment of the foregoing compensation in its sole, absolute and unfettered discretion for any reason or no reason whatsoever. a termination for cause does not constitute an exercise of this right and would be subject to the compensation provisions described below under the section "termination for cause."
the employment agreements provide that an neo can terminate the neo's employment for "good reason" following notice to the company within three months of the neo having actual notice of the occurrence of any of the following events (except that the company will have 30 days after receipt of the notice to cure the conduct specified in the notice):
(i)a reduction in the neo's base salary, annual target bonus opportunity or (where applicable) annual target long-term incentive award opportunity;
(ii)the removal from the neo's position;
(iii)a material reduction in the neo's duties and responsibilities;
(iv)the assignment to the neo of duties that are materially inconsistent with the neo's position or duties or that materially impair the neo's ability to function in the neo's office;
(vi)a material breach of any material provision of the neo's employment agreement by the company.
an neo (or any employee holding equity awards) can also terminate for "good reason" after a change in control (as defined in the 2011 stock incentive plan) if, within 12 months following the change in control, a "triggering event" occurs and in that case the 2011 stock incentive plan provides that any outstanding options, restricted stock units, pbus or other plan awards will generally become fully vested and, in certain cases, paid to the plan participant. a "triggering event" is defined to include: (a) a termination of employment by the company other than for death, disability or "cause;" or (b) a termination of employment by the participant following a reduction in position, pay or other "constructive termination." under the 2011 stock incentive plan, "cause" has the same meaning as in the neo's employment agreement, as defined below under "- termination for cause." any such payments that become subject to the excess parachute tax rules may be reduced in certain circumstances.
each neo's employment agreement specifies that any compensation resulting from subsequent employment will not be offset against amounts described above.
as mr. lansberry was serving as interim cfo on an at-will basis, his cash severance payment would be dictated by the company's severance policy. given both mr. lansberry's level and over 37 years with the company, he would be eligible to receive a lump sum payment equal to 52 weeks of base salary. as mr. lansberry is over the age of 60 and has been with the company for over 10 years, any award he has held for over one year at the time of separation would be eligible for continued vesting for restricted stock units and vesting and exercisability of options.
the following table provides a quantification of benefits (as calculated in the following paragraph) each of the neos would have received if their employment had been terminated at the end of fiscal 2023 (under their employment agreements as in effect at that time and, for mr. lansberry, under the company's severance plan) by the company pursuant to its termination right or by the executive with good reason.
the "option valuation" amount is (a) the difference between the $81.05 closing market price of shares of the company's common stock on september 29, 2023 and the weighted average exercise price of options with an exercise price less than the market price times (b) the number of options with in-the-money exercise prices that would become exercisable despite the termination. the "restricted stock unit valuation" amount is the $81.05 closing market price on september 29, 2023, times the target number of units that could vest. however, as described above, options do not become immediately exercisable and restricted stock units do not immediately vest (and would eventually vest only to the extent applicable performance conditions are met) absent a change in control. the actual value realized from the exercise of the options and the vesting of restricted stock units may therefore be more or less than the amount shown below depending on changes in the market price of the company's common stock and the satisfaction of applicable performance tests.

this amount is equal to the bonus awarded to the neos with respect to fiscal 2023 and set forth in the "non-equity incentive plan compensation" column of the "fiscal 2023 summary compensation table," plus the lump sum payments based on salary through the end of the employment term as described above.
effective december 21, 2023, mr. gutierrez entered into an amended employment agreement with an end date of december 31, 2026. the above values reflect values calculated using a december 31, 2024 contract end date, as that was the date in effect at the end of the fiscal year.
termination for cause each neo's employment agreement provides that, if the neo's employment is terminated by the company for cause, the neo will only be eligible to receive the compensation earned and benefits vested through the date of such termination of employment, including any rights the neo may have under the neo's indemnification agreement with the company or the equity plans of the company.
"termination for cause" is defined in each neo's employment agreement as termination based on a felony conviction, unauthorized disclosure of confidential information, failure to substantially perform such neo's duties, or any other significant policy violation that is significantly injurious to the company unless, if the company determines that the conduct or cause is curable, such conduct or cause is timely cured by the neo.
expiration of employment term; retirement each of the neos is eligible to receive earned, unpaid salary and unconditionally vested accrued benefits (including continued vesting of restricted stock units and vesting and exercisability of options awarded more than one year prior to retirement if they are over 60 years of age with at least ten years of service) if the neo's employment terminates at the expiration of the neo's employment agreement or the neo otherwise retires, but except as described below, they are not contractually entitled to any additional compensation in this circumstance.
under the terms of mr. iger's employment agreement as in effect at december 31, 2021, to enable the company to have access to mr. iger's unique skills, knowledge and experience with regard to the media and entertainment business and his institutional knowledge of the company and its strategic evolution, upon his retirement, mr. iger was to serve as a consultant to the company for a period of five years. in this capacity, mr. iger would provide assistance, up to certain specified monthly and annual maximum time commitments, on such matters as his successor as chief executive officer may request from time to time. in consideration of his consulting services, mr. iger is to receive a quarterly fee of $500,000 for each of the quarters of this five-year period. for the five years following termination of employment, the company would also provide mr. iger with the same security services (other than the personal use of a company-provided or company-leased aircraft) as it has made available to him as chief executive officer. under his employment agreement entered into on november 20, 2022, upon the re-commencement of his employment, the parties' obligations in respect of these post-employment commitments are suspended and will resume to be fulfilled for the remaining term when mr. iger again terminates his employment with the company. under the amendment to his employment agreement entered into on july 12, 2023, the post-retirement security benefits will not be reduced for the approximately 11-month period such services were provided following mr. iger's prior retirement on december 31, 2021.
other neo employment agreements each provide that the chief executive officer may recommend to the compensation committee an annual cash bonus for the fiscal year in which their respective employment agreements end based on the executive's contributions during that fiscal year.
as in the case of a termination under the company's termination right other than for cause or the executive's right to terminate for good reason, vested options and restricted stock units will remain exercisable for 18 months for executives eligible to receive retirement benefits, and options and restricted stock units outstanding for at least one year will continue to vest, and options will remain exercisable, for up to three or five years (depending on the original grant date) if the neo was age 60 or greater and had at least ten years of service at the date of retirement. in addition, under the terms of his employment agreement as in effect at december 31, 2021, the equity grants made to mr. iger in fiscal 2022 became eligible to continue to vest (and options remain exercisable) upon his retirement at december 31, 2021.
pay ratio in accordance with sec rules, we are providing the ratio of the annual total compensation of our chief executive officer to the annual total compensation of the company's median employee. the ratio is a reasonable estimate calculated in a manner consistent with sec rules and the methodology described below.
per sec rules, the company is permitted to use the same median employee as was used in fiscal 2022, and the company determined that no change was needed to the median employee since there has been no change in the company's employee population or employee compensation arrangements that we believe would significantly impact the pay ratio disclosure. our methodology to confirm the median employee is consistent with last year. we reviewed the annual base salary of the global workforce as of the last business day of the fiscal year, september 29, 2023. due to population size, we identified a band of employees with a base salary that approximates the median base salary for the company. the median base salary reflects a workforce with large populations of seasonal, part-time and international employees working in multiple, distinct lines of business. we calculated the median employee's total annual compensation for fiscal 2023 (which consisted of an increase to base salary, overtime pay and the company's contribution to health insurance premiums), and the median employee's compensation did not contain distortive compensation features (e.g., abnormal amounts of overtime, special premium pay or commissions/tips, etc.).
the median disney employee works in a full-time hourly role in parks and has been with the company for over twelve years. for fiscal 2023, the median employee's total annual compensation was $54,010. mr. iger was chief executive officer on september 29, 2023. mr. iger's total annual compensation, including the company's contribution to health insurance premiums (which are not included in the fiscal 2023 summary compensation table in this report), was $32,123,717. since mr. iger became ceo beginning november 20, 2022, we have annualized his salary, other compensation and the company's contribution to health insurance premiums and included reported values for equity grants and change in pension value, as they are reflective of annual compensation. the ratio of these amounts was 595:1.
pay versus performance this disclosure has been prepared in accordance with item 402(v) of regulation s-k under the exchange act and does not necessarily reflect how the compensation committee evaluates compensation decisions in light of company or individual performance. the compensation committee did not consider the pay versus performance disclosure below in making its compensation decisions for any of the fiscal years shown. for discussion of how the compensation committee seeks to align pay with performance when making compensation decisions, please review the section above titled "executive compensation - compensation discussion and analysis."
pay versus performance table the following table sets forth compensation information of our ceos (mr. iger and mr. chapek) and our non-ceo neos and company performance for the fiscal years listed below, in accordance with item 402(v) of regulation s-k.

adjusted segment operating income consists of total segment operating income, as adjusted based on the compensation committee's evaluation against the bonus plan performance each fiscal year. "total segment operating income" consists of the total of segment operating income from each of our segments, which is equivalent to income from continuing operations before income taxes, adjusted for corporate and unallocated shared expenses, restructuring and impairment charges, a+e gain (for fiscal 2023), net other (income) expense, net interest expense, amortization of tfcf and hulu intangible assets and fair value step-up on film and television costs and the impact of content license early terminations (for fiscal 2022). in addition, in fiscal 2021 the committee adjusted actual total segment operating income to exclude the net benefits the company received from timing variances related to the pandemic, such as savings from delayed programming and domestic parks operating efficiencies, partially offset by delays in park openings. we determined adjusted segment operating income to be the most important financial performance measure used to link company performance to cap to our ceos and non-ceo neos in fiscal 2023, as required pursuant to item 402(v) of regulation s-k. this performance measure may not have been the most important financial performance measure for prior fiscal years, and we may determine a different financial performance measure to be the most important financial performance measure in future years.

director independence the provisions of the company's corporate governance guidelines regarding director independence meet and, in some respects, exceed the listing standards of the new york stock exchange. the corporate governance guidelines are available on the company's investor relations website under the "corporate governance" heading at www.disney.com/investors and in print to any shareholder who requests them from the company's secretary.
pursuant to the corporate governance guidelines, the board undertook its annual review of director independence in november 2023. during this review, the board considered transactions and relationships between the company and its subsidiaries and affiliates on the one hand, and on the other hand, directors, immediate family members of directors or entities of which a director or an immediate family member is an executive officer, general partner or significant equity holder. the board also considered whether there were any transactions or relationships between any of these persons or entities and the company's executive officers or their affiliates. as provided in the corporate governance guidelines, the purpose of this review was to determine whether any such relationships or transactions existed that were inconsistent with a determination that the director is independent.
as a result of this review, the board affirmatively determined that all of the directors serving in fiscal 2023 or nominated for election at the annual meeting are independent of the company and its management under the standards set forth in the corporate governance guidelines, with the exception of mr. iger and mr. chapek, neither of whom is considered independent because of employment as a senior executive of the company. additionally, mr. chapek's son provided producer services to the company and was re-hired as an employee in fiscal 2023, as discussed under the section titled "certain relationships and related person transactions" above.

item 1a. risk factors the risk factors discussed in this section should be considered together with information included elsewhere in this form 10-k and should not be considered the only risks to which we are exposed. in general, we are subject to the same general risks and uncertainties that impact many other industrial companies such as general economic, industry and/or market conditions and growth rates; the impact of natural disasters and their effect on global markets; and changes in laws or accounting rules. additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial also may impair our businesses, including our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition.
business and operational risks
•our businesses or operations may be adversely affected by natural or human-induced disasters, acts of war, terrorism, international conflicts, and public health crises.
our businesses or operations may be adversely affected by natural or human-induced disasters including, but not limited to, earthquakes; tsunamis; floods; hurricanes, cyclones or typhoons; fires; other extreme weather conditions; power or water shortages; telecommunications failures; materials scarcity; terrorist acts, civil unrest, conflicts or wars; and health epidemics or pandemics. the occurrence of any such event, and the measures taken in response thereto, may disrupt the global economy and adversely impact our operations, including demand for our products across multiple end-markets as well as our supply chain and operations. existing insurance coverage may not provide protection for all of the costs that may arise from such events. additionally, concerns over the economic impact of such events could cause increased volatility in financial and other capital markets, adversely impacting our stock price, our ability to access the capital markets, and our ability to fund liquidity needs.
the impacts of any such unexpected event are difficult to predict but could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition, or operations.
•recessions, adverse market conditions or downturns in the markets we serve could adversely affect our operations.
in the past, our operations have been exposed to volatility due to changes in general economic conditions or consumer preferences, recessions or adverse conditions in the markets we serve. in the future, similar changes could adversely impact overall sales, operating results (including potential impairment charges for goodwill or other long-lived assets) and cash flows. moreover, during economic downturns we may undertake more extensive restructuring actions, including workforce reductions, global facility consolidations, centralization of certain business support activities, and other cost reduction initiatives, and incur higher costs. as these plans and actions can be complex, the anticipated operational improvements, efficiencies and other benefits might be delayed or not realized. we are unable to determine the impact that recessions, adverse market conditions or downturns will have on our financial position, operating results and cash flows in future periods.
•increases in labor costs, potential labor disputes and work stoppages or an inability to hire skilled personnel could adversely affect our business.
we have a number of collective bargaining units in the u.s. and various collective labor arrangements outside the u.s. we are subject to potential work stoppages, union and works council campaigns and other labor disputes, any of which could adversely impact our productivity, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
furthermore, the competition for skilled personnel is often intense in the regions in which our manufacturing facilities are located. a sustained labor shortage or increased turnover rates within our employee base, increases in the salaries and wages paid by competing employers, as a result of general macroeconomic factors or otherwise, could lead to increased costs, such as increased overtime to meet demand and potentially further increase salaries and wage rates to attract and retain employees, and could negatively affect our ability to efficiently operate our manufacturing facilities and overall business. if we are unable to hire and retain employees capable of performing at a high level, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.
•our reputation, ability to do business and results of operations may be impaired by improper conduct by any of our employees, agents, or business partners.
while we strive to maintain high standards, we cannot provide assurance that our internal controls and compliance systems will always protect us from acts committed by our employees, agents, or business partners that would violate the laws of the jurisdictions where we do business, including the laws governing payments to government officials, bribery, fraud, anti-kickback and false claims, competition, export and import compliance, environmental compliance, money laundering and data privacy, as well as the improper use of proprietary information or social media. any such violations of law or improper actions could: subject us to civil or criminal investigations; lead to substantial civil or criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties and related shareholder lawsuits; lead to increased costs of compliance; and damage our reputation, our consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
•we are subject to risks relating to our existing international operations and expansion into new geographical markets.
approximately 44% and 43% of our revenues for 2023 and 2022, respectively, were derived outside the united states and we expect international sales to continue to represent a significant portion of our revenues given our global growth strategy. as a result of our international operations and our global expansion strategy, we are subject to various risks, including:
o        political, social and economic instability and disruptions;
o        government import and export controls, economic sanctions, embargoes or trade restrictions;
o        the imposition of duties and tariffs and other trade barriers and retaliatory countermeasures;
o        limitations on ownership and dividend of earnings;
o        risk to theft of proprietary information and/or intellectual property;
o        labor unrest and current and changing regulatory environments;
o        increased compliance costs, including costs associated with disclosure requirements and related due diligence;
o        the impact of loss of a single-source manufacturing facility;
o        limitations on our ability to enforce legal rights and remedies;
o        potentially adverse tax consequences; and o        access to or control of networks and confidential information due to local government controls and vulnerability of local networks to cyber risks.
if we are unable to successfully manage the risks associated with expanding our global business or adequately manage operational risks of our existing international operations, the risks could have a material adverse effect on our growth in geographic markets, our reputation, our consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows.
•our operations, businesses, products and business strategy are subject to cybersecurity risks.
although we have several processes and procedures in place designed to manage and mitigate cybersecurity risk, our business is still subject to certain risks. we depend on our own and third party information systems, including cloud-based systems and managed service providers, to store, process and protect our information and support our business activities. we also use third party systems to support employee data processing for our global workforce and to support customer business activities, such as transmitting payment information, providing mobile monitoring services, and capturing operational data. additionally, some of our products contain integrated hardware and software and offer the ability to connect to networks. while we have measures in place that are designed to protect these systems, these systems have been and are expected to continue to be the target of cyber attacks. although we conduct security assessments and periodic re-assessments of third party partners and other service providers, our systems may also experience vulnerabilities from third-party or open source software code that may be incorporated into our own or our vendors' systems. any prolonged system disruption in our systems or third-party services could negatively impact the coordination of our sales, planning, and manufacturing activities, which could harm our business.
our business has both an increasing reliance on systems and an increasing digital footprint as a result of changing technologies, connected devices and digital offerings, as well as expanded remote work policies. if these technologies, systems, products or services are damaged, cease to function properly, are compromised due to employee or third-party contractor error, user error, malfeasance, system errors, or other vulnerabilities, or are subject to cybersecurity attacks, such as those involving denial of service attacks, unauthorized access, malicious software, ransomware, or other intrusions, including by criminals, nation states or insiders, our business may be adversely impacted. the impacts could include production downtimes, operational delays, and other impacts on our operations and ability to provide products and services to our customers; compromise of confidential, proprietary or otherwise protected information, including personal information and customer confidential data; destruction, corruption, or theft of data or intellectual property; manipulation, disruption, or improper use of these technologies, systems, products or services; financial losses from fraudulent transactions, remedial actions, loss of business or potential liability; adverse media coverage; legal claims or legal proceedings, including regulatory investigations, actions and fines; and damage to our reputation. we regularly assess our threat landscape and monitor our systems and other technical security controls, maintain information security policies and procedures, including a breach response plan, ensure maintenance of backup and protective systems, and have a team of security personnel managing our efforts and initiatives. however, there has been a rise in the number of cyberattacks targeting confidential business information generally and in the manufacturing industry specifically, as well as an increase in cyberattacks targeting managed service providers, by both state-sponsored and criminal organizations. moreover, there has been a rise in the number of cyberattacks that depend on human error or manipulation, including phishing attacks or schemes that use social engineering to gain access to systems or perpetuate wire transfer or other frauds.
these trends increase the likelihood of such events occurring as well as the costs associated with protecting against such events. it is possible for vulnerabilities in our systems to remain undetected for an extended period of time up to and including several years. we attempt to mitigate these risks by employing a number of measures, including employee training, systems monitoring and other technical security controls, vulnerability scanning, risk assessments, a breach response plan, maintenance of backup and protective systems, and security personnel. notwithstanding those measures, our systems, networks, products and services remain potentially vulnerable to known or unknown cybersecurity attacks and other threats, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. we continuously monitor and develop our systems to protect our technology infrastructure and data from misappropriation or corruption. however, a cybersecurity attack could persist for an extended period of time before being detected, and, following detection, it could take considerable time for us to obtain full and reliable information about the extent, amount and type of information compromised. during the course of an investigation, we may not know the full impact of the event and how to remediate it, and actions, decisions and mistakes that are taken or made may further increase the negative effects of the event on our business, results of operations and reputation. while we maintain insurance coverage that is intended to address certain aspects of cybersecurity risks, such insurance coverage may not cover all losses or all types of claims that arise. as cyber threats continue to evolve, cybersecurity and data protection laws and regulations continue to develop in the u.s. and globally, and our business continues to move towards increased online connectivity within our information systems and through more internet-enabled products and offerings, we expect to expend additional resources to continue to build out our compliance programs, strengthen our information security, data protection and business continuity measures, and investigate and remediate vulnerabilities. for additional information on our cybersecurity risk management, strategy and governance, see item 1c. "cybersecurity."
•unforeseen developments in contingencies such as litigation and product recalls could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
we and certain of our subsidiaries are, and from time to time may become, parties to a number of legal proceedings incidental to our businesses, including alleged injuries arising out of the use of products or exposure to hazardous substances, or claims related to patent infringement, employment matters and commercial disputes. the defense of these lawsuits may require significant expenses and divert management's attention, and we may be required to pay damages that could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. in addition, any insurance or indemnification rights that we may have may be insufficient or unavailable to protect us against potential loss exposures.
we may be exposed to product recalls and adverse public relations if our products are alleged to have defects, to cause property damage, to cause injury or illness, or if we are alleged to have violated governmental regulations. a product recall could result in substantial and unexpected expenditures, which would reduce operating profit and cash flow. in addition, a product recall may require significant management attention. product recalls may hurt the value of our brands and lead to decreased demand for our products. product recalls also may lead to increased scrutiny by federal, state or international regulatory agencies of our operations and increased litigation and could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
•our revenue, operating profits and cash flows could be adversely affected if our businesses are unable to protect or obtain patent and other intellectual property rights.
our businesses own patents, trademarks, licenses and other forms of intellectual property related to their products and continuously invest in research and development that may result in innovations and general intellectual property rights. our businesses employ various measures to develop, maintain and protect their intellectual property rights. these measures may not be effective in capturing intellectual property rights, and they may not prevent their intellectual property from being challenged, invalidated, or circumvented, particularly in countries where intellectual property rights are not highly developed or protected. unauthorized use of our businesses' intellectual property rights could adversely impact the competitive position of our businesses and could have a negative impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
•we could be negatively impacted by environmental, social and governance (esg) and sustainability matters.
governments, shareholders, customers, employees and other stakeholders are increasingly focusing on corporate esg practices and disclosures, and expectations in this area are rapidly evolving and growing. we have announced certain initiatives, including goals, regarding our focus areas, which include greenhouse gas emissions reductions, health and safety, diversity and inclusion, talent attraction and development, and innovation for sustainable products. the criteria by which our esg practices are assessed may change due to the evolution of the sustainability landscape, which could result in greater expectations of us and may cause us to undertake costly initiatives to satisfy new criteria. moreover, the increasing attention to sustainability could also result in reduced demand for certain of our products or services and/or reduced profits. if we are unable to respond effectively, investors may conclude that our policies and/or actions with respect to esg matters are inadequate. if we fail or are perceived to have failed to achieve previously announced initiatives or goals or to accurately disclose our progress on such initiatives or goals, our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted.
•increasing product, service and price competition by international and domestic competitors, including new entrants, and our inability to introduce new and competitive products could cause our businesses to generate lower revenue, operating profits and cash flows.
our competitive environment is complex because of the wide diversity of the products that our businesses manufacture and the markets they serve. in general, most of our businesses compete with only a few companies. our ability to compete effectively depends on how successfully we anticipate and respond to various competitive factors, including new products, digital solutions and support services that may be introduced by competitors, changes in customer preferences, evolving regulations, new business models and technologies and pricing pressures. if our businesses are unable to anticipate their competitors' developments or identify customer needs and preferences on a timely basis, successfully introduce new products, digital solutions and support services in response to such competitive factors, or adopt to market changes relating to climate change related policies, they could lose customers to competitors. if our businesses do not compete effectively, we may experience lower revenue, operating profits and cash flows.
•our operating results depend in part on the timely development and commercialization, and customer acceptance, of new and enhanced products, digital solutions and support services based on technological innovation.
the success of new and improved products, digital solutions and support services depends on their initial and continued acceptance by our customers. certain of our businesses sell in markets that are characterized by rapid technological changes, frequent new product introductions, changing industry standards and corresponding shifts in customer demand, which may result in unpredictable product transitions, shortened life cycles and increased importance of being first to market. failure to correctly identify and predict customer needs and preferences, to deliver high quality, innovative and competitive products to the market, to adequately protect our intellectual property rights or to acquire rights to third-party technologies, to provide adequate data security and privacy protections and to stimulate customer demand for, and convince customers to adopt new products, digital solutions and support services could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. in addition, we may experience difficulties or delays in the research, development, production or marketing of new products, digital solutions and support services which may prevent us from recouping or realizing a return on the investments required to continue to bring new products and services to market.
•we could lose customers or generate lower revenue, operating profits and cash flows if there are significant increases in the cost of our raw materials or components, or if suppliers are not able to meet our quality and delivery requirements.
we purchase raw materials, sub-assemblies and components for use in our manufacturing operations. factors such as freight costs, transportation availability, inventory levels, the level of imports, the imposition of duties, tariffs and other trade barriers and general economic conditions may affect the price of these raw materials, sub-assemblies and components. significant price increases for certain commodities, other raw materials or components could adversely affect operating profits of our businesses. while we generally attempt to mitigate the impact of increased raw material prices by hedging or passing along the increased costs to customers, there may be a time delay between the increased raw material prices and the ability to increase the prices of products, or we may be unable to increase the prices of products due to a competitor's pricing pressure or other factors.
we use a wide range of raw materials and components in our manufacturing operations that come from numerous suppliers. while we believe that sources of supply for raw materials and components are generally adequate, it is difficult to predict what effects of extended lead times or shortages may have in the future. in addition, some of the raw materials and components may be available only from limited or single source suppliers. if a single source or limited source supplier were to cease or interrupt production for any reason or otherwise fail to supply those raw materials or components to us on favorable purchase terms, including at favorable prices, in sufficient quantities and with adequate lead times needed for efficient manufacturing, our ability to meet customer commitments, and satisfy market demands for affected products could be negatively affected. the disruption of our global supply chain for any reason, including for issues such as covid-19 or other health epidemics or pandemics, labor disputes, loss of single source or limited source supplier, inability to procure sufficient raw materials, quality control issues, ethical sourcing issues, a supplier's financial distress, natural disasters, looting, vandalism or acts of war or terrorism, trade sanctions or other external factors over which we have no control, could interrupt product supply and, if not effectively managed and remedied, have a material adverse impact on our business operations, financial condition and results of operations.
legal and regulatory risks
•our businesses are subject to regulation and their profitability and reputation could be adversely affected by domestic and foreign governmental and public policy changes, risks associated with emerging markets, changes in statutory tax rates and unanticipated outcomes with respect to tax audits.
our businesses' domestic and international sales and operations must comply with a wide variety of laws, regulations and policies (including environmental, employment and health and safety regulations, data security laws, data privacy laws, export/import laws, tax policies such as export subsidy programs and research and experimentation credits, carbon emission regulations, energy efficiency and design regulations and other similar programs). these laws, regulations and policies are complex, change frequently, have tended to become more stringent over time and may be inconsistent across jurisdictions. failure to comply (or any alleged or perceived failure to comply) with any of the foregoing could result in civil and criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties as well as potential damage to our reputation and disruption to our business. we cannot provide assurance that our costs of complying with new and evolving regulatory reporting requirements and current or future laws will not exceed our estimates. any of these factors could adversely affect customer demand, our relationships with customers and suppliers, and our business and financial position.
certain of our businesses have sales or operations in countries, including brazil, india and china, and may in the future invest in other countries, any of which may carry high levels of currency, political, compliance, or economic risk. while these risks or the impact of these risks are difficult to predict, any one or more of them could adversely affect our businesses and reputation.
our effective tax rate is impacted by the mix of earnings among countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation allowance of deferred tax assets and changes in income tax laws. the amount of income taxes and other taxes paid can be adversely impacted by changes in statutory tax rates and laws and are subject to ongoing audits by governmental authorities. if these audits result in assessments different from amounts estimated, then our consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows may be adversely affected by unfavorable tax adjustments.
financial and strategic risks
•our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations on cross-border transactions and the translation of local currency results into u.s. dollars could negatively impact our results of operations.
we conduct business through our subsidiaries in many different countries, and fluctuations in currency exchange rates could have a significant impact on our reported consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows, which are presented in u.s. dollars. cross-border transactions, both with external parties and intercompany relationships, result in increased exposure to foreign exchange effects. accordingly, significant changes in currency exchange rates, particularly the euro, chinese renminbi (yuan), swedish krona, pound sterling, indian rupee, singapore dollar, danish krone, and canadian dollar, could cause fluctuations in the reported results of our businesses' operations that could negatively affect our results of operations. additionally, the strengthening of certain currencies such as the euro and u.s. dollar potentially exposes us to competitive threats from lower cost producers in other countries. our sales are translated into u.s. dollars for reporting purposes. the strengthening of the u.s. dollar could result in unfavorable translation effects as the results of foreign locations are translated into u.s. dollars.
•our growth and results of operations may be adversely affected if we are unsuccessful in our capital allocation and acquisition program.
we expect to continue our strategy of seeking to acquire value creating add-on businesses that broaden our existing position and global reach as well as, in the right circumstances, strategically pursue larger acquisitions that could have the potential to either complement our existing businesses or allow us to pursue a new platform. however, there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to find suitable businesses to purchase, that we will be able to acquire such businesses on acceptable terms, or that all closing conditions will be satisfied with respect to any pending acquisition. in addition, we face the risk that a completed acquisition may underperform relative to expectations. we may not achieve the synergies originally anticipated, may become exposed to unexpected liabilities or may not be able to sufficiently integrate completed acquisitions into our current business and growth model. further, if we fail to allocate our capital appropriately, in respect of either our acquisition program or organic growth in our operations, we could be overexposed in certain markets and geographies and unable to expand into adjacent products or markets. these factors could potentially have an adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
•the indemnification provisions of acquisition and disposition agreements by which we have acquired or sold or disposed of companies may not fully protect us and may result in unexpected liabilities.
certain of the acquisition agreements by which we have acquired companies require the former owners to indemnify us against certain liabilities related to the operation of those companies before we acquired them. in most of these agreements, however, the liability of the former owners is limited and certain former owners may be unable to meet their indemnification responsibilities. similarly, the purchasers of our disposed operations may from time to time agree to indemnify us for operations of such businesses after the closing. we cannot be assured that any of these indemnification provisions will fully protect us, and as a result we may face unexpected liabilities that adversely affect our consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. in addition, we have retained certain liabilities directly or through indemnifications made to the buyers of businesses we have sold or disposed against known and unknown contingent liabilities such as tax liabilities and environmental matters.
there can be no assurance that the indemnity agreements will be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of any liabilities that may arise, or that the indemnitors will be able to fully satisfy their indemnification obligations. the failure to receive amounts for which we are entitled to indemnification could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.

overview dover corporation is a diversified global manufacturer and solutions provider delivering innovative equipment and components, consumable supplies, aftermarket parts, software and digital solutions and support services.
for the year ended december 31, 2023, consolidated revenue was $8.4 billion, a decrease of $70.0 million or 0.8%, as compared to the prior year. the decrease is due to a 1.5% organic revenue decline and an unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation of 0.2%, partially offset by acquisition-related growth of 0.9%. the 1.5% organic revenue decline was due to decreases of 4.0%, 3.3%, and 1.9% in our clean energy & fueling, pumps & process solutions, and engineered products segments, respectively. the decline was partially offset by the climate & sustainability technologies and imaging & identification segments which grew 2.4% and 0.2%, respectively. pricing and productivity initiatives continued during the year to offset the impact of lower volumes across some of the company's businesses.
from a geographic perspective, organic revenue for the u.s., our largest market, declined 3.0% as compared to the prior year. the decrease was primarily due to our clean energy & fueling and pumps & process solutions segments. revenue in europe and asia declined 5.7% and 0.2%, respectively, while revenue in other americas grew 3.4%. all other geographic markets grew 38.5% organically year over year.
gross profit was $3.1 billion for the year ended december 31, 2023, an increase of $21.1 million, or 0.7%, as compared to the prior year. gross profit margin increased to 36.6% for the year ended december 31, 2023 compared to 36.0% for the prior year. for further discussion related to our consolidated and segment results, see "consolidated results of operations" and "segment results of operations," respectively, within this item 7.
bookings decreased 4.4% over the prior year to $8.0 billion for the year ended december 31, 2023. this included an organic bookings decline of 4.6% and an unfavorable impact due to foreign currency translation of 0.4%, partially offset by an increase of 0.6% in acquisition-related bookings. overall, our book-to-bill was 0.95. see definition of bookings, organic bookings and book-to-bill within "segment results of operations"of this item 7.
during the year ended december 31, 2023, we executed restructuring and other costs programs to further optimize operations. restructuring and other costs of $63.7 million included restructuring charges of $50.4 million and other costs of $13.2 million. the restructuring expenses were primarily related to headcount reductions and exit costs in the clean energy & fueling, engineered products and pumps & process solutions segments. these restructuring programs were initiated in 2022 and 2023 and were undertaken in light of current market conditions. other costs were primarily due to an asset impairment in our climate & sustainability technologies segment and product line rationalization and footprint reduction in our clean energy & fueling segment. for further discussion related to our restructuring and other costs, see "restructuring and other costs (benefits)," within this item 7.
during the year ended december 31, 2023, we made two business acquisitions totaling $535.3 million, net of cash acquired and inclusive of contingent consideration. see note 3 - acquisitions in the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10-k for further details regarding the businesses acquired during the year.
on october 11, 2023, the company entered into a definitive agreement to sell de-sta-co, an operating company within the engineered products segment, for approximately $680 million enterprise value, subject to customary post-closing adjustments. the transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2024, subject to customary closing conditions, including receipt of regulatory approvals. see note 4 - dispositions in the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10-k for further details.
in january 2024, we made two business acquisitions totaling approximately $140.6 million, net of cash acquired, plus potential contingent consideration of up to approximately $33.4 million. see note 22 - subsequent events in the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10-k for further details.

revenue revenue for the year ended december 31, 2023 decreased $70.0 million, or 0.8% to $8.4 billion compared with 2022. organic revenue decline of 1.5% is primarily due to general reduction in our customers' and distribution channels' inventory levels that resulted from lead time normalization and higher inventory carrying costs driven by interest rate increases. acquisition-related growth increased by 0.9% primarily driven by our pumps & process solutions segment, offset by an unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation of 0.2%. customer pricing favorably impacted revenue in 2023 by approximately 3.8% and by 6.9% in the prior year.
gross profit gross profit for the year ended december 31, 2023, increased $21.1 million, or 0.7%, to $3.1 billion compared with 2022, primarily driven by positive market conditions in certain secular growth-exposed businesses, as well as pricing, productivity initiatives and restructuring actions, partially offset by lower volumes across some end markets. gross profit margin increased 60 basis points to 36.6% as compared to the prior year driven by benefits from pricing, productivity and restructuring actions, partially offset by lower volumes across some of the company's businesses.
selling, general and administrative expenses selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended december 31, 2023 increased $34.1 million, or 2.0% to $1.7 billion compared with 2022, primarily driven by increased restructuring, employee compensation and benefits and transaction and integration costs, partially offset by lower contract labor costs. as a percentage of revenue, selling, general and administrative expenses increased 60 basis points to 20.4%, reflecting a decrease in the revenue base.
research and development costs, including qualifying engineering costs, are expensed when incurred and amounted to $153.1 million and $163.3 million for the years ended december 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. these costs as a percent of revenue were 1.8% and 1.9% for the years december 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.
non-operating items interest expense, net for the year ended december 31, 2023, interest expense, net of interest income, increased $5.8 million, or 5.2%, to $117.8 million compared with 2022 primarily driven by increased higher average interest rates since the prior year, partially offset by decreased commercial paper borrowings.
other income, net other income, net includes non-service pension benefit, deferred compensation plan investments gain or loss, earnings or charges from equity method investments, foreign exchange gain or loss, and various other items. other income, net for the years ended december 31, 2023 and 2022, was $21.5 million and $20.2 million, respectively. for the year ended december 31, 2023, other income increased compared to 2022 primarily driven by increased non-operational income and increased earnings from our equity method investments, partially offset by the decrease in non-service pension benefit.
income taxes our businesses have a global presence with 40.5% and 43.2% of our pre-tax earnings in 2023 and 2022, respectively, generated in foreign jurisdictions. foreign earnings are generally subject to local country tax rates that differ from the 21.0% u.s. statutory tax rate.
our effective tax rate was 16.8% for the year ended december 31, 2023, compared to 17.3% for the year ended december 31, 2022, respectively. the 2023 rate was primarily due to the release of a $69.7 million net valuation allowance against non-u.s. tax loss carryforwards mainly related to an internal reorganization, partially offset by a $30.4 million accrual of withholding taxes on current and future repatriation of certain foreign earnings. the 2022 rate was primarily driven by favorable audit resolutions, including a reduction to income taxes previously recorded related to the tax cut and jobs act.
the company is monitoring the potential changes in tax laws resulting from the organization for economic cooperation and development's multi-jurisdictional plan of action to address base erosion and profit shifting. we do not expect this to have a material impact on our effective tax rate.
see note 14 - income taxes in the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10-k for additional details.
net earnings for the year ended december 31, 2023, net earnings decreased $8.5 million, or 0.8%, to $1.1 billion, or $7.52 per share, compared with net earnings of $1.1 billion, or $7.42 per share, for the year ended december 31, 2022. earnings decreased primarily due to lower volumes across some of the company's businesses, increased selling, general and administrative expenses, partially offset by customer pricing actions and benefits from productivity initiatives.
segment results of operations the summary that follows provides a discussion of the results of operations of each of our five reportable operating segments (engineered products, clean energy & fueling, imaging & identification, pumps & process solutions and climate & sustainability technologies). each of these segments is comprised of various product and service offerings that serve multiple markets. we evaluate our operating segment performance based on segment earnings as defined in note 19 - segment information in the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10-k. see "non-gaap disclosures" at the end of this item 7 for further details.
additionally, we use the following operational metrics in monitoring the performance of the business. we believe the operational metrics are useful to investors and other users of our financial information in assessing the performance of our segments:
•bookings represent total orders received from customers in the current reporting period and exclude de-bookings related to orders received in prior periods, if any. this metric is an important measure of performance and an indicator of order trends.
•organic bookings represent bookings excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rates and the impact of acquisitions and dispositions. this metric is an important measure of performance and an indicator of order trends.
•book-to-bill is a ratio of the amount of bookings received from customers during a period divided by the amount of revenue recorded during that same period. this metric is a useful indicator of demand trends.
engineered products our engineered products segment provides a wide range of equipment, components, software, solutions and services to the vehicle aftermarket, waste handling, industrial automation, aerospace and defense, industrial winch and hoist, and fluid dispensing end-markets.

engineered products segment revenue for the year ended december 31, 2023 decreased $39.0 million, or 1.9% organic revenue decline. customer pricing favorably impacted revenue in 2023 by approximately 2.6% and by 10.4% in the prior year.
the organic revenue decline was primarily due to lower volumes in our vehicle service business in europe and asia, as well as transient disruptions in north america from an erp upgrade in this business that reduced volumes in the second and third quarter. our other businesses saw robust demand, including in our waste handling business as large national waste haulers and municipal governments invest to upgrade their refuse collection vehicle fleets and implement our leading digital technologies to improve waste collection process efficiencies, and from key defense customers in our aerospace and defense business. we expect organic growth to be positive in 2024, driven by strong order demand trends in several of our key end markets, most notably in our waste handling and in our aerospace and defense businesses. additionally, we expect revenue growth in our vehicle service business against prior year comparable periods.
engineered products segment earnings for the year ended december 31, 2023 increased $30.9 million, or 8.9%, compared to the prior year. the increase included a fourth quarter benefit of $14.4 million as a result of the change from lifo to fifo method for an immaterial portion of inventories, customer pricing actions, productivity and cost reduction initiatives, and favorable business mix, partially offset by lower volumes and increased material and labor costs. as a result, segment margin increased to 18.8% from 17.0% in the prior year. see note 1 - description of business and summary of significant accounting policies in the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10-k for additional details regarding the change from lifo to fifo.
bookings for the year ended december 31, 2023 increased 4.6% compared to the prior year, comprised of organic growth of 4.7% and an unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation of 0.1%. the organic bookings growth was primarily driven by robust demand in our waste handling business as large waste haulers upgrade their vehicle fleets. segment book-to-bill was 1.05.
clean energy & fueling our clean energy & fueling segment provides components, equipment, software, solutions and services enabling safe and reliable storage, transport and dispensing of traditional and clean fuels (including liquefied natural gas, hydrogen, and electric vehicle charging), cryogenic gases, and other hazardous substances along the supply chain, and safe and efficient operation of convenience retail, retail fueling and vehicle wash establishments.

clean energy & fueling segment revenue for the year ended december 31, 2023 decreased $90.2 million, or 4.8%, compared to the prior year, attributable to an organic decline of 4.0% and an unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation of 0.8%. customer pricing favorably impacted revenue in 2023 by approximately 4.3% and by 6.0% in the prior year.
the organic revenue decline was primarily due to reduced year-over-year demand in above ground retail fueling equipment, due to the expected roll-off of emv-related demand in the first half of the year, as well as general reduction in our customers' inventory across our distribution channels, as higher interest rates increased its carrying costs. this was partially offset by pricing actions aimed at mitigating material cost inflation and strong demand in our fluid transfer solutions and hydrogen and liquefied natural gas clean energy businesses. we have made and will continue to make proactive adjustments to our cost structure through restructuring and other programs to align with current demand trends. we expect shipments to remain lower in the first half of 2024 improving progressively for the remainder of the year.
clean energy & fueling segment earnings for the year ended december 31, 2023 decreased $24.4 million, or 6.9%, compared to the prior year. the decrease was primarily due to reduced organic volumes, unfavorable foreign currency translation, and increased material, logistics and labor costs, partially offset by pricing, productivity initiatives, and the benefits from ongoing restructuring actions. the benefits from these restructuring actions are significant and will carry into 2024. see "restructuring and other costs (benefits)" section within this item 7 for further information. segment margin decreased to 18.4% from 18.8% in the prior year.
bookings for the year ended december 31, 2023 decreased 4.1% compared to the prior year, due to organic decline of 3.1% and an unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation of 1.0%. the organic bookings decline was primarily due to decreased year over year demand in above ground fueling equipment and vehicle wash solutions as higher interest rates have impacted ability to finance equipment purchases. segment book-to-bill was 0.98.

imaging & identification segment revenue for the year ended december 31, 2023 decreased $7.1 million, or 0.6% compared to the prior year, comprised of an unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation of 0.8%, partially offset by organic growth of 0.2%. customer pricing favorably impacted revenue in 2023 by approximately 5.0% and by 4.1% in the prior year.
the organic revenue growth was primarily driven by customer pricing and growth in serialization software, partially offset by reduced customer investments in new marking and coding equipment, along with lower textile printer shipments caused by high energy prices and macro uncertainty in textile producing regions. we expect positive organic growth in 2024, driven primarily by customer pricing and increased demand for serialization software, along with a rebound in textile printer demand.
imaging & identification segment earnings for the year ended december 31, 2023 increased $4.4 million, or 1.7%, compared to the prior year. this increase was primarily driven by pricing initiatives and productivity actions, partially offset by an unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation, organic volume reductions, and material and labor cost inflation. segment margin increased to 24.4% from 23.9% in the prior year.
bookings for the year ended december 31, 2023 decreased 2.9%, comprised of an organic decline of 2.1% and an unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation of 0.8%. the organic bookings decline was primarily due to reduced order intake for equipment in our marking and coding and digital textile printing businesses. segment book-to-bill was 1.00.

pumps & process solutions segment revenue for the year ended december 31, 2023 increased $27.5 million, or 1.6%, compared to the prior year, attributable to acquisition-related growth of 4.4% and a favorable impact from foreign currency translation of 0.5%, partially offset by an organic decline of 3.3%. acquisition-related growth was driven by the acquisitions of witte pumps & technology gmbh, malema engineering corporation, and amn dpi in 2022, along with fw murphy production controls business in the fourth quarter of 2023. customer pricing favorably impacted revenue by approximately 4.1% in 2023 and by 3.9% in the prior year.
the organic revenue decline was due to reduced shipments for single-use components used in biopharmaceutical manufacturing, as well as a decline in connector demand in core medical and industrial end markets, due to channel and end customer focus on inventory reductions. this was partially offset by customer pricing, along with continued demand strength in thermal connectors, hygienic dosing systems, plastics and polymer processing solutions equipment, and bearings and compression components. we expect segment revenue growth in 2024, mostly driven by the acquisition of fw murphy, with stable organic revenue performance year-over-year. we expect positive demand trends in connectors supported by recent specification wins in high performance computing applications and improving customer sentiment in bioprocessing, as well as continued solid demand in hygienic dosing systems and bearings and compression components, offset by slower expected demand in our polymer processing equipment business after several very strong years.
pumps & process solutions segment earnings for the year ended december 31, 2023 decreased $48.6 million, or 9.1%, compared to the prior year. the decrease was primarily due to the unfavorable volume and product mix impact of reduced revenues relating to biopharmaceutical components along with labor and material cost increases, partially offset by pricing initiatives and productivity and cost reduction actions. segment margin decreased to 27.6% from 30.8% in the prior year.
bookings for the year ended december 31, 2023 decreased 1.9% as compared to the prior year, due to an organic decline of 4.7%, partially offset by acquisition-related growth of 2.8%. the organic bookings decline was due to reduced orders in our polymer processing equipment and biopharmaceutical components businesses, partially offset by continued order strength in hygienic dosing systems, industrial pumps and bearings and compression components, along with specification wins in high performance computing applications in our thermal connector business. segment book-to-bill was 0.96.

climate & sustainability technologies segment revenue for the year ended december 31, 2023 increased $40.9 million, or 2.4%, compared to the prior year, reflecting an organic revenue growth of 2.4%, acquisition-related growth of 0.2%, partially offset by an unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation of 0.2%. customer pricing favorably impacted revenue in 2023 by approximately 3.7% and by 9.2% in the prior year.
the organic revenue growth was principally driven by strong demand and pricing initiatives in most markets. our heat exchanger business grew in u.s. commercial hvac and industrial markets, and growth in europe as regulation-driven efforts to shift from fossil fuel to electric energy drove demand for heat pump applications. retail refrigeration revenue also increased from the prior year, driven by customer pricing actions, large system refurbishment programs and growing demand for low-gwp (global warming potential) co2 refrigerant systems, partially offset by lower shipments in the interest rate sensitive convenience store market. beverage can-making business revenues modestly decreased from the prior year due to expected year over year revenue reductions beginning in the fourth quarter driven by project timing and reduced demand for beverage can-making equipment as large can-maker customers focus on scaling production and growing utilization of recent capacity additions. we expect overall segment organic revenues to decline in 2024 despite continued growth in retail refrigeration, particularly growth in new natural refrigerant system installations. we anticipate continued headwinds in new beverage can-making equipment as customers reduce near-term capacity investments, and some near-term slowing in heat exchangers driven by hvac oems efforts to reduce component inventories; however, the long-term demand trends for decarbonization of heating remain intact. we expect gradual improvement in volumes into the second half of 2024.
climate & sustainability technologies segment earnings for the year ended december 31, 2023 increased $50.9 million, or 20.0%, compared to the prior year. the segment earnings increase was driven by customer pricing actions, product mix and significant benefits from productivity initiatives, partially offset by higher labor costs. segment margin increased to 17.2% from 14.6% in the prior year.
bookings for the year ended december 31, 2023 decreased 19.2% compared to the prior year, reflecting an organic decline of 19.1% and an unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation of 0.3%, partially offset by acquisition-related growth of 0.2%. the organic bookings decline was principally due to moderating demand with key customers in beverage can-making equipment, transient disruptions from adverse economic conditions for heat exchangers and customer order timing returning to historical seasonal patterns in refrigeration. segment book-to-bill was 0.76.

(1) purchase accounting expenses in our clean energy &amp; fueling segment decreased by $18,394 for the year ended december 31, 2023 from the prior year comparable period, which included $18,995 of charges related to fair value step-ups for inventory from the q4 2021 acquisition of rego and acme cryogenics.
financial condition we assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund our operating, investing and financing activities. significant factors affecting liquidity are cash flows generated from operating activities, capital expenditures, acquisitions, dispositions, dividends, repurchase of outstanding shares, adequacy of available commercial paper and bank lines of credit and the ability to attract long-term capital with satisfactory terms. we generate substantial cash from the operations of our businesses and remain in a strong financial position, with sufficient liquidity available for reinvestment in existing businesses and strategic acquisitions.
operating activities                               $1,336,345                          $805,724
investing activities                                (726,630)                         (540,924)
financing activities                                (568,056)                         (260,265)
operating activities cash flow from operating activities for the year ended december 31, 2023 increased by $530.6 million compared to 2022. this increase was primarily driven by improvements in the management of working capital.
adjusted working capital: we believe adjusted working capital (a non-gaap measure calculated as accounts receivable, plus inventory, less accounts payable) provides a meaningful measure of liquidity by showing changes caused by operational results. the following table provides a calculation of adjusted working capital:
adjusted working capital (in thousands)             december 31, 2023       december 31, 2022
adjusted working capital                           $1,698,950              $1,815,335
adjusted working capital decreased by $116.4 million, or 6.4%, to $1.7 billion at december 31, 2023, which reflected a decrease in accounts receivable of $84.8 million, a decrease in inventory of $141.2 million and a decrease in accounts payable of $109.6 million. these amounts include the effects of acquisitions, dispositions and foreign currency translation. the decrease in inventories is due to reduced purchasing of inventories as supply chains have normalized. the change in accounts receivable and payable reflect the timing of payments and collections.
investing activities cash flow from investing activities is derived from cash outflows for capital expenditures and acquisitions, partially offset by cash inflows from proceeds from the sale of businesses, and property, plant and equipment. the majority of the activity in investing activities was comprised of the following:
•acquisitions: in 2023, we deployed $533.6 million, net of cash acquired, to acquire two businesses. in comparison, we acquired three businesses in 2022 for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $312.9 million, net of cash acquired and inclusive of measurement period adjustments. see note 3 - acquisitions in the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10-k for additional information with respect to recent acquisitions.
•capital spending: capital expenditures, primarily to support growth initiatives, productivity and new product launches, were $192.6 million in 2023 and $221.0 million in 2022. our capital expenditures decreased $28.4 million in 2023 in line with our planned expenditures for the year.
we anticipate that capital expenditures and any additional acquisitions we make in 2024 will be funded from available cash and internally generated funds and, if necessary, through the issuance of commercial paper, or by accessing the public debt or equity markets. we estimate capital expenditures in 2024 to range from $160.0 million to $170.0 million.
financing activities cash flow from financing activities generally relates to the use of cash for purchases of our common stock and payment of dividends, offset by net borrowing activity. the majority of financing activity was attributed to the following:
•repurchase of common stock, including accelerated share repurchase program: during 2023, the company repurchased no shares. during the year ended december 31, 2022, we used $85.0 million to repurchase 641,428 shares and $500.0 million to repurchase 3,892,295 shares through an accelerated share repurchase transaction.
•commercial paper and other short-term borrowings, net: during 2023, we paid down $267.5 million of short term borrowings, primarily commercial paper. during 2022, we received net proceeds of $629.9 million from commercial paper and other short-term borrowings used to partially fund our accelerated share repurchase transaction and the acquisition of malema.
liquidity and capital resources free cash flow in addition to measuring our cash flow generation and usage based upon the operating, investing and financing classifications included in the consolidated statements of cash flows, we also measure free cash flow (a non-gaap measure) which represents net cash provided by operating activities minus capital expenditures. we believe that free cash flow is an important measure of liquidity because it provides management and investors a measurement of cash generated from operations that may be available for mandatory payment obligations and investment opportunities, such as funding acquisitions, paying dividends, repaying debt and repurchasing our common stock.
the following table reconciles our free cash flow to cash flow provided by operating activities:
cash flow provided by operating activities                                    $1,336,345                          $805,724
less: capital expenditures                                                     (192,592)                         (220,962)
cash flow from operating activities as a percentage of revenue                         15.8 %                             9.5 %
cash flow from operating activities as a percentage of net earnings                   126.4 %                            75.6 %
for 2023, we generated free cash flow of $1.1 billion, representing 13.6% of revenue and 108.2% of net earnings. free cash flow in 2022 was $584.8 million, or 6.9% of revenue and 54.9% of earnings. free cash flow increased from 2022 to 2023 driven by higher operating cash flow, primarily as a result of improvements in cash flows related to working capital and a decrease in capital expenditures compared to the prior year. additionally, the year ended december 31, 2022 includes a $43.5 million income tax payment related to the gain on sale of ub in the fourth quarter of 2021 and a $13.4 million tax payment in 2022 related to an internal reorganization.
capitalization we use commercial paper borrowings for general corporate purposes, including the funding of acquisitions and the repurchase of our common stock. as of december 31, 2023, we maintained $1.0 billion five-year and $500.0 million 364-day unsecured revolving credit facilities ("credit agreements") with a syndicate of banks which expire april 6, 2028 and april 4, 2024, respectively. the five-year credit facility replaced the previous $1.0 billion five-year unsecured revolving credit facility, which was set to expire on october 4, 2024 and was terminated by the company upon execution of the current five-year credit facility. we may elect to extend the maturity date of any loans under the 364-day credit facility until april 4, 2025, subject to conditions specified therein. the credit agreements are designated as a liquidity back-stop for the company's commercial paper program, which was upsized from $1.0 billion to $1.5 billion during the second quarter of 2023, and also are available for general corporate purposes.
the company may elect to have loans under the credit agreements which bear interest at a base rate plus a specified applicable margin. under these facilities, we are required to pay a facility fee and to maintain an interest coverage ratio of consolidated ebitda to consolidated net interest expense of not less than 3.0 to 1. we were in compliance with this covenant and our other long-term debt covenants at december 31, 2023 and had a coverage ratio of 14.5 to 1. we are not aware of any potential impairment to our liquidity and expect to remain in compliance with all of our debt covenants. additionally, our earliest material long-term debt maturity is in 2025.
we also have a current shelf registration statement filed with the sec that allows for the issuance of additional debt securities that may be utilized in one or more offerings on terms to be determined at the time of the offering. net proceeds of any offering would be used for general corporate purposes, including repayment of existing indebtedness, capital expenditures and acquisitions.
at december 31, 2023, our cash and cash equivalents totaled $398.6 million, of which approximately $269.6 million was held outside the united states. at december 31, 2022, our cash and cash equivalents totaled $380.9 million, of which $261.4 million was held outside the united states. cash and cash equivalents are held primarily in bank deposits with highly rated banks. we regularly hold cash in excess of near-term requirements in bank deposits or invest the funds in government money market instruments or short-term investments, which consist of investment grade time deposits with original maturity dates at the time of purchase of no greater than three months.
on october 11, 2023, the company entered into a definitive agreement to sell de-sta-co for approximately $680.0 million enterprise value, subject to customary post-closing adjustments. this transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2024. see note 4 - dispositions in the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10-k for further details.
in january 2024, we made two business acquisitions totaling approximately $140.6 million, net of cash acquired, plus potential contingent consideration of up to approximately $33.4 million. see note 22 - subsequent events in the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10-k for further details.
we utilize the net debt to net capitalization calculation (a non-gaap measure) to assess our overall financial leverage and capacity and believe the calculation is useful to investors for the same reason. net debt represents total debt minus cash and cash equivalents, including cash held for sale. net capitalization represents net debt plus stockholders' equity. the following table provides a reconciliation of net debt to net capitalization to the most directly comparable gaap measures:
net debt to net capitalization ratio (dollars in thousands)                       december 31, 2023                december 31, 2022
less: cash and cash equivalents, including cash held for sale                     (415,861)                        (380,868)
add: stockholders' equity                                                         5,106,605                        4,286,366
net capitalization                                                               $8,150,785                       $7,583,783
net debt to net capitalization                                                         37.3       %                     43.5       %
our net debt to net capitalization ratio decreased to 37.3% at december 31, 2023 compared to 43.5% at december 31, 2022. net debt decreased $253.2 million primarily due to a decrease in commercial paper borrowings and greater cash and cash equivalents, including cash held for sale. stockholders' equity increased for the period as a result of current earnings of $1.1 billion, offset by $284.3 million of dividends paid.
our ability to obtain debt financing at comparable risk-based interest rates is partly a function of our existing cash flow-to-debt and debt-to-capitalization levels as well as our current credit standing. set forth below are our credit ratings, as of december 31, 2023, which were independently developed by the respective credit agencies. the moody's rating and outlook were issued in december 2018, and the standard & poor's rating was issued in december 2017 and the outlook was most recently revised in may 2021. the ratings and outlooks from both agencies were affirmed in 2023.
short-term rating       long-term rating        outlook moody's                       p-2                     baa1                    stable standard &amp; poor's         a-2                     bbb+                    stable as of december 31, 2023, we had approximately $180.0 million outstanding in letters of credit, surety bonds, and performance and other guarantees with financial institutions, which primarily expire on various dates through 2031. these letters of credit and bonds are primarily issued as security for insurance, warranty and other performance obligations. in general, we would only be liable for the amount of these guarantees in the event of default in the performance of our obligations, the probability of which we believe is remote.
operating cash flow and access to capital markets are expected to satisfy our various cash flow requirements, including acquisitions, capital expenditures, purchase obligations, and lease obligations. see note 7 - leases in the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10-k for additional details on lease obligations. acquisition spending and/or share repurchases could potentially increase our debt.
we believe that existing sources of liquidity are adequate to meet anticipated funding needs at current risk-based interest rates for the foreseeable future.
financial instruments and risk management the diverse nature of our businesses' activities necessitates the management of various financial and market risks, including those related to changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices. we periodically use derivative financial instruments to manage some of these risks. we do not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes. we are exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to our financial instrument contracts; however, nonperformance by these counterparties is considered unlikely as our policy is to contract with highly-rated, diversified counterparties.
interest rate exposure as of december 31, 2023, and for the years ended december 31, 2023 and 2022, we did not have any open interest rate swap contracts; however, we may in the future enter into interest rate swap agreements to manage our exposure to interest rate changes. we issue commercial paper, which exposes us to changes in variable interest rates; however, maturities are typically three months or less so a change in rates over this period would not have a material impact on our pre-tax earnings.
we consider our current risk related to market fluctuations in interest rates to be minimal since our debt is largely long-term and fixed rate in nature. generally, the fair market value of fixed-interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. a 100 basis point increase in market interest rates would decrease the 2023 year-end fair value of our long-term debt by approximately $155.9 million. however, since we have no plans to repurchase our outstanding fixed-rate instruments before their maturities, the impact of market interest rate fluctuations on our long-term debt does not affect our results of operations or financial position.
foreign currency exposure we conduct business in various non-u.s. countries, including canada, substantially all of the european countries, mexico, brazil, china, india and other asian countries. therefore, we have foreign currency risk relating to receipts from customers, payments to suppliers and intercompany transactions denominated in foreign currencies. we will occasionally use derivative financial instruments to offset such risks, when it is believed that the exposure will not be limited by our normal operating and financing activities. we have formal policies to mitigate risk in this area by using fair value and/or cash flow hedging programs.
changes in the value of the currencies of the countries in which we operate affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows when translated into u.s. dollars, our reporting currency. the strengthening of the u.s. dollar could result in unfavorable translation effects as the results of foreign operations are translated into u.s. dollars. we have generally accepted the exposure to exchange rate movements relative to our investment in non-u.s. operations. we may, from time to time, for a specific exposure, enter into fair value hedges.
additionally, we have designated the €600 million and €500 million of euro-denominated notes issued november 9, 2016 and november 4, 2019, respectively, as a hedge of our net investment in euro-denominated operations. due to the high degree of effectiveness between the hedging instruments and the exposure being hedged, fluctuations in the value of the euro-denominated debt due to exchange rate changes are offset by changes in the net investment. accordingly, changes in the value of the euro-denominated debt are recognized in the cumulative translation adjustment section of other comprehensive income to offset changes in the value of the net investment in euro-denominated operations. due to the fluctuations of the euro relative to the u.s. dollar, the u.s. dollar equivalent of this debt increases or decreases, resulting in the recognition of a pre-tax loss of $45.8 million and pre-tax gain of $80.3 million in other comprehensive income for the years ended december 31, 2023 and 2022 respectively.
commodity price exposure some of our businesses are exposed to volatility in the prices of certain commodities, such as aluminum, steel, copper and various precious metals, among others. our primary exposure to commodity pricing volatility relates to the use of these materials in purchased component parts or the purchase of raw materials. markets for multiple raw materials saw significant cost increases throughout 2021 and into 2023, which we partially offset through price increases and other levers. in some cases, we maintain longer-term index based contracts on raw materials and component parts and centrally drive an ongoing effort to minimize risk proactively. however, we are prone to exposure as these contracts expire.
critical accounting estimates revenue recognition description the majority of our revenue is generated through the manufacture and sale of a broad range of specialized products and components, with revenue recognized upon transfer of title and risk of loss, which is generally upon shipment. in limited cases, our revenue arrangements with customers require delivery, installation, testing, certification, or other promises to deliver goods or services that may impact the timing or pattern of revenue recognized. the remainder of our revenue is recognized over time, which is primarily related to services performed and specialized goods manufactured.
judgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate a significant level of judgment is involved in the identification of performance obligations for contracts with multiple-element arrangements and the allocation of the transaction price based on the relative stand-alone selling price. the identification requires judgment to identify all distinct goods or services and also the appropriate timing of revenue recognition for each distinct good or service based on the transfer of control to the customer. we estimate the relative stand-alone selling price for performance obligations if not directly observable. a significant level of judgment is also involved in the selection of the appropriate method to recognize revenue over time.
effect if actual results differ from assumptions to the extent the judgments and estimates used or the method selected to recognize revenue over time differ or change in a future period, a change to revenue and the related assets and liabilities could impact our financial position or results of operations. the judgments, estimates, and methods used have been applied consistently over the last three fiscal years.
valuation of acquired intangible assets description intangible assets represent a significant portion of our consolidated balance sheet as a result of current and past acquisitions. intangible assets primarily include customer intangibles, trademarks, unpatented technologies, and patents. the fair value of acquired intangible assets is determined using widely accepted valuation techniques, and the company may engage third-party appraisal firms to assist with the determination of fair values of significant intangible assets. the valuation of intangible assets is performed at the time of acquisition and may change during the acquisition measurement period until the valuation is finalized. the fair value of finite-lived intangible assets is subsequently amortized over the estimated useful life.
judgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate the significant assumptions used in the valuation of customer intangibles include future cash flows, customer attrition rate, and discount rate. the significant assumptions for the valuation of trademarks include future revenues, royalty rate, and discount rate. the significant assumptions for the valuation of unpatented technologies and patents include future revenues, obsolescence rate, royalty rate, and discount rate. the assumptions and estimates used in the valuation of these intangible assets are based on several factors, including historical experience with similar businesses and industries and information obtained from operating company management.
effect if actual results differ from assumptions while we believe the assumptions used in our valuation of intangible assets are reasonable and representative of expected results, actual results may differ from these assumptions. while the assumptions used for each acquisition are dependent on the acquired company, the assumptions have been applied using a consistent methodology over the last three fiscal years.
goodwill impairment description goodwill is the difference between the consideration transferred and the fair value of net assets acquired. goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis during the fourth quarter, or more frequently when indicators of impairment exist, or when a change in the composition of reporting units for goodwill occurs for other reasons, such as a disposition or a change in segments. the impairment test involves a comparison of the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying value. fair value reflects the price a potential market participant would be willing to pay for the reporting unit in an arms-length transaction.
judgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate the significant assumptions in the fair value analysis of goodwill are the estimated future cash flows and the discount rate. the determination of future cash flows involves significant judgment and is primarily driven by forecasted revenue growth rates and ebitda margins for the reporting unit. these assumptions are developed based on the reporting unit's expected future performance, which considers historical performance. we use a discount rate commensurate with the inherent risks in our internally developed forecasts of future cash flows. the discount rate may also fluctuate due to market conditions such as rising interest rates.
effect if actual results differ from assumptions while we believe the assumptions used in our annual impairment analysis are reasonable and representative of expected results and reflective of a market participant, actual results may differ from these assumptions. the methodology used for the goodwill impairment test has remained consistent over the last three fiscal years.
valuation of pension benefit obligation description the pension benefit obligation is actuarially determined in accordance with gaap and is impacted by assumptions used to estimate the obligation, namely the discount rate. annually, we review the actuarial assumptions used and compare the assumptions to third-party benchmarks to ensure that the selected assumptions accurately account for our future pension benefit obligations.
judgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate our discount rate assumptions are determined by developing a yield curve based on high quality corporate bonds with maturities matching the plans' expected benefit payment streams. the plans' expected cash flows are then discounted by the resulting year-by-year spot rates. the 2023 weighted-average discount rate used to measure our pension benefit obligations ranged from 2.80% to 5.20%, a general decrease from the 2022 rates, which ranged from 3.57% to 5.55%, due to decreases in corporate bond yields over this period.
effect if actual results differ from assumptions a 25-basis point decrease in the discount rates used for these plans would have increased pension benefit obligations by approximately $16.6 million from the amount recorded at december 31, 2023. the methodology used for the valuation of the pension benefit obligation has remained consistent over the last three fiscal years.
recoverability of deferred income tax assets and unrecognized tax benefits description we operate in and are subject to income taxes in various jurisdictions and are subject to ongoing audits by federal, state, and non-u.s. tax authorities. significant judgment is required in determining the realizability of deferred tax assets and evaluating unrecognized tax benefits.
we have significant amounts of deferred tax assets that are evaluated for recoverability and valued accordingly. management evaluates the realizability of deferred income tax assets for each jurisdiction in which the company operates. we record valuation allowances to reduce the carrying value of deferred tax assets to amounts that we expect are more likely than not to be realized.
the provision for unrecognized tax benefits provides a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for determining the financial statement tax benefits taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and disclosure requirements regarding uncertainties in income tax positions. the tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement.
judgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate in assessing the adequacy of a recorded valuation allowance, we consider all positive and negative evidence, including the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, historical and projected future taxable income, and tax planning strategies. additionally, significant judgment is required in the identification and measurement of unrecognized tax benefits. our liability for unrecognized tax benefits contains uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the exposures associated with our various filing positions.
effect if actual results differ from assumptions although we believe that our judgments and estimates are reasonable, actual results could differ and result in additional tax expense or benefit. if we determine a valuation allowance should be recognized to reduce the carrying value of a deferred tax asset or a liability for an unrecognized tax benefit needs to be recorded, the adjustment would result in a change to tax expense in the period such determination is made. we have not made any material changes in the process we use to assess valuation allowances and unrecognized tax benefits over the last three fiscal years.
contingencies description liabilities are established for environmental and legal contingencies at both the business and corporate levels. a significant amount of judgment and the use of estimates are required to quantify our ultimate exposure in these matters.
judgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate the valuation of liabilities for these contingencies is reviewed on a quarterly basis to ensure that we have accrued the proper level of expense. the liability balances are adjusted to account for changes in circumstances for ongoing issues and the establishment of additional liabilities for emerging issues. estimates used in the valuations include the probable outcome of such proceedings, the costs and expenses reasonably expected to be incurred and currently accrued to-date and consider the availability and extent of insurance coverage. such liability balances contain uncertainties due to new developments regarding the facts and circumstances of each proceeding, changes in applicable laws and regulations, and other future events and decisions by third parties that may impact the ultimate resolution of a proceeding.
effect if actual results differ from assumptions although we believe that the amount accrued to-date is adequate, future changes in circumstances could impact these determinations, and we may be exposed to a material loss. for example, to the extent we prevail in matters for which a liability has been established or are required to pay amounts in excess of our established liability, our contingent liability in a given financial statement period could be materially affected. however, the company does not believe that it is currently involved in any legal proceedings which, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material effect on its financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.
recent accounting standards see note 1 - description of business and summary of significant accounting policies in the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10-k for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements and recently adopted accounting standards.
non-gaap disclosures in an effort to provide investors with additional information regarding our results as determined by gaap, we also disclose non-gaap information, which we believe provides useful information to investors. free cash flow, free cash flow as a percentage of revenue, free cash flow as a percentage of net earnings, net debt, net capitalization, net debt to net capitalization ratio, adjusted working capital, and organic revenue growth are not financial measures under gaap and should not be considered as a substitute for cash flows from operating activities, debt or equity, working capital or revenue as determined in accordance with gaap, and they may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.
we believe the net debt to net capitalization ratio and free cash flow are important measures of liquidity. net debt to net capitalization is helpful in evaluating our capital structure and the amount of leverage we employ. free cash flow and free cash flow ratios provide both management and investors a measurement of cash generated from operations that is available to fund acquisitions, pay dividends, repay debt and repurchase our common stock. free cash flow as a percentage of revenue equals free cash flow divided by revenue. free cash flow as a percentage of net earnings equals free cash flow divided by net earnings. we believe that reporting adjusted working capital provides a meaningful measure of liquidity by showing changes caused by operational results. we believe that reporting organic revenue growth, which excludes the impact of foreign currency exchange rates and the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, provides a useful comparison of our revenue performance and trends between periods.
reconciliations and comparisons of gaap to non-gaap measures can be found above in this item 7, md&a.

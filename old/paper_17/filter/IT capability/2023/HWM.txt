item 1a. risk factors.
howmet's business, financial condition and results of operations may be impacted by a number of factors. in addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this report, the following risks and uncertainties could materially harm the company's business, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows, including causing its actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements. the following list of risk factors is not all-inclusive or necessarily in order of importance. additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to howmet or that howmet currently deems immaterial may also adversely affect the company materially in future periods.
risks related to our business and operations the markets for howmet's products are cyclical, and such markets and howmet's operations are influenced by a number of factors, including global economic conditions.
howmet is subject to cyclical fluctuations in global economic conditions and lightweight metals end-use markets. howmet sells many products to industries that are cyclical, such as the aerospace and commercial transportation industries, and the demand for our products is sensitive to, and quickly impacted by, demand for the finished goods manufactured by our customers in these industries, which may change as a result of changes in regional or worldwide economies, currency exchange rates, interest rates, inflation, energy prices or other factors beyond our control. in particular, howmet derives a significant portion of our revenue from products sold to the aerospace industry, which is cyclical and reflective of changes in the general economy. the commercial aerospace industry is historically driven by the demand from commercial airlines for new aircraft and spare parts. demand for commercial aircraft and spare parts is influenced by airline industry profitability, trends in airline passenger traffic domestically and globally, the state of u.s., regional and world economies, the ability of aircraft purchasers to obtain required financing and numerous other factors. changes and uncertainties in the timing and level of future aircraft production by oems may cause our future results to differ from prior periods due to changes in the company's product mix. the defense aerospace cycle is highly dependent on u.s. and foreign government funding. it is also impacted by the effects of terrorism, a changing global geopolitical environment, u.s. foreign policy, whether older military aircraft are retired, and technological improvements to new engines and airframes. the demand for howmet's commercial transportation products is driven by the number of vehicles produced by commercial transportation manufacturers. commercial transportation sales and production are affected by many factors, including the age of the vehicle fleet, labor relations issues, fuel prices, regulatory requirements, government initiatives, trade agreements, and levels of competition.
the ongoing conflict between russia and ukraine has impacted global energy markets, particularly in europe, leading to high volatility and increasing prices for crude oil, natural gas and other energy supplies. higher energy costs result in increases in operating expenses at our manufacturing facilities, in the expense of shipping raw materials to our facilities, and in the expense of shipping products to our customers. the costs of certain raw materials (including, but not limited to, nickel, titanium, aluminum, cobalt, and rhenium) necessary for the manufacture of howmet's products and other manufacturing and operating costs are influenced by market forces and governmental constraints, including inflation, supply and demand, and shortages, and could be further influenced by export limits, sanctions, new or increased import duties, and countervailing or anti-dumping duties. for example, as the russia-ukraine conflict continues, global titanium prices may continue to fluctuate or increase. our customers' failure to return titanium revert (reusable scrap) to howmet can result in an increase of the amount of titanium purchased at inflated costs. recent high levels of inflation worldwide and in the united states has resulted in an increase in the costs of materials and labor. while we generally attempt to pass along higher raw material and energy costs to our customers through contractual agreements in the form of price increases, there can be a delay between an increase in our costs and our ability to increase the prices of our products. additionally, we may not be able to increase the prices of our products due to competitive pricing pressure and other factors. if the company is unable to offset significant cost increases through customer price increases, productivity improvements, cost reduction or other programs, howmet's business, operating results or financial condition could be materially adversely affected.
howmet is unable to predict the future course of industry variables, the strength of the u.s., regional or global economies, or the effects of government actions. negative economic conditions, such as a major economic downturn or recession, continued inflation, or disruptions in the financial markets, could have a material adverse effect on howmet's business, financial condition or results of operations.
if howmet's operations, particularly one of its key manufacturing facilities, were to be disrupted, including because of significant equipment failures, natural disasters, power outages, fires, explosions, terrorism, theft, sabotage, adverse weather conditions, public health crises, labor disputes, labor shortages or other reasons, howmet may be unable to effectively meet its obligations to, or demand from, its customers. in addition, the manufacture of many of howmet's products is a complex process. manufacturing problems arising from equipment failure or malfunction, inadvertent failure to follow regulatory or customer specifications and procedures, including those related to quality or safety, and problems with raw materials could have an adverse impact on the company's ability to fulfill orders or meet product quality or performance requirements, which may result in negative publicity and damage to our reputation, adversely impacting product demand and customer relationships. interruptions in production capability could increase howmet's costs and reduce its sales, including causing the company to incur costs for premium freight, make substantial capital expenditures, or purchase alternative material at higher costs to fulfill customer orders. additionally, a delivery delay by us due to production interruptions could subject us to liability from customer claims that such delay resulted in losses to the customer. furthermore, product manufacturing or performance issues could result in recalls, customer penalties, contract cancellation and product liability exposure in addition to a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. because of approval, license and qualification requirements applicable to manufacturers and/or their suppliers, sources of alternatives to mitigate manufacturing disruptions may not be readily available to howmet or its customers.
howmet is dependent on a limited number of suppliers for materials and services essential to our operations, including raw materials, and supply chain disruptions could have a material adverse effect on our business.
howmet has supply arrangements with suppliers for various materials and services, including raw materials. we maintain annual or long-term contracts for a majority of our supply requirements, and, for the remainder, we depend on spot purchases. there can be no assurance that we will be able to renew, or obtain replacements for, any of our long-term contracts when they expire on terms that are as favorable as our existing agreements, or at all. for certain raw materials and services, we depend on a number of limited source or sole source suppliers, such as for titanium sponge and specialized metal alloys. supply constraints could impact our production or force us to purchase materials and other supplies from alternative sources, which may not be available in sufficient quantities or at prices that are favorable to us. howmet could also have exposure if a key supplier is unable to deliver sufficient quantities of a necessary material on a timely basis. several of our suppliers have had constraints on their ability to supply howmet with its full requirements due to lack of capacity, labor shortages and/or material availability. if such constraints continue or escalate, it could result in an adverse impact on our business. because of approval, license and qualification requirements applicable to manufacturers and/or their suppliers, sources of alternatives to mitigate supply disruptions may not be readily available to howmet. any delay in supply from these suppliers could prevent us from meeting customer demand for our products. the availability and costs of certain raw materials necessary for the production of howmet's products may also be influenced by private or government entities, including as a result of changes in geopolitical conditions or regulatory requirements, labor relations between the producers and their work forces, and unstable governments in exporting nations. any of the foregoing supply chain disruptions or those due to trade barriers, business continuity, quality, cyberattacks, transportation, delivery or logistics challenges, weather, natural disaster, war, or pandemic events could adversely affect howmet's business, results of operations or financial condition.
howmet's business depends, in part, on its ability to successfully meet program demand, production targets and commitments.
howmet is currently under contract to supply components for a number of existing and new commercial, general aviation, military aircraft and aircraft engine programs. many of these contracts contemplate production increases over the next several years. if howmet fails to meet production targets and commitments, or encounters difficulty or unexpected costs in meeting such levels, it could have a material adverse effect on the company's reputation, business, operating results or financial condition. similarly, to the extent demand for our products increases rapidly and significantly in future periods, we may not be able to ramp up production quickly enough to meet the demand, which could result in lost opportunities for growth and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or competitive position.
failure to attract and retain a qualified workforce and key personnel or to provide adequate succession planning could adversely affect howmet's operations and competitiveness.
howmet's global operations require qualified and skilled personnel with relevant industry and technical experience. shortages in certain skills, in areas such as engineering, manufacturing and technology, and other labor market inadequacies have created more competition for talent. a sustained labor shortage, lack of skilled labor, increased turnover, labor inflation, or increase in general labor costs could lead to higher labor, recruiting or training costs to attract and retain personnel. if the company fails to attract, train, develop and retain a global workforce with the skills and in the locations we need to operate and grow our business, our business and operations could be adversely impacted. furthermore, the continuity of key personnel and the preservation of institutional knowledge are vital to the success of the company's growth and business strategy. the loss of key personnel could significantly harm howmet's business, and any unplanned turnover or failure to develop adequate succession plans for key positions could deplete the company's institutional knowledge base, result in loss of technical or other expertise, delay or impede the execution of the company's business plans and erode howmet's competitiveness.
howmet could be adversely affected by the loss of key customers or significant changes in the business or financial condition of its customers.
howmet has long-term contracts with a significant number of its customers, some of which are subject to renewal, renegotiation or re-pricing at periodic intervals or upon changes in competitive supply conditions. howmet's failure to successfully renew, renegotiate or favorably re-price such agreements, or a material deterioration in or termination of these customer relationships, could result in a reduction or loss in customer revenue. additionally, a significant downturn or deterioration in the business or financial condition or loss of a key customer supplied by howmet could adversely affect howmet's financial results. howmet's customers may experience delays in the launch of new products, labor strikes, diminished liquidity or credit unavailability, weak demand for their products, decreases in production rates due to regulatory investigations or otherwise, supply chain constraints or other difficulties in their businesses. howmet's customers may also change their business strategies or modify their business relationships with howmet, including to reduce the amount of howmet's products they purchase, to switch to alternative suppliers, or to enter into the markets themselves to compete with howmet. if howmet's customers reduce, terminate or delay purchases from howmet due to the foregoing factors or otherwise and howmet is unsuccessful in enforcing its contract rights or replacing such business in whole or in part or replaces it with less profitable business, our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.
howmet's products are used in a variety of military applications, including military aircraft. although many of the military programs in which howmet participates extend several years, changes in military strategy, policy and priorities, or reductions in defense spending, may affect current and future funding of these programs and could reduce the demand for howmet's products, which could adversely affect howmet's business, financial condition or results of operations.
information technology system failures, cyberattacks and security breaches may threaten the integrity of howmet's intellectual property and other sensitive information, disrupt its business operations, and result in reputational harm and other negative consequences having a material adverse effect on its financial condition and results of operations.
howmet's information technology systems could be subject to damage or interruption from power outages; computer network and telecommunications failures; cyberattacks; catastrophic events, such as fires, floods, earthquakes, tornadoes, hurricanes, acts of war or terrorism; and usage errors by employees. if howmet's information technology systems are damaged or cease to function properly, the company may have to make a significant investment to fix or replace them, and howmet may suffer loss of critical data and interruptions or delays in its operations. any material disruption in the company's information technology systems, or delays or difficulties in implementing or integrating new systems or enhancing current systems, could have an adverse effect on howmet's business, financial condition or results of operations.
increased global cybersecurity vulnerabilities, threats and more sophisticated and targeted cyberattacks pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks, and the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data, as well as those of our customers, suppliers and other counterparties. the company believes that it faces threats of cyberattacks due to the industries it serves, the locations of its operations, and its technological innovations. the company has experienced cybersecurity attacks in the past, including breaches of its information technology systems in which information was taken, and may experience them in the future, potentially with more frequency or sophistication. although past attacks did not result in known losses of any critical data or have a material impact on howmet's financial condition or results of operations, the scope and impact of any future incident cannot be predicted. while the company continually works to safeguard its systems and mitigate potential risks, there is no assurance that such actions will be sufficient to prevent cybersecurity incidents that manipulate or improperly use the company's systems or networks, compromise confidential, personal or otherwise protected information, destroy or corrupt data, block access to its systems, or otherwise disrupt its operations. the occurrence of such events could negatively impact howmet's reputation and its competitive position and could result in litigation with third parties, regulatory action, loss of business, potential liability and increased remediation costs, any of which could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition and results of operations.
howmet faces significant competition, which may have an adverse effect on profitability.
as discussed in "competitive conditions" in part i, item 1 (business) of this report, the markets for howmet's products are highly competitive. howmet's competitors include a variety of both u.s. and non-u.s. companies in our product markets, which could include existing customers. new entrants in our markets, new product offerings, new and/or emerging technologies in the marketplace, or new facilities may compete with or replace howmet products. the willingness of customers to accept alternative solutions for the products sold by howmet, pricing pressure from competitors, and technological advancements or other developments by or affecting howmet's competitors or customers could adversely affect howmet's business, financial condition or results of operations. howmet's competitive position and future performance depends, in part, on the company's ability to develop and innovate products, deploy technology initiatives and implement advanced manufacturing technologies. while howmet intends to continue to develop innovative new products and services, it may not be able to successfully differentiate its products or services from those of its competitors or achieve and maintain technological advantages.
in addition, howmet may face increased competition due to industry consolidation. companies that are strategic partners in some areas of howmet's business may acquire or form alliances with howmet's competitors, thereby reducing their business with howmet. industry consolidation may result in stronger competitors who are better able to obtain favorable terms from suppliers or who are better able to compete as sole-source vendors for customers. consolidation within howmet's customer base may result in customers who are better able to exert leverage in negotiating prices and other terms of sale, or may lead to reduced demand for howmet's products if a combined entity replaces howmet with a howmet competitor with which it had prior relationships. the result of these circumstances could have a material adverse effect on howmet's business, operating results and financial condition.
howmet's global operations expose howmet to risks that could adversely affect its business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or the market price of its securities.
howmet has operations or activities in numerous countries and regions outside the united states, including europe, mexico, china, and japan. as a result, howmet's global operations are affected by economic, political, legal, and other conditions in the united states and foreign countries in which howmet does business, including (i) economic and commercial instability risks, including changes in local government laws, regulations and policies, such as those related to tariffs, sanctions and trade barriers, taxation, exchange controls, employment regulations and repatriation of assets or earnings; (ii) geopolitical risks such as political instability, civil unrest, expropriation, nationalization of properties by a government, imposition of sanctions, and renegotiation or nullification of existing agreements; (iii) wars such as those in ukraine and the middle east, cyber threats, terrorist activities or other dangerous conditions; (iv) compliance with applicable u.s. and foreign laws, including antitrust and competition regulations, the foreign corrupt practices act and other anti-bribery and corruption laws, and laws concerning trade, including the international traffic in arms regulations, the export administration regulations, and the sanctions, regulations and embargoes administered by the u.s. department of treasury's office of foreign assets control; (v) aggressive, selective or lax enforcement of laws and regulations by foreign governmental authorities; (vi) exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, as well as inflation, economic factors, and currency controls in the countries in which it operates; and (vii) major public health issues, such as an outbreak of a pandemic or epidemic. although the effect of any of the foregoing factors is difficult to predict, any one or more of them could adversely affect howmet's business, financial condition or results of operations.
risks related to liquidity and capital resources a decline in howmet's financial performance or outlook could negatively impact its credit profile, its access to capital markets and its borrowing costs.
a decline in the company's financial performance or outlook due to internal or external factors, such as macroeconomic conditions, a deterioration in the company's financial metrics or a contraction in the company's liquidity, could adversely affect the company's credit ratings and its access to the capital or credit markets on terms and conditions that the company finds acceptable. a downgrade of howmet's credit ratings could result in negative consequences, including limiting its ability to obtain future financing on favorable terms, if at all, increasing borrowing costs and credit facility fees, triggering collateral postings, and adversely affecting the market price of howmet securities. for information on our credit ratings, see "liquidity and capital resources" in part ii, item 7 (management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations). limitations on howmet's ability to access global capital markets, a reduction in howmet's liquidity or an increase in borrowing costs could materially and adversely affect howmet's ability to maintain or grow its business, which in turn may adversely affect its financial condition, liquidity and results of operations.
an adverse decline in the liability discount rate, lower-than-expected investment return on pension assets and other factors could adversely affect howmet's results of operations or amount of pension funding contributions in future periods.
howmet's results of operations may be negatively affected by the amount of expense howmet records for its pension and other postretirement benefit plans, by reductions in the fair value of plan assets and by other factors. howmet calculates income or expense for its plans using actuarial valuations in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america. these valuations reflect assumptions about financial market and other economic conditions, which may change due to changes in key economic indicators. the most significant year-end assumptions used by howmet to estimate pension or other postretirement benefit income or expense for the following year are the discount rate applied to plan liabilities and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. in addition, howmet is required to make an annual measurement of plan assets and liabilities, which may result in a significant charge to shareholders' equity. for a discussion regarding how howmet's financial statements can be affected by pension and other postretirement benefits accounting policies, see "critical accounting policies and estimates-pension and other postretirement benefits" in part ii, item 7 (management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations) and note g to the consolidated financial statements in part ii, item 8.
adverse capital market conditions could result in reductions in the fair value of plan assets and increase the company's liabilities related to such plans. additionally, unpredictable future declines in the discount rate or lower-than-expected investment returns on plan assets could lead to a decline in the plans' funded status and result in higher than expected pension contributions. the foregoing factors may adversely affect the company's financial condition, liquidity and results of operations.
dividends and share repurchases fall within the discretion of our board of directors and depend on a number of factors.
share repurchases and the declaration of dividends fall within the discretion of howmet's board of directors, and the board's decision regarding such matters depends on many factors, including howmet's financial condition, earnings, capital requirements, debt service obligations, covenants associated with certain of the company's debt obligations, industry practice, legal requirements, regulatory constraints and other factors that the board deems relevant. there can be no assurance that the company will declare dividends or repurchase stock in the future in any particular amounts, or at all.
the manufacture and sale of our products expose howmet to potential product liability, personal injury, property damage and related claims. in the event that a howmet product fails to perform as expected, regardless of fault, or is used in an unexpected manner, and such failure or use results in, or is alleged to result in, bodily injury and/or property damage or other losses, howmet may be subject to product liability lawsuits and other claims, or may participate in a recall or other corrective action involving such product. in addition, if a howmet product is perceived to be defective or unsafe, howmet's sales could decrease, its reputation could be adversely impacted and howmet could be exposed to government investigations or regulatory enforcement actions. howmet is also subject to a variety of global legal and regulatory compliance risks in connection with its business and products. these risks include, among other things, potential claims, class action lawsuits or compliance issues, including those relating to securities laws, employment laws, intellectual property rights, cyber, security and privacy, insurance, commercial matters, antitrust and competition, human rights, third-party relationships, esg (including climate-related/sustainability and other) rules and regulations, supply chain operations and the manufacture and sale of products. an adverse outcome in one or more of proceedings or investigations, or unfavorable changes in laws, regulations or policies, or other contingencies that the company cannot predict with certainty, could have a material adverse effect on the company's financial condition, results of operations or cash flows, including reputational harm, loss of customers and substantial monetary damages and/or non-monetary penalties. for additional information regarding the legal proceedings involving the company, see note u to the consolidated financial statements in part ii, item 8.
our business may be adversely affected if we fail to comply with government contracting regulations.
we derive a portion of our revenue from sales to u.s. and foreign governments and their respective agencies. such contracts are subject to various procurement laws and regulations and contract provisions relating to their formation, administration and performance. new laws and regulations or changes to existing ones (including, but not limited to, those related to subcontracting, cybersecurity and specialty metals) can increase our risks and/or costs. failure to comply with these laws, regulations or provisions in our government contracts could result in the imposition of various civil and criminal penalties, termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, increased pricing pressure or suspension from future government contracting. if our government contracts are terminated, if we are suspended from government work, or if our ability to compete for new contracts is adversely affected, our financial condition and results of operation could be adversely affected.
howmet may face challenges to its intellectual property rights which could adversely affect the company's reputation, business and competitive position.
howmet owns important intellectual property, including patents, trademarks, copyrights and trade secrets. the company's intellectual property plays an important role in maintaining howmet's competitive position in a number of the markets that the company serves. howmet's competitors may develop technologies that are similar or superior to howmet's proprietary technologies, or design around the patents howmet owns or licenses. despite its controls and safeguards, howmet's technology may be misappropriated by its employees, its competitors or other third parties. the pursuit of remedies for any misappropriation of howmet intellectual property is expensive and the ultimate remedies may be deemed insufficient. further, in jurisdictions where the enforcement of intellectual property rights is less robust, the risk of misappropriation of howmet intellectual property increases, despite efforts the company undertakes to protect it. developments or assertions by or against howmet relating to intellectual property rights, and any inability to protect or enforce howmet's rights sufficiently, could adversely affect howmet's business and competitive position.
unanticipated changes in howmet's tax provisions or exposure to additional tax liabilities could affect howmet's future profitability.
howmet is subject to income taxes in both the united states and various non-u.s. jurisdictions. its domestic and international tax liabilities are dependent upon the distribution of income among these different jurisdictions. changes in applicable domestic or foreign tax laws and regulations, including enactment of the organization for economic cooperation and development's pillar 2 framework, or their interpretation and application, including the possibility of retroactive effect, could affect the company's tax expense and profitability. howmet's tax expense includes estimates of additional tax that may be incurred for tax exposures and reflects various estimates and assumptions. the assumptions include assessments of future earnings of the company that could impact the valuation of its deferred tax assets. the company's future results of operations could be adversely affected by changes in the effective tax rate as a result of a change in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the overall profitability of the company, changes in tax legislation and rates, changes in generally accepted accounting principles, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, the results of tax audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns or related litigation and continuing assessments of its tax exposures.
labor disputes and other employee relations issues could adversely affect howmet's business, financial condition or results of operations.
a significant portion of howmet's employees are represented by labor unions in the united states and other countries under various collective bargaining agreements, each with varying durations and expiration dates. for more information, see "employees" in part i, item 1 (business) of this report. howmet may not be able to negotiate successor collective bargaining agreements upon expiration without a risk of labor disputes, including strikes or work stoppages, or we may be unable to renegotiate such contracts on favorable terms. labor organizations may attempt to organize groups of additional employees from time to time, and potential changes in labor laws could make it easier for them to do so. howmet may also be subject to general country strikes or work stoppages unrelated to its business or collective bargaining agreements. if we experience any extended interruption of operations at any of our facilities as a result of labor disputes, strikes or other work stoppages, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected.
howmet is exposed to environmental, health and safety risks and is subject to a broad range of health, safety and environmental laws and regulations which may result in substantial costs and liabilities.
howmet's operations worldwide are subject to numerous complex and increasingly stringent health, safety and environmental laws and regulations. the costs of complying with such laws and regulations, as well as participation in assessments and cleanups of sites, and internal voluntary programs, have been, and in the future could be, significant. environmental matters for which howmet may be liable may arise in the future at its present sites, at sites owned or operated by its predecessors or affiliates, at sites that it may acquire in the future, or at third-party sites used by howmet, its predecessors or affiliates for material and waste handling and disposal. compliance with health, safety and environmental laws and regulations, including remediation obligations, may impact howmet's results of operations or liquidity in a particular period.
in addition, the industrial activities conducted at howmet's facilities present a significant risk of injury or death to our employees or third parties that may be on site. our operations are subject to regulation by various federal, state and local agencies in the united states, including the occupational safety and health administration, and regulation by foreign government entities abroad responsible for employee health and safety. material liabilities relating to injury, death or other workers' compensation claims could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition or result in negative publicity and/or significant reputational harm.
increased concern over climate change has led to new and proposed legislative and regulatory initiatives, such as cap-and-trade systems and additional limits on emissions of greenhouse gases, which in turn may trigger customer decarbonization requirements. new or revised laws, regulations and policies in this area and customer decarbonization requirements could directly and indirectly affect howmet and its customers and suppliers, including by increasing the costs of production or impacting demand for certain products, which could result in an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. additionally, howmet utilizes natural gas, electricity and other fuels to operate its facilities. significant increased energy costs and/or costs to transition to renewable energy sources, as a result of new laws, such as carbon pricing or product energy efficiency requirements, or as a result of customer requirements, could be passed along to the company and its customers and suppliers. compliance with any new or more stringent laws or regulations, or stricter interpretations of existing laws, could require additional expenditures by the company or its customers or suppliers.
physical risks associated with climate change may result in an increase of the exposure to, and impact of, events with damage due to flooding, extreme winds and extreme precipitation for howmet locations, suppliers or customers. prolonged periods of drought may result in wildfires and/or restrictions on process water use. these climate-related impacts may have an adverse effect on production capacity of howmet sites, suppliers and customers. these types of incidents could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
with respect to the various transaction agreements that the company entered into in connection with its separation transactions, if the counterparties fail to meet their obligations or if we have material indemnification obligations under such agreements, our business, results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected.
in connection with our separation transactions, we entered into various agreements with arconic corporation and alcoa corporation, including respective separation and distribution agreements pursuant to which arconic corporation and alcoa corporation agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities, and we agreed to indemnify those parties for certain liabilities. we rely on these parties to satisfy their performance and payment obligations under these agreements. if either party is unable or unwilling to satisfy its obligations under its applicable agreements, we could incur operational difficulties and/or material losses. the indemnities that we are required to provide alcoa corporation and arconic corporation under these agreements are currently not material. if either alcoa corporation or arconic corporation, as applicable, is not able to fully satisfy its indemnification obligations to us, we may be required to bear such losses. each of these risks could negatively affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.
the following management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ("md&a") is intended to help the reader understand our results of operations and financial condition. the md&a is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in part ii, item 8 (financial statements and supplementary data) of this form 10-k.
overview our business howmet is a global leader in lightweight metals engineering and manufacturing. howmet's innovative, multi-material products, which include nickel, titanium, aluminum, and cobalt, are used worldwide in the aerospace (commercial and defense), commercial transportation, and industrial and other markets.
howmet is a global company operating in 20 countries. based upon the country where the point of shipment occurred, north america and europe generated 70% and 23%, respectively, of howmet's sales in 2023. in addition, howmet has operating activities in numerous countries and regions outside of north america and europe, including china and japan. governmental policies, laws and regulations, and other economic factors, including inflation and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, affect the results of operations in countries with such activities.
management review of 2023 and outlook the company derived approximately 49% of its revenue from products sold to the commercial aerospace market for the year ended december 31, 2023 which is substantially less than the pre-pandemic 2019 annual rate of approximately 60%. aircraft production in the commercial aerospace industry continues to recover based on increases in demand for narrow body and wide body aircraft. we expect commercial aerospace wide body demand to grow faster than narrow body demand on a production percentage basis. the timing and level of future aircraft builds by oems are subject to changes and uncertainties, which may cause our future results to differ from prior periods due to changes in product mix in certain segments.
income before income taxes increased 61% from 2022. total segment adjusted ebitda(1) increased 17% from 2022 primarily due to favorable sales in the commercial aerospace, defense aerospace, commercial transportation, and industrial and other markets as well as favorable product pricing.
management continued its focus on liquidity and cash flows as well as improving its operating performance through profitable revenue, efficient operations, and margin enhancement. management has also continued its intensified focus on capital efficiency. management's focus and the related results enabled howmet to end 2023 with a solid financial position.
•total segment adjusted ebitda(1) of $1,587, an increase of $235, or 17%, from 2022;
•cash provided from operations of $901; cash used for financing activities of $868; and cash used for investing activities of $215;
(1)see below in results of operations for the reconciliation of total segment adjusted ebitda to income before income taxes.
in 2024, management projects sales to increase as we expect solid growth in the commercial aerospace market, and the company's strong position in that market is expected to continue. earnings per share is expected to grow as management continues to focus on revenue growth and operational performance. cash provided from operations is expected to increase for the full year in 2024 compared with 2023, resulting from a continued focus on operating performance and on capital efficiency. capital expenditures are expected to increase with additional investments in capacity expansions.
results of operations earnings summary sales. sales for 2023 were $6,640 compared with $5,663 in 2022, an increase of $977, or 17%. the increase was primarily due to higher sales in the commercial aerospace, defense aerospace, commercial transportation, and industrial and other markets, favorable product pricing of $105, and an increase in material cost pass through of $90. product price increases are in excess of inflationary pass through to our customers.
sales for 2022 were $5,663 compared with $4,972 in 2021, an increase of $691, or 14%. the increase was primarily due to higher sales in the commercial aerospace market, an increase in material cost pass through of $225, and favorable product pricing of $67, partially offset by lower sales in the defense aerospace market. product price increases are in excess of inflationary pass through to our customers.
cost of goods sold ("cogs"). cogs as a percentage of sales was 71.9% in 2023 compared with 72.5% in 2022. the decrease was primarily due to higher volumes, favorable product pricing, and lower costs related to three plant fires, partially offset by material cost pass through and increased net headcount, primarily in the engine products and fastening systems segments, in support of expected revenue increases. the company had total cogs insurance claims reimbursements of $19 in 2023, partially offset by charges of $7, related to fires that occurred in 2019 at a fastening systems plant in france (the "france plant fire") and a mechanical failure resulting in substantial heat and fire-related damage to equipment at the company's cast house in barberton, ohio in the third quarter of 2022 (the "barberton cast house incident"), compared to total cogs charges of $59 in 2022, offset by partial insurance claims reimbursements of $23, related to a fire at a forged wheels plant in barberton, ohio in mid-february 2020 (the "barberton plant fire") and the france plant fire. the insurance claims related to these three plant fires were in excess of the insurance deductible. during the fourth quarter of 2022, the company settled the insurance claim related to the barberton plant fire. the company is negotiating resolution of the insurance claims related to the france plant fire and barberton cast house incident.

other expense, net. other expense, net was $8 in 2023 compared with $82 in 2022. the decrease in expense of $74 was primarily due to the reversal of $25 of the $65 pre-tax charge taken in the third quarter of 2022 related to the lehman brothers international (europe) ("lbie") legal proceeding which was settled in the second quarter of 2023 (see note u to the consolidated financial statements in part ii, item 8) (financial statements and supplementary data) and higher interest income of $17, partially offset by the impacts of deferred compensation arrangements of $18, higher non-service related net periodic benefit costs related to pension and other postretirement benefit plans in 2023 of $13, and an increase from net realized and unrealized losses of $4, primarily related to mark-to-market adjustments on exchange-traded fixed income securities and losses on sales of receivables. non-service related net periodic benefit costs related to defined benefit plans is expected to increase by approximately $15 from 2023 to 2024.
other expense, net was $82 in 2022 compared with $19 in 2021. the increase in expense of $63 was primarily driven by the adverse judgment of $65 related to the lbie swaps, an increase from net realized and unrealized losses of $9, primarily related to mark-to-market adjustments on exchange-traded fixed income securities and losses on sales of receivables, and higher non-service related net periodic benefit costs related to pension and other postretirement benefit plans in 2022 of $7, partially offset by the impacts of deferred compensation arrangements of $16 and higher interest income of $4.
income taxes. howmet's effective tax rate was 21.5% (provision on pre-tax income) in 2023 compared with the u.s. federal statutory rate of 21%. the effective tax rate differs from the u.s. federal statutory rate primarily as a result of a $21 charge for a tax reserve established in france, $10 of incremental state tax and foreign taxes on earnings also subject to u.s. federal income tax, and $8 of charges related to nondeductible expenses, partially offset by a $14 benefit to release a valuation allowance related to u.s. foreign tax credits, a $9 excess benefit for stock compensation, $7 of benefits related to tax credits, a $2 benefit to release a valuation allowance related to u.s. state tax losses and credits, and a $2 benefit to revalue deferred taxes for changes to apportioned u.s. state tax rates. on october 8, 2021, the organization for economic cooperation and development ("oecd") released the pillar two model rules introducing a 15% global minimum tax under the oecd/g20 inclusive framework on base erosion and profit shifting. jurisdictions where the company operates have started to enact pillar two legislation effective january 1, 2024, and other jurisdictions are expected to enact legislation prospectively. the company has assessed both enacted and proposed pillar two legislation and, at this time, does not expect a material impact to its corporate tax liability or effective tax rate. howmet anticipates that the effective tax rate in 2024 will be approximately 21.5%.
howmet's effective tax rate was 22.6% (provision on pre-tax income) in 2022 compared with the u.s. federal statutory rate of 21%. the effective tax rate differs from the u.s. federal statutory rate primarily as a result of a $12 charge related to an increase in the valuation allowance on a foreign tax credit carryforward in the u.s., $8 of charges related to u.s. tax on global intangible low-taxed income ("gilti") and other foreign earnings, $8 of charges related to nondeductible expenses, and $5 of incremental state tax and foreign taxes on earnings also subject to u.s. federal income tax, partially offset by a $6 benefit for the release of a valuation allowance on interest deduction carryforwards in the u.k., a $5 benefit related to a tax accounting method change, a $5 excess benefit for stock compensation, and a $3 benefit related to a distribution of foreign earnings. the inflation reduction act of 2022 (the "act") was signed into law on august 16, 2022. the act includes various tax provisions, including a 1% excise tax on net stock repurchases, expanded tax credits for clean energy incentives, and a corporate alternative minimum tax that generally applies to u.s. corporations with average adjusted financial statement income over a three-year period in excess of $1,000. the company does not expect the act to materially impact its financial statements.
howmet's effective tax rate was 20.4% (provision on pre-tax income) in 2021 compared with the u.s. federal statutory rate of 21%. the effective tax rate differs from the u.s. federal statutory rate primarily as a result of a $32 benefit from the recognition of income tax credits related to development incentives in hungary and a $9 benefit related to updated u.s. regulatory guidance concerning the utilization of foreign tax credits in connection with the one-time transition tax on the deemed repatriation of previously non-taxed post-1986 earnings and profits of certain foreign subsidiaries enacted as part of the u.s. tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 (the "2017 act"), partially offset by $9 of charges from the decision to no longer permanently reinvest earnings in certain foreign subsidiaries, $8 of charges to establish a valuation allowance on certain net operating losses in switzerland, $7 of charges from distributions of foreign earnings, $6 of charges related to u.s. tax on foreign income, and other impacts related to nondeductible expenses including foreign losses with no tax benefit.
net income. net income was $765, or $1.83 per diluted share, for 2023 compared to $469, or $1.11 per diluted share, in 2022. the increase in results of $296, or 63%, was primarily due to higher sales in the commercial aerospace market, favorable product pricing of $105, a change of $90 due to the reversal of $25 of the $65 pre-tax charge taken in the third quarter of 2022 related to the lbie legal proceeding (see note u to the consolidated financial statements in part ii, item 8), a decrease in restructuring and other charges of $33, and a decrease in interest expense, net of $11, partially offset by an increase in the provision for income taxes primarily driven by an increase in income before income taxes.
segment information the company's operations consist of four worldwide reportable segments: engine products, fastening systems, engineered structures and forged wheels. segment performance under howmet's management reporting system is evaluated based on a number of factors; however, the primary measure of performance is segment adjusted ebitda. prior to the first quarter of 2022, the company used segment operating profit as its primary measure of performance. however, the company's ceo believes that segment adjusted ebitda is a better representation of its business because it provides additional information with respect to the company's operating performance and the company's ability to meet its financial obligations. howmet's definition of segment adjusted ebitda (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) is net margin plus an add-back for depreciation and amortization. net margin is equivalent to sales minus the following items: cost of goods sold; selling, general administrative, and other expenses; research and development expenses; and provision for depreciation and amortization. special items, including restructuring and other charges, are excluded from net margin and segment adjusted ebitda. segment adjusted ebitda may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.
differences between the total segment and consolidated totals are in corporate (see note c to the consolidated financial statements in part ii, item 8 (financial statements and supplementary data) of this form 10-k).
the company has aligned its operations consistent with how the ceo assesses operating performance and allocates capital.

the use of cash in 2023 was primarily related to the repayments on the aggregate outstanding principal amount of long-term debt of approximately $876, the repurchase of common stock of $250, taxes paid for net share settlement of equity awards of $77, and dividends paid to shareholders of $73. these items were partially offset by proceeds from term loan facilities of $400 and the exercise of employee stock options of $11. on an annual basis, the 2023 debt reduction and refinancing activities will decrease interest expense, net by approximately $29.
the use of cash in 2022 was primarily related to the repurchase of common stock of $400, the repayments on the aggregate outstanding principal amount of long-term debt of approximately $69, and dividends paid to shareholders of $44. these items were partially offset by proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options of $16.
the use of cash in 2021 was primarily related to the repayments on the aggregate outstanding principal amount of long-term debt of approximately $1,537, repurchase of common stock of $430, premiums paid on the redemption of debt of $138, dividends paid to shareholders of $19, and debt issuance costs of $11. these items were partially offset by long-term debt issuance of $700 and proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options of $22.
for further details regarding the company's debt reduction and refinancing activities and stock repurchases, see note q and note i, respectively, to the consolidated financial statements in part ii, item 8 (financial statements and supplementary data) of this form 10-k.
the company maintains a credit facility (the "credit facility") pursuant to its five-year revolving credit agreement (the "credit agreement") with a syndicate of lenders and issuers named therein (see note q to the consolidated financial statements in part ii, item 8 (financial statements and supplementary data) of this form 10-k for reference). there were no amounts outstanding under the credit agreement as of december 31, 2023 or december 31, 2022, and no amounts were borrowed during 2023 or 2022 under the credit agreement.
the company has an effective shelf registration statement on form s-3, filed with the sec, which allows for offerings of debt securities from time to time. the company may opportunistically issue new debt securities in accordance with securities laws or utilize commercial paper in order to, but not limited to, refinance existing indebtedness. the company continues to evaluate whether, when and to what extent it may access capital markets, including any plans to refinance the 5.125% notes due october 2024 and the 6.875% notes due may 2025. our ability to refinance our indebtedness or enter into alternative financings in adequate amounts on commercially reasonable terms, or terms acceptable to us, may be affected by circumstances and economic events outside of our control. in the event that a refinancing does not occur before the maturity dates of the company's 5.125% notes and the 6.875% notes, respectively, the company believes that its projected cash on hand and availability under the credit facility will enable the company to repay, as applicable, the 5.125% notes and/or the 6.875% notes.
in the future, the company may, from time to time, redeem portions of its debt securities or repurchase portions of its debt or equity securities in either the open market or through privately negotiated transactions, in accordance with applicable sec and other legal requirements. the timing, prices, and sizes of purchases depend upon prevailing trading prices, general economic and market conditions, and other factors, including applicable securities laws. such purchases may be completed by means of trading plans established from time to time in accordance with rule 10b5-1 under the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended, block trades, private transactions, open market repurchases, tender offers, and/or accelerated share repurchase agreements or other derivative transactions.
the company's costs of borrowing and ability to access the capital markets are affected not only by market conditions but also by the short-term and long-term debt ratings assigned to the company by the major credit rating agencies. the company believes that its cash on hand, cash provided from operations and availability of the credit facility and its accounts receivables securitization program will continue to be sufficient to fund our operating and capital allocation activities, including repayments of indebtedness.
the company's credit ratings from the three major credit rating agencies are as follows:
moody's investors service ("moody's")        ba1                  positive       september 18, 2023
fitch investors service ("fitch")            bbb                  stable         august 23, 2023
on december 15, 2023, s&p upgraded howmet's long-term debt rating to bbb- and updated the current outlook from positive to stable, citing strong demand in the commercial aerospace market and the company's improved financial leverage.
on september 18, 2023, moody's affirmed howmet's long-term debt rating at ba1 and upgraded the current outlook from stable to positive, citing the company's revenue and strong market position.
on august 23, 2023, fitch upgraded howmet's long-term debt rating to bbb, citing the company's improved financial leverage, and affirmed the current outlook at stable.
investing activities cash used for investing activities was $215 and $135 in 2023 and 2022, respectively, compared with cash provided from investing activities of $107 in 2021.
the use of cash in 2023 was capital expenditures of $219 primarily related to various automation projects, information technology upgrades, and sustaining and return seeking capital projects across all segments, partially offset by proceeds from the sale of assets and investments of $4.
the use of cash in 2022 was capital expenditures of $193 primarily related to various automation projects, information technology upgrades, and sustaining capital projects across all segments, partially offset by proceeds from the sale of assets of $58, which was primarily due to the sale of the corporate center and a manufacturing facility in engine products. in the second quarter of 2022, the company sold the corporate headquarters in pittsburgh, pa. the proceeds from the sale of the corporate headquarters were $44, excluding $3 of transaction costs, and a carrying value of $41. the company entered into a 12-year lease with the purchaser for a portion of the property. additionally, in the fourth quarter of 2022, the company sold the property of a manufacturing facility in the engine products segment. the proceeds from the sale of this property were $15 and a carrying value of $7.
the source of cash in 2021 was primarily cash receipts from sold receivables of $267 and proceeds from the sale of a small manufacturing plant in france of $8 and the sale of assets at a small u.s. manufacturing facility in fastening systems of $23, partially offset by capital expenditures of $199 primarily related to capacity expansion investments in hungary and mexico in forged wheels and various automation projections.
contractual obligations and off-balance sheet arrangements contractual obligations howmet is required to make future payments under various contracts, including long-term purchase obligations, financing arrangements, and lease agreements. howmet also has commitments to fund its pension plans, provide payments for other postretirement benefit plans, and fund capital projects.
in order to better understand howmet's outstanding contractual obligations, the table below represents a summary of these commitments as of december 31, 2023 (these contractual obligations are grouped in the same manner as they are classified in the statement of consolidated cash flows in order to provide a better understanding of the nature of the obligations and to provide a basis for comparison to historical information):
total                  2024                  2025-2026                  2027-2028                 thereafter operating activities:

obligations for operating activities raw material purchase obligations consist mostly of aluminum, titanium, cobalt, nickel, and various other metals with expiration dates ranging from less than one year to five years. many of these purchase obligations contain variable pricing components, and, as a result, actual cash payments may differ from the estimates provided in the preceding table. the company generally passes through metal costs in customer contracts with limited exceptions. as a result, the company expects higher metal costs to contribute to increased sales in 2024. in connection with the arconic inc. separation transaction, the company entered into several agreements with arconic corporation that govern the relationship between the company and arconic corporation following the separation, including raw material supply agreements.
purchase and other payment obligations include the remaining settlement in connection with the lbie legal proceeding (see note u to the consolidated financial statements in part ii, item 8) (financial statements and supplementary data), public utility purchase obligations, and future payments of tax-related interest and penalties.
deferred revenue was $64 as of december 31, 2023. deferred revenue arrangements require howmet to deliver product to certain customers over a specified contract period, which is expected to be within one year. while these obligations are not expected to result in cash payments and are not included in the table above, they represent contractual obligations for which the company would be obligated if the specified product deliveries could not be made.
interest related to total debt is based on fixed interest rates in effect as of december 31, 2023 and is calculated on debt with maturities that extend to 2042.
estimated minimum required pension funding and other postretirement benefit payments are based on actuarial estimates using current assumptions for discount rates, long-term rate of return on plan assets, and health care cost trend rates, among others. it is howmet's policy to fund amounts for pension plans sufficient to meet the minimum requirements set forth in the benefits laws and tax laws of the applicable country. periodically, howmet contributes additional amounts as deemed appropriate.
howmet has determined that it is not practicable to present pension funding and other postretirement benefit payments beyond 2029 and 2033, respectively.
layoff and other restructuring payments to be paid within one year primarily relate to severance costs.
uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken on an income tax return may result in additional payments to tax authorities. the amounts in the preceding table include interest and penalties accrued related to such positions as of december 31, 2023. amounts for uncertain tax positions in which the timing of future potential payments are not reasonably estimable are included in the "thereafter" column. if a tax authority agrees with the tax position taken or expected to be taken or the applicable statute of limitations expires, then additional payments will not be necessary. tax assessments received may also result in payments to be made in order to preserve our right to appeal any tax positions challenged by tax authorities for which we have concluded that we are more likely than not to prevail. see note u to the consolidated financial statements in part ii, item 8 (financial statements and supplementary data) of this form 10-k for further discussion on tax payments made.
contingencies such as ongoing legal proceedings and environmental matters may also result in additional cash payments. the timing of these payments, if necessary, depends on several factors, including the timing of litigation and settlements of liability claims. accordingly, amounts have not been included in the preceding table. amounts for settled legal proceedings and other such payables are included within purchase and other payment obligations in the preceding table. see note u to the consolidated financial statements in part ii, item 8 (financial statements and supplementary data) of this form 10-k for further discussion.
obligations for financing activities howmet has historically paid quarterly dividends on its preferred and common stock. the company paid an aggregate of $73 in common stock and preferred stock dividends to shareholders during 2023. because all dividends are subject to approval by howmet's board of directors, amounts are not included in the preceding table unless such authorization has occurred. as of december 31, 2023, there were 409,914,461 shares of outstanding common stock and 546,024 shares of outstanding class a preferred stock. in 2023, the preferred stock dividend was $3.75 per share. a dividend of $0.17 per share on the company's common stock was paid in 2023 ($0.04 per share in each of the first, second, and third quarters of 2023 and $0.05 in the fourth quarter of 2023). fully diluted shares outstanding as of december 31, 2023 were 412,897,456.
the board authorized a share repurchase program of up to $1,500 of the company's outstanding common stock. after giving effect to the share repurchases made through the fourth quarter of 2023, approximately $697 board authorization remained available as of january 1, 2024. there is no stated expiration for the share repurchase program. accordingly, amounts have not been included in the preceding table. see "liquidity and capital resources" for additional information.
obligations for investing activities capital projects in the preceding table only include amounts approved by management as of december 31, 2023. funding levels may vary in future years based on the anticipated construction schedules of the projects. it is expected that significant expansion projects will be funded through various sources, including cash provided from operations. total capital expenditures are anticipated to be approximately 4% of sales in 2024 and include additional capital expenditures related to the engine products capacity and forged wheels expansions.
off-balance sheet arrangements as of december 31, 2023, howmet had outstanding bank guarantees related to tax matters, outstanding debt, workers' compensation, environmental obligations, and customs duties, among others. the total amount committed under these guarantees, which expire at various dates between 2024 and 2040, was $24 as of december 31, 2023.
pursuant to the separation and distribution agreement, dated as of october 31, 2016, between howmet and alcoa corporation, howmet was required to provide certain guarantees for alcoa corporation, which had a fair value of $6 as of both december 31, 2023 and 2022, and were included in other noncurrent liabilities and deferred credits in the consolidated balance sheet. the remaining guarantee, for which the company and arconic corporation are secondarily liable in the event of a payment default by alcoa corporation, relates to a long-term energy supply agreement that expires in 2047 at an alcoa corporation facility. the company currently views the risk of an alcoa corporation payment default on its obligations under the contract to be remote. the company and arconic corporation are required to provide a guarantee up to an estimated present value amount of approximately $1,131 and $1,040 as of december 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, in the event of an alcoa corporation default. in december 2021, december 2022, and december 2023, a surety bond with a limit of $80 relating to this guarantee was obtained by alcoa corporation to protect howmet's obligation. this surety bond will be renewed on an annual basis by alcoa corporation.
howmet has outstanding letters of credit primarily related to workers' compensation, environmental obligations, and insurance obligations, among others. the total amount committed under these letters of credit, which automatically renew or expire at various dates, mostly in 2024, was $114 as of december 31, 2023.
pursuant to the separation and distribution agreements between the company and arconic corporation and between the company and alcoa corporation, the company is required to retain letters of credit of $52 (which are included in the $114 in the above paragraph) that had previously been provided related to the company, arconic corporation, and alcoa corporation workers' compensation claims that occurred prior to the respective separation transactions of april 1, 2020 and november 1, 2016. arconic corporation and alcoa corporation workers' compensation and letters of credit fees paid by the company are proportionally billed to, and are reimbursed by, arconic corporation and alcoa corporation, respectively. also, the company was required to provide letters of credit for certain arconic corporation environmental obligations and, as a result, the company has $17 of outstanding letters of credit relating to such liabilities (which are also included in the $114 in the above paragraph). arconic corporation has issued surety bonds to cover these environmental obligations. arconic corporation is being billed for these letter of credit fees paid by the company and will reimburse the company for any payments made under these letters of credit.
howmet has outstanding surety bonds primarily related to tax matters, contract performance, workers' compensation, environmental-related matters, energy contracts, and customs duties. the total amount committed under these annual surety bonds, which automatically renew or expire at various dates, primarily in 2024 and 2025, was $43 as of december 31, 2023.
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make certain judgments, estimates, and assumptions regarding uncertainties that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and disclosed in the accompanying notes. these estimates are based on historical experience and, in some cases, assumptions based on current and future market experience, including considerations relating to changes in the aerospace industry. areas that require significant judgments, estimates, and assumptions include the testing of goodwill, properties, plants, and equipment, and other intangible assets for impairment; estimating fair value of businesses acquired or divested; pension plans and other postretirement benefits obligations; stock-based compensation; income taxes; and litigation and contingent liabilities.
management uses historical experience and all available information to make these judgments, estimates, and assumptions, and actual results may differ from those used to prepare the company's consolidated financial statements at any given time. despite these inherent limitations, management believes that management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes provide a meaningful and fair perspective of the company.
a summary of the company's significant accounting policies is included in note a to the consolidated financial statements of this form 10-k. management believes that the application of these policies on a consistent basis enables the company to provide the users of the consolidated financial statements with useful and reliable information about the company's operating results and financial condition.
goodwill. howmet reviews goodwill for impairment annually (in the fourth quarter) or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist or if a decision is made to sell or realign a business. the company has the option to assess impairment through qualitative assessment, which includes factors such as general economic conditions, negative developments in equity and credit markets, adverse changes in the markets in which an entity operates, increases in input costs that have a negative effect on earnings and cash flows, or a trend of negative or declining cash flows over multiple periods, among others. howmet can also assess goodwill impairment through a quantitative analysis, using a discounted cash flow ("dcf") model to estimate a reporting unit's fair value. assumptions and estimates utilized in the dcf model include weighted average cost of capital ("wacc") rates, revenue, future profitability, working capital, cash flows and a number of other items. for more information on these matters, see note a to the consolidated financial statements of this form 10-k.
properties, plants, and equipment and other intangible assets. properties, plants, and equipment and other intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets (asset group) may not be recoverable. recoverability of assets is determined by comparing the estimated undiscounted net cash flows of the operations related to the assets (asset group) to their carrying amount. an impairment loss would be recognized when the carrying amount of the assets (asset group) exceeds the estimated undiscounted net cash flows. the amount of the impairment loss to be recorded is measured as the excess of the carrying value of the assets (asset group) over their fair value, with fair value determined using the best information available, which generally is a dcf model.
the determination of what constitutes an asset group, the associated estimated undiscounted net cash flows, and the estimated useful lives of the assets also require significant judgments.
discontinued operations and assets held for sale. the fair values of all businesses to be divested are estimated using accepted valuation techniques such as a dcf model, valuations performed by third parties, earnings multiples, or indicative bids, when available. a number of significant estimates and assumptions are involved in the application of these techniques, including the forecasting of markets and market share, sales volumes and prices, costs and expenses, and multiple other factors. management considers historical experience and all available information at the time the estimates are made; however, the fair value that is ultimately realized upon the divestiture of a business may differ from the estimated fair value reflected in the consolidated financial statements.
pension and other postretirement benefits. liabilities and expenses for pension and other postretirement benefits are determined using actuarial methodologies and incorporate significant assumptions, including the interest rate used to discount the future estimated liability, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, and several assumptions relating to the employee workforce (health care cost trend rates, retirement age, and mortality). the pension and other postretirement benefits obligation was $1,695 and $1,719, with a funded status of $(770) and $(749) as of december 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. the total benefit obligation reduction of $24 was primarily driven by benefit payments and plan settlements. the decline in the funded status of $21 was primarily driven by service and interest costs and changes in discount rates, partially offset by asset returns and contributions. excluding settlements and curtailments, net periodic benefit cost of pension and other postretirement benefits is expected to be approximately $46 in 2024 compared to $33 and $22 in 2023 and 2022, respectively. these costs increased by $11, or 50%, in 2023 compared to 2022 as a result of changes in discount rates and asset returns.
employer contributions for pension benefits were $36 and $43 for the years ended december 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. benefits paid for other postretirement benefits were $14 and $13 for the years ended december 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. total pension contributions and other postretirement benefits paid decreased by $6, or 11%, in 2023 compared to 2022 primarily driven by improved asset returns year over year. cash pension contributions in 2024 are expected to be approximately $52. howmet's funded status under the employee retirement income security act was approximately 70% as of january 1, 2023.
the interest rate used to discount future estimated liabilities for the u.s. is determined using a company-specific yield curve model (above-median) developed with the assistance of an external actuary, while both the u.k. and canada utilize models developed by the respective actuary. the cash flows of the plans' projected benefit obligations are discounted using a single equivalent rate derived from yields on high quality corporate bonds, which represent a broad diversification of issuers in various sectors, including finance and banking, industrials, transportation, and utilities, among others. the yield curve models parallel the plans' projected cash flows, which have a global average duration of 10 years. the underlying cash flows of the bonds included in the models exceed the cash flows needed to satisfy the company's plans' obligations multiple times. in 2023, 2022, and 2021, the discount rate used to determine benefit obligations for pension and other postretirement benefit plans was 5.10%, 5.40%, and 2.70%, respectively. the impact on the liabilities of a change in the discount rate of 1/4 of 1% would be approximately $36 and either a charge or credit of less than $1 to earnings in the following year.
the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is generally applied to a five-year market-related value of plan assets. the process used by management to develop this assumption is one that relies on a combination of historical asset return information and forward-looking returns by asset class. as it relates to historical asset return information, management focuses on various historical moving averages when developing this assumption. while consideration is given to recent performance and historical returns, the assumption represents a long-term, prospective return. management also incorporates expected future returns on current and planned asset allocations using information from various external investment managers and consultants, as well as management's own judgment.
management used 6.70% for both 2023 and 2022 and 6.20% for 2021 as its weighted-average global expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, which was based on the prevailing and planned strategic asset allocations, as well as estimates of future returns by asset class for each plan. these rates were within the respective range of the 20-year moving average of actual performance and the expected future return developed by asset class for each plan. for 2024, management anticipates that the expected long-term rate of return for global plan assets will remain at approximately 7%. a change in the assumption for the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets of 1/4 of 1% would impact earnings by approximately $3 for 2024.
stock-based compensation. howmet recognizes compensation expense for employee equity grants using the non-substantive vesting period approach, in which the expense is recognized ratably over the requisite service period based on the grant date fair value. forfeitures are accounted for as they occur. for restricted stock unit awards, the fair value is equivalent to the closing market price of howmet's common stock on the date of grant. the fair value of performance awards containing a market condition is valued using a monte carlo valuation model. determining the fair value at the grant date requires judgment, including estimates for the average risk-free interest rate, dividend yield, volatility, and exercise behavior. these assumptions may differ significantly between grant dates because of changes in the actual results of these inputs that occur over time.
income taxes. the provision (benefit) for income taxes is determined using the asset and liability approach of accounting for income taxes. under this approach, the provision (benefit) for income taxes represents income taxes paid or payable (or received or receivable) based on current year pre-tax income plus the change in deferred taxes during the year. deferred taxes represent the future tax consequences expected to occur when the reported amounts of assets and liabilities are recovered or paid, and result from differences between the financial and tax bases of howmet's assets and liabilities and are adjusted for changes in tax rates and tax laws when enacted.
valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. in evaluating the need for a valuation allowance, management considers all potential sources of taxable income, including income available in carry-back periods, future reversals of taxable temporary differences, projections of taxable income, and income from tax planning strategies, as well as all available positive and negative evidence. positive evidence includes factors such as a history of profitable operations, projections of future profitability within the carryforward period, including from tax planning strategies, and howmet's experience with similar operations. existing favorable contracts and the ability to sell products into established markets are additional positive evidence. negative evidence includes items such as cumulative losses, projections of future losses, or carryforward periods that are not long enough to allow for the utilization of a deferred tax asset based on existing projections of income. deferred tax assets for which no valuation allowance is recorded may not be realized upon changes in facts and circumstances, resulting in a future charge to establish a valuation allowance. existing valuation allowances are re-examined under the same standards of positive and negative evidence. if it is determined that it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will be realized, the appropriate amount of the valuation allowance, if any, is released. deferred tax assets and liabilities are also remeasured to reflect changes in underlying tax rates due to law changes and the granting and lapse of tax holidays.
it is howmet's policy to apply a tax law ordering approach when considering the need for a valuation allowance on net operating losses expected to offset gilti inclusions. under this approach, reductions in cash tax savings are not considered as part of the valuation allowance assessment. instead, future gilti inclusions are considered a source of taxable income that support the realizability of deferred tax assets.
it is howmet's policy to treat taxes due from future inclusions in u.s. taxable income related to gilti as a current period expense when incurred.
tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return are recorded when such benefits meet a more likely than not threshold. otherwise, these tax benefits are recorded when a tax position has been effectively settled, which means that the statute of limitations has expired or the appropriate taxing authority has completed their examination even though the statute of limitations remains open. interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions are recognized as part of the provision for income taxes and are accrued beginning in the period that such interest and penalties would be applicable under relevant tax law until such time that the related tax benefits are recognized.
litigation and contingent liabilities. from time to time, we are involved in various lawsuits, claims, investigations, and proceedings. these matters may include speculative claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts of damages. management determines the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome based on many factors, such as the nature of the matter, available defenses and case strategy, progress of the matter, views and opinions of legal counsel and other advisors, applicability and success of appeals processes, and the outcome of similar historical matters, among others. if an unfavorable outcome is deemed probable and the amount of the potential loss can be estimated, the most reasonable loss estimate is recorded. if an unfavorable outcome of a matter is deemed probable but the loss is not reasonably estimable, or if an unfavorable outcome is deemed reasonably possible, then the matter is disclosed but no liability is recorded. legal matters are reviewed on a continuous basis to determine if there has been a change in management's judgment regarding the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome or the estimate of a potential loss. for more information on these matters, see note u to the consolidated financial statements in part ii, item 8 (financial statements and supplementary data) of this form 10-k.
see the recently adopted and recently issued accounting guidance section of note b to the consolidated financial statements in part ii, item 8 (financial statements and supplementary data) of this form 10-k.

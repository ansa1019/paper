item 1a: risk factors you should carefully consider the risks described below in addition to our other filings with the sec and the other information set forth in this form 10-k, including the "management's discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations" section in part ii. item 7 and our consolidated financial statements in part ii. item 8. if any of the risks and uncertainties described in the cautionary factors described below actually occur or continue to occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations, reputation and the trading price of our common stock could be materially and adversely affected. these risks may be amplified by the effects of macroeconomic events or developments. moreover, the risks below are not the only risks we face and additional risks not currently known to us or that we presently deem immaterial may emerge or become material at any time and may negatively impact our business, financial condition, results of operations, reputation or the trading price of our common stock.
risks related to laws and regulations we are subject to complex and changing laws and regulations in various jurisdictions regarding privacy, data protection, information security, and cybersecurity which exposes us to increased costs and potential liabilities in the event of any actual or perceived failure to comply with such legal and compliance obligations and could adversely affect our business.
the eu adopted the general data protection regulation ("gdpr") which took effect on may 25, 2018, harmonizing data protection laws across the eu. the gdpr strengthens individual privacy rights and enhances data protection obligations for processors and controllers of personal data. this includes expanded disclosures about how personal information is to be used, limitations on retention of information and mandatory data breach notification requirements. noncompliance with the gdpr can trigger significant fines.
u.s. federal, state and other foreign governments and agencies have adopted or are considering adopting laws and regulations regarding the collection, storage, use, processing and disclosure of personal data. several state governments within the u.s. have recently enacted their own versions of "gdpr-like" privacy legislation, which has created, and we expect will continue to, create additional compliance challenges, risk, and administrative burden. comprehensive u.s. federal privacy legislation is also being discussed seriously by lawmakers, and the federal trade commission has commenced a privacy rulemaking that may attempt to implement nationwide rules. these proposals, as well as other standalone federal bills, could restrict the ability of law enforcement to purchase data from private companies. it is possible that a one-size fits all compliance program may be difficult to achieve and manage globally, and that we will be forced to comply with a patchwork of inconsistent privacy regulations.
also, several other countries in which we operate, including australia and brazil, have established legal requirements for cross-border data transfers. there is continued uncertainty concerning rules related to transfers of eu and united kingdom ("uk") personal data outside of their respective jurisdictions. there is also an increasing trend towards data localization policies. cloud-based solutions may be subject to further regulation with respect to data localization requirements and restrictions on the international transfer of data. if countries implement more restrictive regulations for cross-border personal data transfers (or customers do not permit personal data to leave the country of origin), it could affect the manner in which we provide our services or the geographical location or segregation of our relevant systems and operations, which could adversely impact our business.
in addition, various jurisdictions in which we operate have adopted or are expected to promulgate cybersecurity regulations that would apply directly to our products and services. for example, in the eu, we are subject to, and expect to continue to be subject to, cybersecurity regulations for certain services we provide. these regulations expose us to increased costs to address compliance obligations and potential liability in the event of any failure to comply with such regulations, which could result in fines and penalties, reputational harm, and adversely affect our business. because the interpretation and application of privacy, data protection, information security and cybersecurity laws are complex and still uncertain; it is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our existing practices or the features of our products, software and services. any failure or perceived failure by us, our business partners, or third-party service providers to comply with such laws and regulations, or the privacy commitments in contracts, could result in proceedings against us by governmental entities or others and significant fines, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results and harm our reputation.
existing or future legislation and regulations pertaining to ai, ai-enabled products and the use of biometrics (e.g., facial recognition) or other video analytics that apply to us or to our customers may make it more challenging, costly, or in some cases prohibit certain products or services from being offered or modified and subject us to regulatory and litigation risks and potential liabilities, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations.
current or future legislation and governmental regulations pertaining to ai, ai-enabled products and the use of biometrics or other video analytics may affect how our business is conducted or expose us to unfavorable developments resulting from changes in the regulatory landscape. for example, president biden's recent executive order on safe, secure, and trustworthy artificial intelligence has potentially broad implications on the development and use of ai across agencies within the united states, and could also result in extensive compliance requirements for companies like ours that sell solutions with ai applications. as another example, the ai act in the eu, which received high-level political agreement in december 2023, and is anticipated to be passed into law by mid-2024, is expected to place severe restrictions on the use of ai for real-time "biometric identification" by law enforcement, and implement significant compliance requirements on the development and use of ai for biometric identification of any kind. if adopted, it is also expected to place compliance requirements on a variety of other ai uses by law enforcement, as well as on the companies that develop those products, including us. other such laws are expected to pass around the globe in the coming months and years.
with respect to biometrics and other analytics, laws such as the biometric information privacy act in illinois have restricted the collection, use and storage of biometric information and provide a private right of action of persons who are aggrieved by violations of the act. additionally, laws such as the california automatic license plate recognition ("alpr") statute regulate the use of alprs and provide a private right of action to persons who have suffered actual damages from violation of the statute. the federal trade commission has increasingly pursued enforcement actions against companies for the misuse of biometric information and the use of facial recognition technology without implementing appropriate safeguards. such legislation, regulations, and enforcement actions have exposed us to, and we expect that they will continue to expose us to, regulatory and litigation risks.
legislation and governmental regulations related to ai and the use of biometrics and other video analytics may also influence our current and prospective customers' activities, as well as their expectations and needs in relation to our products and services. compliance with these laws and regulations may be onerous and expensive, and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, further increasing the cost of compliance and the risk of liability. it is also not clear how existing and future laws and regulations governing issues such as ai, ai-enabled products, biometrics and other video analytics apply or will be enforced with respect to the products and services we sell.
any such increase in costs or increased risk of liability as a result of changes in these laws and regulations or in their interpretation could individually, or in the aggregate, make our products and services that use ai technologies, biometrics or other video analytics less attractive to our customers, cause us to change or limit our business practices or affect our financial condition and operating results.
government regulation of radio frequencies may limit the growth of private and public safety narrowband and broadband systems or reduce barriers to entry for new competitors.
radio spectrum is required to provide wireless voice, data, and video communications services. the allocation of frequencies is regulated in the u.s. and other countries and limited spectrum is allocated to wireless services, including commercial and public safety users. the global demand for wireless communications has grown exponentially, and spurred competition for access among various networks and users. in response, regulators are reassessing the allocations of spectrum among users, including public safety users, and considering whether to change the allocation of certain spectrum bands from narrowband to broadband use, or to require sharing of spectrum bands. our results could be negatively affected by the rules and regulations adopted by regulators. our products operate both on licensed and unlicensed spectrum. the loss of available radio spectrum may result in the loss of business opportunities. regulatory changes in current spectrum bands (e.g., the sharing of previously dedicated or other spectrum) may require modifications to some of our products so they can continue to be manufactured and marketed.
a portion of our business is dependent upon u.s. government contracts and grants, which are highly regulated and subject to disclosure obligations and oversight audits by u.s. government representatives and subject to cancellations. any such disclosure events, audits or noncompliance with such regulations and laws could result in adverse findings and negatively impact our business.
our business with or funded by the u.s. government is subject to specific laws and regulations with numerous and unique compliance requirements relating to formation, administration and performance of u.s. federal or federally funded contracts. these requirements, which may increase or change over time, may increase our performance and compliance costs thereby reducing our margins, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition. violations or other failures to comply with these laws, regulations or other compliance requirements could lead to terminations for default, suspension or debarment from u.s. government contracting or subcontracting for a period of time or other adverse actions. such laws, regulations or other compliance requirements include those related to procurement integrity, export control, u.s. government security and information security regulations, supply chain and sourcing requirements and restrictions, employment practices, protection of criminal justice data, protection of the environment, accuracy of records, proper recording of costs, foreign corruption, trade agreements act, buy america act, other domestic content requirements, and the false claims act.
generally, in the u.s., government contracts and grants are subject to certain voluntary or mandatory disclosure obligations and oversight audits by government representatives. such disclosures or audits could result in adjustments to our contracts. for contracts covered by the cost accounting standards, any costs found to be improperly allocated to a specific contract may not be allowed, and such costs already reimbursed may have to be refunded. future disclosures, audits and adjustments, if required, may materially reduce our revenues or profits upon completion and final negotiation of such disclosure events or audits. negative disclosure or audit findings could also result in investigations, termination of a contract or grant, forfeiture of profits or reimbursements, suspension of payments, fines and suspension or prohibition from doing business with the u.s. government. all contracts with the u.s. government can be terminated for convenience by the government at any time.
certain of our offerings include services that are subject to telecommunications regulations in various jurisdictions, which expose us to increased costs to address compliance obligations and potential liability in the event of any failure to comply with such regulations, which could result in fines and penalties, reputational harm and adversely affect our business.
we are a provider of certain services that include telecommunications in the u.s., including selective routing services for 911 calls. as such, we are subject to certain federal communications commission fcc and possible state regulations relating to telecommunications, including some certification or licensing, service reliability, and regulatory fee requirements. if we do not comply with these regulations, we could be subject to enforcement actions, fines, and possibly loss of certifications or licenses to operate or offer certain of our services that are regulated telecommunications. any enforcement action, which may be a public process, could also damage our reputation and erode customer trust.
additionally, we are subject to regulations in certain foreign countries where we offer services that include telecommunications or other types of communications services. for example, we are registered to provide wave ptx push-to-talk offerings, with and without telecommunications connectivity, in certain countries internationally. local laws and regulations, and the interpretation of such laws and regulations, can differ significantly among the jurisdictions in which we provide these services. in some countries, certain services that we offer are not considered to be regulated communications services, while in other countries they are subject to regulations, including registration with the local telecommunications governing authority, which increases the level of scrutiny and potential for enforcement by regulators as well as our cost of doing business internationally. further, enforcement and interpretations of the laws and regulations in some countries can be unpredictable and subject to the informal views of government officials. failure to comply with these regulations could subject us to enforcement actions, fines and penalties, additional compliance obligations or liabilities, loss of authority to provide regulated services, and reputational harm, which could adversely affect our business.
moreover, it is possible that regulations in any of these jurisdictions may be changed, expanded or interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our existing practices. future applicable legislative, regulatory or judicial actions could increase the cost and complexity of our compliance and increase our exposure to potential liability.
increased focus on climate change has contributed to an evolving state of environmental regulation and uncertainty related to such regulation, as well as physical risks of climate change, could impact our results of operations, financial or competitive position.
increased public awareness and worldwide focus on climate change has led to legislative and regulatory efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions, and may result in more international, federal or regional requirements or industry standards to reduce or mitigate global warming. there continues to be a lack of consistent climate legislation, which creates economic and regulatory uncertainty. additionally, legislative and regulatory efforts have focused on carbon taxes in certain areas where we operate. as a result, we may become subject to new or strengthened regulations, legislation or other governmental requirements or industry standards, and we anticipate that we will see increased demand to meet voluntary criteria related to reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, the elimination of certain constituents from products and increasing energy efficiency. for example, the eu's corporate sustainability reporting directive, corporate sustainability due diligence directive and eu taxonomy initiatives will introduce additional due diligence and disclosure requirements addressing sustainability that will apply or we expect will apply, as applicable, to us in the coming years. these requirements will, and other increased regulation of climate change concerns could, subject us to additional costs and restrictions, and could require us to make certain changes to our manufacturing practices and/or product designs, which could negatively impact our business, results of operations, financial condition and competitive position.
in addition, the physical risks of climate change (such as extreme weather conditions or rising sea levels) may impact the availability and cost of materials and natural resources, sources and supply of energy, product demand and manufacturing and could increase insurance and other operating costs. this may include, potentially, costs associated with repairing damage as a result of extreme weather events or renovating or retrofitting facilities to better withstand extreme events. many of our facilities around the world, as well as our customers' and suppliers' operations, are in locations that may be impacted by the physical risks of climate change, and we face the risk of losses incurred as a result of physical damage to our facilities or those of our suppliers or customers such as loss or spoilage of inventory and business interruption caused by such events.
we are subject to a wide range of product regulatory and safety, consumer, worker safety and environmental product compliance and remediation laws that continue to expand and could impact our ability to grow our business, could subject us to unexpected costs and liabilities and could impact our financial performance.
our operations and the products we manufacture are subject to a wide range of product regulatory and safety, consumer, worker safety and environmental product compliance and remediation laws. compliance with such existing or future laws could subject us to future costs or liabilities, impact our production capabilities, constrict our ability to sell, expand or acquire facilities, restrict what products and services we can offer, and generally impact our financial performance. some of these laws are environmental and relate to the use, disposal, cleanup of, and exposure to certain substances. for example, in the u.s., laws often require parties to fund remedial studies or actions regardless of fault and oftentimes in response to action or omissions that were legal at the time they occurred. we continue to incur disposal costs and have ongoing remediation obligations, including those resulting from newly discovered environmental issues located at discontinued company facilities, as well as current and former facilities of companies that we acquire. changes to environmental laws or our discovery of additional obligations under these laws could have a negative impact on our financial performance.
laws focused on: (i) the energy efficiency of electronic products and accessories, (ii) recycling of both electronic products and packaging, (iii) reducing or eliminating certain hazardous substances in electronic products, (iv) the use and transportation of batteries, and (v) debt collection and other consumer finance matters continue to expand significantly. there are also demanding and rapidly changing laws around the globe related to issues such as radio interference, radio frequency radiation exposure, medical related functionality, use of products with video functionality, and consumer and social mandates pertaining to use of wireless or electronic equipment. these laws, and changes to these laws, could have a substantial impact on whether we can offer certain products, solutions and services, on product costs, and on what capabilities and characteristics our products or services can or must include, which could negatively impact our business, results of operations, financial condition and competitive position.
tax matters could have a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations.
we are subject to income taxes in the u.s. and numerous foreign tax jurisdictions. our provision for income taxes and cash tax liability may be negatively impacted by: (i) changes in the mix of earnings taxable in jurisdictions with different statutory tax rates, (ii) changes in tax laws and accounting principles, (iii) changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, (iv) changes in available tax credits, (v) discovery of new information during the course of tax return preparation, (vi) increases in non-deductible expenses, or (vii) repatriating cash held abroad.
since our 2022 tax year, the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 has required that we capitalize and amortize our research and experimental expenditures over five or fifteen years, as applicable. this change in law had a materially negative impact on our cash tax liability in 2023, and we expect such change to continue to impact our cash tax liability through 2026, unless the provisions are repealed or deferred by congress.
tax audits may also negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. we are subject to continued examination of our income tax returns, and tax authorities may disagree with our tax positions and assess additional tax. we regularly evaluate the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. outcomes from these continuing examinations may have a negative impact on our future financial condition and operating results.
certain tax policy efforts, including the organization for economic co-operation and development's base erosion and profit shifting project, the european commission's state aid investigations, and other initiatives could have an adverse effect on the taxation of international businesses. furthermore, many of the countries where we are subject to taxes, including the u.s., are independently evaluating their tax policy and we may see significant changes in legislation and regulations concerning taxation. certain countries have already enacted legislation which could affect international businesses, and other countries have become more aggressive in their approach to audits and enforcement of their applicable tax laws. such changes, to the extent they are brought into tax legislation, regulations, policies, or practices, could increase our effective tax rates in many of the countries where we have operations and have an adverse effect on our overall tax rate, along with increasing the complexity, burden and cost of tax compliance, all of which could impact our operating results, cash flows and financial condition.
risks related to our ability to grow our business as we expand the technologies within our products and systems integration and software and services segments, we may face increased areas of risk that we may not be able to properly assess or mitigate, as well as increased competition and additional compliance obligations, each of which could harm our market share, results of operations and financial condition or result in additional obligations or liabilities for our business.
the process of developing new video security, access control, and software products and enhancing existing products is complex, costly and uncertain, and any failure by us to anticipate customers' changing needs, emerging technological trends and development costs accurately could significantly harm our market share, results of operations and financial condition. any failure to accurately predict technological and business trends, control research and development costs or execute our innovation strategy could harm our business and financial performance. our research and development initiatives may not be successful in whole or in part, including research and development projects, that we have prioritized with respect to funding and/or personnel.
we may face increasing competition from traditional system integrators, the defense industry, commercial software companies, and commercial telecommunication carriers as services contracts become larger, more complicated, and include an expanded range of services. expansion will bring us into contact with new regulatory requirements and restrictions with which we may have to comply and which could result in additional compliance obligations or liabilities; (including potential enforcement actions, fines penalties, or reputational harm); or increase the costs of doing business, reduce margins or delay or limit the range of new solutions and services which we will be able to offer. we may be required to agree to specific performance metrics that meet the customer's requirements for network security, availability, reliability, maintenance and support and, in some cases, if these performance metrics are not met we may not be paid.
the markets for certain products of ours are characterized by changing technologies and evolving industry standards and customer preferences. for example, the software and video security industries are characterized by rapidly changing customer preferences in favor of cloud solutions and the adoption of ai capabilities. in some cases, it is unclear what specific technology will be adopted in the market or what delivery model will prevail. in addition, new technologies such as push-to-talk over lte and 5g could reduce sales of our traditional products. new technologies and new competitors continue to enter our markets at a faster pace than we have experienced in the past, resulting in increased competition from traditional and non-traditional suppliers. new products and services are expensive to develop and bring to market and additional complexities are added when this process is outsourced as we have done in certain cases or as we increase our reliance on third-party content and technology. moreover, evolving expectations from customers, including the expectations that companies offer products and services to help reduce energy consumption, improve efficiency and minimize greenhouse gas footprints, may impact our competitive position and research and development efforts. our success depends, in substantial part, on the timely and successful introduction of new products and services, upgrades and enhancements of current products to comply with emerging industry standards, customer expectations, laws and regulations, including country specific proprietary technology requirements, and to address competing technological and product developments carried out by our competitors. developing new technologies to compete in a specific market may not be financially viable, resulting in our inability to compete in that market. the research and development of new, technologically-advanced products and services is a complex and uncertain process requiring high levels of innovation and investment, as well as the accurate anticipation of technology and market trends. many of our products and services are complex and we may experience delays in completing development and introducing new products or technologies in the future.
catastrophic events may interrupt our business, or our customers' or suppliers' business, which may adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial position, cash flows and stock price.
our business operations, and the operations of our customers and suppliers, are subject to interruption by natural disasters (including climate change-related events), flooding, fire, power shortages, the widespread outbreak of infectious diseases and pandemics, terrorist acts or the outbreak or escalation of armed hostilities, and other events beyond our control. if a new pandemic or health outbreak were to occur, we could experience varied impacts similar to what we experienced related to the impacts of covid-19, including impacts to our workforce and supply chain, inflationary pressures and increased costs, schedule or production delays, market volatility and other financial impacts. these events such as covid-19 have had, and in the future could continue to have, a negative impact on our ability to manage our business and/or cause disruption of economic activity, which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial position, cash flows and stock price.
social, ethical, and competitive risks relating to the use of ai in our products and services could adversely affect our results of operations and business reputation.
we envision a future in which ai operating in our products and services will help our public safety and enterprise customers build safer communities with stronger communication platforms. as we increasingly build ai, including generative ai, into our offerings, we may enable or offer solutions that draw controversy due to their actual or perceived impact on social and ethical issues resulting from the use of new and evolving ai in such offerings. ai may not always operate as intended and datasets may be insufficient or contain illegal, biased, harmful or offensive information, which could negatively impact our results of operations, business reputation or customers' acceptance of our ai offerings. although we work to responsibly meet our customers' needs for products and services that use ai, including through ai governance programs and internal technology oversight committees, we may still suffer reputational or competitive damage as a result of any inconsistencies in the application of the technology or ethical concerns, both of which may generate negative publicity.
further, we face significant competition from other companies that are developing their own ai systems. other companies may develop ai systems that are similar or superior to our technologies or more cost-effective to develop and deploy. additionally, customer demand for ai-based analytics may continue to increase at a fast rate. therefore, the research and development cost we may incur to compete with such ai systems and meet increased customer demand for ai-based analytics may increase the cost of our offerings. if we are unable to mitigate these risks, our results of operations may be adversely affected.
we expect to continue to make strategic acquisitions of other companies or businesses and these acquisitions introduce significant risks and uncertainties, including risks related to integrating the acquired businesses and achieving benefits from the acquisitions.
in order to position ourselves to take advantage of growth opportunities or to meet other strategic needs such as product or technology gaps, we have made, and expect to continue to make, strategic acquisitions that involve significant risks and uncertainties. these risks and uncertainties include: (i) the inability to realize our business plan with respect to the acquired businesses, (ii) the difficulty or inability in integrating newly-acquired businesses and operations in an efficient and effective manner, including ensuring proper integration of acquired businesses' legal and regulatory compliance programs, information technology systems and financial reporting and internal control systems, (iii) the challenges in integrating acquired businesses to create the operating platform for public safety, (iv) the challenges in achieving strategic objectives, cost savings and other benefits from acquisitions, (v) the risk that our contractual relationships or the markets served do not evolve as anticipated and that the technologies acquired do not prove to be those needed to be successful in those markets, (vi) the potential loss of key employees of the acquired businesses, (vii) the risk of diverting the attention of senior management from our operations, (viii) the risks of entering new markets in which we have limited experience, (ix) future impairments of goodwill, (x) the potential loss of intellectual property due to actions of employees in connection with such acquisitions and (xi) the potential identified or unknown security vulnerabilities in acquired products that expose us to additional security risk.
certain acquisition candidates in the industries in which we participate may carry higher relative valuations (based on revenues, earnings, cash flow, or other relevant multiples) than we do. this is particularly evident in recurring revenue businesses, software businesses and certain services businesses. acquiring a business that has a higher relative valuation than motorola solutions may be dilutive to our earnings. in addition, we may not pursue opportunities that are highly dilutive to near-term earnings.
key employees of acquired businesses may receive substantial value in connection with a transaction in the form of cash payments for their ownership interest, particularly in the case of founders and other shareholder employees, or as a result of change-in-control agreements, acceleration of stock options and the lifting of restrictions on other equity-based compensation rights. to retain such employees and integrate the acquired business, we may offer additional retention incentives, but it may still be difficult to retain certain key employees.
risks related to information technology and intellectual property increased cybersecurity threats could lead to a security breach or other significant disruption of our it systems, those of our outsource partners, suppliers or those we manufacture, install, and in some cases operate and maintain for our customers, and could have a negative impact on our operations, sales, and operating results.
we rely extensively on our information systems to manage our business operations. we are consistently subject to attempts to compromise our information technology systems from both internal and external sources and, like all information technology systems, our systems are potentially vulnerable to damage, unauthorized access or interruption from a variety of sources, including but not limited to, cyberattack, cyber intrusion, computer viruses, security breach, denial-of-service attacks, ransomware or other malware, energy blackouts, natural disasters and severe weather conditions, terrorism, sabotage, war, insider trading, human error and computer and telecommunication failures. as a provider of mission-critical communications systems for customers in critical infrastructure sectors of the u.s. and globally, including systems that we operate and maintain for certain customers of ours or as a software-based service, we face additional risk as a potential target of sophisticated attacks aimed at compromising both our company's and our customers' sensitive information and intellectual property. this risk is heightened because these systems may contain sensitive governmental information or personally identifiable or other protected information. our vulnerability and that of our third-party vendors, to cyber and other information technology risks may also be increased by factors such as cyberattacks related to geopolitical conflicts (which may be heightened by our global presence) and the large portion of our office workforce that continues to work from home. additionally, the volume, frequency and sophistication of these threats continues to grow and the complexity and scale of the systems to be protected continues to increase. like other enterprise software companies, we also use open source software from time to time, which may be more susceptible to vulnerabilities that may not be identified with scanning tools. in an effort to protect against such attacks, we maintain insurance related to cybersecurity risks and employ a number of countermeasures and security controls, including training, audits, encryption, and utilization of commercial information security threat sharing networks. if we fail to effectively manage our cybersecurity, our business, products, and services could suffer from the resulting weaknesses in our infrastructure, systems or controls.
further, our company outsources certain business operations, including, but not limited to it, network connectivity, hr information systems, manufacturing, repair, distribution and engineering services. we are dependent, in certain instances, upon our outsourced business partners, suppliers, and customers to adequately protect our it systems and those it systems that we manage for our customers, including the hosts of our cloud infrastructure on top of which our cloud-based solutions are built, as well as the network connectivity upon which some of our services are built. some of our customers are exploring broadband solutions that use public carrier networks on which our solutions would operate. we do not have direct oversight or influence over how public carrier networks manage the security, quality, or resiliency of their networks, and because they are an attractive high value target due to their role in critical infrastructure, they expose customers to an elevated risk over our private networks. in addition, we maintain certain networked equipment at customer locations and are reliant on those customers to protect and maintain that equipment.
a cyberattack or other significant disruption involving our it systems or those of our outsource partners, suppliers or our customers could result in substantial costs to repair or replace our it systems or the loss of critical data and interruptions or delays in our ability, or that of our customers, to perform critical functions. such disruption may also result in the unauthorized release of proprietary, confidential or sensitive information of us or our customers, or the disruption of services provided to customers and essential for their mission. such unauthorized access to, or release of, information or disruption of services could: (i) allow others to unfairly compete with us, (ii) compromise safety or security, given the mission-critical nature of our customers' systems, (iii) subject us to claims for breach of contract, tort, and other civil claims without adequate indemnification from our suppliers, (iv) subject us to time-intensive notification requirements, (v) damage our reputation, and (vi) require us to provide modifications or replacements to our products and services. our potential liability related to such claims by customers or third-parties described above may not be contractually capped nor fully covered by our insurance. we could face regulatory penalties, enforcement actions, remediation obligations and/or private litigation by parties whose data is improperly disclosed or misused. any or all of the foregoing could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flow.
if we are unable to adequately protect our intellectual property, or if we, our customers and/or our suppliers are found to have infringed intellectual property rights of third parties, our competitive position and results of operations may be adversely impacted.
our intellectual property rights protect our innovations and technology, and they may also generate income under license agreements. we attempt to protect our proprietary technology with intellectual property in the form of patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secret laws, confidentiality agreements and other methods. we also generally restrict access to and distribution of our proprietary information. despite these precautions, it may be possible for a third-party to obtain and use our proprietary information or develop similar technology independently. as we expand our business, including through acquisitions, and compete with new competitors in new markets, the breadth and strength of our intellectual property portfolio in those new markets may not be as developed as in our longer-standing businesses. this may expose us to a heightened risk of litigation and other challenges from competitors in these new markets. in addition, effective patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited in certain foreign countries. unauthorized use of our intellectual property rights by third-parties and the cost of any litigation necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights could have a negative impact on our financial results and competitive position. moreover, the validity and scope of coverage of our patents cannot be fully determined prior to litigation.
additionally, because our products are comprised of complex technology, we are often involved in or impacted by assertions, including both requests for licenses and litigation, regarding third-party patents and other intellectual property rights.
the development of products operable in accordance with industry standards, such as those related to 5g or video technology, may result in third-party patent royalty demands. third-parties have asserted, and in the future may assert, intellectual property infringement claims against us and against our customers and suppliers. many of these assertions are brought by non-practicing entities whose principal business model is to secure patent licensing-based revenue from product manufacturing companies. the patent holders often make broad and sweeping claims regarding the applicability of their patents to our products and services, seeking a percentage of sales as licenses fees, seeking injunctions to pressure us into taking a license, or a combination thereof. defending claims may be expensive and divert the time and efforts of our management and employees. third-parties may also seek broad injunctive relief, which could limit our ability to sell our products in the u.s. or elsewhere with intellectual property subject to the claims. if we do not succeed in any such litigation, we could be required to expend significant resources to pay damages, develop non-infringing products or to obtain licenses to the intellectual property that is the subject of such litigation, each of which could have a negative impact on our financial results. such licenses, if available at all, may not be available to us on commercially reasonable terms. in some cases, we might be forced to stop delivering certain products if we or our customer or supplier are subject to a final injunction.
we face risks relating to intellectual property licenses and intellectual property indemnities in our customer and supplier contracts, which may fail to fully protect us and subject us to unexpected liabilities or harm our financial condition and results of operations.
we obtain some technology from suppliers through the purchase of components or licensing of software, and we attempt to negotiate favorable intellectual property indemnities with our suppliers for infringement of third-party intellectual property rights. with respect to such indemnities, we may not be successful in our negotiations, a supplier's indemnity may not fully protect us or cover all damages and losses suffered by us and our customers due to the infringing products, or a supplier may not choose to obtain a third-party license or modify or replace its products with non-infringing products which would otherwise mitigate such damages and losses. such situations may subject us to unexpected liabilities or unfavorable conditions. further, we may not be able to participate in intellectual property litigation involving a supplier and may not be able to influence any ultimate resolution or outcome that may negatively impact our sales or operations if a court enters an injunction that enjoins the supplier's products or if the international trade commission issues an exclusionary order that blocks importation of our products into the u.s. intellectual property disputes involving our suppliers have resulted in our involvement in international trade commission proceedings from time to time. these proceedings are costly and entail the risk that we will be subjected to a ban on the importation of our products into the u.s. solely as a result of our use of a supplier's components.
in addition, our customers increasingly demand that we indemnify them broadly from all damages and losses resulting from intellectual property litigation against them. these demands may stem from non-practicing entities that engage in patent enforcement and litigation, sometimes seeking royalties and litigation judgments in proportion to the value of the use of our products, rather than in proportion to the cost of our products. such demands can amount to many times the selling price of our products.
further, competitors may be able to negotiate significantly more favorable terms for intellectual property than we are able to, which puts them at a competitive advantage. moreover, with respect to our internally developed proprietary software, we may be harmed if we are forced to make publicly available, under the relevant open-source licenses, some of that proprietary software as a result of either our use of open-source software code or the use of third-party software that contains open-source code.
we no longer own certain logos and other trademarks, trade names and service marks, including motorola, moto, motorola solutions and the stylized m logo and all derivatives and formatives thereof ("motorola marks") and we license the motorola marks from motorola trademark holdings, llc ("mth"), which is currently owned by motorola mobility, a subsidiary of lenovo. our joint use of the motorola marks could result in product and market confusion and negatively impact our ability to expand business under the motorola brand. in addition, if we do not comply with the terms of the license agreement we could lose our rights to the motorola marks.
in 2010, we secured a worldwide, perpetual and royalty-free license from mth to use the motorola marks as part of our corporate name and in connection with the manufacture, sale, and marketing of our current products and services. the license of the motorola marks is important to us because of the reputation of the motorola brand for our products and services. there are risks associated with both motorola mobility and us using the motorola marks and our loss of ownership of the motorola marks. as both we and motorola mobility use the motorola marks, confusion could arise in the market, including customer confusion regarding the products offered by and the actions of the two companies. also, any negative publicity associated with either company in the future could adversely affect the public image of the other.
motorola mobility was acquired by lenovo in 2014, which resulted in lenovo having effective control over the motorola marks. our risks under the license could increase if lenovo expands its use of the motorola marks, or if our products and those of lenovo converge. in addition, because our license of the motorola marks is limited to products and services within our specified fields of use, we are not permitted to use the motorola marks in other fields of use without the approval of motorola mobility. as we continue to expand our business into any other fields of use, we either must do so with a brand other than the motorola brand, which could take considerable time and expense, or assume the risk that our expanded fields don't meet the definition of permitted fields of use under our license, which could result in loss of our rights to use the motorola marks.
we could lose our rights to use the motorola marks if we do not comply with the terms of the license agreement. such a loss could negatively affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. furthermore, mth has certain rights to license the brand to third-parties and either motorola mobility or licensed third-parties may use the brand in ways that make the brand less attractive for customers of motorola solutions, creating increased risk that motorola solutions may need to develop an alternate or additional brand. motorola mobility may require us to adopt modifications to the motorola marks, and this could negatively impact our business, including costs associated with rebranding.
neither motorola mobility nor lenovo is prohibited from selling the motorola marks. in the event of a liquidation by lenovo or the then-owner of the motorola marks, it is possible that a bankruptcy court would either (i) permit the motorola marks to be assigned to a third-party whose interests may be incompatible with ours, thereby potentially making the license arrangement difficult to administer and increasing the costs and risks of sharing the motorola marks, or (ii) refuse to uphold the license or certain of its terms, which could negatively affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
risks related to the operation of our business our future operating results depend on our ability to purchase at acceptable prices a sufficient amount of materials, parts, and components, as well as software and services, to meet the demands of our customers and any disruption to our suppliers or significant increase in the price of supplies has had, and could continue to have a negative impact on our results of operations or financial condition.
our ability to meet customers' demands depends, in part, on our ability to timely obtain an adequate delivery of quality materials, parts, and components, as well as software and services, from our suppliers. if demand for our products or services increases from our current expectations or if, as we have experienced recently, suppliers are unable to meet our demand for other reasons, including as a result of supply chain constraints, natural disasters (including events related to climate change), financial issues or other factors, we have, and could continue to experience an interruption in supply or a significant increase in the price of supply. we have experienced such shortages in the past that have negatively impacted our results of operations and may continue to experience such shortages in the future. in 2023, we reduced our inventory carrying levels as compared to 2022 in response to improved supply conditions of semiconductors, although we expect to continue to actively manage our inventory in the future, including by continuing to carry increased levels of inventory in targeted areas to support increased demand and customer requirements. we expect that any future supply chain effects could also impact our ability to meet customer demand and negatively impact our results of operations.
our suppliers have, and may continue to significantly and quickly increase their prices in response to increases in costs of raw materials that they use to manufacture their parts or components. as a result, we may not be able to increase our prices commensurately with our increased costs, which could negatively impact our results of operations or financial condition. in addition, certain supplies, including for some of our critical components, software and services solutions, are available only from a single source or limited sources and we may not be able to diversify sources in a timely manner. where certain supplies are not available from our direct suppliers, we may be required to move to an alternative source or source certain items through the open market, which involves significantly increased prices that are difficult to forecast or predict. we have been required to take these steps in certain instances in connection with the impact on the semiconductor market described above. each of these factors may impact our ability to meet customer demand and could negatively impact our results of operations or financial condition.
we enter into large, multi-year system and services contracts with municipal, state, and nationwide government and commercial customers. in some cases, we may not be the prime contractor and may be dependent on other third-parties such as commercial carriers or systems integrators. our entry into these contracts exposes us to risks, including among others: (i) technological risks, (ii) risk of defaults by third-parties on whom we are relying for products or services as part of our offering or who are the prime contractors, (iii) financial risks, including potential penalties applicable to us if performance commitments in managed services contracts are not met, the estimates inherent in projecting costs associated with such contracts, the fact that such contracts often only receive partial funding initially and may be cancellable on short notice with limited penalties, our inability to recover front-loaded capital expenditures in long-term managed services contracts, the impact of the termination of funding for a government program or the insolvency of a commercial customer, and the impact of currency fluctuations and inflation, (iv) cybersecurity risks, especially in managed services contracts with public safety and enterprise customers that process data, and (v) political or regulatory risks, especially related to the contracts with government customers, including our airwave contract in the uk, as described below.
with respect to the political or regulatory risks of such contracts, in october 2021, the cma announced that it had opened a market investigation into the mobile radio network services market. this investigation included airwave, our private mobile radio communications network that we acquired in 2016. airwave provides mission-critical voice and data communications to emergency services and other agencies in great britain. in early 2023, the cma published a final decision which stated it will impose a prospective price control on the airwave contract. we disagreed with the cma's decision and filed an appeal with the competition appeal tribunal ("cat"). in addition, on july 31, 2023, the cma adopted a remedies order which implemented the price control set out in its final decision, which was suspended until the cat dismissed our appeal on december 22, 2023. on february 13, 2024, we filed an application with the united kingdom court of appeal requesting that it hear our appeal. revenue will be recognized according to the remedies order published by the cma, unless the united kingdom court of appeal were to reverse the remedies order.
our customers and suppliers are located throughout the world. in 2023, 31% of our revenue was generated outside of north america. in addition, 47% of our employees were employed outside of north america in 2023. most of our suppliers' operations are outside the u.s.
a significant amount of manufacturing and research and development of our products, as well as administrative and sales facilities, takes place outside of the u.s. if the operations in these facilities are disrupted, our business, financial condition, results of operation, and cash flows could be negatively impacted.
because of these sizable sales and operations outside of the u.s., we have more complexity in our operations and are exposed to a unique set of global risks that could negatively impact our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows, including but not limited to: (i) currency fluctuations, including but not limited to increased pressure to agree to established currency conversion rates and cost of living adjustments as a result of foreign currency fluctuations, (ii) import/export regulations, tariffs, trade barriers and trade disputes, customs classifications and certifications, including but not limited to changes in classifications or errors or omissions related to such classifications and certifications, (iii) compliance with and changes in u.s. and non-u.s. laws or regulations related to antitrust and competition (such as the cma's findings and remedies order in connection with its market investigation into the mobile radio network services market and the eu foreign subsidies regulation), anti-corruption (such as the foreign corrupt practices act and the u.k. bribery act), trade, labor and employment, environmental, health and safety, technical standards, consumer protection, intellectual property and data privacy, (iv) tax issues, such as tax law changes, variations in tax laws from country to country and as compared to the u.s., obligations under tax incentive agreements, and difficulties in securing local country approvals for cash repatriations, (v) reduced financial flexibility given that a significant percentage of our cash and cash equivalents is currently held outside of the u.s., (vi) challenges in collecting accounts receivable, (vii) cultural and language differences, (viii) instability in economic or political conditions, including inflation, recession, the imposition of sanctions and actual or anticipated military or political conflicts and terrorism, (ix) natural disasters, (x) public health issues or outbreaks or pandemics (such as the covid-19 pandemic) and (xi) litigation in foreign court systems and foreign enforcement or administrative proceedings.
additionally, the benefits we receive under various agreements we have entered into with non-u.s. governments and agencies relate to our operations and/or sales in such foreign jurisdictions. if our operations or sales are not at levels originally anticipated, we may be at risk of having to reimburse benefits already granted, which could increase our cost of doing business in such foreign jurisdictions.
over the last several years we have utilized third-parties to develop, design and/or manufacture many of our components and some of our products, and to perform portions of certain business operations such as it, network connectivity, hr information systems, manufacturing, repair, distribution and engineering services. we expect to continue these practices in the future, which limit our control over these business operations and exposes us to additional risk as a result of the actions of our outsource partners.
we rely on third-parties to develop, design and/or manufacture many of our components and some of our products (including software), and to assist in performing certain it, network connectivity, hr information systems, manufacturing, repair, distribution and engineering services. as we outsource more of such operations we are not able to directly control these activities. we could have difficulties fulfilling our orders and our sales and profits could decline if: (i) we are not able to engage such third-parties with the capabilities or capacities required by our business, (ii) such third-parties lack our desired level of performance or service, lack sufficient quality control or fail to deliver quality components, products, services or software on time and at reasonable prices, (iii) there are significant changes in the financial or business condition of such third-parties, (iv) our third-party providers fail to comply with legal or regulatory requirements (such as the uyghur forced labor protection act), (v) we have difficulties transitioning operations to such third-parties, or (vi) such third-parties are disrupted by external events, such as cyberattacks, natural disasters, public health issues or outbreaks or pandemics, extreme weather conditions related to climate change, acts of terrorism or political conflicts.
our reliance on third-parties could, in certain instances, result in reputational damage or even disqualify us from sales opportunities with certain government customers. for example, our supply chain is complex and if our suppliers are unable to verify that components and parts provided to us are free of defined "conflict minerals" originating from the democratic republic of congo ("drc") or an adjoining country, then we may be required to publicly disclose, as we have disclosed in the past, that we are not currently able to determine if the products we manufactured are drc conflict-free, which could harm our reputation.
once a business activity is outsourced we may be contractually prohibited from or may not practically be able to bring such activity back within the company or move it to another outsource partner. the actions of our outsource partners could result in reputational damage to us and could negatively impact our business, financial conditions, results of operations, and cash flows.
we utilize the services of subcontractors to perform under many of our contracts and the inability of our subcontractors to perform in a timely and compliant manner or to adhere to our human rights policy could negatively impact our business.
we engage subcontractors, including third-party integrators, on many of our contracts and as we expand our technologies in our products and systems integration and software and services segments, our use of subcontractors has and will continue to increase. our subcontractors may further subcontract performance and may supply third-party products and software from a number of smaller companies. in addition, it is our policy to require our subcontractors and other third-parties with whom we work to operate in compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations, including our human rights policy (and, in addition, for our suppliers to comply with our supplier code of conduct).
we may have disputes with our subcontractors, including disputes regarding the quality and timeliness of work performed by the subcontractor or its subcontractors and the functionality, warranty and indemnities of products, software and services supplied by our subcontractor. we are not always successful in passing down customer requirements to our subcontractors or a customer may otherwise look to us to cover a loss or damage, and thus in some cases may be required to absorb contractual risks from our customers without corresponding back-to-back coverage from our subcontractor. our subcontractors may not be able to acquire or maintain the quality of the materials, components, subsystems and services they supply, or secure preferred warranty and indemnity coverage from their suppliers which might result in greater product returns, service problems, warranty claims and costs and regulatory compliance issues. further, one of our subcontractors or other third-parties subject to our human rights policy could fail to comply with such policies or with applicable law or may engage in unethical business practices. any of the foregoing could cause orders to be canceled, relationships to be terminated or our reputation to be damaged, which could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.
if the quality of our products does not meet our customers' expectations or regulatory or industry standards, then our sales and operating earnings, and ultimately our reputation, could be negatively impacted.
some of the products we sell may have quality issues resulting from the design or manufacture of the product, or from the software used in the product. sometimes, these issues may be caused by components we purchase from suppliers, or from finished products we purchase from other manufacturers, which we then resell to customers. often these issues are identified prior to the shipment of the products and may cause delays in shipping products to customers, or even the cancellation of orders by customers. sometimes, we discover quality issues in the products after they have been shipped to our customers, requiring us to resolve such issues in a timely manner that is the least disruptive to our customers, particularly in light of the mission-critical nature of our communications products. such pre-shipment and post-shipment quality issues can have legal, financial and reputational ramifications, including: (i) delays in the recognition of revenue, loss of revenue or future orders, (ii) customer-imposed penalties for failure to meet contractual requirements, (iii) increased costs associated with repairing or replacing products, and (iv) a negative impact on our goodwill and brand name reputation. in some cases, if the quality issue affects the product's performance, safety or regulatory compliance, then such a "defective" product may need to be "stop-shipped" or recalled. depending on the nature of the quality issue and the number of products in the field, it could cause us to incur substantial recall or corrective field action costs, in addition to the costs associated with the potential loss of future orders and the damage to our goodwill or brand reputation. in addition, we may be required, under certain customer contracts, to pay damages for failed performance that might exceed the revenue that we receive from the contracts. recalls and field actions involving regulatory non-compliance could also result in fines and additional costs. recalls and field actions could result in third-party litigation by persons or companies alleging harm or economic damage as a result of the use of the products.
in addition, privacy advocacy groups and other technology and industry groups have established or may establish various new or different self-regulatory standards that may place additional obligations on us. our customers may expect us to meet voluntary certifications or adhere to other standards established by third-parties. if we are unable to maintain these certifications or meet these standards, it could reduce demand for our products and adversely affect our business.
increasing scrutiny and evolving expectations from investors, customers, lawmakers, regulators and other stakeholders regarding environmental, social and governance ("esg")-related practices and disclosures may adversely affect our reputation, adversely impact our ability to attract and retain employees or customers, expose us to increased scrutiny from the investment community or enforcement authorities or otherwise adversely impact our business and results of operations.
there is increasing scrutiny and evolving expectations from investors, customers, lawmakers, regulators and other stakeholders on esg-related practices and disclosures, including those related to environmental stewardship, climate change, diversity, equity and inclusion, forced labor, racial justice and workplace conduct. regulators have imposed, and likely will continue to impose, esg-related rules and guidance, which may conflict with one another and impose additional costs on us or expose us to new or additional risks. moreover, certain organizations that provide information to investors have developed ratings for evaluating companies on their approach to different esg-related matters, and unfavorable ratings of us or our industries may lead to negative investor sentiment and the diversion of investment to other companies or industries. we have elected to share publicly our ongoing esg-related efforts in our proxy statement, corporate responsibility report, tcfd report, and on our corporate website. our business may face increased scrutiny related to these activities, and our failure or perceived failure to meet esg-related goals or maintain esg practices that meet evolving stakeholder expectations, could harm our reputation, adversely impact our ability to attract and retain employees or customers, expose us to increased scrutiny from the investment community or enforcement authorities or otherwise adversely affect our business and results of operations.
risks related to human capital management our success depends in part upon our ability to attract and retain senior management and key employees, including engineers and other key technical employees, in order to remain competitive.
the performance of our ceo, senior management and other key employees such as engineers and other technical employees is critical to our success. if we are unable to retain talented, highly-qualified senior management, engineers and other key employees or attract them when needed, it could negatively impact our business.
we rely on the experience of our senior management, most of whom have been with us for many years and as a result have specific knowledge relating to us and our industry that is difficult to replace and competition for management with experience in the communications industry is intense. a loss of the ceo, a member of senior management, or an engineer or other key employee particularly to a competitor, could also place us at a competitive disadvantage. in addition, we face increased demands for technical personnel in areas such as software development, which is an area of particularly high demand for skilled employees. we believe that our future success depends in large part on our continued ability to hire, assimilate, retain and leverage the skills of qualified engineers and other highly-skilled personnel needed to develop successful new products or services. in particular, we have faced, and expect to continue to face, intense competition globally for experienced software and cloud computing infrastructure engineers, as well as employees in data science and ai. the compensation and incentives we have available to attract, retain and motivate employees may not meet the expectations of current and prospective employees as the competition for talent intensifies. our efforts to attract, develop, integrate, and retain highly skilled employees with appropriate qualifications may be compounded by the increased availability of remote working arrangements, which has expanded the pool of companies that can compete for our employees and employment candidates. further, if we fail to adequately plan for the succession of our ceo, senior management and other key employees, our business could be negatively impacted.
risks related to financial performance or economic conditions as we are a global company, we face a number of risks related to current global economic and political conditions in the markets in which we operate that have and could continue to unfavorably impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
global economic and political conditions, including impacts from the inflationary cost environment, continue to be challenging for many of our government and enterprise markets, as economic growth in many countries has remained low or declined, currency fluctuations have impacted profitability, credit markets have remained tight for certain counterparties of ours and some of our customers are dependent on government grants to fund purchases of our products and services.
in addition, conflicts in the middle east and elsewhere have created many economic and political uncertainties that continue to impact worldwide markets, including impacts relating to new or increased tariffs and potential trade wars, and threats to national security vulnerabilities linked to country of origin. the length of time these adverse economic and political conditions may persist is unknown.
these global economic and political conditions have impacted and could continue to impact our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows in a number of ways, including:
•requests by certain of our government and enterprise customers that we provide vendor financing, including in response to financial challenges surrounding state and local governments, which may cause us to retain exposure to the credit quality of our customers who we finance if we are unable to sell these receivables on terms acceptable to us.
•the inability of certain of our customers to obtain financing in order to make purchases from us and/or maintain their business, which may negatively impact our financial results.
•deferment or cancellation of purchases and orders by customers may occur due to uncertainty about current and future global economic conditions, which could reduce future demand for our products and negatively impact our financial results.
•intensifying political instability in a number of markets in which we operate could have a significant impact on our ability to grow and, in some cases, operate in such locations, which could negatively impact our financial results.
we have large underfunded pension obligations, in part resulting from the fact that we retained almost all of the u.s. pension liabilities and a major portion of our non-u.s. pension liabilities following our past divestitures. the funding position of our pension plans is affected by the performance of the financial markets, particularly the equity and debt markets, and the interest rates used to calculate our pension obligations for funding and expense purposes. minimum annual pension contributions are determined by government regulations and calculated based upon our pension funding status, interest rates, and other factors. if the financial markets perform poorly, we have been and could be required to make additional large contributions. the equity and debt markets can be volatile, and therefore our estimate of future contribution requirements can change dramatically in relatively short periods of time. similarly, changes in interest rates can affect our contribution requirements. in volatile capital market environments, the uncertainty of material changes in future minimum required contributions increases.
we may not continue to have access to the capital markets for financing on acceptable terms and conditions, particularly if our credit ratings are downgraded, which could limit our ability to repay our indebtedness and could cause liquidity issues.
from time to time we access the capital markets to obtain financing. our access to the capital markets and the bank loan markets at acceptable terms and conditions are impacted by many factors, including: (i) our credit ratings, (ii) the condition of the overall capital markets, (iii) strength and credit availability in the banking markets, and (iv) the state of the global economy. in addition, we frequently access the credit markets to obtain performance bonds, bid bonds, standby letters of credit and surety bonds, as well as to hedge foreign exchange risk and sell receivables. furthermore, we may not be able to refinance our existing indebtedness (i) on commercially reasonable terms, (ii) on terms, including with respect to interest rates, as favorable as our current debt, or (iii) at all. we may not continue to have access to the capital markets or bank credit markets on terms acceptable to us and if we are unable to repay or refinance our debt, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to generate enough cash flows from operations or that we will be able to obtain enough capital to service our debt, fund our planned capital expenditures or pay future dividends.
we are rated investment grade by all three national rating agencies. any downward changes by the rating agencies to our credit rating may negatively impact the value and liquidity of both our debt and equity securities. under certain circumstances, an increase in the interest rate payable by us under our revolving credit facility, if any amounts are borrowed under such facility, could negatively affect our operating cash flows. in addition, a downgrade in our credit ratings could limit our ability to: (i) access the capital markets or bank credit markets, (ii) issue commercial paper (iii) provide performance bonds, bid bonds, standby letters of credit and surety bonds, (iv) hedge foreign exchange risk, (v) fund our foreign affiliates, (vi) sell receivables, and (vii) obtain favorable trade terms with suppliers. in addition, we may avoid taking actions that would otherwise benefit us or our stockholders, such as engaging in certain acquisitions or engaging in stock repurchases, that would negatively impact our credit rating.
we conduct business through our subsidiaries in many different countries, and fluctuations in currency exchange rates could have a significant impact on our reported consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows, which are presented in u.s. dollars. cross-border transactions, both with external parties and intercompany relationships, result in increased exposure to foreign exchange effects. accordingly, significant changes in currency exchange rates, particularly the euro, british pound, canadian dollar and australian dollar, has had in the past, and could continue to, cause fluctuations in the reported results of our businesses' operations that could negatively affect our results of operations. additionally, the strengthening of certain currencies such as the euro and u.s. dollar potentially exposes us to competitive threats from lower cost producers in other countries. our sales are translated into u.s. dollars for reporting purposes. the strengthening of the u.s. dollar has in the past, and could continue to, result in unfavorable translation effects as the results of foreign locations are translated into u.s. dollars.
item 7: management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following is a discussion and analysis of our financial position as of december 31, 2023 and 2022 and results of operations and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended december 31, 2023. this commentary should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto appearing under "item 8: financial statements and supplementary data."
executive overview our business motorola solutions is solving for safer. every day we come to work solving for safer communities, safer schools, safer hospitals, safer businesses, safer everywhere. we are a global leader in public safety and enterprise security, grounded in nearly 100 years of close customer and community collaboration. we design and advance technology for more than 100,000 public safety and enterprise customers in over 100 countries. we are driven by our commitment to help make everywhere safer for all.
we manage our business organizationally through two segments: "products and systems integration" and "software and services." within these segments, we have principal product lines that also follow our three major technologies: lmr communications, video and command center.
the company has invested across these three technologies organically and through acquisitions to evolve its lmr focus and expand its safety and security products and services.
our strategy is to generate value through our technologies that help meet the changing needs of our customers around the world in protecting people, property and places. while each technology individually strives to make users safer and more productive, we believe we can enable better outcomes for our customers when we unite these technologies to work together. our goal is to help remove silos and barriers between people and technologies, so that data unifies, information flows, operations run and collaboration improves to help strengthen safety and security everywhere. across all three technologies, we offer cloud-based and hybrid solutions, cybersecurity services, software and subscription services as well as managed and support services.
one example of this collaboration is highlighted by a school setting. when a teacher presses a panic button on a phone, this can automatically notify local law enforcement of an emergency, trigger a lockdown to secure all entries, share live video feeds with first responders and send mass notifications to key stakeholders inside and outside the school, helping schools to detect, respond and resolve safety and security threats.
the principal products within each segment, by technology, are described below:
lmr communications our lmr communications technology includes infrastructure and devices for lmr, public safety long term evolution ("lte") and enterprise-grade private lte. our technology enables voice and multimedia collaborations across two-way radio, wifi and public and private broadband networks. we are a global leader in the two-way radio category, including project 25 (p25), terrestrial trunked radio ("tetra") and digital mobile radio (dmr), as well as other pcr solutions. we also deliver lte solutions for public safety, government and commercial users, including devices operating in both low-band and mid-band frequencies, including citizens' broadband radio service (cbrs) frequencies.
we believe that public safety agencies and enterprises continue to trust lmr communications systems and devices because they are purpose-built and designed for reliability, availability, security and resiliency to withstand the most challenging conditions.
by extending our two-way radios with broadband data capabilities, we strive to provide our customers with greater functionality and multimedia access to the information and data they need in their workflows. examples include application services such as gps location to better protect lone workers, job dispatch to share detailed information and over-the-air programming to optimize device uptime. our view is that complementary data applications such as these enable government, public safety and enterprise customers to work more efficiently and safely, while maintaining their mission-critical voice communications to remain connected and working in collaboration with others.
primary sources of revenue for this technology come from selling devices and building communications networks, including infrastructure, installation and integration with our customers' technology environments. the lmr technology within the products and systems integration segment represented 82% of the net sales of the total segment in 2023.
video our video technology includes video management infrastructure, ai-powered security cameras including fixed and certain mobile video equipment as well as on-premise and cloud-based access control solutions. we deploy video security and access control solutions to thousands of government and enterprise customers around the world, including schools, transportation systems, healthcare centers, public venues, commercial real estate, utilities, prisons, factories, casinos, airports, financial institutions, government facilities, state and local law enforcement agencies and retailers. organizations such as these utilize video security and access control to verify critical events or incidents in real-time and to provide data to investigate an event or incident after it happens.
our view is that government and public safety customers in particular are increasingly turning to video security technologies, including fixed and mobile cameras, to increase visibility, accountability and safety for citizens, communities and first responders alike. additionally, we believe that government, public safety agencies and enterprises are increasingly turning to scalable, cloud-based multi-factor authentication access control to make their facilities more secure.
the video technology within the products and systems integration segment represented 18% of the net sales of the total segment in 2023.
lmr communications lmr communications services include support and managed services, which offer a broad continuum of support for our customers. support services include repair and replacement, technical support and preventative maintenance, and more advanced offerings such as system monitoring, software updates and cybersecurity services. managed services range from partial to full operational support of customer-owned or motorola solutions-owned communications networks. our customers' systems often have multi-year or multi-decade lifespans that help drive demand for software upgrades, device and infrastructure refresh opportunities, as well as additional services to monitor, manage, maintain and secure these complex networks and solutions. we strive to deliver services to our customers that help improve performance across their systems, devices and applications for greater safety and productivity.
given the mission-critical nature of our customers' operational environments, we aim to design the lmr networks they rely on for availability, security and resiliency. we have a comprehensive approach to system upgrades that addresses hardware, software and implementation services. as new system releases become available, we work with our customers to upgrade software, hardware, or both, with respect to site controllers, comparators, routers, lan switches, servers, dispatch consoles, logging equipment, network management terminals, network security devices such as firewalls and intrusion detection sensors, on-site or remotely.
the lmr technology within the software and services segment represented 64% of the net sales of the total segment in 2023.
video video software includes video network management software, decision management and digital evidence management software, certain mobile video equipment, and advanced vehicle location data analysis software, including license plate recognition. our software is designed to complement video hardware systems, proving end-to-end video security to help keep people, property and places safe.
our video network management software is embedded with ai-powered analytics to deliver operational insights to our customers by bringing attention to important events within their video footage. given the growing volume of video content, we believe that analytics are critical to deliver meaningful, action-oriented insights. our view is that these insights can help to proactively detect an important event in real time as well as reactively search video content to detect an important event that occurred in the past. for example, ai-powered analytics can highlight unusual behavior such as a person at a facility out of hours, locate a missing child at a theme park with appearance search, flag a vehicle of interest at a school through license plate recognition, send an alert through access control if doors are propped open at a hospital, or trigger parallel workflows by activating a school's customized lockdown plan while simultaneously alerting first responders with video footage inside the school.
our cloud technologies can offer organizations the ability to access, search and manage their video security and access control system from a centralized dashboard, accessible on remote devices such as smartphones and laptops. additionally, our fixed video systems can be connected to the cloud, providing our customers with the ability to securely access video across their sites from a remote or central monitoring location.
our video services include our "video-as-a-service" subscription-based offerings for law enforcement, simplifying procurement by bundling hardware and software into a single subscription. for example, body cameras and in-car video systems can be paired with either on-premises or cloud-based digital evidence management software and complementary command center products. our cloud solutions are also sold as-a-service, available as single-year to multi-year hosted services, supporting our customers with upgrades and software enhancements to help ensure system performance and technological advancement.
the video technology within the software and services segment represented 16% of the net sales of the total segment in 2023.
command center our command center portfolio consists of native cloud, hybrid and on-premises software solutions that support the complex process of the public safety workflow from "911 call to case closure." from the moment a person contacts 911, an array of individuals engage to gather information to coordinate a response and manage the post-incident resolution. these individuals include dispatchers who route calls to police, fire and emergency medical services, first responders in the field, intelligence analysts who manage real-time operations, records specialists who preserve the integrity of information and evidence, crime analysts who identify patterns and accelerate investigations, and corrections officers who oversee jail and inmate management.
additionally, to help ensure that individuals within the public safety workflow can work as efficiently, effectively and safely as possible, we believe it's important that individuals within enterprise settings and communities can communicate and collaborate directly with public safety agencies, particularly during emergencies. we remain focused on strengthening the intersection of public safety and enterprise security, offering solutions that are designed to help individuals, enterprises and public safety agencies work together and share the information in an effort to help prevent critical incidents from occurring and better inform an emergency response when an incident unfolds.
our command center software supports all of these individuals through the three phases of incident or event: detection, response and resolution. detection software includes community engagement and alert applications for tip submissions, crime mapping and evidence submission, mass notification, panic buttons that can share real-time incident details and location, 911 call management software (including multimedia and ai-powered language transcription) and next-generation core services for 911 call routing. response software includes voice and computer aided dispatch (cad) for dispatch and coordinating first response, collaboration software to share operational updates, real-time intelligence software that shows a single, real-time view of video feeds and other alerts on a map, and field response and reporting to help frontline personnel collaborate, manage incident activity and file reports from the field. resolution software includes centralized records for streamlined reporting and record-keeping, evidence management for gathering, managing and sharing multimedia evidence throughout an incident's lifecycle, and investigative tools that uncover connections across records, vehicles and images in an effort to identify crime trends.
another area of public safety evolution is the increasing adoption of next generation 911 core services ("ngcs"), a group of products and services needed to create infrastructure connectivity in order to process a 911 call using next generation ("ng") technology. the ng infrastructure is an emergency service ip network ("esinet"), which can carry voice, data and multimedia. esinet enables 911 call takers at public safety answering points to respond to text, video and data. our ngcs can be offered as a managed service and includes call routing, esinet, location services, geographic information services, cybersecurity and our continuous communications network and security operations center dedicated to public safety.
command center also includes interoperability solutions that provide connectivity across lmr and broadband networks to help ensure that communication is not limited by coverage area, network technology or device type. additionally, command center includes push-to-talk ("ptt") devices that deliver voice communications over lte and wi-fi, and advanced back-end systems that enable and manage interoperable communications, capable of scaling from small enterprises to nationwide cellular networks. for example, a two-way radio network can connect with an lte network, assisting individuals in communicating securely and more easily across technologies. these solutions can provide our public safety customers with the critical interoperability between multiple agencies' networks, facilitating a coordinated response.
finally, as the command center market continues to evolve from on-premises to hybrid and cloud "software-as-a-service" ("saas") technologies to improve their operations, reduce response times and increase officer availability, we offer both native cloud-based applications and cloud features that enhance on-premises applications. we believe this flexibility helps our customers to optimize their investments and enhance their systems with the technologies of their choice.
the command center technology within the software and services segment represented 20% of the net sales of the total segment in 2023.
•we returned approximately $1.4 billion of capital to shareholders, in the form of $804 million in share repurchases and $589 million in dividends in 2023.
•we ended 2023 with a backlog position of $14.3 billion, down $88 million compared to 2022.
28.1% from 22.1% in 2022 primarily driven by higher sales, a $147 million fixed asset impairment loss in 2022 that did not recur in 2023, related to assets constructed and used in the deployment of the emergency services network ("esn") services contract with the home office of the united kingdom (the "home office") which we have executed an agreement to exit, and a reduction in intangible amortization expenses, partially offset by the revenue reduction on airwave services in 2023 due to the implementation of the united kingdom's (the "u.k.") competition and markets authority's ("cma") remedies order and higher expenses associated with acquired businesses.
macroeconomic events during fiscal year 2023, we operated under market conditions influenced by events such as those discussed below. for a further discussion of our business and the trends and risks that we encounter in our business, please refer to "part i. item 1. business" and "part i. item 1a. risk factors" in this form 10-k.
in 2023, we experienced improved conditions with respect to availability of materials in the semiconductor market. we reduced our inventory carrying levels as compared to 2022 in response to the improved supply conditions. we continue to remain focused on improving our supplier network, engineering alternative designs and working to reduce supply shortages and effectively manage costs. in addition, we continue to actively manage our inventory by diversifying the footprint of our supply chain operations, including by finalizing a strategic agreement relating to our video manufacturing operations during the first quarter of 2024, and maintaining increased levels of inventory in targeted areas to support increased demand and customer requirements.
recent events cma update in october 2021, the cma announced that it had opened a market investigation into the mobile radio network services market. this investigation included airwave, our private mobile radio communications network that we acquired in 2016. airwave provides mission-critical voice and data communications to emergency services and other agencies in great britain.
in early 2023 the cma issued its final decision which stated it will impose a prospective price control on airwave. we strongly disagreed with the cma's final decision and we filed an appeal with the competition appeal tribunal ("cat"). on july 31, 2023, the cma adopted a remedies order which implemented the price control set out in its final decision, which was suspended until the cat dismissed our appeal on december 22, 2023. on february 13, 2024, we filed an application with the united kingdom court of appeal requesting that it hear our appeal.
based on the adoption of the remedies order, since august 1, 2023, revenue under the airwave contract has been recognized in accordance with the prospective price control. as our appeal to the cat has been dismissed, revenue will continue to be recognized according to the remedies order published by the cma, unless the united kingdom court of appeal were to reverse the remedies order. our backlog for airwave services contracted with the home office through 2026, inclusive of the five month period beginning august 1, 2023, was reduced by $777 million to align with the remedies order in the fourth quarter of 2023.

climate change regulations we expect that our operations and supply chain will become increasingly subject to federal, state, local and foreign laws, regulations and international treaties and industry standards relating to climate change. for example, in the european union (the "eu"), the eu corporate sustainability reporting directive, corporate sustainability due diligence directive and eu taxonomy initiatives will introduce additional due diligence and disclosure requirements addressing sustainability that will apply or we expect will apply, as applicable, to us in the coming years.
recently, in october 2021 the u.k.'s cabinet office began requiring companies bidding on contracts with the u.k. government that have a value of over £5m per year to have carbon reduction plans that contain a commitment to achieving net zero emissions by 2050 for u.k. operations. this requirement applies to our operations in the u.k. although motorola solutions uk ltd. and airwave solutions ltd., our u.k. subsidiaries, each committed in early 2022 to achieving net zero emissions by 2050 for such entities' u.k. operations, this requirement and any similar future requirements and other increased regulation of climate change concerns could subject us to additional costs and restrictions, impact our competitive position or require us to make certain changes to our manufacturing practices and/or product designs.
looking forward we expect continued growth within our global lmr installed base as a number of events such as natural disasters and large-scale incidents continue to reinforce the importance of having secure, reliable lmr for public safety. we believe our augmentation of lmr with broadband solutions will also drive growth, as we expect our customers will look to integrate valuable data capabilities. we expect to provide additional services to existing lmr customers as communications networks become more complex, software-centric and data-driven.
as public safety needs continue to evolve, we anticipate growth opportunities within the command center as our command center portfolio supports the complex process of the public safety workflow from "911 call to case closure." we expect increased growth across our portfolio that consists of native cloud, hybrid and on-premises software solutions that provide a migration path for our customers from on-premises solutions to cloud capabilities, as well as from the increasing adoption of ngcs.
within video, we expect growth across our portfolio of fixed and mobile video security solutions embedded with advanced analytics and access control solutions. we believe drivers include the expansion of traditional video sales beyond enterprise customers to government and public safety customers. additionally, we believe that government, public safety agencies and enterprises are increasingly turning to scalable, cloud-based multi-factor authentication access control to make their facilities more secure with the ability to securely access, search and manage these systems across their sites from a remote or central monitoring location. we also expect customers to continue to embrace analytics that convert video data into actionable insights and offerings such as "video-as-a-service."
finally, we anticipate new opportunities from the investments we are making to integrate our lmr, video and command center technologies into one unified safety and security ecosystem. we have made go-to-market and research and development investments in both video and our command center technologies with growth in mind. we have made a number of acquisitions and we see opportunities to continue to rationalize costs within both segments of our business, further driving operating leverage in our businesses.
we expect the continuing impact of revenue reduction on airwave services in 2024 due to the implementation of the cma's remedies order. revenue will continue to be recognized according to the remedies order published by the cma, unless the united kingdom court of appeal were to reverse the remedies order. refer to "recent events" set forth in this "part ii. item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" of this form 10-k for a further discussion regarding the impact of the cma's remedies order on our business.

during 2022, we recorded net reorganization of business charges of $36 million relating to the separation of 460 employees, of which 310 were direct employees and 150 were indirect employees. the $36 million of charges included $18 million recorded to cost of sales and $18 million recorded to other charges. included in the aggregate $36 million were charges of $36 million for employee separation costs and $10 million for exit costs, partially offset by $10 million of reversals for accruals no longer needed.
cash payments for employee severance in connection with the reorganization of business plans were $37 million, $34 million, and $77 million in 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. the reorganization of business accruals for employee separation costs at december 31, 2023 were $23 million which we expect to pay within one year.
at january 1, 2023, we had an accrual of $10 million for exit costs related to our exit of the esn contract with the home office. during the year, we recorded a $5 million reversal for accruals no longer needed. the remaining $5 million of exit costs are recorded in accrued liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet at december 31, 2023, and are expected to be paid within one year.

in 2023, we repatriated $435 million in cash to the u.s. from international jurisdictions. we routinely repatriate a portion of non-u.s. earnings each year. we have recorded income tax expense for foreign withholding tax and distribution taxes on such earnings and, under current u.s. tax laws, do not expect to incur material incremental u.s. tax on repatriation.
where appropriate, we may also pursue capital reduction activities; however, such activities can be involved and lengthy. while we regularly repatriate funds, and a portion of offshore funds can be repatriated with minimal adverse financial impact, repatriation of some of these funds may be subject to delay due to local country approvals.
operating activities the increase in operating cash flows from 2022 to 2023 was driven by:
•improved working capital; partially offset by
•$280 million of higher income tax payments, including a one-time $70 million cash tax payment made in 2023 related to an intra-group transfer of certain ip rights that was completed in 2022 (see "note 7: income taxes" to our consolidated financial statements in "part ii. item 8. financial statements and supplementary data" of this form 10-k for further information).
•an increase in working capital, inclusive of higher inventory;
investing activities the decrease in net cash used for investing activities from 2022 to 2023 was primarily due to:
•$997 million decrease in acquisitions and investments, driven by acquisitions and investments of $180 million in 2023 compared to $1.2 billion in 2022; and
•$3 million decrease in capital expenditures in 2023 compared to 2022; partially offset by
the increase in net cash used for investing activities from 2021 to 2022 was primarily due to:

at december 31, 2023, the company had retained servicing obligations for $813 million of long-term receivables, compared to $891 million of long-term receivables at december 31, 2022. servicing obligations are limited to collection activities related to the sales of accounts receivables and long-term receivables.
on september 5, 2019, we entered into an agreement with silver lake partners to issue $1.0 billion of 1.75% senior convertible notes which mature in september 2024 (the "senior convertible notes"). interest on these notes is payable semiannually. the senior notes became fully convertible on september 5, 2021. the notes are convertible based on a conversion rate of 4.9670 per $1,000 principal amount (which is equal to a conversion price of $201.33 per share), adjusted for dividends declared through the date of settlement. on february 14, 2024, we agreed with silver lake partners to repurchase $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of the 1.75% senior convertible notes for aggregate consideration of $1.59 billion in cash, inclusive of the conversion premium. the cash consideration will be paid during the first quarter of 2024 and is expected to be paid from cash on the balance sheet and short-term borrowings including under the 2021 motorola solutions credit agreement.
in may of 2021, we issued $850 million of 2.75% senior notes due 2031. we recognized net proceeds of $844 million after debt issuance costs. a portion of these proceeds was then used to redeem $324 million in principal amount of our outstanding long-term debt for a purchase price of $341 million, excluding $3 million of accrued interest. after accelerating the amortization of debt issuance costs, we recognized a loss of $18 million related to the redemption in other, net within other income (expense) in our consolidated statements of operations.
in may of 2022, we issued $600 million of 5.6% senior notes due 2032. we recognized net proceeds of $595 million after debt issuance costs and discounts. a portion of these proceeds was then used to repurchase $275 million in principal amount of the company's 4.0% senior notes due 2024 pursuant to a cash tender offer, for a purchase price of $279 million, excluding $3 million of accrued interest. after accelerating the amortization of debt discounts and debt issuance costs, we recognized a loss of $6 million related to the tender offer in other, net within other income (expense) in our consolidated statements of operations.
we have an unsecured commercial paper program, backed by the revolving credit facility described below, under which we may issue unsecured commercial paper notes up to a maximum aggregate principal amount of $2.2 billion outstanding at any one time. at maturity, the notes are paid back in full including the interest component. the notes are not redeemable prior to maturity. as of december 31, 2023, we had no outstanding debt under the commercial paper program.
credit facilities as of december 31, 2023, we had a $2.25 billion syndicated, unsecured revolving credit facility scheduled to mature in march 2026 (the "2021 motorola solutions credit agreement"). the 2021 motorola solutions credit agreement includes a letter of credit sub-limit and fronting commitments of $450 million. borrowings under the facility bear interest at the prime rate plus the applicable margin, or at a spread above the secured overnight financing rate ("sofr"), at our option. an annual facility fee is payable on the undrawn amount of the credit line. the interest rate and facility fee are subject to adjustment if our credit rating changes. we must comply with certain customary covenants including a maximum leverage ratio, as defined in the 2021 motorola solutions credit agreement. we were in compliance with our financial covenants as of december 31, 2023.
we have investment grade ratings on our senior unsecured long-term debt. during the year ended december 31, 2023, moody's investors service upgraded our credit rating to baa2 from baa3. we continue to believe that we will be able to maintain sufficient access to the capital markets in the next twelve months and the foreseeable future.
share repurchase program through a series of actions, including approval in november 2023 to increase the authorized amount by $2.0 billion, the board of directors has authorized an aggregate share repurchase amount of up to $18.0 billion of our outstanding shares of common stock (the "share repurchase program"). the share repurchase program does not have an expiration date. as of december 31, 2023, we used approximately $15.5 billion of the share repurchase authority, excluding transaction costs and excise tax, to repurchase shares, leaving approximately $2.5 billion of authority available for future repurchases. as of january 1, 2023, our share repurchases in excess of issuances are subject to a 1% excise tax enacted by the inflation reduction act of 2022, which was $4 million as of december 31, 2023.
dividends we paid cash dividends to holders of our common stock of $589 million in 2023, $530 million in 2022, and $482 million in 2021. on january 12, 2024, we paid an additional $163 million in cash dividends to holders of our common stock.
adequate internal funding resources we believe that we have adequate internal resources available to generate adequate amounts of cash to meet our expected working capital, capital expenditure and cash requirements for the next twelve months and the foreseeable future, as supported by the level of cash and cash equivalents in the u.s., the ability to repatriate funds from foreign jurisdictions, cash provided by operations, as well as liquidity provided by our commercial paper program backed by the 2021 motorola solutions credit agreement.
we do not anticipate a material decrease to net future cash flows generated from operations. we expect to use our available cash, investments, and debt facilities to support and invest in our business. this includes investing in our existing products and technologies, seeking new acquisition opportunities related to our strategic growth initiatives and returning cash to shareholders through common stock cash dividend payments (subject to the discretion of our board of directors) and share repurchases. refer also to "part i. item 1a. risk factors" for further discussion regarding access to the capital markets.
material cash requirements from contractual and other obligations summarized in the table and text below are our short-term (within the next twelve months) and long-term material cash requirements as of december 31, 2023, which we expect to fund with a combination of operating cash flows, existing cash balances or, as needed, borrowings under new or existing debt:
(1)amounts included represent the estimated principal payments applicable to outstanding debt. refer to "note 5: debt and credit facilities" in "part ii. item 8. financial statements and supplementary data" of this form 10-k for discussion related to our long-term debt obligations.
(2)we lease certain office, factory and warehouse space, land, and other equipment, principally under non-cancelable operating leases. we are evaluating our real estate needs in order to identify opportunities to reduce long-term cash requirements for office space where practicable. refer to "note 3: leases" to our consolidated financial statements in "part ii. item 8. financial statements and supplementary data" of this form 10-k for further discussion of these material lease obligations.
(3)amounts included represent firm, non-cancelable commitments. such commitments include license agreements and agreements with contract manufacturers and suppliers that either allow them to procure inventory based upon criteria as defined by us or establish the parameters defining our requirements. we do not anticipate the cancellation of any of our take-or-pay agreements in the future and estimate that purchases from these suppliers will exceed the minimum obligations during the agreement periods.
other contingencies potential contractual damage claims in excess of underlying contract value: in certain circumstances, we enter into contracts with customers pursuant to which the damages that could be claimed by the customer for failed performance might exceed the revenue we receive from the contract. contracts with these types of uncapped damages provisions are fairly rare, but individual contracts could still represent meaningful risk. there is a possibility that a claim by a counterparty to one of these contracts could result in expenses that are far in excess of the revenue received from the counterparty in connection with the contract.
indemnification provisions: we may provide indemnifications for losses that result from the breach of general warranties contained in certain commercial and intellectual property agreements. historically, we have not made significant payments under these agreements, nor have there been significant claims asserted against us. however, there is an increasing risk in relation to intellectual property indemnities given the current legal climate. in indemnification cases, payment by us is conditioned on the other party making a claim pursuant to the procedures specified in the particular contract, which procedures typically allow us to challenge the other party's claims. in some instances we may have recourse against third-parties for certain payments made by us.
legal matters: we are a defendant in various lawsuits, claims, and actions, which arise in the normal course of business. in the opinion of management, the ultimate disposition of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or liquidity. however, an unfavorable resolution could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the periods in which the matters are ultimately resolved, or in the periods in which more information is obtained that changes management's opinion of the ultimate disposition.
long-term customer financing commitments outstanding commitments:  certain purchasers of our products and services may request that we provide long-term financing (defined as financing with a term of greater than one year) in connection with the sale of equipment. these requests may include all or a portion of the purchase price of the products and services. our obligation to provide long-term financing may be conditioned on the issuance of a letter of credit in favor of us by a reputable bank to support the purchaser's credit or a pre-existing commitment from a reputable bank to purchase the long-term receivables from us. we had outstanding commitments to provide long-term financing to third-parties totaling $103 million at december 31, 2023 and $65 million at december 31, 2022.
critical accounting estimates this management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles ("gaap"). the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience, current economic and industry conditions and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. this forms the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. we believe that the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting estimates, which are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require management's most difficult, subjective and complex judgments.
revenue recognition we enter into arrangements which generally consist of multiple promises to our customers. we evaluate whether the promised goods and services are distinct or a series of distinct goods or services. where contracts contain multiple performance obligations, we allocate the total estimated consideration to each performance obligation based on applying an estimated selling price ("esp") as our best estimate of standalone selling price. we use list price as the standalone selling price for sales sold through our channel partners. given the unique nature of the goods and services we provide to direct customers, standalone sales of our products generally do not exist. therefore, we determine esp by: (i) collecting all reasonably available data points including historical sales, cost and margin analyses of the product or services, and other inputs based on our normal pricing and discounting practices, (ii) making any reasonably required adjustments to the data based on market and company-specific factors, and (iii) stratifying the data points for similar customers and circumstances, when appropriate, based on major product or service, type of customer, geographic market, and sales volume.
for system contracts accounted for over time using estimated costs as a measure of performance completed, we rely on estimates around the total estimated costs to complete the contract ("estimated costs at completion"). total estimated costs at completion include direct labor, equipment and subcontracting costs. due to the nature of the efforts required to be performed to meet the underlying performance obligation, determining estimated costs at completion may be complex and subject to many variables. we have a standard and disciplined process in which management reviews the progress and performance of open contracts in order to determine the best estimate of estimated costs at completion. as part of this process, management reviews information including, but not limited to, any outstanding key contract matters, progress towards completion, the project schedule, identified risks and opportunities, and the related changes in estimates of costs. the risks and opportunities include management's judgment about the ability and cost to achieve the project schedule, technical requirements, and other contract requirements. management must make assumptions and estimates regarding labor productivity and availability, the complexity of work to be performed, the availability and cost of materials, and performance by subcontractors, among other variables. based on this analysis, any adjustment to net sales, cost of sales, and the related impact to operating income are recorded as necessary in the period they become known. when estimates of total costs to be incurred on a contract exceed estimates of total revenue to be earned, a provision for the entire loss on the contract is recorded in the period in which the loss is determined.
retirement benefits our benefit obligations and net periodic pension costs (benefits) associated with our domestic noncontributory pension plans ("u.s. pension benefit plans"), our foreign noncontributory pension plans ("non-u.s. plans"), as well as our domestic postretirement health care plan ("postretirement health care benefits plan"), are determined using actuarial assumptions. the assumptions are based on management's best estimates, after consulting with outside investment advisors and actuaries.
accounting methodologies use an attribution approach that generally spreads the effects of individual events over the service lives of the participants in the plan, or estimated average lifetime when almost all of the plan participants are considered "inactive." examples of "events" are plan amendments and changes in actuarial assumptions such as discount rate, expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, and rate of compensation increases. as such, depending on the specific plan, we amortize gains and losses over periods ranging from nine to twenty-seven years. prior service costs are being amortized over periods ranging from one to seventeen years. benefits under all pension plans are valued based on the projected unit credit cost method.
there are various assumptions used in calculating the net periodic costs (benefits) and related benefit obligations. one of these assumptions is the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. the required use of the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets may result in recognized pension income that is greater or less than the actual returns of those plan assets in any given year. over time, however, the expected long-term returns are designed to approximate the actual long-term returns. we use a five-year, market-related asset value method of recognizing asset related gains and losses.
we use long-term historical actual return experience with consideration of the expected investment mix of the plans' assets, as well as future estimates of long-term investment returns, to develop our expected rate of return assumption used in calculating the net periodic pension cost (benefit) and the net postretirement health care benefit. our investment return assumption for the u.s. pension benefit plans was 7.87% in 2023 and 6.76% in 2022. our investment return assumption for the postretirement health care benefits plan was 8.00% in 2023 and 6.90% in 2022. our weighted average investment return assumption for the non-u.s. plans was 6.18% in 2023 and 4.78% in 2022. for the u.s. pension benefit plans, a 25 bps increase in expected return on plan assets would result in $10 million of additional net periodic pension benefit and a 25 bps decrease would result in a $10 million reduction in net periodic pension benefit in 2023. for the non-u.s. pension benefit plans, a 25 bps increase in expected return on plan assets would result in $4 million of additional net periodic pension benefit and a 25 bps decrease would result in a
$4 million reduction in net periodic pension benefit in 2023. for the postretirement health care benefits plan, a change in expected return on plan assets would have a de minimis impact to net periodic pension benefit in 2023.
a second key assumption is the discount rate. the discount rate assumptions used for the u.s. pension benefit plans, the non-u.s. plans and the postretirement health care benefits plan reflect, at december 31 of each year, the prevailing market rates for high-quality, fixed-income debt instruments that, if the obligation was settled at the measurement date, would provide the necessary future cash flows to pay the benefit obligation when due. our discount rates for measuring our u.s. pension benefit plan obligations were 5.01% and 5.20% at december 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. our weighted average discount rates for measuring our non-u.s. plans were 4.3% and 4.6% at december 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. our discount rates for measuring the postretirement health care benefits plan obligation were 4.92% and 5.10% at december 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.
for the u.s. pension benefit plans, a 25 bps increase in the discount rate on the projected benefit obligation would result in a $114 million reduction of the projected benefit obligation and a 25 bps decrease would result in $119 million of additional projected benefit obligation in 2023. for the non-u.s. pension benefit plans and the postretirement health care benefits plan, a 25 bps change in our discount rate would be de minimis in 2023.
valuation and recoverability of goodwill we assess the recorded amount of goodwill for recovery on an annual basis as of the last day of the third quarter of each fiscal year. goodwill is assessed more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying amount. we continually assess whether any such events and circumstances have occurred, which requires a significant amount of judgment. such events and circumstances may include: (i) adverse changes in macroeconomic conditions, (ii) adverse changes in the industry or market in which we transact, (iii) changes in cost factors negatively impacting earnings and cash flows, (iv) negative or declining overall financial performance, (v) events affecting the carrying value or composition of a reporting unit, or (vi) a sustained decrease in share price, among others. any such adverse event or change in circumstances could have a significant impact on the recoverability of goodwill and could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
the goodwill impairment assessment is performed at the reporting unit level. a reporting unit is an operating segment or one level below an operating segment (referred to as a "component"). a component of an operating segment is a reporting unit if the component constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews the operating results of that component. when two or more components of an operating segment have similar economic characteristics, the components are aggregated and deemed a single reporting unit. an operating segment is deemed to be a reporting unit if all of its components are similar, if none of its components is a reporting unit, or if the segment comprises only a single component. based on this guidance, we have determined that our products and systems integration and software and services segments are comprised of three and two reporting units, respectively.
we performed a qualitative assessment to determine whether it was more-likely-than-not that the fair value of each reporting unit was less than its carrying amount for the fiscal years 2023. in performing this qualitative assessment we assessed relevant events and circumstances including macroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions, cost factors, overall financial performance, changes in enterprise value and entity-specific events. in the fiscal year 2022, we elected to perform a quantitative assessment of goodwill for impairment. for fiscal years 2023 and 2022, we concluded it was more-likely-than-not that the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value.
valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. under this method, income tax expense is recognized for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year. in addition, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. management makes assumptions, judgments and estimates to determine our current and deferred tax provision and also the deferred tax assets and liabilities. we evaluate our deferred tax assets quarterly to determine if adjustments to our valuation allowance are required based on the consideration of all available positive and negative evidence.
our assumptions, judgments and estimates for computing the income tax provision takes into account current tax laws, our interpretation of current tax law and possible outcomes of current and future audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax authorities. we believe such estimates to be reasonable; however, the final determination of certain audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our financial statements.

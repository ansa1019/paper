item 1a. risk factors our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows are subject to various risks, many of which are not exclusively within our control, that may cause actual performance to differ materially from historical or projected future performance. we encourage you to consider carefully the risk factors described below in evaluating the information contained in this report as the outcome of one or more of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows.
•we depend heavily on a single customer, the u.s. government, for a substantial portion of our business. changes in this customer's priorities and spending could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows.
our primary customer is the u.s. government, from which we derived 86 percent of our sales in 2023; we have a number of large programs with the u.s. department of the air force, in particular. the u.s. government has the ability to delay, modify or cancel ongoing competitions, procurements and programs, as well as to change its future acquisition strategy. we cannot predict the impact on existing, follow-on, replacement or future programs from potential changes in the threat and global security environment, defense spending levels, government and budgetary priorities, political leadership, procurement practices and strategy, inflation and other macroeconomic trends, military strategy; or broader changes in social, economic, security or political demands and priorities.
the u.s. government has the ability to terminate contracts, in whole or in part, for its convenience or for default based on performance. in the event of termination for convenience, contractors are generally protected by provisions covering reimbursement for costs incurred and profit on those costs up to the amount authorized under the contract, but not the anticipated profit that would have been earned. in the event of termination due to default, contractors may be required to pay for re-procurement costs in excess of the original contract price, net of the value of work accepted from the original contract, as well as other damages. termination due to our default (or that of a teammate) could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, our ability to compete for other contracts and our financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows.
where program cost estimates exceed certain thresholds, our customer has been, and may in the future be, required to provide congressional notification of significant or critical cost increases (or breaches) under the nunn-mccurdy act, which, in some circumstances, could result in program restructure or termination. for example, in january 2024 the customer provided congressional notification that the ground based strategic deterrent ("sentinel") program is currently under a nunn-mccurdy breach review.
the u.s. government also has the ability to stop work under a contract for a limited period of time for its convenience. the u.s. government has invoked and could invoke this ability across a limited or broad number of contracts. in the event of a stop work order, contractors are typically protected by provisions covering reimbursement for costs incurred to date and for costs associated with the temporary stoppage of work plus a reasonable fee. however, such temporary stoppages often introduce inefficiencies and result in financial and other damages for which contractors may not be able to negotiate full recovery. in some cases, they have also ultimately resulted and could result in termination of a contract for convenience or reduced future orders.
a significant shift in government priorities, programs or strategies could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows.
•significant delays or reductions in appropriations for our programs and u.s. government funding more broadly, including a prolonged continuing resolution or breach of the debt ceiling, can negatively impact our business and programs and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows.
u.s. government programs are subject to annual congressional budget authorization and appropriation processes. for many programs, congress appropriates funds annually even though the program performance period may extend over several years. programs are often partially funded initially, with additional funds committed only as congress makes further appropriations. when we or our subcontractors incur costs in excess of funds obligated on a contract, we are generally at risk for reimbursement unless and until additional funds are obligated to the contract. we cannot
northrop grumman corporation predict what funding will ultimately be approved for individual programs. in addition, pressures on, as well as laws and plans relating to the federal budget, potential changes in priorities and defense spending, the timing and substance of the appropriations process, use of continuing resolutions (with restrictions, e.g., on new starts) and the federal debt limit (including a breach of the federal debt ceiling), have adversely affected and could adversely affect the amount and timing of funding for individual programs and delay purchasing or payments by our customers. in the event government funding for our significant programs is reduced, delayed or unavailable, or orders are reduced, our contracts or subcontracts, or competitions for such programs have at times been, and in the future may be, terminated or changed.
the u.s. continues to face an uncertain and changing political environment, along with substantial fiscal, economic and security challenges, which affect funding and budgetary priorities. the budget and macroeconomic environment, global security environment, political instability, and uncertainty surrounding the appropriations processes and the debt ceiling, remain significant short and long-term risks. see "overview" in md&a. in addition, high deficit levels and high debt servicing costs could drive cuts to federal spending. considerable uncertainty exists regarding how future budget and program decisions will unfold. if annual appropriations bills are not timely enacted, the u.s. government may continue to operate under a continuing resolution (potentially of extended duration), restricting new contract or program starts, presenting resource allocation challenges and placing limitations on budgets. we also may face a prolonged government shutdown that could lead to program cancellations, disruptions and/or stop work orders and could limit the u.s. government's ability to progress programs and make timely payments. a prolonged shutdown could limit our ability to perform on our contracts and successfully compete for new work. if the statutory debt limit is not increased adequately, we could be obligated to work without receiving timely payments, and a prolonged breach could have far-reaching adverse consequences. if current macroeconomic pressures (especially from inflation and labor and supply chain challenges) are prolonged or worsen, and increased costs continue, then existing or anticipated appropriated and contracted funds may not be sufficient to cover costs incurred on existing or future programs.
future funding for certain programs in which we participate may be reduced, delayed or cancelled. budget cuts globally could adversely affect the viability of our subcontractors and suppliers. while we believe that our business is well-positioned in areas for future defense spending, changing priorities, budget pressures, defense spending cuts, challenges in the appropriations process, the possibility of a long-term continuing resolution (or series of continuing resolutions) and breach of the debt ceiling, ongoing fiscal debates and the global economic and security environment increase uncertainties and risk.
significant delays or reductions in appropriations for our current and future programs; long-term funding under a continuing resolution; an extended debt ceiling breach or government shutdown; and/or future budget and program decisions, among other items, may negatively impact our business and programs and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows.
•we use estimates when accounting for contracts. contract cost growth or changes in estimated contract revenues and costs can affect our profitability and our overall financial position.
contract accounting requires judgment, including in assessing risks, estimating contract revenues and costs, and predicting future performance. given the size and nature of our many contracts, estimating total revenues and costs at completion is complex and subject to many variables. when there is sufficient information to assess expected future performance, we consider performance related incentives, awards and penalties in estimating revenue and profit rates. suppliers' expected performance, and the availability and costs of labor, materials and components, are also considered.
our operating income can be adversely affected when estimated contract costs increase, especially without comparable increases in revenue. there are many reasons estimated contract costs can increase, including inflation, labor challenges, supply chain challenges, and market and exchange rate volatility; delays or limitations in customer funding; design or other development challenges; production challenges (including from technical or quality issues and other performance concerns); inability to realize learning curves or other cost savings; changes in laws or regulations; actions necessary for long-term customer satisfaction; challenges caused by the global health environment; and natural disasters or environmental matters.
we aim to mitigate this risk through contract terms, and we have submitted and may submit requests for equitable adjustment (reas), engineering change proposals or other claims to seek recovery in whole or in part for our increased costs. we have also sought, and will seek, other avenues, as appropriate, to compensate the company for certain unexpected cost increases. however, our contracts may not enable full recovery, and/or the government may disagree with our requests and may not have funding to cover them.
northrop grumman corporation our risk varies with the type of contract. fixed-price contracts inherently tend to have more financial risk than cost-type contracts, including as a result of inflationary pressures, labor rates and shortages, and supplier challenges. in 2023, approximately half of our sales were derived from fixed-price contracts. we have more often entered into fixed-price contracts where costs can be more reasonably estimated based on actual experience, such as for mature production programs. however, our customers have sought, and may in the future seek, fixed-price contracts for development programs, combined development and production programs, or low-rate initial production programs, where the risks are greater. in addition, our contracts contain provisions relating to cost controls and audit rights. if we do not achieve our estimates or meet terms in our contracts, our profitability has at times been and may be reduced, and we have incurred and may incur losses.
certain of our fixed-price contracts include or may include fixed-price development work. this work is inherently more uncertain, and, as a result, there is typically more variability in estimates of the costs to complete the development stage. as work progresses into production, the risks associated with estimating total costs are typically reduced. while management uses its best judgment to estimate costs associated with fixed-price contracts, future events could result in significant adjustments.
under cost-type contracts, allowable costs are generally subject to reimbursement plus a fee. we often enter into cost-type contracts for development programs with complex design and technical challenges. these cost-type programs may have award or incentive fees that are uncertain and may be earned over extended periods or towards the end of the contract. in these cases, the financial risks are typically in recognizing profit, which ultimately may not be earned, or program cancellation if cost, schedule, or technical performance issues arise. we also face additional financial risk when solicitations require us to bid on cost-type development work and fixed-price production lots and/or options in one submission, or cost-type development work requiring us to provide certain items at our expense or with little or no fee. ongoing macroeconomic challenges increase these risks.
because of the significance of management's judgments and the estimation processes, and the difficulties inherent in estimating future costs, particularly in a challenging macroeconomic environment, it is possible that we could see materially different results. changes in underlying assumptions, circumstances or estimates, and the failure to recover on requests for equitable adjustments, engineering change proposals or other claims could have a material adverse effect on the profitability of one or more of our contracts and on our overall financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows. see "critical accounting policies and estimates" in md&a and note 12 to the consolidated financial statements.
•the global macroeconomic environment could negatively impact our business and our financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows could be materially adversely affected.
our business, financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows have been and may continue to be adversely impacted by the global macroeconomic environment, which has experienced extraordinary challenges, including high rates of inflation; increased interest rates; widespread disruptions in supply chains; workforce challenges, including labor shortages; and market volatility, including exchange rate volatility. these challenges have, among other things, led to increased costs, labor and supply shortages, and delays and disruption in performance, as well as competing demands for scarce resources. those challenges have adversely impacted our customers, our industry, our company, our suppliers and others with whom we do business. while some aspects of the macroeconomic environment have improved, and we have been able to mitigate some of the challenges (especially with respect to labor shortages), other challenges persist. we cannot predict the future trajectory or duration of this risk, including how the macroeconomic environment will evolve or how it will continue to impact us.
we continue to work proactively to mitigate the challenges caused by the macroeconomic environment, including, in some cases, seeking the inclusion of economic price adjustment clauses or seeking to recover on requests for equitable adjustments, engineering change proposals or other claims. however, if we are unable to do so successfully, our financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows could be materially adversely affected.
•competition within our markets and bid protests may affect our ability to win new contracts and result in reduced revenues and market share.
we operate in highly competitive markets and our competitors may have more financial capacity or more extensive or specialized engineering, manufacturing, marketing or servicing capabilities. they may be willing to accept more risk or lower profitability in competing for contracts. we have seen, and anticipate we will continue to see, increased competition in some of our core markets, especially as a result of our customers' budget pressures, their focus on affordability and competition, and our own success in winning business. we are facing increasing competition in the u.s. and outside the u.s. from u.s., foreign and multinational firms, including new entrants, and anticipate that acquisitions within our industry could further increase competition. we are also facing increasing competition for,
northrop grumman corporation and more limited access to various critical products, services and other supplies. in some instances, foreign companies may receive loans, subsidies and other assistance from their governments that may not be available to u.s. companies and foreign companies may be subject to fewer restrictions on technology transfer. some customers, including the dod, are turning to commercial contractors, rather than traditional defense contractors, for some products and services, and continue to utilize small business contractors or determine to source work internally. our success in competing depends, in part, on our ability to remain cost-competitive, accurately anticipate our customers' needs and successfully to effect our digital transformation strategy and adopt and integrate new digital manufacturing and operating technologies into our products and services.
bid protests can result in contract modifications or the award decision being reversed and loss of the contract award. even where a bid protest does not result in such a loss, it can delay the start of contract activities and earnings.
if we are unable to continue to compete successfully against our current or future competitors, or prevail in protests, or to prevail against other attempts to interfere with our ability to obtain and retain awards, we may experience declines in future revenues and market share, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows.
•we are subject to various investigations, claims, disputes, enforcement actions, litigation, and other legal proceedings that could ultimately be resolved against us.
the size, nature and complexity of our business make us particularly susceptible to investigations, claims, disputes, enforcement actions, prosecutions, litigation and other legal proceedings (collectively "legal proceedings"), particularly those involving governments, which have at times been, and may continue to be, increasingly aggressive. we are and may become subject to legal proceedings globally (including criminal, civil and administrative) and across a broad array of matters, including, but not limited to, government contracts, cost accounting, financial accounting and reporting, false statements or claims, cybersecurity and pension accounting and other employee benefit plan matters. these matters can divert resources; result in administrative, civil or criminal fines, penalties or other sanctions (including judgments, convictions, consent or other voluntary decrees or agreements), compensatory, treble or other damages, non-monetary relief, or other liabilities; and otherwise harm our business and our ability to obtain and retain awards. certain allegations may lead to suspension or debarment from government contracts or suspension of export/import privileges for the company or one or more of its components. suspension or debarment or criminal resolutions in particular could have a material adverse effect on the company because of our reliance on government contracts and export authorizations. an investigation, claim, dispute, enforcement action or litigation, even if pending or not ultimately substantiated or if fully indemnified or insured, can negatively impact our reputation among our customers and the public, and make it substantially more difficult for us to compete effectively for business, obtain and retain awards, ensure adequate funding for our programs or obtain adequate insurance in the future. investigations, claims, disputes, enforcement actions, litigation or other legal proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows. see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding investigations, claims and litigation.
•the improper conduct of employees, agents, subcontractors, suppliers, business partners or joint ventures in which we participate can impact our reputation, our ability to do business and our financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows.
we have implemented policies, training and other compliance controls, and have negotiated contractual terms designed to prevent misconduct by employees, agents or others working with us or on our behalf that would violate the applicable laws of the jurisdictions in which we operate, including laws governing improper payments to government officials, the protection of export controlled or classified information, false claims, procurement integrity, cost accounting and billing, competition, information security and data privacy, intellectual property and contract terms. however, we cannot ensure that we will prevent all such misconduct committed by our employees, agents, suppliers, partners or others working with us or on our behalf. we have in the past experienced and may in the future experience such misconduct, despite a vigorous compliance program, our values and strong culture. this risk of improper conduct may increase as we continue to expand globally, with greater opportunities and demands to do more business with local and new partners, and in new environments. at the same time, law enforcement agencies are continuing to focus collaboratively on combating global corruption and other misconduct. in the ordinary course we form and are members of joint ventures or other business arrangements and/or invest in third parties with whom we do business. notwithstanding our robust processes, we may be unable to prevent misconduct or violations of applicable laws by these joint ventures (including their officers, directors and employees) or our
northrop grumman corporation partners. improper actions by our employees or those with whom or through whom we do business subjects us to risk of administrative, civil or criminal investigations and enforcement actions; monetary and non-monetary penalties; liabilities; and the loss of privileges and other sanctions, including suspension and debarment, which could negatively impact our reputation and ability to conduct business and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows.
•as a u.s. government contractor, we and our partners are subject to various procurement and other laws, regulations and contract terms applicable to our industry, as well as those more broadly applicable to industry, and we could be adversely affected by changes in such laws, regulations or terms, or any negative findings by the u.s. government as to our compliance with them. we also may be adversely affected by changes in our customers' business practices globally.
u.s. government contractors (including their subcontractors and others with whom they do business) must comply with various specific procurement laws, regulations, rules and other legal requirements, as well as ones more broadly applicable. these various legal requirements, although sometimes customary in government contracting, increase costs and risks. they have been and are evolving at a significant pace. the costs are not always fully recoverable. new laws or other requirements, or changes to existing ones (including, for example, related to cyber, information protection, cost accounting, environment, sustainability, securities, competition, compensation costs, taxes, counterfeit parts, pensions, and use of certain non-us equipment) or more expansive interpretations or other changes in how government agencies construe existing ones, can significantly increase our costs and risks and reduce our profitability.
we operate in a highly regulated environment and are routinely audited and reviewed by the u.s. government and its agencies, such as the dcaa, defense contract management agency (dcma) and the dod inspector general. these agencies review performance under our contracts, our cost structure and accounting, and our compliance, and the adequacy of our systems in meeting government requirements. costs ultimately found to be unallowable or improperly allocated may not be reimbursed or may be refunded. when an audit uncovers improper or illegal activities, we are subject to possible civil and criminal penalties, sanctions, or suspension or debarment. whether or not illegal activities are alleged, the u.s. government has the ability to decrease or withhold certain payments when it deems systems to be inadequate, with significant financial impact, regardless of the ultimate outcome. in addition, we risk serious reputational harm in situations involving allegations of impropriety made against us or our business partners.
our industry has experienced, and we expect it will continue to experience, significant changes to business practices globally, in part as a result of changes in the global security and threat environment and an increased focus on affordability, efficiencies, business systems, recovery of costs and a reprioritization of available defense funds. we have experienced and may continue to experience an increased number of audits and challenges to our claims and our business systems for current and past years, as well as longer periods to close audits, broader requests for information and an increased risk of withholdings of payments. the u.s. government has been pursuing and may continue to pursue policies that could negatively impact our profitability, including those that shift additional responsibility and performance risks to the contractor. changes in procurement practices, including those favoring incentive-based fee arrangements; fixed price development or long-term production programs; different award criteria; non-traditional contract provisions; and contract negotiation offers that indicate what our costs should be, have affected and may in the future affect our profitability and predictability.
we (including our subcontractors and others with whom we do business) also are subject to, and expected to perform in compliance with, a vast array of federal, state and local laws, regulations, contract terms and requirements related to our industry, our products and the businesses we operate, as well as those more broadly applicable to industry, such as securities laws and regulations. these requirements, whether specific to our industry or broadly applicable, may limit our ability to achieve our goals. if we are found to have violated any such requirements, or are found not to have acted responsibly, we may be subject to a wide array of actions, including contract modifications or termination; payment withholds; the loss of export/import privileges; administrative, civil or criminal judgments or penalties (including convictions, agreements, fines, damages and non-monetary relief); or suspension or debarment.
if we or those with whom we do business do not comply with the laws, regulations, rules, contract terms and processes to which we are subject or if customer business practices or requirements change significantly, including with respect to allowable costs, it could affect our ability to compete and have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows.
•environmental matters, including climate change, unforeseen costs associated with compliance and remediation efforts, and government and third party claims, could have a material adverse effect on our reputation and our financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows.
our operations are subject to and affected by a variety of federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and regulations, including as they may be expanded, otherwise changed or enforced differently over time. compliance with these existing and evolving environmental laws and regulations requires, and is expected to continue to require, significant operating and capital costs. for example, some of these recently enacted laws and regulations prohibit the use of certain chemicals or other substances that are used in our business, which may require us to identify alternate sources, result in additional costs and/or otherwise impact our business and operations. new and evolving laws, regulations and rule makings globally are expected to impose different and more restrictive standards and require greater disclosures. they could also require capital investments, could adversely impact our ongoing operations, and could require changes on a more accelerated time frame. our suppliers are expected to face similar challenges and incur additional compliance costs that may be passed on to us. these direct and indirect costs may adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition, and, if we are unable to comply with legislative and regulatory requirements or meet our sustainability objectives, our reputation and ability to do business could be negatively impacted. in addition, our customers' requirements, priorities and ways of doing business with respect to environmental matters, and climate change specifically, also may have an impact on our business, operations and financial success. for example, in 2022, the sec and far council issued proposed rule-makings on climate change. the proposed rules, depending on how they are finally adopted, as well as other changes the government might implement, could impose significant new burdens on the company and our suppliers, with significant potential costs and operational impacts, and adversely impact our ability to win business and operate successfully.
environmental matters may significantly impact our business and operations and present evolving risks and challenges. environmental impacts, including climate change specifically, create short and long-term financial risks to our business globally. we have significant operations located in regions that have been, and may in the future be, exposed to significant weather events and other natural disasters. increased worldwide focus on climate change has led to legislative and regulatory efforts to combat both potential causes and adverse impacts of climate change, including regulation of greenhouse gas emissions. new or more stringent laws and regulations related to greenhouse gas emissions and other climate change related concerns have affected and will likely continue to affect us, our suppliers and our customers. the company has set a goal to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions in our operations by 2035 and is committed to working to achieve its climate change and other sustainability goals. we are working to identify opportunities to utilize alternatives to fossil-based energy sources, to decrease our greenhouse gas emissions, to reduce our consumption of water and generation of waste, and to ensure our compliance with environmental regulations where we operate, enhancing our record of environmental sustainability. however, the costs of doing so may be greater than expected, and there can be no assurance the company will achieve its objectives, or meet the evolving sustainability expectations and standards of our investors and other external stakeholders.
we may be subject to substantial administrative, civil or criminal fines, penalties or other sanctions (including suspension and debarment) for violations of environmental laws. if we are found to be in violation of the federal clean air act or the clean water act, the facility or facilities involved in the violation could be placed by the environmental protection agency on a list of facilities that generally cannot be used in performing on u.s. government contracts until the violation is corrected.
we incur, and expect to continue to incur, substantial remediation costs related to the cleanup of pollutants previously released into the environment. stricter or different remediation standards or enforcement of existing laws and regulations; new requirements, including regulation of new substances; discovery of previously unknown or more extensive contamination or new contaminants; imposition of fines, penalties, or damages (including natural resource damages); a determination that certain remediation or other costs are unallowable; rulings on allocation or insurance coverage; and/or the insolvency, inability or unwillingness of other parties to pay their share, could require us to incur material additional costs in excess of those anticipated.
we are and may become a party to various legal proceedings and disputes involving government and private parties (including individual and class actions) relating to alleged impacts from pollutants released into the environment, including bodily injury and property damage. these matters could result in material compensatory or other damages, remediation costs, penalties, and non-monetary relief, and adverse determinations on allowability or insurance coverage.
northrop grumman corporation government and private parties also seek to hold us responsible for liabilities or obligations related to former operations that have been divested or spun-off and/or for which we believe other parties have agreed to be responsible and/or to indemnify us. these rights may not be sufficient to protect us.
the impact of these factors is difficult to predict, but one or more of them could harm our reputation and business and have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows.
•unanticipated changes in our tax provisions or exposure to additional tax liabilities could affect our profitability and cash flow.
we are subject to income and other taxes in the u.s. and foreign jurisdictions. changes in applicable tax laws and regulations, or their interpretation and application, including the possibility of retroactive effect, have affected and could affect our tax expense. in addition, the final determination of any tax audits or related litigation, in particular with regard to our positions on research credits and timing of revenue recognition under irc section 451(b), could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals.
we may be subject to future tax audits and legal challenges involving oatk, which we acquired in 2018, or the spinoff of its then subsidiary vista outdoor, and we may be unable to obtain indemnification or we may be required to indemnify vista.
changes in our tax provisions or an increase in our tax liabilities, whether due to changes in applicable laws and regulations, the interpretation or application thereof, or a final determination of tax audits or litigation or agreements, could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows.
•our business could be negatively impacted by cyber and other security threats or disruptions.
as a defense contractor, we face significant cyber and other security threats. they include, among other things, attempts to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information or otherwise compromise the integrity, confidentiality and/or availability of our systems, hardware and networks, and the information on them; insider threats; ransomware; threats to the safety of our directors, officers and employees; threats to our facilities, infrastructure, products (we produce and use), and subcontractors or other suppliers (referred to inclusively as suppliers); and threats from terrorist acts, espionage, civil unrest and other acts of aggression. we are also subject to increasing government, customer and other cyber and security requirements, including disclosure obligations.
we have robust measures in place to address and mitigate cyber-related risks. however, we have experienced cyber attacks and expect we will continue to experience additional attacks in the future, including from nation states and non-state actors. we continue to invest in the cybersecurity and resiliency of our networks and products and to enhance our internal controls and processes, which are designed to help protect our systems and infrastructure, and the information they contain. these include timely detection of incidents through monitoring, training, incident response capabilities, and mitigating cyber and security risks to our data, systems, products and services. we also partner with the government and others in our industry to help protect national security. however, given the complex, continuing and evolving nature of cyber and other security threats, including threats from targeting by more advanced and persistent adversaries, including nation states and other actors, these efforts may not be fully effective, particularly against previously unknown vulnerabilities that could go undetected for an extended period.
although we implement various measures and controls to monitor and mitigate risks associated with these threats and to increase the cyber resiliency of our infrastructure and products, there can be no assurance that these processes will be sufficient. successful attacks could lead to losses or misuse of sensitive information or capabilities; theft or corruption of data; harm to personnel, infrastructure or products; financial costs and liabilities; protracted disruptions in our operations and performance; and the misuse of our products, as well as damage to our reputation as a provider of cyber-related or cyber-protected goods and services. we have not always been able to and may in the future not always be able to obtain adequate insurance to cover our losses.
cyber threats, both on premises and in the cloud, are evolving and include, but are not limited to: malicious software, destructive malware, ransomware, attempts to gain unauthorized access to systems or data, disruption to
northrop grumman corporation operations, critical systems or denial of service attacks; unauthorized release of confidential, personal or other protected information (ours or that of our employees, customers or partners); corruption of data, networks or systems; harm to individuals; and loss of assets. we have been and could be impacted by cyber threats or other disruptions or vulnerabilities found in products or services we use or in our internal, partners' or customers' systems that are used in connection with our business. some of these threats are zero-day attacks associated with previously unknown vulnerabilities in third party software or products we utilize in our business. cyber events, if not prevented or effectively mitigated, have caused and could cause harm and require remedial actions. they could also damage our reputation, disrupt performance, impact our ability to obtain future insurance coverage, and lead to loss of business, regulatory actions, liabilities or other financial losses, for which we do not have adequate sources of recovery.
we provide systems, products and services to various customers who also face cyber threats. our systems, products and services may not be able to detect or deter threats, or effectively to mitigate resulting losses. these losses could adversely affect our customers and our company.
we also face increasing and evolving disclosure obligations related to cyber and other security events. despite rigorous processes, we risk failing to meet all our existing or future disclosure obligations and/or having our disclosures misinterpreted. national security or public safety considerations may also affect, or in limited instances prevent, our public disclosure of a cybersecurity incident in certain circumstances.
we also face threats to our physical security, including to our facilities and the safety and well-being of our people. these threats could involve terrorism, insider threats, workplace violence, civil unrest, natural disasters, damaging weather, or fires, which could adversely affect our company. our customers and suppliers face similar risks that, if realized, could also adversely impact our operations. such acts could cause delays, manufacturing downtime, or other impacts that could detrimentally impact our ability to perform our operations. we could also incur unanticipated costs to remediate impacts and lost business.
the occurrence and impact of these various risks are difficult to predict, but one or more of them could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows.
•our ability to win new competitions and meet the needs of our customers depends, in part, on our ability to maintain a qualified workforce.
our operating results and growth opportunities are heavily dependent upon our ability to attract and retain sufficient qualified and diverse personnel who are or can reasonably be cleared (and obtain program access), who have the requisite skills in multiple areas, including science, technology, engineering and math, and who share our values and are able to operate effectively consistent with our culture. outside the u.s., it is increasingly important that we are also able to attract and retain personnel with relevant local qualifications and experience. we continue to face increased competition for talent, both with traditional defense companies and commercial companies, globally, and with increasing wage rates. although we have realized benefits from extensive hiring and retention programs in recent years, the risk of insufficient personnel may increase, either broadly or with respect to select critical staffing requirements. if necessary qualified personnel are more scarce or more difficult to attract or retain under reasonable terms, or if we experience a high level of attrition, generally or in particular areas, or if such personnel are increasingly unable to obtain security clearances or program access on a timely basis or are unable to be timely and effectively trained, we would expect higher labor-related costs and we could face challenges performing on various of our programs and meeting financial expectations. in addition, the macroeconomic environment, including continued challenges in the global labor market, may further affect our ability to hire, develop and retain the necessary talented and diverse workforce, and to maintain performance levels and our corporate culture. there is also the risk that we are unable to achieve our environmental, social and governance (esg) goals which may be required by certain of our shareholders, employees, the government and other stakeholders, which could adversely impact our reputation, business and ability to hire and retain talent.
certain of our employees are covered by collective agreements. we generally have been able to renegotiate renewals to expiring agreements without significant disruption of operating activities. however, the environment appears to be shifting, and if, for example, we experience difficulties with renewals and renegotiations of existing collective agreements, or if our employees pursue new collective representation, we could incur additional expenses and impacts on operating efficiency and may be subject to work stoppages or other labor-related disruptions. any such expenses or delays could adversely affect our performance and results.
northrop grumman corporation if we are unable to attract and retain a qualified workforce, we may be unable to maintain our competitive position or achieve our results, and it could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows.
•our earnings and profitability depend, in part, on subcontractor and supplier performance and financial viability as well as raw material and component availability and pricing.
we rely on other companies to provide raw materials, chemicals, parts and components and subsystems for our products, produce hardware elements and sub-assemblies, provide software and intellectual property, provide information about the parts they supply to us, and perform some of the services we need for our operations or provide to our customers, and to do so in compliance with all applicable laws, regulations and contract terms, while maintaining strong values and cultures. disruptions or performance problems with our subcontractors or other suppliers (referred to inclusively as suppliers), unanticipated cost growth for the products and services they provide, failure to meet regulatory or contractual requirements, unethical behavior, or a misalignment between our contractual obligations to our customers and our agreement with our suppliers, have had and may continue to have various adverse impacts on the company, including on our ability to meet our commitments to customers and financial expectations. this risk of delays and disruptions in the supply chain, and supply chain challenges more broadly, has been and continues to be heightened globally, in the current macroeconomic environment.
our ability to perform our obligations on time is adversely affected if one or more of our suppliers is unable to provide the agreed-upon products, materials or information, or perform the agreed-upon services in a timely, compliant and cost-effective manner. we also may experience challenges performing if we are unable to use certain raw materials, chemicals or other substances due to laws or other regulations that restrict or prohibit the use of such items and cannot obtain a reasonable substitute on a cost-effective basis. changes in political or economic conditions, including changes in demand, changes in the macroeconomic environment (including inflation and labor and supply chain challenges), changes in defense budgets and/or priorities, changes in the global security environment, changes in export/import restrictions, evolving requirements, or changes in access to critical technology and materials (including metals and components), among others, have adversely affected and could in the future adversely affect the financial stability of our suppliers and/or their ability to perform effectively. the inability of our suppliers to perform effectively has required and may require us to provide them additional support and/or to transition to alternate suppliers, if available, with additional costs and delays. we expect we will need to continue to provide additional resources to support certain of our suppliers in performing under our contracts. in addition, if we are unable to do that, we may face additional losses and liabilities under our current contracts and adversely impact the prospects for certain new ones.
in connection with our u.s. government contracts, we are required to procure certain materials, components and parts from supply sources approved by the customer and/or are restricted from procuring products or services from certain sources. for example, we require assured access to certain microelectronics. our ability to produce and/or deliver products will be significantly impacted if the microelectronics manufacturing supply chain is cut off or significantly delayed. for some components, there has been or may be only one supplier, or one domestic supplier. if that supplier cannot meet our needs or if we are unable to procure components from certain suppliers due to regulatory restrictions, we may be unable to find a suitable alternative and to meet our obligations.
we and our suppliers are also facing increased regulatory requirements globally. we may be held responsible not only for our compliance, but that of our suppliers. our procurement practices are intended to reduce the risk we procure counterfeit, unauthorized or otherwise non-compliant parts or materials. we rely on our suppliers also to comply with applicable laws and contract terms, to ensure the quality of their components and effectively to mitigate the risk of cyber and security threats or other disruptions to their performance.
if our suppliers are not financially viable, incur increased costs of delays, fail to comply with legal requirements, or otherwise fail to address these risks or meet their obligations to us, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows.
•our international business exposes us to additional risks, including risks related to geopolitical and economic factors, laws and regulations.
sales to customers outside the u.s. are an important component of our strategy. our international business (including our participation in joint ventures, requirements for local content, and our global supply chain) is subject to numerous political and economic factors, legal requirements, cross-cultural considerations and other risks associated with doing business globally. these risks differ in some respects from those associated with our u.s.
our international business is generally subject to both u.s. and foreign laws, regulations and practices. failure by us, our employees, partners or others with whom we work to comply with applicable laws and regulations could result in administrative, civil, commercial or criminal liabilities, including suspension or debarment from government contracts or suspension of export/import privileges. failure to comply with local practices can adversely impact our ability to win and perform business. new regulations and requirements, or changes to existing ones in countries in which we operate can significantly increase our costs and risks of doing business internationally. our customers outside of the u.s. also often have the ability to terminate contracts for convenience as well as for default based on performance. suspension or debarment, or termination of a contract due to default could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, our ability to compete for other contracts and our financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows. despite robust processes, we also face risks related to the unintended or unauthorized use of our products and resources.
changes in laws, political leadership and environment, and/or security risks may dramatically affect our ability to conduct or continue to conduct profitable business in international markets. our international business is impacted by changes in u.s. and non-u.s. national policies and priorities, and geopolitical relationships, any of which may be influenced by changes in the global threat environment, political leadership, geopolitical and economic uncertainties, world events, government budgets, inflationary pressures, sanctions imposed in countries where we do business or seek to do business, and economic and political factors more generally. the u.s. and its allies continue to face a global security environment of heightened tensions and instability, threats from state and non-state actors, including major global powers, as well as terrorist organizations, emerging nuclear tensions, and diverse regional security concerns. any of these factors may impact demand for our products and services, funding for programs, our ability to perform, our supply chain, export authorizations, purchasing decisions or customer payments. global macroeconomic conditions, as well as fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and credit, are also likely to further impact our business.
our contracts with non-u.s. customers in some cases include terms and reflect legal requirements that create additional risks. they may include requirements to hire, invest, manufacture or purchase locally, or specific financial obligations, including offset obligations, and they may provide for significant penalties if we fail to meet such requirements. they may also require us to enter into letters of credit, performance bonds, bank guarantees or other financial arrangements. if we are dependent on certain suppliers, as in the u.s., we face risks related to their failure to perform in accordance with legal requirements, particularly where we rely on a sole source supplier. our ability to sell products globally could be adversely affected if we are unable to design our products on a cost effective basis or to obtain and retain all necessary export authorizations, which the u.s. government can deny, change or revoke for reasons outside our control. our business outside of the u.s. also depends on our ability to attract and retain sufficient qualified personnel with the skills and/or security clearances in the markets in which we do business. we may need to partner successfully with non-u.s. companies, including through joint ventures, teaming agreements, co-production or other arrangements. this risk includes the ability to identify and negotiate appropriate arrangements with qualified and acceptable local partners, potential exposure for their actions, and the ability effectively to terminate these arrangements. this risk is complicated further when we partner with government-affiliated entities.
the products and services we provide, including those provided by suppliers and joint ventures, are sometimes in countries with unstable governments, economic or fiscal challenges, military or political conflicts, different business practices and/or developing legal systems. this may increase the risk to our employees, suppliers or other third parties, including for their safety, and increase our risk to a wide range of financial consequences and other liabilities, as well as loss of property or damage to our products.
the occurrence and impact of these factors is difficult to predict, but one or more of them could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows.
•we face various risks related to health epidemics, pandemics and similar outbreaks, which may have material adverse effects on our business, financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows.
we face a wide variety of risks related to health epidemics, pandemics and similar outbreaks, especially of infectious diseases. the global health environment has contributed to business slowdowns or shutdowns, labor shortages, supply chain challenges, changes in government spending and requirements, regulatory challenges, inflationary pressures and market volatility. although we aim to mitigate impacts of adverse changes in the global health environment, these changes can be unpredictable and we may be unable to effectively mitigate them. if a health
northrop grumman corporation epidemic, pandemic or similar outbreak were to occur or worsen, we likely would experience broad and varied impacts, including potentially to our workforce and supply chain, with inflationary pressures and increased costs (which may or may not be fully recoverable or insured), schedule and/or production delays, market volatility and other financial impacts. if any or all of these items were to occur, we could experience material adverse impacts on our business, financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows.
•our future success depends, in part, on our ability to innovate, develop new products and technologies, progress and benefit from digital transformation and maintain technologies, facilities and equipment to win new competitions and meet the needs of our customers. failure to do so or meet our contractual obligations that require innovative design could adversely affect our profitability, reputation and future prospects.
we design, develop and manufacture technologically advanced and innovative products and services, which are applied by our customers in a variety of environments, including highly demanding operating conditions, to accomplish challenging missions. our success depends upon our ability to develop technologically advanced, innovative and cost-effective products and services and market these products and services to our customers globally. our ability to develop innovative and technologically advanced products depends on the talent of our workforce, continued funding for, and investment in, research and development projects, continued access to assured suppliers of important technologies and components, our ability to compete (including with commercial companies) and our ability to provide the people, technologies, facilities, equipment and financial capacity needed to develop and deliver those products and services with maximum efficiency. to perform on our contracts and to win new business, we also depend increasingly on our ability to progress successfully on our digital transformation. it is increasingly necessary to meet evolving customer requirements, to differentiate our offerings, and to achieve efficiencies that we and our suppliers/partners successfully develop digital based solutions and transform our operations. if we are unable to continue to develop new products and technologies in a timely fashion, and progress successfully to effect digital solutions and transformation, or if we fail to achieve market acceptance more rapidly than our competitors, we may be unable to maintain our competitive position and our future success could be materially adversely affected.
we aim to ensure that our technical solutions are responsibly developed, tested and operated. problems and delays in the successful development and delivery of our solutions, including as a result of issues with our design, technology or operations, digital transformation, inability to achieve learning curve assumptions, artificial intelligence, manufacturing materials or components, or subcontractor (or other supplier) performance can prevent us from meeting requirements and create significant risk and liabilities. similarly, failures to perform on schedule or otherwise to fulfill our contractual obligations can negatively impact our financial position, reputation and ability to win future business.
in addition, our products cannot be tested and proven in all situations and are otherwise subject to unforeseen problems that can negatively affect revenue, schedule and profitability, and result in loss of life or property. they include loss on launch or flight of spacecraft, loss of aviation platforms, premature failure of products that cannot be accessed for repair or replacement, unintended explosions, problems with design, quality and workmanship, country of origin of procured materials, inadequate supplier components and degradation of product performance. factors that may affect revenue and profitability also include: inaccurate cost estimates, design issues, human factors, unforeseen costs and expenses, diversion of management focus, loss of follow-on work, replacement obligations, and repayment to the government customer of certain contract cost and fee payments previously received.
certain contracts, primarily involving space satellite systems, contain provisions that entitle the customer to recover fees in the event of failure of the system upon launch or subsequent deployment for less than a specified period of time. under such terms, we are generally required to forfeit fees previously recognized and/or collected.
if we are unable to meet our obligations, including due to issues regarding the design, development or manufacture of our products or services, or we experience launch, platform, satellite system or other failures, it could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, our ability to compete for other contracts and our financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows.
•our business is subject to disruption caused by natural disasters that could adversely affect our profitability and our overall financial position.
we have significant operations, including centers of excellence, located in regions that have been, and may in the future be, exposed to hurricanes, earthquakes, water levels, wildfires, windstorms, and other natural disasters. we expect our facilities, operations, employees and communities in the future, particularly at facilities in coastal areas and areas prone to extreme weather events and water scarcity to continue to be at risk for future natural disasters or
northrop grumman corporation other weather events (which may be exacerbated by climate change). climate related changes can impact natural disasters, including weather patterns, with the increased frequency and severity of significant weather events (e.g., flooding, hurricanes and tropical storms), natural hazards (e.g., increased wildfire risk), rising mean temperature and sea levels, and long-term changes in precipitation patterns (e.g., drought, desertification, and/or poor water quality). if a natural disaster occurs, our operations could be interrupted, our employees could be impacted, we could incur significant costs and our performance could be adversely affected. our subcontractors and other suppliers have also been, and may in the future be, subject to natural disasters that could cause disruption and affect their ability to deliver or perform. disruptions also impact the availability and cost of materials needed for manufacturing and could increase insurance and other operating costs, or result in a lack of available coverage. although we take steps to mitigate these risks, including considering them in determining where to put new businesses, the damage and disruption resulting from natural disasters, which may increase, as well as delays in recovery, may be significant.
if insurance or other sources are unavailable or insufficient to recover all costs or if we experience a significant disruption to our business due to a natural disaster, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows.
we provide products and services related to hazardous and high risk operations. among other such operations, our products and services are used in nuclear-related activities (including nuclear-powered platforms) and used in support of nuclear-related operations of third parties. in addition, certain of our products are provided with space and missile launches. we use and provide energetic materials, including in propulsion systems, which include products that involve highly explosive or flammable elements. we develop missile systems, and counter systems, including strategic deterrents, as well as subsystems and components. these and other activities subject us to various extraordinary risks, including (1) potential liabilities relating to nuclear or non-nuclear launch-related incidents, unintended initiation of energetic materials and explosions, including risk of personal injury, property damage and environmental harm; (2) harmful effects on the environment and human health that may result from nuclear-related activities, operations or incidents; the storage, handling and disposal of radioactive materials; and the development, testing and use of energetics, including in propulsion systems, and unintended explosions or releases and (3) to failed launches. we may be subject to reputational harm and potential liabilities arising out of such incidents or hazardous operations, whether or not the cause was within our control, and insurance may not be reasonably available. under some circumstances, the u.s. government and prime contractors may provide for certain indemnification and other protection, including pursuant to, or in connection with, public law 85-804, 10 u.s.c. 3861, the price-anderson nuclear industries indemnity act, the nasa space act, the commercial space launch act and the terrorism risk insurance reauthorization act, for certain risks, but those protections may not be available or adequate.
certain of our products, such as medium and large caliber ammunition and propulsion systems, involve the use, manufacture and/or handling of a variety of explosive and flammable materials or other hazardous substances. these activities have resulted and may result in incidents that cause workplace injuries and fatalities, the temporary shut down or other disruption of manufacturing, production delays, environmental harm and expense, fines and liabilities to third parties. we have safety and loss prevention programs, which provide for pre-construction reviews, along with safety audits of operations involving explosive materials, to attempt to mitigate some such incidents, as well as potentially insurance coverage and indemnification, but they may not be successful.
in addition, our customers may use our products and services in ways that can be unusually hazardous or risky, or in ways that are not intended, which may create potential liabilities for our company, as well as reputational harm.
if any of these risks were to materialize (e.g. if there was a nuclear incident, or an incident related to launch activities or the use of energetics or propulsion systems), and if insurance coverage or indemnification or other protection was not fully available, it could adversely affect our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows.
•we may be unable fully to exploit or adequately to protect intellectual property rights, which could materially affect our ability to compete, our reputation and our financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows.
to perform on our contracts and to win new business, we depend on our ability to develop, protect and exploit our intellectual property and also to access the intellectual property of others under reasonable terms. increasing demands from our customers to access and obtain rights in our intellectual property, and positions taken by our suppliers and competitors challenge our ability to exploit, protect and access intellectual property.
northrop grumman corporation we own many forms of intellectual property, including u.s. and foreign patents, trademarks, copyrights and trade secrets and we license or otherwise obtain access to various intellectual property rights of third parties. the u.s. government and certain foreign governments hold licenses or other rights to certain intellectual property that we develop in performance of government contracts, and at times seek to use or authorize others to use such intellectual property, including in competition with us and including where we do not believe they are entitled to do so. governments continue to increase efforts to assert or obtain more extensive rights in intellectual property, which could reduce our ability to develop, protect and exploit certain of our intellectual property rights and to compete. governments also decline at times to make intellectual property of others available to us under acceptable terms.
we rely significantly upon proprietary technology, information, processes and know-how. we typically seek to protect this information, including by entering into intellectual property agreements with our employees and other parties such as consultants, teammates and subcontractors. these agreements and other measures may not provide adequate protection for our trade secrets and other proprietary information. in the event of an infringement of such intellectual property rights, a breach of a confidentiality agreement, a misuse or theft of our intellectual property or divulgence of proprietary information, we may not have adequate legal remedies. in addition, our trade secrets or other proprietary information may otherwise become known or be independently developed by competitors.
in some instances, our ability to win or perform contracts requires us to use third party intellectual property. this may require the government or our customer to provide rights to such third party intellectual property, or that we are able to negotiate directly with third parties to obtain necessary rights on reasonable terms. that may not be practicable.
our intellectual property is subject to challenge, invalidation, misappropriation or circumvention by third parties. our access to and use of intellectual property licensed or otherwise obtained from third parties is also subject to challenges. litigation to determine the scope of intellectual property rights, even if ultimately successful, could be costly and could divert management's attention. moreover, the laws concerning intellectual property rights vary among countries and the protection provided to our intellectual property by foreign laws and courts may not be favorable.
if we are unable adequately to exploit our intellectual property rights, to protect our intellectual property rights, to obtain rights to intellectual property of others, it could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, ability to compete for and perform on contracts, financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows.
•our insurance coverage, customer indemnifications or other liability protections may be unavailable or inadequate to cover all of our significant risks, which could adversely affect our profitability and overall financial position.
we endeavor to obtain insurance from financially solid, responsible, highly rated counterparties in established markets to cover significant risks and liabilities (including, for example, natural disasters, space launches and on-orbit operations, cyber security, hazardous operations, energetics and products liability). not every risk or liability can be insured, and insurance coverage is not always reasonably available. the policy limits and terms of coverage reasonably obtainable may not be sufficient to cover actual losses or liabilities. for example, the space and property insurance markets are experiencing increased price volatility and capacity constraint. due to recent increases in the frequency and severity of losses, insurers are decreasing limits, increasing pricing and some may exit the market. even if insurance coverage is available, we are not always able to obtain it at a price or on terms acceptable to us or without increasing exclusions. disputes with insurance carriers over the availability of coverage, and the insolvency of one or more of our insurers has affected and may continue to affect the availability or timing of recovery, as well as our ability to obtain insurance coverage at reasonable rates in the future. in some circumstances we may be entitled to certain legal protections or indemnifications from our customers through contractual provisions, laws or otherwise. however, these protections are not always available, are difficult to negotiate and obtain, are typically subject to certain terms or limitations, including the availability of funds, and may not be sufficient to cover our losses or liabilities. if insurance coverage, customer indemnifications and/or other legal protections are not available or are not sufficient to cover risks or losses, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows.
•pension and other postretirement benefit (opb) obligations and related expenses and funding requirements may fluctuate significantly depending upon investment performance of plan assets, changes in actuarial assumptions, and legislative or other regulatory actions.
northrop grumman corporation the company's pension and opb obligations and related expenses are dependent upon the investment performance of plan assets and various assumptions, including discount rates, mortality and the estimated long-term rates of return on plan assets. changes in assumptions associated with our pension and opb plans, investment performance of plan assets, and gains or losses associated with changes in valuation of marketable securities related to our non-qualified plans and other non-operating assets could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows.
funding requirements for our pension plans, including pension benefit guaranty corporation premiums, are subject to legislative and other government regulatory actions. in accordance with government regulations, pension plan cost recoveries under our u.s. government contracts may occur in different periods from when they are recognized for financial statement purposes or when pension funding is made. these timing differences, as well as government challenges to pension and opb cost recovery, could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows.
•business investments and/or recorded goodwill and other long-lived assets may become impaired, resulting in substantial losses and write-downs that would reduce our operating income.
goodwill is an intangible asset that we recognize in connection with acquisitions of third-party businesses. goodwill accounts for approximately 38 percent of our total assets as of december 31, 2023. other long-lived assets principally comprise property, plant and equipment (pp&e) used in operating our business. the cost of pp&e utilized in support of our commercial business, including approximately $500 million of pp&e used in our commercial space business, is not allocable to government contracts and is therefore subject to greater recoverability risk than pp&e utilized in support of our u.s. government contracts. although the fair value of our reporting units and the net realizable value of our other long-lived assets currently exceed their respective carrying values, changes in business conditions, the market-based inputs used in our goodwill impairment test, or our assumptions related to the recoverability of our long-lived assets, could result in significant write-offs of goodwill or other long-lived assets, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and/or results of operations.
item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the following discussion should be read along with the financial statements included in this form 10-k, as well as part ii, "item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" of our form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2022 ("2022 annual report on form 10-k").
global security environment the u.s. and its allies continue to face a global security environment of heightened tensions and instability, threats from state and non-state actors, including in particular major global powers, as well as terrorist organizations, increasing nuclear tensions, diverse regional security concerns and political instability. the market for defense products, services and solutions globally is driven by these complex and evolving security challenges, considered in the broader context of political and socioeconomic circumstances and priorities. our operations and financial performance, as well as demand for our products and services, are impacted by global events, including violence and unrest. the same is true for our suppliers and other business partners.
the conflict in ukraine has increased global tensions and instability, highlighted threats and increased global demand, as well as further disrupted global supply chains. we continue to not anticipate significant adverse financial impacts directly from the ongoing conflict. we have experienced, and, while difficult to predict, may continue to experience a modest increase in demand for certain of our goods and services directly and indirectly related to the conflict in ukraine, either through direct sales or if the u.s. provides increased military assistance and support to ukraine.
more recently, the hostilities in israel and the gaza strip have further heightened global tensions and instability. at this time, it is unknown whether hostilities in this region will escalate into an even larger conflict. the demand for our goods and services may increase, especially if the u.s. provides increased military assistance and support to israel. we do not have a significant business presence in the region, and therefore do not anticipate significant adverse financial impacts directly from the current conflict.
more broadly, the ongoing conflicts in ukraine and israel and threats elsewhere, particularly in the pacific region, have heightened tensions and highlighted security requirements globally, including europe, the middle east and the pacific region, as well as the u.s. these conflicts may result in increased demand for defense products and services from allies and partner nations, particularly in those areas. we are actively exploring both opportunities and risks associated with the broader global security environment.
we believe the current global security environment highlights the significant national security threats to the u.s. and its allies, and the need for strong deterrence and a robust defense capability. we believe our capabilities, particularly in space, c4isr, missile defense, battle management, advanced weapons, and survivable aircraft and mission systems should help our customers in the u.s. and globally defend against current and future threats and, as a result, continue to allow for long-term profitable business growth.
global economic environment the global economic environment has experienced extraordinary challenges, including high rates of inflation and inflationary pressures; widespread delays and disruptions in supply chains; business slowdowns or shutdowns; workforce challenges and labor shortfalls; and market volatility. some of these challenges were due, in part, to the global health emergency caused by covid-19, which the world health organization declared ended in may 2023. direct impacts of covid-19 on our business during 2023 were limited, and we are not currently expecting significant direct impacts on our business going forward.
the macroeconomic factors have contributed, and we expect will continue to contribute, to increased costs, delays, disruptions and other performance challenges, as well as increased competing demands for limited resources to address such increased costs and other challenges, for our company, our suppliers and partners, and our customers.
we continue to work hard to mitigate challenges caused by the current macroeconomic environment on our business, including by taking steps to support our suppliers and small businesses and enhancing our workforce through extensive hiring, development and retention efforts. however, the broader macroeconomic environment, including inflationary pressures and supply chain challenges, continued adversely to affect the company's results for the year ended december 31, 2023. we cannot clearly predict how long these macroeconomic challenges will continue, how they will change over time, or what additional resources will be available, but we expect to see this challenging macroeconomic environment continue adversely to impact the global economy, our customers and suppliers, our industry and our company in 2024.
northrop grumman corporation in addition, increased interest rates, raising the cost of borrowing for governments, could further impact government spending priorities (in the u.s. and allied countries, in particular), including their demand for defense products. economic tensions and changes in international trade policies, including higher tariffs on imported goods and materials and renegotiation of free trade agreements, could also further impact the global market for defense products, services and solutions.
u.s. political, budget and regulatory environment the u.s. continues to face an uncertain and evolving political, budget and regulatory environment. in particular, it is difficult to predict the specific course of future defense budgets. current and future requirements related to the conflicts in ukraine and israel, threats in the pacific regions and other security priorities, as well as global inflation, the national debt, and other domestic priorities, among other things, in the u.s. and globally, will continue to impact our customers' budgets, spending and priorities, and our industry. the u.s. political environment, including the u.s. election cycle, may also impact defense budgets and priorities, issues related to the national debt, and government spending more broadly. we anticipate that issues related to budgetary priorities and defense spending levels, the debt ceiling, and the spending caps imposed by the fiscal responsibility act of 2023 (fra), particularly with respect to discretionary spending, will continue to be a subject of considerable debate, with a potentially significant impact on our programs and the company.
annual appropriations to fund the federal government for fy 2024 have not been enacted. congress continues to pass short-term continuing resolutions (cr) to fund the federal government. the most recent "laddered" cr passed in january 2024 funds the government through march 2024, depending on the appropriation bill. if congress does not pass full year appropriations or an additional cr before current funding expires, the federal government (or select departments) could face a shutdown and cease what are characterized as certain non-essential operations. depending on the nature and duration of a potential shutdown, businesses that rely on government funding, including defense contractors, could be significantly impacted. if the federal government remains under a cr at the end of april 2024, the one percent discretionary spending cuts under the fra could be triggered, potentially resulting in lower funding on the programs in which we participate.
the political environment, federal budget, debt ceiling and regulatory environment are expected to continue to be the subject of considerable debate, especially in light of the ongoing conflicts and heightened global tensions, the inflationary environment and political tensions. the results of those debates could have material impacts on defense spending broadly and the company's programs in particular. we anticipate that the broader macroeconomic environment, with ongoing inflationary pressures, pockets of labor challenges, and supply chain disruption, among other considerations, will continue to play a significant role in the outcome of these debates and, in turn, on our industry and company.

ground-based strategic deterrent ("gbsd" or "sentinel") program nunn-mccurdy breach review due in part to the impact of macroeconomic factors, in january 2024 the customer provided congressional notification that the sentinel program is currently under a nunn-mccurdy breach review, which is required when total program cost estimates exceed certain defined thresholds. this notification, which has been driven primarily by increases in construction and procurement cost projections for the production and deployment phases, commences the process to achieve recertification for continuance of the program and update its baseline cost estimates. we are currently executing under a cost-type contract for the engineering and manufacturing development phase, and the production and deployment phases are yet to be priced and negotiated. we are continuing to partner with our customer to address this critical mission. for more information, see "risk factors".
disposition of it and mission support services business effective january 30, 2021 (the "divestiture date"), we completed the sale of our it and mission support services business (the "it services divestiture") for $3.4 billion in cash and recorded a pre-tax gain of $2.0 billion. the it and mission support services business was comprised of the majority of the former information solutions and services (is&s) division of defense systems (excluding the vinnell arabia business); select cyber, intelligence and missions support programs, which were part of the former cyber and intelligence mission solutions (cims) division of mission systems; and the former space technical services business unit of space systems. operating results include sales and operating income for the it and mission support services business prior to the divestiture
northrop grumman corporation date; therefore, no sales and operating income were recognized for this business during the years ended december 31, 2023 and 2022. the company recorded sales of $162 million and pre-tax profit of $20 million for the it and mission support services business during the year ended december 31, 2021.
operating performance assessment and reporting we manage and assess our business based on our performance on contracts and programs (typically larger contracts or two or more closely-related contracts). we recognize sales from our portfolio of long-term contracts as control is transferred to the customer, primarily over time on a cost-to-cost basis (cost incurred relative to costs estimated at completion). as a result, sales tend to fluctuate in concert with costs incurred across our large portfolio of contracts. due to the applicable far and cas requirements that govern our u.s. government business, most types of costs are allocable to u.s. government contracts. as such, we do not focus on individual cost groupings (such as manufacturing, engineering and design labor, subcontractor, material, overhead and general and administrative (g&a) costs), as much as we do on total contract cost, which is the key driver of our sales and operating income.
in evaluating our operating performance, we primarily focus on changes in sales and operating margin rates. where applicable, significant fluctuations in operating performance attributable to individual contracts or programs, or changes in a specific cost element across multiple contracts, are described in our analysis. based on this approach and the nature of our operations, the discussion of results of operations below first focuses on our four segments before distinguishing between products and services. changes in sales are generally described in terms of volume, while changes in operating margin rates are generally described in terms of performance and/or contract mix. for purposes of this discussion, volume generally refers to increases or decreases in sales or cost from production/service activity levels and performance generally refers to non-volume-related changes in profitability, which are typically described in terms of changes in net eac adjustments. contract mix generally refers to changes in the ratio of contract type and/or life cycle (e.g., cost-type, fixed-price, development, production, and/or sustainment).
consolidated operating results for purposes of the operating results discussion below, we assess our performance using certain financial measures that are not calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america ("gaap" or "fas").
mark-to-market adjusted net earnings (mtm-adjusted net earnings) and mtm-adjusted earnings per share (mtm-adjusted eps) exclude mtm pension and opb (expense)/benefit and related tax impacts, which are generally only recognized during the fourth quarter. transaction-adjusted net earnings and transaction-adjusted earnings per share (transaction-adjusted eps) exclude the mtm impacts noted above, as well as impacts related to the it services divestiture, including the gain on sale of the business, associated federal and state income tax expenses, transaction costs, and the make-whole premium for early debt redemption. these non-gaap measures may be useful to investors and other users of our financial statements as supplemental measures in evaluating the company's underlying financial performance by presenting the company's operating results before the non-operational impact of pension and opb actuarial gains and losses, and with regard to transaction-adjusted net earnings and eps, the impact of certain divestiture activity. these measures are also consistent with how management views the underlying performance of the business as the impact of mtm accounting and the it services divestiture are not considered in management's assessment of the company's operating performance or in its determination of incentive compensation awards.
we reconcile these non-gaap financial measures to their most directly comparable gaap financial measures below. these non-gaap measures may not be defined and calculated by other companies in the same manner and should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to operating results presented in accordance with gaap.

2023 operating income decreased $1.1 billion, or 30 percent, primarily due to a $1.56 billion charge on the b-21 program at aeronautics systems, partially offset by higher operating income at space systems and defense systems. the b-21 charge relates to the low-rate initial production (lrip) phase of the program and is due principally to a change in our assumptions regarding funding to mitigate the impact of macroeconomic disruptions on the program and higher projected manufacturing costs that reflect recent supplier negotiations and our experience in completing the first aircraft. the decrease was also offset by $311 million of lower unallocated corporate expense, largely due to higher deferred state tax benefits associated with the mtm adjustment and b-21 charge and lower intangible asset amortization and pp&e step-up depreciation, as well as a $118 million reduction in the fas/cas operating adjustment. 2023 operating margin rate declined to 6.5 percent from 9.8 percent reflecting the items above.
2023 g&a costs as a percentage of sales decreased to 10.2 percent from 10.6 percent, primarily due to higher sales, which more than offset our continued investments for future business opportunities.

federal and foreign income taxes the 2023 effective tax rate (etr) decreased to 12.4 percent from 16.1 percent in 2022 primarily due to lower earnings before income taxes as a result of the b-21 charge and mtm expense, which collectively reduced the 2023 etr by 3.8 percentage points. the 2022 mtm benefit increased the 2022 etr by 1.2 percentage points. see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.

aeronautics systems aeronautics systems is a leader in the design, development, production, integration, sustainment and modernization of military aircraft systems for the u.s. air force, the u.s. navy, other u.s. government agencies, and international customers. major products include strategic long-range strike aircraft; tactical fighter and air dominance aircraft; airborne battle management and command and control systems; and unmanned autonomous aircraft systems, including high-altitude long-endurance (hale) strategic intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (isr) systems and vertical take-off and landing (vtol) tactical isr systems.
defense systems defense systems is a leader in the design, development, integration and production of advanced tactical weapons and missile defense solutions, and a provider of sustainment, modernization and training services for manned and unmanned aircraft and electronics systems for the u.s. military and a broad range of international customers. major products and services include integrated, all-domain command and control (c2) battle management systems, precision strike weapons; advanced propulsion, including high speed air-breathing and hypersonic systems; high-performance gun systems, ammunition, precision munitions and advanced fuzes; aircraft and mission systems logistics support, sustainment, operations and modernization; and warfighter training.
2023 sales increased $283 million, or 5 percent, primarily due to higher volume on several programs, including ammunition programs, guided multiple launch rocket system (gmlrs), an international training program, hypersonic attack cruise missile (hacm), and stand-in attack weapon (siaw).
2023 operating income increased $46 million, or 7 percent, due to higher sales and a higher operating margin rate. operating margin rate increased to 12.1 percent from 11.9 percent primarily due to the write-down of an unconsolidated joint venture investment in the prior year.
mission systems mission systems is a leader in advanced mission solutions and multifunction systems, primarily for the u.s. defense and intelligence community, and international customers. major products and services include command, control, communications and computers, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (c4isr) systems; radar, electro-optical/infrared (eo/ir) and acoustic sensors; electronic warfare systems; advanced communications and network systems; full spectrum cyber solutions; intelligence processing systems; advanced microelectronics; navigation and positioning sensors; and maritime power, propulsion and payload launch systems.
2023 operating income decreased $9 million, or 1 percent, due to a lower operating margin rate, which more than offset higher sales. operating margin rate decreased to 14.8 percent from 15.6 percent primarily due to a prior year $33 million benefit recognized in connection with a contract-related legal matter, as well as changes in contract mix toward more cost-type content.
space systems space systems is a leader in delivering end-to-end mission solutions through the design, development, integration, production and operation of space, missile defense, launch and strategic missile systems for national security, civil government, commercial and international customers. major products include satellites and spacecraft systems, subsystems, sensors and payloads; ground systems; missile defense systems and interceptors; launch vehicles and related propulsion systems; and strategic missiles.
2023 sales increased $1.7 billion, or 14 percent, primarily due to higher volume on restricted programs and ramp-up on development programs, including increases of $426 million on the ground based strategic deterrent (gbsd) program, $333 million on the next-generation overhead persistent infrared polar (nextgen polar) program, $219 million on the next generation interceptor (ngi) program, $119 million on the space development agency (sda) tranche 1 tracking layer program and $102 million on the sda tranche 2 transport layer program. these increases were partially offset by a $172 million decrease for commercial resupply services (crs) missions and a $109 million decrease on the habitation and logistics outpost (halo) program.
2023 operating income increased $54 million, or 5 percent, due to higher sales, partially offset by a lower operating margin rate. operating margin rate decreased to 8.7 percent from 9.4 percent primarily due to a prior year $96 million gain recognized in connection with a land exchange transaction, as well as lower net eac adjustments driven by $100 million of unfavorable eac adjustments on the halo program in 2023. these decreases were partially offset by a $42 million benefit from insurance recoveries in our commercial space business during 2023.
2023 product sales increased $2.4 billion, or 8 percent, due to an increase in product sales at all four sectors. the increase was principally driven by higher volume on restricted programs, gbsd and ngi at space systems, higher restricted sales at mission systems and aeronautics systems, and higher volume on ammunition programs, gmlrs, ibcs and hacm at defense systems.
2023 product costs increased $4.0 billion, or 16 percent, consistent with the higher product sales described above and reflect a lower operating margin rate principally due to the previously described $1.56 billion charge on the b-21 program at aeronautics systems and lower net eac adjustments on space systems production programs.
2023 service costs increased $180 million, or 3 percent, consistent with the higher service sales described above and reflects a higher operating margin rate on space systems service programs.
backlog backlog represents the future sales we expect to recognize on firm orders received by the company and is equivalent to the company's remaining performance obligations at the end of each period. it comprises both funded backlog (firm orders for which funding is authorized and appropriated) and unfunded backlog. unexercised contract options and indefinite delivery indefinite quantity (idiq) contracts are not included in backlog until the time the option or idiq task order is exercised or awarded. backlog is converted into sales as costs are incurred or deliveries are made.
2023 net awards totaled $44.8 billion. significant 2023 new awards include $15.5 billion for restricted programs (primarily at space systems, aeronautics systems and mission systems), $2.1 billion for f-35 programs (primarily at aeronautics systems and mission systems), $1.7 billion for e-2, $1.5 billion for triton, $1.4 billion for sda tranche 2 transport layer, and $0.8 billion for gmlrs.
liquidity and capital resources we are focused on the efficient conversion of operating income into cash to provide for the company's material cash requirements, including working capital needs, satisfaction of contractual commitments, funding of our pension and opb plans, investment in our business through capital expenditures, and shareholder return through dividend payments and share repurchases.
as of december 31, 2023, we had cash and cash equivalents of $3.1 billion; $277 million was held outside of the u.s. by foreign subsidiaries. we expect cash and cash equivalents and cash generated from operating activities, supplemented by borrowings under credit facilities, commercial paper and/or in the capital markets through our shelf registration with the sec, if needed, to be sufficient to provide liquidity to the company in the short-term and long-term. the company has a five-year senior unsecured credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of $2.5 billion, and in april 2023, we renewed our one-year $500 million uncommitted credit facility. at december 31, 2023, there were no borrowings outstanding under these credit facilities. in february 2023, we issued $2.0 billion of unsecured senior notes for general corporate purposes, including debt repayment, share repurchases and working capital.
the company's principal contractual commitments include purchase obligations, repayments of long-term debt and related interest, and payments under operating leases. at december 31, 2023, we had $20.7 billion of purchase obligations, approximately half of which is short-term. purchase obligations are largely comprised of open purchase order commitments to suppliers and subcontractors under u.s. government contracts. in most circumstances, our risk associated with the purchase obligations on our u.s. government contracts is limited to the termination liability provisions within those contracts. as such, we do not believe they represent a material liquidity risk to the company. at december 31, 2023, we had capital expenditure commitments of $1.4 billion, which we expect to satisfy with cash on hand. we also had provisions for uncertain tax positions of $2.0 billion, some or all of which could result in future cash payments to various taxing authorities. at this time, we are unable to estimate the timing and amount of any future cash outflows related to these uncertain tax positions.
refer to the respective notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information about our share repurchase programs (note 3), commercial paper, credit facilities and long-term debt (note 10), standby letters of
northrop grumman corporation credit and guarantees (note 12), future minimum contributions for the company's pension and opb plans (note 13), and lease payment obligations (note 15).
beginning in 2022, the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 ("tcja") eliminated the option to deduct research and development expenditures in the current year and requires taxpayers to amortize them over five years pursuant to irc section 174. our 2022 cash from operations were reduced by approximately $900 million for federal estimated tax payments we made related to section 174. as we finalized our 2022 federal tax return along with our continued analysis of research and development expenditures, we reduced the previously estimated impact of section 174 on our tax liability for 2022 and 2023 to approximately $700 million and $500 million, respectively. congress is considering legislation that would defer the amortization requirement to later years, possibly with retroactive effect. in the meantime, we expect to continue to make additional federal tax payments based on the current section 174 tax law. the impact of section 174 on our cash from operations depends on the amount of research and development expenditures incurred by the company and whether the irs issues guidance on the provision which differs from our current interpretation, among other things.
cash flow measures in addition to our cash position, we consider various cash flow measures in capital deployment decision-making, including cash provided by operating activities and adjusted free cash flow, a non-gaap measure described in more detail below.

(1)includes depreciation and amortization, non-cash lease expense, mtm (expense) benefit, stock based compensation expense, deferred income taxes and net periodic pension and opb income.
2023 cash provided by operating activities increased $974 million, or 34 percent, principally due to improved trade working capital largely driven by increased billings and cash collections, partially offset by higher supplier payments.
adjusted free cash flow adjusted free cash flow, as reconciled in the table below, is a non-gaap measure defined as net cash provided by or used in operating activities, less capital expenditures, plus proceeds from the sale of equipment to a customer (not otherwise included in net cash provided by or used in operating activities) and the after-tax impact of discretionary pension contributions, if any. adjusted free cash flow includes proceeds from the sale of equipment to a customer as such proceeds were generated in a customer sales transaction. it also includes the after-tax impact of discretionary pension contributions for consistency and comparability of financial performance. this measure may not be defined and calculated by other companies in the same manner. we use adjusted free cash flow as a key factor in our planning for, and consideration of, acquisitions, the payment of dividends and stock repurchases. this non-gaap measure may be useful to investors and other users of our financial statements as a supplemental measure of our cash performance, but should not be considered in isolation, as a measure of residual cash flow available for discretionary purposes, or as an alternative to operating cash flows presented in accordance with gaap.
northrop grumman corporation the table below reconciles net cash provided by operating activities to adjusted free cash flow:
net cash provided by operating activities                         $3,875                      $2,901                      $3,567                     34   %                  (19)   %

2023 adjusted free cash flow increased $479 million, or 30 percent, principally due to higher net cash provided by operating activities, partially offset by an increase in capital expenditures.
2023 net cash used in investing activities increased $341 million principally due to higher capital expenditures. proceeds from the sale of minority investments in 2023 were largely offset by cash received in 2022 from the sale of equipment to a customer.
2023 net cash used in financing activities decreased $852 million principally due to the issuance of $2.0 billion in long-term debt, partially offset by $1.05 billion in debt repayments. cash returned to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends totaled $2.6 billion in each period.
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with gaap, which requires us to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements. we employ judgment in making our estimates in consideration of historical experience, currently available information and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. actual results could differ from our estimates and assumptions, and any such differences could be material to our consolidated financial statements. we believe the following accounting policies are critical to the understanding of our consolidated financial statements and require the use of significant management judgment in their application. for a summary of our significant accounting policies, see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements.
revenue recognition due to the long-term nature of our contracts, we generally recognize revenue over time using the cost-to-cost method, which requires us to make reasonably dependable estimates regarding the revenue and cost associated with the design, manufacture and delivery of our products and services.
contract sales may include estimates of variable consideration, including cost or performance incentives (such as award and incentive fees), un-priced change orders, reas and contract claims. variable consideration is included in total estimated sales to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved. we estimate variable consideration as the most likely amount to which we expect to be entitled.
our cost estimation process is based on the professional knowledge of our engineering, program management and financial professionals, and draws on their significant experience and judgment. we prepare eacs for our contracts and calculate an estimated contract profit based on total estimated contract sales and cost. since our contracts often span a period of several years, estimation of revenue, cost, and progress toward completion requires the use of judgment. factors considered in these estimates include our historical performance, the availability, productivity and cost of labor, the nature and complexity of work to be performed, the effect of change orders, availability and cost of materials, components and subcontracts, the effect of any delays in performance and the level of indirect cost allocations.
we also consider the impact of macroeconomic factors on our estimates, in particular on contract eacs that span several years. for example, during 2023, we included in our eacs management's best estimate of the impact inflation has had and may continue to have on our contracts. we also included our current best estimate of the impact on our eacs of disruptions we have experienced and continue to experience in the supply chain. the volatility of the recent macroeconomic environment has added complexity to our estimation process and may result in our year end 2023 contract eacs having more variability in the future than they might otherwise have had if the estimates had been prepared in a more stable macroeconomic environment.
northrop grumman corporation we generally review and reassess our sales, cost and profit estimates for each significant contract at least annually or more frequently as determined by the occurrence of events, changes in circumstances and evaluations of contract performance to reflect the latest reliable information available. these assessments require judgments and estimates that can be affected by any number of these factors over time, which may cause actual results to differ materially from those estimates as facts and circumstances change or become known to us.
the company performs on a broad portfolio of long-term contracts, including the development of complex and customized military platforms and systems, as well as advanced electronic equipment and software, that often include technology at the forefront of science. cost estimates on fixed-price development contracts and early-stage/low-rate production contracts are inherently more uncertain as to future events than on mature, full-rate production contracts. as a result, there is typically more variability in those estimates and greater financial risk associated with unanticipated cost growth on fixed-price development contracts and early-stage/low-rate production contracts. changes in estimates occur for a variety of reasons, including changes in contract scope, the resolution of risk at lower or higher cost than anticipated, unanticipated performance and other risks affecting contract costs, performance issues with subcontractors or suppliers, changes in indirect cost allocations, such as overhead and g&a costs, and changes in estimated award and incentive fees. identified risks typically include technical, schedule and/or performance risk based on our evaluation of the contract effort. similarly, the changes in estimates may include changes in, or resolution of, identified opportunities for operating margin improvement.
retirement benefits overview - the determination of projected benefit obligations, the fair value of plan assets, and pension and opb expense for our retirement benefit plans requires the use of estimates and actuarial assumptions. we perform an annual review of our actuarial assumptions in consultation with our actuaries. when we determine changes in the assumptions are warranted, or as a result of plan amendments, future pension and opb expense and our projected benefit obligation could increase or decrease materially. the principal estimates and assumptions that have a significant effect on our consolidated financial position and annual results of operations are the discount rate, cash balance crediting rate, expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, estimated fair market value of plan assets, and the mortality rate of those covered by our pension and opb plans. the effects of actual results differing from our assumptions and the effects of changing assumptions (i.e., actuarial gains or losses) are recognized immediately through earnings upon annual remeasurement in the fourth quarter, or on an interim basis as triggering events warrant remeasurement.
discount rate - the discount rate represents the interest rate used to determine the present value of future cash flows currently expected to be required to settle our pension and opb obligations. the discount rate is generally based on the yield of high-quality corporate fixed-income investments. at the end of each year, we determine the discount rate using a theoretical bond portfolio model of bonds rated aa or better to match the notional cash outflows related to projected benefit payments for each of our significant benefit plans. taking into consideration the factors noted above, our weighted-average composite pension discount rate was 5.15 percent at december 31, 2023 and 5.54 percent at december 31, 2022.
the effects of a hypothetical change in the discount rate may be nonlinear and asymmetrical for future years as the discount rate changes. holding all other assumptions constant, an increase or decrease of 25 basis points in the december 31, 2023 discount rate assumption would have the following estimated effects on 2023 pension and opb obligations, which would be reflected in the 2023 mtm expense (benefit), and 2024 expected pension and opb expense:
2023 pension and opb obligation and mtm expense (benefit)                      $866                                          $(827)
2024 pension and opb (benefit) expense                      (23)                22
northrop grumman corporation cash balance crediting rate - a portion of the company's pension obligation and resulting pension expense is based on a cash balance formula, where participants' hypothetical account balances are accumulated over time with pay-based credits and interest. interest is credited monthly using the current 30-year treasury bond rate. the interest crediting rate is part of the cash balance formula and independent of actual pension investment returns. the cash balance crediting rate used for fas purposes tends to move in concert with the discount rate but has an offsetting effect on pension benefit obligations and the related mtm expense (benefit). the minimum cash balance crediting rate allowed under the plan is 2.25 percent. the cash balance crediting rate assumption has been set to 4.02 percent for all years. holding all other assumptions constant, an increase or decrease of 25 basis points in the december 31, 2023 cash balance crediting rate assumption would have the following estimated effects on the 2023 pension benefit obligation, which would be reflected in the 2023 mtm expense (benefit), and 2024 expected pension expense:
2023 pension obligation and mtm expense (benefit)                    $(105)                                            $108

expected long-term rate of return on plan assets - the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets (eroa) assumption reflects the average rate of net earnings we expect on current and future benefit plan investments. eroa is a long-term assumption, which we review annually and adjust to reflect changes in our long-term view of expected market returns and/or significant changes in our plan asset investment policy. due to the inherent uncertainty of this assumption, we consider multiple data points at the measurement date including the plan's target asset allocation, historical plan asset returns and third party projection models of expected long-term returns for each of the plans' strategic asset classes. in addition to the data points themselves, we consider trends in the data points, including changes from the prior measurement date. the eroa assumptions we use for pension benefits are consistent with those used for opb plans; however, we reduce the eroa for opb plans to allow for the impact of tax on investment earnings, as certain voluntary employee beneficiary association trusts are taxable.
during 2023, the investment committee of the company's benefit plans reviewed the plans' major asset class allocations and approved an update to increase the target fixed-income asset allocation from 40% to 43%. the current asset allocation is now approximately 42% fixed-income, 27% public equities, 28% alternatives and 3% cash. at this time, the investment committee is not planning any significant changes to that mix. for further information on plan asset investments, see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements.
while historical market returns are not necessarily predictive of future market returns, given our long history of plan performance supported by the stability in our investment mix, investment managers, and active asset management, we believe our actual historical performance is a reasonable metric to consider when developing our eroa. our average annual rate of return from 1976 to 2023 was approximately 10.7 percent and our 20-year and 30-year rolling average rates of return were approximately 7.9 percent and 8.7 percent, respectively, each determined on an arithmetic basis and net of expenses. our 2023 return on plan assets, net of expenses, were approximately 11.1 percent.
consistent with our past practice, we obtained long-term capital market forecasting models from several third parties and, using our target asset allocation, developed an expected rate of return on plan assets from each model. we considered not only the specific returns projected by those third party models, but also changes in the models year-to-year when developing our eroa.

northrop grumman corporation in addition, holding all other assumptions constant, an increase or decrease of 100 basis points in actual versus expected return on plan assets would have the following estimated effects on our 2024 mtm expense (benefit):
2024 mtm expense (benefit)                      $305              $(305)
estimated fair market value of plan assets - for certain plan assets where the fair market value is not readily determinable, such as real estate, private equity, hedge funds and opportunistic investments, we develop estimates of fair value using the best information available. estimated fair values on these plan assets are based on redemption values and net asset values (nav), as well as valuation methodologies that include third party appraisals, comparable transactions, discounted cash flow valuation models and public market data.
mortality rate - mortality assumptions are used to estimate life expectancies of plan participants. in october 2014, the society of actuaries retirement plans experience committee (rpec) issued updated mortality tables and a mortality improvement scale, which reflected longer life expectancies than previously projected. in october 2019, the rpec issued an updated mortality base table (the private retirement plans mortality table for 2012 (pri-2012)), which we adopted after reviewing our own historical mortality experience. in october 2021, the rpec released a new projection scale (mp-2021) that included additional underlying data for 2019, which included an increase in life expectancies relative to the prior year.
the rpec did not release a mp-2022 or mp-2023 projection scale citing complexities in incorporating the substantial number of "excess deaths" in 2020 into their existing model and uncertainties about future expectations primarily related to covid-19. as such, after considering the information released by the rpec in october 2021 as well as the company's recent mortality experience, we adopted the full mp-2021 projection scale while continuing to use the pri-2012 white collar table, supplemented with 50% of the gradual wear-off illustration as outlined in the rpec's 2022 mortality improvement update paper to reflect the future impacts of covid-19, to develop our mortality assumptions used in calculating our pension and opb obligations recognized at december 31, 2023, and the amounts estimated for our 2024 pension and opb expense.
litigation, commitments and contingencies we are subject to a range of claims, disputes, enforcement actions, investigations, lawsuits, overhead cost claims, environmental matters, income tax matters and administrative proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business. estimating liabilities and costs associated with these matters requires judgment based upon the professional knowledge and experience of management. we determine whether to record a reserve and, if so, what amount based on consideration of the facts and circumstances of each matter as then known to us. determinations regarding whether to record a reserve and, if so, of what amount, reflect management's assessment regarding what is likely to occur; they do not necessarily reflect what management believes should occur. the ultimate resolution of any such exposure to us may vary materially from earlier estimates as further facts and circumstances develop or become known to us.
environmental matters - we are subject to environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we do or have done business. factors that could result in changes to the assessment of probability, range of reasonably estimated costs and environmental accruals include: modification of planned remedial actions; changes in the estimated time required to conduct remedial actions; discovery of more or less extensive (or different) contamination than anticipated; information regarding the potential causes and effects of contamination; results of efforts to involve other responsible parties; financial capabilities of other responsible parties; changes in laws and regulations, their interpretation or application; contractual obligations affecting remediation or responsibilities; and improvements in remediation technology. as we expect to be able to recover a portion of environmental remediation liabilities through overhead charges on government contracts, such amounts are deferred in prepaid expenses and other current assets (current portion) and other non-current assets until charged to contracts. we use judgment to evaluate the recoverability of our environmental remediation costs, assessing, among other things, u.s. government regulations, our u.s. government contract mix and past practices. portions of the company's environmental liabilities we do not expect to be recoverable have been expensed. as of december 31, 2023, we expect approximately 90 percent of the company's environmental remediation costs to be recoverable; however, to the extent our judgments on the recoverability of our environmental remediation costs change or the unallowable portion of our environmental
northrop grumman corporation remediation costs otherwise increase, there could be a significant impact on our consolidated financial position, annual results of operations and/or cash flows.
income tax matters - the evaluation of tax positions taken in a filed tax return, or planned to be taken in a future tax return or claim, requires the use of judgment. we establish reserves for uncertain tax positions when, despite the belief that our tax positions are supportable, there remains uncertainty in a tax position taken in our filed tax returns or planned to be taken in a future tax return or claim. the company follows a recognition and measurement approach, considering the facts, circumstances, and information available at the reporting date. we exercise judgment in determining the level of evidence necessary and appropriate to support our assessment using all available information. the technical merits of a given tax position are derived from sources of authority in the tax law and their applicability to the facts and circumstances of the position. in measuring the tax position, the company considers the amounts and probabilities of the outcomes that could be realized upon settlement. when it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained, we record the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority. as of december 31, 2023, we have approximately $2.0 billion in unrecognized tax benefits. to the extent we prevail in matters for which reserves have been established or are required to pay amounts in excess of reserves, there could be a significant impact on our consolidated financial position, annual results of operations and/or cash flows.
for further information on litigation, commitments and contingencies, see "risk factors" and note 1, note 7, note 11 and note 12 to the consolidated financial statements.
goodwill and long-lived assets overview - we allocate the purchase price of acquired businesses to the underlying tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their respective fair values, with the excess recorded as goodwill. such fair value assessments require judgments and estimates that can be affected by contract performance and other factors over time, which may cause final amounts to differ materially from original estimates. adjustments to the fair value of purchased assets and liabilities after the initial measurement period are recognized in net earnings.
we record property, plant and equipment (pp&e) for capital assets used in operating our business. the cost of pp&e utilized in support of our government contracts is generally allowable and allocable cost in accordance with applicable far and cas requirements, which limits our risk of impairment on those assets. however, the cost of pp&e utilized in support of our commercial business, including approximately $500 million of pp&e used in our commercial space business, is not allocable to government contracts and is therefore subject to greater recoverability risk.
impairment testing - we test for impairment of goodwill annually at each of our reporting units, which comprise our operating segments. the results of our annual goodwill impairment tests as of december 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, indicated that the estimated fair value of each reporting unit significantly exceeded its respective carrying value. there were no impairment charges recorded in the years ended december 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021.
in addition to performing an annual goodwill impairment test, we may perform an interim impairment test if events occur or circumstances change that suggest goodwill in any of our reporting units may be impaired. such indicators may include, but are not limited to, the loss of significant business, significant reductions in federal government appropriations or other significant adverse changes in industry or market conditions. during 2023, we determined there were no impairment indicators requiring us to perform an interim goodwill impairment test.
when testing goodwill for impairment, we compare the fair values of each of our reporting units to their respective carrying values. to determine the fair value of our reporting units, we primarily use the income approach based on the cash flows we expect the reporting units to generate in the future, consistent with our operating plans. this income valuation method requires management to project sales, operating expenses, working capital, capital spending and cash flows for the reporting units over a multi-year period, as well as to determine the weighted-average cost of capital (wacc) used as a discount rate and terminal value assumptions. the wacc takes into account the relative weights of each component of our consolidated capital structure (equity and debt) and represents the expected cost of new capital adjusted as appropriate to consider lower risk profiles associated with longer-term contracts and barriers to market entry. the terminal value assumptions are applied to the final year of the discounted cash flow model. we use industry multiples (including relevant control premiums) of operating earnings to corroborate the fair values of our reporting units determined under the market valuation method of the income approach.
impairment assessment inherently involves management judgments as to assumptions about expected future cash flows and the impact of market conditions on those assumptions. due to the many variables inherent in developing the estimates used in our impairment analyses, differences in assumptions may have a material effect on the results of those impairment analyses.

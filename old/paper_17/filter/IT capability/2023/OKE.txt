item 1a.    risk factors you should consider carefully the following discussion of risks, as well as all of the other information contained in this annual report. our business, financial conditions, results of operations or prospects could be materially and adversely affected by any of these risks or uncertainties.
our gathering and transportation pipeline systems are dependent upon production from natural gas and crude oil wells, which naturally decline over time. as a result, our cash flows associated with these wells may also decline over time. in order to maintain or increase throughput levels on our gathering and transportation pipeline systems and the asset utilization rates at our processing and fractionation facilities, we must continually obtain new supplies. our ability to maintain or expand our businesses depends largely on the level of drilling and production by third parties in the regions in which we operate. our natural gas and ngl supply volumes may be impacted if producers curtail or redirect drilling and production activities. drilling and production are impacted by factors beyond our control, including:
•producers' access to capital;
•producers' ability to secure drilling and completion crews and equipment;
•producers' desire and ability to obtain necessary permits, drilling rights and surface access in a timely manner and on reasonable terms;
•capacity constraints and/or shutdowns on the pipelines that transport crude oil, natural gas, ngls and refined products from producing areas and our facilities.
commodity prices are subject to significant volatility. drilling and production activity levels may vary across our geographic areas; however, a prolonged period of low commodity prices may reduce drilling and production activities across all areas. if we are not able to obtain new supplies to replace the natural decline in volumes from existing production or reductions in volumes because of competition, throughput on our gathering and transportation pipeline systems and the utilization rates of our processing and fractionation facilities would decline, which could affect adversely our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows.
our operating results may be affected adversely by unfavorable economic and market conditions.
uncertainty or adverse changes in economic conditions worldwide, in the united states, or in the economic regions in which we operate, could negatively affect the crude oil and natural gas markets, resulting in reduced demand and increased price competition for our services and products, or otherwise affect adversely our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows. volatility in commodity prices may have an impact on many of our suppliers and customers, which, in turn, could have a negative impact on their ability to meet their obligations to us. periods of severe volatility in equity and credit markets may disrupt our access to such markets, make it difficult to obtain financing necessary to expand facilities or acquire assets, increase financing costs and result in the imposition of restrictive financial covenants. also, economic conditions in the wake of the pandemic have included increasing inflation. inflationary pressures have resulted in, and may continue to result in, additional increases to the cost of our materials, services and personnel, which could increase our capital expenditures and operating costs. sustained levels of high inflation have caused the federal reserve system and other central banks to increase interest rates, which may cause the cost of capital to increase and depress economic growth, either of which, or the combination of both, could affect adversely our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows.
the volatility of natural gas, ngl, refined products and crude oil prices could affect adversely our earnings and cash flows.
lower commodity prices could reduce crude oil, natural gas and ngl production, which could decrease the demand for our services. additionally, a significant portion of our revenues are derived from the sale of commodities that are received or purchased in conjunction with our gathering, processing, fractionation, transportation and storage services. as commodity table of contents prices decline, we could be paid less for our commodities thereby reducing our cash flows. historically, commodity prices have been volatile and can change quickly. it is likely that commodity prices will continue to be volatile in the future.
the prices we receive for our commodities are subject to wide fluctuations in response to a variety of factors beyond our control, including, but not limited to, the following:
•overall domestic and global economic conditions and uncertainty;
•the occurrence of wars (such as the russian invasion of ukraine), the activities of the organization of petroleum exporting countries (opec) and other non-opec oil producing countries with large production capacity, or other geopolitical conditions (including instability in the middle east) impacting supply and demand for natural gas, ngls, refined products and crude oil;
•the availability and cost of third-party transportation, natural gas processing and fractionation capacity;
•weather conditions;
•the price and availability of alternative fuels;
•speculation in the commodity futures markets;
•the impact of new supplies, new pipelines, processing and fractionation facilities on location price differentials; and
these external factors and the volatile nature of the energy markets make it difficult to reliably estimate future prices of commodities and the impact commodity price fluctuations have on our customers and their need for our services, which could affect adversely our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows.
reduced volatility in energy prices or new government regulations could discourage our storage customers from holding positions in refined products, crude oil and natural gas, which could adversely affect our business.
the demand for the storage services has resulted in part from customers' desire to have the ability to take advantage of profit opportunities created by the volatility in prices of refined products, crude oil and natural gas. periods of prolonged stability or declines in these commodity prices could reduce demand for our storage services. if federal, state or international regulations are passed that discourage our customers from storing these commodities, demand for our storage services could decrease, in which case we may be unable to identify customers willing to contract for such services or be forced to reduce the rates we charge for our services. the realization of any of these risks could adversely affect our business.
we depend on producers, gathering systems, refineries and pipelines owned and operated by others to supply our assets, and any closures, interruptions or reduced activity levels at these facilities may adversely affect our business.
we depend on crude oil production and on connections with gathering systems, refineries and pipelines owned and operated by third parties to supply our assets. we cannot control or predict the amount of product that will be delivered to us by the gathering systems and pipelines that supply our assets, nor can we control or predict the output of refineries that supply our refined products pipelines and terminals. changes in the quality or quantity of this crude oil production, outages at these refineries or reduced or interrupted throughput on gathering systems or pipelines due to weather-related or other natural causes, competitive forces, testing, line repair, damage, reduced operating pressures or other causes could reduce shipments on our pipelines or result in our being unable to receive products at or deliver products from our terminals, any of which could adversely affect our business.
refineries that supply or are supplied by our facilities are subject to regulatory developments, including but not limited to low carbon fuel standards, regulations regarding fuel specifications, plant emissions and safety and security requirements that could significantly increase the cost of their operations and reduce their operating margins. in addition, the profitability of the refineries that supply our facilities is subject to regional and global supply and demand dynamics that are difficult to predict.
there are increasing expectations that companies across all industries address esg issues, including climate change. changes in regulatory policies, public sentiment or widespread adoption of technologies that aim to address climate change through reducing ghg emissions may result in a reduction in the demand for hydrocarbon products, restrictions on their use or increased use of alternative energy sources. these changes could reduce the demand for our services, impacting our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows.
in addition, increasing attention to climate change has resulted in an increased likelihood of governmental investigations, regulation, shareholder activism and private litigation, which could increase our costs or otherwise affect adversely our business. for example, the sec has announced its plans to propose new climate change disclosure requirements. while the form those requirements may take are not final, we may face increased costs associated with complying with any new climate disclosure rules.
certain investors are increasingly focused on esg issues, including climate change. further, organizations that provide information to investors on corporate governance and related matters have also increased their focus on esg issues and have developed ratings processes for evaluating companies on various esg initiatives. unfavorable esg ratings may lead to increased negative investor sentiment toward us or midstream companies in general. due to climate change concerns, some investors may choose not to invest, or to reduce investment, in companies that explore for, produce, process, transport or sell products derived from hydrocarbons. if this negative investor sentiment increases, we may see reduced demand for our securities, which could impact our liquidity or the value of our securities. additionally, certain large institutional lenders have announced their own policies to meet publicly announced climate commitments, which often involve commitments to shift lending activities in the energy sector to meet ghg emissions goals. as a result, certain institutional lenders may impose additional requirements on us, or decide not to lend to us, based on esg concerns, which could adversely affect our access to capital on reasonable terms or at all and, as a result, our financial condition. to the extent financial markets view climate change and emissions of ghgs as a financial risk, this could also negatively affect our ability to access capital or cause us to receive less favorable terms and conditions in future financings.
in 2021, we announced a companywide absolute ghg emissions reduction target of 2.2 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalents from our combined scope 1 and scope 2 emissions by 2030 for our legacy oneok assets. the target represents a 30% reduction in combined operational scope 1 and location-based scope 2 ghg emissions attributable to oneok assets as of december 31, 2019. to the extent that the potential pathways we have identified to achieve this emissions reduction target are not available to us, or to the extent we otherwise are unable to make progress toward other esg-related targets we may establish, we may face additional costs to meet these targets, or we may fail to meet them, which could negatively impact our business and reputation.
we may be subject to risks associated with the physical impacts of climate change.
the threat of global climate change may create physical and financial risks to our business. some of our customers' energy needs vary with weather conditions, primarily temperature. to the extent weather conditions may be affected by climate change, customers' energy use could increase or decrease depending on the duration and magnitude of any changes. increased energy use due to weather changes may require us to invest in more pipelines and other infrastructure to serve increased demand. a decrease in energy use due to weather changes may affect our financial condition, through decreased revenues. extreme weather conditions in general require more system backup, adding to costs, and can contribute to increased system stresses, including damage to our assets or service interruptions. weather conditions outside of our operating territory could also have an impact on our revenues. severe weather impacts our operating territories primarily through hurricanes, thunderstorms, tornados, floods, freezing temperatures and snow or ice storms. to the extent the severity or frequency of extreme weather events increases, this could increase our cost of providing services, including the cost of insurance, and the availability of certain insurance coverages could decrease. we may not be able to pass on the higher costs to our customers or recover all costs related to mitigating these physical risks.
our operations are subject to all the risks and hazards typically associated with the operation of gathering, transportation and distribution pipelines, storage facilities and processing and fractionation facilities, which include, but are not limited to, leaks, pipeline ruptures, damage by third parties, the breakdown or failure of equipment or processes and the performance of facilities below expected levels of capacity and efficiency. other operational hazards and unforeseen interruptions include adverse weather conditions (including extreme cold weather), infectious disease including a pandemic (such as covid-19), cybersecurity attacks, geopolitical reactions, accidents, explosions, fires, the collision of equipment with our pipeline facilities (for example, this may occur if a third party were to perform excavation or construction work near our facilities) and catastrophic events such as tornados, hurricanes, earthquakes, floods and other similar events beyond our control. similar operational hazards and unforeseen interruptions may also impact our producers or suppliers; for example, extreme cold weather can result in supply reductions from producer wellhead freeze-offs, as well as power curtailments or outages. further, the united states government warned that energy assets, specifically the nation's pipeline infrastructure, may be targets of terrorist attacks. an act of terrorism could target our facilities, those of our suppliers or customers or those of other pipelines. a casualty occurrence may result in injury or loss of life, extensive property damage or environmental damage. the occurrence of operational hazards and unforeseen interruptions could affect adversely our business results of operations, financial position and cash flows.
premiums and deductibles for certain insurance policies can increase substantially, and, in some instances, certain insurance may become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage. consequently, we may not be able to renew existing insurance policies or purchase other desirable insurance on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. insurance proceeds may not be adequate to cover all liabilities or incurred costs and losses or lost earnings. further, we are not fully insured against all risks inherent to our business. if we were to incur a significant liability for which we were not fully insured, it could affect adversely our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows. further, the proceeds of any such insurance may not be paid in a timely manner.
production areas outside of our operating regions may compete with natural gas, ngl and crude oil supply originating in production areas connected to our systems, which may cause products in supply areas connected to our systems to be diverted to markets other than our traditional market areas and may affect capacity utilization adversely on our pipeline systems and our ability to renew or replace existing contracts.
we do not hedge fully against commodity price risk or interest rate risk, including commodity price changes, seasonal price differentials, product price differentials or location price differentials. this could result in decreased revenues, increased costs and lower margins, affecting adversely our results of operations.
certain of our businesses are exposed to market risk and the impact of market fluctuations in natural gas, ngl, refined products and crude oil prices. market risk refers to the risk of loss of future cash flows and earnings arising from adverse changes in commodity prices. our primary commodity price exposures arise from:
•the value of the commodities sold under fee with pop contracts of which we retain a portion of the sales proceeds;
•the price risk related to electric costs to operate our facilities; and
to manage the risk from market price fluctuations in natural gas, ngls, refined products and crude oil and electricity prices, we may use derivative instruments such as swaps, futures, forwards and options. however, we do not hedge fully against commodity price changes, and we therefore retain some exposure to market risk. further, hedging instruments that are used to reduce our exposure to interest-rate fluctuations could expose us to risk of financial loss where we may contract for fixed-rate swap instruments to hedge variable-rate instruments and the fixed rate exceeds the variable rate. finally, hedging arrangements for forecasted sales and purchases are used to reduce our exposure to commodity price fluctuations and may limit the benefit we would otherwise receive if market prices for natural gas, ngls, refined products and crude oil differ from the stated price in the hedge instrument for these commodities.
table of contents a breach of information security, including a cybersecurity attack, or failure of one or more key information technology or operational systems, or those of third parties, may affect adversely our operations, financial results or reputation.
our businesses are dependent upon our operational systems to process a large amount of data and complex transactions. the various uses of these information technology systems, networks and services include, but are not limited to:
•controlling our plants and pipelines with industrial control systems including supervisory control and data acquisition;
•complying with regulatory, legal, financial or tax requirements;
•providing data security; and
if any of our systems is damaged, fails to function properly or otherwise becomes unavailable, we may incur substantial costs to repair or replace them and may experience loss or corruption of critical data and interruptions or delays in our ability to perform critical functions, which could affect adversely our business and results of operations. our financial results could also be affected adversely if our operational systems fail as a result of an inadvertent error or by deliberate tampering with or manipulation of our operational systems. in addition, dependence upon automated systems may further increase the risk that operational system flaws or employee or third-party tampering or manipulation of those systems will result in losses that are difficult to detect.
due to increased technology advances and an increase in remote work arrangements, we have become more reliant on technology to help increase efficiency in our businesses. according to experts, there has been a rise in the number and sophistication of cyberattacks on companies' network and information systems by both state-sponsored and criminal organizations and, as a result, the risks associated with such an event continue to increase. a significant failure, compromise, breach or interruption in our systems, or those of our vendors or counterparties, could result in a disruption of our operations, physical or environmental damages, customer dissatisfaction, damage to our reputation and a loss of customers or revenues. if any such failure, interruption or similar event results in the improper disclosure of information maintained in our information systems and networks or those of our vendors and counterparties, including personnel, customer, vendor and counterparty information, we could also be subject to liability under relevant contractual obligations and laws and regulations protecting personal data and privacy. efforts by us and our vendors and counterparties to develop, implement and maintain security measures may not be successful in anticipating, detecting or preventing these events from occurring, due in part to attackers' ever-changing methods and efforts to conceal their activities, and any network and information systems-related events could require us to expend significant resources to identify, assess and remedy such events. cybersecurity, physical security and the continued development and enhancement of our controls, processes and practices designed to protect our enterprise, information systems and data from attack, damage or unauthorized access and to identify and appropriately report cyberattacks, remain a priority for us. although we believe that we have robust information security procedures and other safeguards in place, including sufficient insurance, as cyberthreats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend additional resources to continue to enhance our information security measures and/or to investigate and remediate information security vulnerabilities.
cyberattacks against us or others in our industry could result in additional regulations or cumbersome contractual obligations. current efforts by the federal government, such as the improving critical infrastructure cybersecurity executive order, and the tsa security directives have utilized significant internal and external resources, and any potential future statutes, regulations or orders could lead to further increased regulatory compliance costs, insurance coverage costs or capital expenditures. we cannot predict the potential impact to our business resulting from additional regulations.
growing our business by constructing new pipelines and facilities or making modifications to our existing facilities subjects us to construction risk and supply risks, should adequate natural gas, ngl, refined products and crude oil supply be unavailable upon completion of the facilities.
to expand our business, we regularly construct new and modify or expand existing pipelines and gathering, processing, storage and fractionation facilities. the construction and modification of these facilities may involve the following risks:
•projects may require significant capital expenditures, which may exceed our estimates, and involve numerous regulatory, environmental, political, legal and weather-related uncertainties;
•we may be unable to obtain new rights of way or permits to connect our systems to supply or downstream markets;
•our revenues may not increase immediately upon the expenditure of funds on a particular project. for instance, if we build a new pipeline, the construction will occur over an extended period of time, and we will not receive any material increases in revenues until after completion of the project;
•we may construct facilities to capture anticipated future growth in production or downstream demand in which anticipated growth does not materialize;
•opposition from environmental and social groups, landowners, tribal groups, local groups and other advocates could result in organized protests, attempts to block or sabotage our construction activities or operations, intervention in regulatory or administrative proceedings involving our assets, or lawsuits or other actions designed to prevent, disrupt or delay the construction or operation of our assets;
•we may be required to rely on third parties downstream of our facilities to have available capacity for our delivered natural gas, ngls, refined products and crude oil, which may not be operational; and
as a result, new facilities may not be able to attract enough natural gas, ngls, refined products and crude oil to achieve our expected investment return, which could affect adversely our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows.
we may not be able to accurately estimate hydrocarbon reserves and production volumes expected to be delivered to us for a variety of reasons, including the unavailability of sufficiently detailed information and unanticipated changes in producers' expected drilling schedules. accordingly, we may not have accurate estimates of total reserves committed to our assets, the anticipated life of such reserves or the expected volumes to be produced from those reserves. in such event, if we are unable to secure additional sources, then the volumes that we gather, process, fractionate and transport in the future could be less than anticipated. a decline in such volumes could affect adversely our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows.
we do not own all of the land on which our pipelines and facilities are located, and we lease certain facilities and equipment, which could disrupt our operations.
we do not own all of the land on which certain of our pipelines and facilities are located, and we are, therefore, subject to the risk of increased costs to maintain necessary land use. we obtain the rights to construct and operate certain of our pipelines and related facilities on land owned by third parties and governmental agencies for a specific period of time. our loss of these rights, through our inability to renew right-of-way contracts on acceptable terms or increased costs to renew such rights, could affect adversely our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows.
measurement adjustments on our pipeline systems may be impacted materially by changes in estimation, type of commodity and other factors.
product measurement adjustments occur as part of the normal operating conditions associated with our assets. the quantification and resolution of measurement adjustments are complicated by several factors including: (i) the significant quantities (i.e., thousands) of measurement equipment that we use across our systems, (ii) varying qualities of natural gas in the streams gathered and processed through our systems and the mixed nature of ngls gathered and fractionated; and (iii) variances in measurement that are inherent in metering technologies and standards. each of these factors may contribute to measurement adjustments that may occur on our systems, which could affect adversely our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows.
in the competition for supply, we may have significant levels of excess capacity on our pipeline, processing, fractionation, terminal and storage assets.
our pipeline, processing, fractionation, terminal and storage assets compete with other similar assets for natural gas, ngl, refined products and crude oil supply delivered to the markets we serve. as a result of competition, we may have significant levels of uncontracted or discounted capacity on our assets, which could affect adversely our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows.
many of our assets are designed as long-lived assets. over time the age of these assets could result in increased maintenance or remediation expenditures and an increased risk of product releases and associated costs and liabilities. any significant increase table of contents in these expenditures, costs or liabilities could affect adversely our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows.
we participate in several joint ventures. due to the nature of some of these arrangements, each participant in these joint ventures has made substantial investments in the joint venture and, accordingly, has required that the relevant charter documents contain certain features designed to provide each participant with the opportunity to participate in the management of the joint venture and to protect its investment, as well as any other assets that may be substantially dependent on or otherwise affected by the activities of that joint venture. these participation and protective features customarily include a corporate governance structure that requires at least a majority-in-interest vote to authorize many basic activities and requires a greater voting interest (sometimes up to 100%) to authorize more significant activities. examples of these more significant activities are large expenditures or contractual commitments, the construction or acquisition of assets, borrowing money or otherwise raising capital, transactions with affiliates of a joint-venture participant, litigation and transactions not in the ordinary course of business, among others. thus, without the concurrence of joint-venture participants with enough voting interests, we may be unable to cause any of our joint ventures to take or not to take certain actions, even though those actions may be in the best interest of us or the particular joint venture.
moreover, subject to contractual restrictions, any joint-venture owner generally may sell, transfer or otherwise modify its ownership interest in a joint venture, whether in a transaction involving third parties or the other joint-venture owners. any such transaction could result in our being required to partner with different or additional parties who may have business interests different from ours.
we rely on others to provide administrative, operating and management services for certain of our joint-venture assets. we have a limited ability to control the operations and the associated costs of such operations. the success of these operations depends on a number of factors that are outside our control, including the competence and financial resources of the operator or an outsourced service provider. we may have to contract elsewhere for outsourced services, which may cost more than we are currently paying. in addition, we may not be able to obtain the same level or kind of service or retain or receive the services in a timely manner, which may impact our ability to perform under our contracts and affect adversely our business and results of operations.
our ability to use net operating losses and certain other tax attributes to offset future taxable income may be limited.
we currently have substantial u.s. federal net operating loss ("nol") carry forwards and other state tax attributes. our ability to use these tax attributes to reduce our future u.s. federal and state income tax obligations depends on many factors, including our future taxable income, the timing of which is uncertain. in addition, our ability to use nol carryforwards and other tax attributes may be subject to significant limitations under section 382 of the internal revenue code of 1986, as amended (the "code") and corresponding provisions of state law.
under section 382 of the code and corresponding provisions of state law, if a corporation undergoes an ownership change, which is generally defined as a greater than 50 percent change in its equity ownership over a three-year period, the company's ability to utilize u.s. nol carryforwards and other tax attributes may be limited. determining the limitation under section 382 of the code is highly complex. we believe our u.s. nol carryforwards and other tax attributes are not currently subject to a limitation as a result of an ownership change. however, it is possible that an ownership change may occur in the future, which may materially impact our ability to use our u.s. nol carryforwards and other tax attributes to reduce u.s. federal and state taxable income. such a limitation could affect adversely our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.
table of contents risk factors related to regulation increased regulation of exploration and production activities, including hydraulic fracturing, well setbacks and disposal of wastewater, could result in reductions or delays in drilling and completing new crude oil and natural gas wells.
the crude oil and natural gas industries are relying increasingly on supplies from nonconventional sources, such as shale and tight sands. crude oil and natural gas extracted from these sources frequently requires hydraulic fracturing, which involves the pressurized injection of water, sand and chemicals into a geologic formation to stimulate crude oil and natural gas production. legislation or regulations placing restrictions on exploration and production activities, including hydraulic fracturing and disposal of wastewater, could result in operational delays, increased operating costs and additional regulatory burdens on exploration and production operators. any of these factors could reduce their production of crude oil and unprocessed natural gas and, in turn, affect adversely our revenues and results of operations by decreasing the volumes of crude oil, natural gas and ngls gathered, treated, processed, fractionated, stored and transported on our or our joint ventures' assets.
•regulatory approval and review of certain of our rates, operating terms and conditions of service;
•construction and operation of new facilities;
•the integrity, safety and security of facilities and operations;
•acquisition, extension or abandonment of services or facilities;
•relationships with affiliate companies involved in all aspects of our business.
compliance with these requirements can be costly and burdensome. future changes to laws, regulations and policies in these areas may impair our ability to compete for business or to recover costs and may increase the cost and burden of our operations. we cannot guarantee that state or federal regulators will not challenge our safety practices or will authorize any projects or acquisitions that we may propose in the future. moreover, there can be no guarantee that, if granted, any such authorizations will be made in a timely manner or will be free from potentially burdensome conditions.
under the natural gas act, which is applicable to our interstate natural gas pipelines, and the interstate commerce act, which is applicable to our interstate refined products, crude oil and ngl pipelines, our interstate transportation rates are regulated by the ferc and many changes to our pipeline tariffs must be approved in a regulatory proceeding. additionally, shippers, the ferc and/or state regulatory agencies may investigate our tariff rates which could result in, among other things, our being ordered to reduce rates or make refunds to shippers.
failure to comply with all applicable state or federal statutes, rules and regulations and orders could bring substantial penalties and fines.
rate regulation, challenges by shippers of the rates we charge for transportation on our pipelines or changes in the jurisdictional characterization of our assets or activities by federal, state or local regulatory agencies may reduce the amount of cash we generate.
the ferc regulates the rates we can charge and the terms and conditions we can offer for interstate transportation service on our pipelines. state regulatory authorities regulate the rates we can charge and the terms and conditions we can offer for intrastate movements on our pipelines. the determination of the interstate or intrastate character of shipments on our pipelines may change over time, which may change the regulatory framework and the rates we are allowed to charge for transportation and other related services. shippers may protest our pipeline tariff filings, and the ferc or state regulatory authorities may investigate and require changes to tariff terms as a result of the protests or complaints. further, the ferc may order refunds of amounts collected under interstate rates that are determined to be in excess of a just and reasonable level. state regulatory authorities could take similar measures for intrastate tariffs. in addition, shippers may challenge by complaint the lawfulness of tariff rates that have become final and effective. if existing rates are determined to be in excess of a just and reasonable level, we could be required to pay refunds to shippers, reduce rates and make other concessions.
table of contents the ferc's ratemaking methodologies may limit our ability to increase rates by amounts sufficient to reflect our actual cost or may delay the use of rates that reflect increased costs. we use the ferc's indexing methodology to establish our rates in approximately 30% of the markets serviced by our refined products pipelines. the ferc's indexing methodology is based on changes in the producer price index for finished goods combined with an index adjustment. the methodology is subject to review every five years and currently allows a pipeline to change its rates each year to a new ceiling level. when the change in the ceiling level is negative, we are generally required to reduce our rates that are subject to the ferc's indexing methodology.
the ferc and most relevant state regulatory authorities allow us to establish rates based on conditions in competitive markets without regard to the ferc's index level or our cost-of-service. we establish market-based rates in approximately 70% of the markets for our refined products pipelines. the tariffs on most of our long-haul crude oil pipelines are at negotiated rates but are still subject to regulation by the ferc or state agencies and subject to protest by shippers. if we were to lose our market-based rate authority, or if our negotiated rates were determined to not be just and reasonable, we could be required to establish rates on some other basis, such as our cost-of-service. establishing our rates through a cost-of-service filing could be expensive and could result in tariff reductions, which would adversely affect our business.
our liquids blending activities subject us to federal regulations that govern renewable fuel requirements in the u.s.
the energy independence and security act of 2007 expanded the required use of renewable fuels in the u.s. each year, the epa establishes a renewable volume obligation (rvo) requirement for refiners and fuel manufacturers based on overall quotas established by the federal government. by virtue of our liquids blending activity and resulting gasoline production, we are an obligated party and receive an annual rvo from the epa. we typically purchase renewable energy credits, called rins, to meet this obligation. increases in the cost or decreases in the availability of rins could have an adverse impact on our business.
we may face significant costs to comply with the regulation of ghg emissions.
ghg emissions in the midstream industry originate primarily from combustion engine exhaust, heater exhaust and fugitive methane gas emissions. international, federal, regional and/or state legislative and/or regulatory initiatives may attempt to control or limit ghg emissions, including initiatives directed at issues associated with climate change. various federal and state legislative proposals have been introduced to regulate the emission of ghgs, particularly carbon dioxide and methane, and the united states supreme court has ruled that carbon dioxide is a pollutant subject to regulation by the epa. in addition, there have been international efforts seeking legally binding reductions in emissions of ghgs.
we believe it is likely that future governmental legislation and/or regulation on the federal, state and regional levels, may further require us to limit ghg emissions associated with our operations, pay additional fees associated with our ghg emissions or purchase allowances for such emissions. for example, the ira directs the epa to impose and collect payment of "waste emissions charges", or "methane fees", for specific facilities that report more than 25,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent of ghg emissions per year and have methane emissions intensity in excess of the relevant statutory threshold. based on text in the ira and a related rule that the epa proposed in january 2024 to implement the methane fee program, we expect to begin paying methane fees in 2025 (for 2024 reported emissions) for applicable facilities. methane fees and other legislative and/or regulatory initiatives could make some of our activities uneconomic to maintain or operate. however, we cannot predict precisely what form these future legislative and/or regulatory initiatives will take, the stringency of such initiatives, when they will become effective or the impact on our capital expenditures, competitive position and results of operations. further, we may not be able to pass on the higher costs to our customers or recover all costs related to complying with ghg legislative and/or regulatory requirements. our future results of operations, financial position or cash flows could be affected adversely if such costs are not recovered or otherwise passed on to our customers.
our operations are subject to federal and state laws and regulations relating to the protection of public health and the environment, which may expose us to significant costs and liabilities. increased litigation and activism challenging continued reliance upon oil and gas as well as changes to and/or increased penalties from the enforcement of laws, regulations and policies could impact adversely our business.
the risk of incurring substantial environmental costs and liabilities is inherent in our business. our operations are subject to extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment. examples of these laws include the:
•clean water act and analogous state laws that impose requirements related to activities in and around certain state and federal waters, including requirements related to discharge of wastewater from our facilities into state and federal table of contents waters and discharge of dredge and fill materials, such as dirt and other earthy materials, into waters of the united states;
•rcra and analogous state laws that impose requirements for the handling and discharge of solid and hazardous waste from our facilities.
various federal and state governmental authorities, including the epa, have the power to enforce compliance with these laws and regulations and the permits issued under them. violators are subject to administrative, civil and criminal penalties, including civil fines, injunctions or both. joint and several, strict liability may be incurred without regard to fault under the cercla, rcra and analogous state laws for the remediation of contaminated areas.
there is an inherent risk of incurring environmental costs and liabilities in our business due to our handling of the products we gather, transport, process and store; air emissions related to our operations; past industry operations and waste disposal practices, some of which may be material. private parties, including the owners of properties through which our pipeline systems pass, may have the right to pursue legal actions to enforce compliance as well as to seek damages for noncompliance with environmental laws and regulations or for personal injury or property damage arising from our operations. some sites we operate are located near current or former third-party hydrocarbon storage and processing operations, and there is a risk that contamination has migrated from those sites to ours. in addition, increasingly strict laws, regulations and enforcement policies could increase significantly our compliance costs, penalties and other cost associated with any alleged noncompliance, and the cost of any remediation that may become necessary; some of these costs could be material and could adversely affect our business, results of operation, financial position and cash flows. our insurance may not cover all of these environmental risks, and there are also limits on coverage. additional information is included under item 1, business, under "regulatory, environmental and safety matters" and in note o of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this annual report.
increased litigation and activism challenging oil and gas development as well as changes to and/or more aggressive enforcement of laws, regulations and policies could impact our business. these actions could, among other things, impact our customers' activities, our existing permits, our ability to obtain permits for new development projects and public perception of our company, which could affect adversely our business, results of operations, financial position or cash flows.
we use both fixed and variable rate debt, and we are exposed to market risk due to the floating interest rates on our short-term borrowings. our results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be affected adversely by significant fluctuations in interest rates.
any reduction in our credit ratings could affect adversely our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows.
our long-term debt has been assigned an investment-grade credit rating of "baa2" by moody's and "bbb" by both s&p and fitch. our commercial paper program has been assigned an investment-grade credit rating of prime-2, a-2 and f2 by moody's, s&p and fitch, respectively. we cannot provide assurance that any of our current ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by these credit rating agencies. if these agencies were to downgrade our long-term debt or our commercial paper rating, particularly below investment grade, our borrowing costs could increase, which would affect adversely our financial results, and our potential pool of investors and funding sources could decrease. ratings from these agencies are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold our securities. each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating.
table of contents our indebtedness and guarantee obligations could impair our financial condition and our ability to fulfill our obligations.
•make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to senior notes and other indebtedness due to the increased debt-service obligations, which could, in turn, result in an event of default on such other indebtedness or the senior notes;
•impair our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or general business purposes;
•diminish our ability to withstand a downturn in our business or the economy;
•require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to debt-service payments, reducing the availability of cash for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, dividends or general corporate purposes;
•limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate; and
•place us at a competitive disadvantage compared with our competitors that have proportionately less debt and fewer guarantee obligations.
we are not prohibited under the indentures governing the senior notes from incurring additional indebtedness, but our debt agreements do subject us to certain operational limitations that could restrict our ability to finance future operations or expand or pursue business activities, as summarized in the next paragraph. if we incur significant additional indebtedness, it could worsen the negative consequences mentioned above and could affect adversely our ability to repay our other indebtedness.
our $2.5 billion credit agreement contains provisions that, among other things, limit our ability to make material changes to the nature of our business, merge, consolidate or dispose of all or substantially all of our assets, grant liens and security interests on our assets, engage in transactions with affiliates or make restricted payments, including dividends. it also requires us to maintain certain financial ratios, which limit the amount of additional indebtedness we can incur, as described in the "liquidity and capital resources" section of part ii, item 7, management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations, in this annual report. these restrictions could result in higher costs of borrowing and impair our ability to generate additional cash. future financing agreements we may enter into may contain similar or more restrictive covenants.
if we are unable to meet our debt-service obligations or comply with financial covenants, we could be forced to restructure or refinance our indebtedness, seek additional equity capital or sell assets. we may be unable to obtain financing or sell assets on satisfactory terms, or at all.
an event of default may require us to offer to repurchase certain of our and oneok partners' senior notes or may impair our ability to access capital.
the indentures governing certain of our and oneok partners' senior notes include an event of default upon the acceleration of other indebtedness of $15 million or more for certain of our senior notes or $100 million or more for certain of our and oneok partners' senior notes. such events of default would entitle the trustee or the holders of 25% in aggregate principal amount of our and oneok partners' outstanding senior notes to declare those senior notes immediately due and payable in full. we may not have sufficient cash on hand to repurchase and repay any accelerated senior notes, which may cause us to borrow funds under our credit facility or seek alternative financing sources to finance the repurchases and repayment. we could also face difficulties accessing capital or our borrowing costs could increase, impacting our ability to obtain financing for acquisitions or capital expenditures, to refinance indebtedness and to fulfill our debt obligations.
the right to receive payments on our outstanding debt securities and subsidiary guarantees is unsecured and will be effectively subordinated to any future secured indebtedness as well as to any existing and future indebtedness of our subsidiaries that do not guarantee the senior notes.
although oneok partners, the intermediate partnership and magellan have guaranteed our debt securities, the guarantees are subject to release under certain circumstances, and we have subsidiaries that are not guarantors. in those cases, the debt securities effectively are subordinated to the claims of all creditors, including trade creditors and tort claimants, of our subsidiaries that are not guarantors. in the event of the insolvency, bankruptcy, liquidation, reorganization, dissolution or winding up of the business of a subsidiary that is not a guarantor, creditors of that subsidiary would generally have the right to be paid in full before any distribution is made to us or the holders of the debt securities.
oneok, oneok partners, the intermediate partnership and magellan have cross guarantees in place for our and oneok partners' indebtedness. a court may use fraudulent conveyance laws to subordinate or avoid the cross guarantees of certain of this indebtedness. it is also possible that under certain circumstances, a court could avoid or subordinate the guarantor's guarantee of this indebtedness in favor of the guarantor's other debts or liabilities to the extent that the court determined either of the following were true at the time the guarantor issued the guarantee:
•the guarantor incurred the guarantee with the intent to hinder, delay or defraud any of its present or future creditors or the guarantor contemplated insolvency with a design to favor one or more creditors to the total or partial exclusion of others; or
•the guarantor did not receive fair consideration or reasonable equivalent value for issuing the guarantee and, at the time it issued the guarantee, the guarantor:
- was engaged or about to engage in a business or transaction for which its remaining assets constituted unreasonably small capital; or
- intended to incur, or believed that it would incur, debts beyond its ability to pay such debts as they matured.
the measure of insolvency for purposes of the foregoing will vary depending upon the law of the relevant jurisdiction. generally, however, an entity would be considered insolvent for purposes of the foregoing if:
•the sum of its debts, including contingent liabilities, were greater than the fair saleable value of all of its assets at a fair valuation;
•the present fair saleable value of its assets was less than the amount that would be required to pay its probable liability on its existing debts, including contingent liabilities, as they become absolute and mature; or
•it could not pay its debts as they become due.
among other things, a legal challenge of the cross guarantees of our and oneok partners' indebtedness on fraudulent conveyance grounds may focus on the benefits, if any, realized by the guarantor as a result of the issuance of such debt. to the extent the guarantor's guarantee of any such indebtedness is avoided as a result of fraudulent conveyance or held unenforceable for any other reason, the holders of such debt would cease to have any claim in respect of the guarantee.
general risk factors mergers and acquisitions that appear to be accretive may nevertheless reduce our cash from operations on a per-share basis.
any merger or acquisition involves potential risks that may include, among other things:
•an inability to integrate successfully the businesses we acquire;
•decrease in our liquidity as a result of our using a significant portion of our available cash or borrowing capacity to finance the acquisition;
•a significant increase in our interest expense and/or financial leverage if we incur additional debt to finance the acquisition;
•the assumption of unknown liabilities for which we are not indemnified, our indemnity is inadequate or our insurance policies may exclude from coverage;
•an inability to hire, train or retain qualified personnel to manage and operate the acquired business and assets;
•limitations on rights to indemnity from the seller;
•inaccurate assumptions about the overall costs of equity or debt;
if we consummate any future mergers or acquisitions, our capitalization and results of operations may change significantly, and investors will not have the opportunity to evaluate the economic, financial and other relevant information that we will consider in determining the application of our resources to future acquisitions.
the success of the magellan acquisition will depend, in part, on our ability to realize the anticipated benefits from combining the businesses of oneok and magellan. if the businesses are not successfully combined, the anticipated benefits of the magellan acquisition may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected. in addition, the integration may result in additional and unforeseen expenses, which could reduce the anticipated benefits of the magellan acquisition. it is possible that the integration process could result in the loss of key employees, as well as the disruption of our ongoing businesses or inconsistencies in our standards, controls, procedures and policies. any or all of those occurrences could affect adversely the combined company's ability to maintain relationships with customers and employees after the magellan acquisition or to achieve the anticipated benefits of the magellan acquisition. integration efforts between the two companies will also divert management attention and resources. these integration matters could have an adverse effect on us.
we may not have sufficient cash each quarter to pay dividends or maintain current or expected levels of dividends. the actual amount of cash we pay in the form of dividends may fluctuate from quarter to quarter and will depend on various factors, some of which are beyond our control, including our working capital needs, our ability to borrow, the restrictions contained in our indentures and credit facility, our debt-service requirements and the cost of acquisitions, if any. a failure either to pay dividends or to pay dividends at expected levels could result in a loss of investor confidence, reputational damage and a decrease in the value of our stock price.
we are exposed to the credit risk of our customers or counterparties, and our credit-risk management may not be adequate to protect against such risk.
we are subject to the risk of loss resulting from nonpayment and/or nonperformance by our customers and counterparties. our customers or counterparties may experience rapid deterioration of their financial condition as a result of changing market conditions, commodity prices or financial difficulties that could impact their creditworthiness or ability to pay us for our services. we assess the creditworthiness of our customers and counterparties and obtain collateral or contractual terms as we deem appropriate. we cannot, however, predict to what extent our business may be impacted by deteriorating market or financial conditions, including possible declines in our customers' and counterparties' creditworthiness. our customers and counterparties may not perform or adhere to our existing or future contractual arrangements. to the extent our customers and counterparties are in financial distress or commence bankruptcy proceedings, contracts with them may be subject to renegotiation or rejection under applicable provisions of the united states bankruptcy code. if our risk-management policies and procedures fail to assess adequately the creditworthiness of existing or future customers and counterparties, any material nonpayment or nonperformance by our customers and counterparties due to inability or unwillingness to perform or adhere to contractual arrangements could affect adversely our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows.
our counterparties are primarily major integrated and independent exploration and production, pipeline, marketing and petrochemical companies and natural gas and electric utilities. therefore, our counterparties may be similarly affected by changes in economic, regulatory or other factors that may affect our overall credit risk.
a shortage of skilled labor may make it difficult for us to maintain labor productivity and competitive costs.
our operations require skilled and experienced workers with proficiency in multiple tasks. in recent years, a shortage of workers trained in various skills associated with the midstream energy business has, at times, caused us to conduct certain operations without full staff, thus hiring outside resources, which may decrease productivity and increase costs. this shortage of trained workers is the result of experienced workers reaching retirement age and increased competition for workers in certain areas, combined with the challenges of attracting new, qualified workers to the midstream energy industry. if the shortage of experienced labor continues or worsens, it could affect adversely our labor productivity and costs and our ability to expand operations in the event there is an increase in the demand for our services and products, which could affect adversely our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows.
our employees or directors may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including noncompliance with regulatory standards and requirements.
as with all companies, we are exposed to the risk of employee fraud or other misconduct. our board of directors has adopted a code of business conduct and ethics that applies to our directors, officers (including our principal executive and financial officers, principal accounting officer, controllers and other persons performing similar functions) and all other employees. we require all directors, officers and employees to adhere to our code of business conduct and ethics in addressing the legal and ethical issues encountered in conducting their work for our company. our code of business conduct and ethics requires, among table of contents other things, that our directors, officers and employees avoid conflicts of interest, comply with all applicable laws and other legal requirements, conduct business in an honest and ethical manner and otherwise act with integrity and in our company's best interest. all directors, officers and employees are required to report any conduct that they believe to be an actual or apparent violation of our code of business conduct and ethics. however, it is not always possible to identify and deter misconduct, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to comply with such laws or regulations. if any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could affect adversely our reputation, business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows.
an impairment of goodwill, long-lived assets, including intangible assets, and equity-method investments could reduce our earnings.
goodwill is recorded when the purchase price of a business exceeds the fair market value of the tangible and separately measurable intangible net assets. gaap requires us to test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or when events or circumstances occur indicating that goodwill might be impaired. long-lived assets, including intangible assets with finite useful lives, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. for the investments we account for under the equity method, the impairment test considers whether the fair value of the equity investment as a whole, not the underlying net assets, has declined and whether that decline is other than temporary. for example, if a low commodity price environment persisted for a prolonged period, it could result in lower volumes delivered to our systems and impairments of our assets or equity-method investments. if we determine that an impairment is indicated, we would be required to take an immediate noncash charge to earnings with a correlative effect on equity and balance sheet leverage as measured by consolidated debt to total capitalization.
for further discussion of impairments of long-lived assets, goodwill and equity-method investments, see notes a, f, g, and n, respectively, of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this annual report.
the cost of providing pension and postretirement health care benefits to eligible employees and qualified retirees is subject to changes in pension fund values and changing demographics and may increase.
we have defined benefit pension plans for certain employees and former employees, which are closed to new participants, and postretirement welfare plans that provide postretirement medical and life insurance benefits to certain employees. the cost of providing these benefits to eligible current and former employees is subject to changes in the market value of our pension and postretirement benefit plan assets, changing demographics, including longer life expectancy of plan participants and their beneficiaries and changes in health care costs. for further discussion of our defined benefit pension plan and postretirement welfare plans, see note l of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this annual report.
any sustained declines in equity markets and reductions in bond yields may affect adversely the value of our pension and postretirement benefit plan assets. in these circumstances, additional cash contributions to our pension plans may be required, which could affect adversely our business, financial condition and cash flows.
if we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may not be able to report accurately our financial results or prevent fraud. as a result, current and potential holders of our equity and debt securities could lose confidence in our financial reporting.
effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports, prevent fraud and operate successfully as a public company. we cannot be certain that our efforts to maintain our internal controls will be successful, that we will be able to maintain adequate controls over our financial processes and reporting in the future or that we will be able to continue to comply with our obligations under section 404 of the sarbanes-oxley act of 2002. any failure to maintain effective internal controls, or difficulties encountered in implementing or improving our internal controls, could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. ineffective internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which would likely have a negative effect on the trading price of our equity, our access to capital markets and the cost of capital.
item 7.    management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with part i, item 1, business, our audited consolidated financial statements and the notes to consolidated financial statements in this annual report.
recent developments please refer to the "financial results and operating information" and "liquidity and capital resources" sections of management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in this annual report for additional information.
magellan acquisition - on september 25, 2023, we completed the magellan acquisition. the acquisition strategically diversifies our complementary asset base and allows for significant expected synergies. pursuant to the merger agreement, each common unit of magellan was exchanged for a fixed ratio of 0.667 shares of oneok common stock and $25.00 of cash, for a total consideration of $14.1 billion. in addition, we assumed magellan's debt at the fair value of $4.0 billion. we issued approximately 135 million shares of common stock, with a fair value of approximately $9.0 billion as of the closing date of the magellan acquisition. we funded the cash portion of the acquisition with an underwritten public offering of $5.25 billion senior unsecured notes.
for additional information on the magellan acquisition, see part ii, item 8, note b of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this annual report. see part 1, item 1a "risk factors" for further discussion of risks related to the magellan acquisition. additional information regarding the financial results and operating information of our refined products and crude segment subsequent to the closing of the magellan acquisition is provided in "financial results and operating information."
market condition - we experienced increased volumes across our system in 2023, compared with 2022, highlighting our extensive and integrated assets located in, and connected with, some of the most productive shale basins, refining regions and demand centers, in the united states.
medford incident - in january 2023, we reached an agreement with our insurers to settle all claims for physical damage and business interruption related to the medford incident that occurred at our 210 mmbl/d medford, oklahoma, ngl fractionation facility in july 2022. under the terms of the settlement agreement, we agreed to resolve the claims for total insurance payments of $930 million, $100 million of which was received in 2022. the remaining $830 million was received in the first quarter of 2023, resulting in a one-time settlement gain of $779 million. the proceeds serve as settlement for property damage, business interruption claims to the date of settlement and as payment in lieu of future business interruption insurance claims.
the medford incident resulted in an increase in operating income and adjusted ebitda of $663 million, from the settlement gain of $779 million, offset partially by $146 million of third-party fractionation costs compared with an approximately $30
table of contents million unfavorable impact of the 45-day waiting period in the year ended december 31, 2022. we expect our cash from operations in 2024 to be impacted by incurred costs resulting from the medford incident for which we no longer receive business interruption proceeds.
for additional information on the medford incident, see part ii, item 8, note c of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this annual report.
ethane economics - price differentials between ethane and natural gas can cause natural gas processors to recover ethane or leave it in the natural gas stream, known as ethane rejection. as a result of these ethane economics, ethane volumes on our system can fluctuate. ethane volumes under long-term contracts delivered to our ngl system increased 25 mbbl/d to an average of 475 mbbl/d during 2023, compared with an average of 450 mbbl/d in 2022, due primarily to changes in ethane extraction economics. we estimate that there are approximately 250 mbbl/d of discretionary ethane, consisting of approximately 150 mbbl/d in the rocky mountain region and approximately 100 mbbl/d in the mid-continent region, that could be recovered and transported on our system.
capital projects - our primary capital projects are outlined in the table below:
west texas ngl pipeline expansion         increase capacity to 740 mbbl/d in the permian basin                                  $520         first quarter 2025
elk creek pipeline expansion              increase capacity to 435 mbbl/d out of the rocky mountain region                      $355         first quarter 2025
(a) - excludes capitalized interest/afudc.
debt issuances - in august 2023, we completed an underwritten public offering of $5.25 billion senior unsecured notes consisting of $750 million, 5.55% senior notes due 2026; $750 million, 5.65% senior notes due 2028; $500 million, 5.80% senior notes due 2030; $1.5 billion, 6.05% senior notes due 2033; and $1.75 billion, 6.625% senior notes due 2053. the net proceeds, after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions and offering expenses, were $5.2 billion. the net proceeds were used to fund the cash consideration and other costs related to the magellan acquisition.
debt repayments - in 2023, we repurchased in the open market outstanding principal of certain of our senior notes in the amount of $322 million for an aggregate repurchase price of $280 million, including accrued and unpaid interest, with cash on hand. in connection with these open market repurchases, we recognized $41 million of net gains on extinguishment of debt.
in june 2023, we redeemed our $500 million, 7.5% senior notes due september 2023 at 100% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, with cash on hand.
in february 2023, we redeemed our $425 million, 5.0% senior notes due september 2023 at 100% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, with cash on hand.
share repurchase program - in january 2024, our board of directors authorized a share repurchase program to buy up to $2.0 billion of our outstanding common stock and targets the program to be largely utilized over the next four years. we expect shares to be acquired from time to time in open-market transactions or through privately negotiated transactions at our discretion, subject to market conditions and other factors. we expect any purchases to be funded by cash on hand, cash flow from operations and short-term borrowings. the program will terminate upon completion of the repurchase of $2.0 billion of common stock or on january 1, 2029, whichever occurs first. as of february 20, 2024, no shares have been repurchased under the program.
dividends - during 2023, we paid common stock dividends totaling $3.82 per share, an increase of 2% compared to the 2022 dividend of $3.74 per share. in february 2024, we paid a quarterly common stock dividend of $0.99 per share ($3.96 per share on an annualized basis), an increase of 3.7% compared with the same quarter in the prior year. our dividend growth is primarily due to the increase in cash flows resulting from the growth of our operations.
table of contents financial results and operating information how we evaluate our operations management uses a variety of financial and operating metrics to analyze our performance. our consolidated financial metrics include: (1) operating income; (2) net income; (3) diluted eps; and (4) adjusted ebitda. we evaluate segment operating results using adjusted ebitda and our operating metrics, which include various volume and rate statistics that are relevant for the respective segment. these operating metrics allow investors to analyze the various components of segment financial results in terms of volumes and rate/price. management uses these metrics to analyze historical segment financial results and as the key inputs for forecasting and budgeting segment financial results. for additional information on our operating metrics, see the respective segment subsections of this "financial results and operating information" section.
non-gaap financial measures - adjusted ebitda is a non-gaap measure of our financial performance. adjusted ebitda is defined as net income adjusted for interest expense, depreciation and amortization, noncash impairment charges, income taxes, noncash compensation expense and certain other noncash items. following the magellan acquisition, we performed a review of our calculation methodology of adjusted ebitda, and beginning in 2023, we updated our calculation to include the adjusted ebitda related to our unconsolidated affiliates using the same recognition and measurement methods used to record equity in net earnings from investments. in prior periods, our calculation included equity in net earnings from investments. this change resulted in an additional $62 million of adjusted ebitda in 2023, and we have not restated prior periods. adjusted ebitda from our unconsolidated affiliates is calculated consistently with the definition above and excludes items such as interest, depreciation, income taxes and other noncash items. although the amounts related to our unconsolidated affiliates are included in the calculation of adjusted ebitda, such inclusion should not be understood to imply that we have control over the operations and resulting revenues, expenses or cash flows of such unconsolidated affiliates.
we believe this non-gaap financial measure is useful to investors because it and similar measures are used by many companies in our industry as a measurement of financial performance and is commonly employed by financial analysts and others to evaluate our financial performance and to compare financial performance among companies in our industry. adjusted ebitda should not be considered an alternative to net income, eps or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with gaap. additionally, this calculation may not be comparable with similarly titled measures of other companies.

table of contents changes in commodity prices and sales volumes affect both revenues and cost of sales and fuel in our consolidated statements of income and, therefore, the impact is largely offset between these line items.
•refined products and crude - transportation and storage revenues of $535 million for the period of september 25, 2023, through december 31, 2023 due to the impact of the magellan acquisition; offset by
•consolidated operating, depreciation and transaction costs - an increase of $290 million in operating costs and depreciation expense from our refined products and crude segment, an increase of $158 million from transaction costs related to the magellan acquisition and an increase of $239 million due primarily to higher operating costs and depreciation expense in our natural gas gathering and processing, natural gas liquids and natural gas pipelines segments.
net income and diluted eps increased due primarily to the items discussed above, higher equity in net earnings from investments, higher interest income due to both higher cash balances and higher interest rates and net gains on extinguishment of debt related to open market repurchases. these increases were offset partially by higher income taxes and higher interest expense due to interest costs resulting from the magellan acquisition, which include acquired debt balances, our august 2023 $5.25 billion notes offering and commitment fees associated with our undrawn and terminated 364-day bridge loan facility.
capital expenditures increased due primarily to our capital projects, including our mb-6 fractionator, ngl pipeline expansion projects and the viking compression project.
additional information regarding our financial results and operating information is provided in the following discussion for each of our four segments. in connection with the magellan acquisition, we reviewed our business segments in light of certain changes in the financial information regularly reviewed by our chief operating decision maker and other factors. based on this review, we added the refined products and crude segment. this change, which was effective as of september 25, 2023, had no impact on our consolidated financial statements for any periods.

(a) - beginning in 2023, we updated our calculation methodology of adjusted ebitda to include adjusted ebitda from our unconsolidated affiliates, which resulted in an additional $3 million of adjusted ebitda in 2023, and we have not restated prior periods. see reconciliation of net income to adjusted ebitda in the "non-gaap financial measures" section.
changes in commodity prices and sales volumes affect both revenue and cost of sales and fuel, and, therefore, the impact is largely offset between these line items.
2023 vs. 2022 - adjusted ebitda increased $207 million, primarily as a result of the following:
•an increase of $227 million from higher volumes due primarily to increased producer activity in the rocky mountain and mid-continent regions, and the impact of winter weather in the rocky mountain region in the second and fourth quarters of 2022; and
capital expenditures remained relatively unchanged for 2023, as compared to 2022, due primarily to increased expenditures in 2023 on various capital projects, offset by expenditures in 2022 on our demicks lake iii project completed in the first quarter of 2023.
(a) - includes volumes for consolidated entities only.
(b) - includes volumes we processed at company-owned and third-party facilities.
2023 vs. 2022 - our natural gas processed volumes increased due primarily to increased producer activity in the rocky mountain and mid-continent regions and the impact of winter weather in the rocky mountain region in the second and fourth quarters of 2022.
our average fee rate increased due primarily to increased contribution of volumes on higher fee contracts in the williston basin and inflation-based escalators in our contracts. also, for certain fee with pop contracts, our contractual fees increased due to production volumes, delivery pressures or commodity prices relative to specified contractual thresholds.
natural gas liquids capital projects - our natural gas liquids segment invests in capital projects to transport, fractionate, store, deliver to market centers and receive ngl supply from shale and other resource development areas. our growth strategy is focused around
table of contents connecting diversified supply basins from the rocky mountain region through the mid-continent region and the permian basin with demand for purity ngls from the petrochemical and refining industries and ngl exports in the gulf coast. we proactively monitor lead times on materials and equipment used in constructing capital projects, and we enter into procurement agreements for long-lead items for potential projects to plan for future growth. see "capital projects" in the "recent developments" section for more information on our capital projects.

(a) - beginning in 2023, we updated our calculation methodology of adjusted ebitda to include adjusted ebitda from our unconsolidated affiliates which resulted in an additional $9 million of adjusted ebitda in 2023, and we have not restated prior periods. see reconciliation of net income to adjusted ebitda in the "non-gaap financial measures" section.
changes in commodity prices and sales volumes affect both revenues and cost of sales and fuel and, therefore, the impact is largely offset between these line items.
2023 vs. 2022 - adjusted ebitda increased $950 million primarily as a result of the following:
•an increase of $663 million related to the medford incident, due to the settlement gain of $779 million, offset partially by $146 million of third-party fractionation costs, compared with an approximately $30 million unfavorable impact of the 45-day waiting period in 2022;
•an increase of $303 million in exchange services due primarily to higher volumes across the system, offset partially by narrower commodity price differentials;
•an increase of $12 million in optimization and marketing due primarily to higher earnings on sales of purity ngls held in inventory; offset by
capital expenditures increased in 2023 due primarily to capital projects, which includes our mb-6 fractionator and pipeline expansion projects.
we generally expect ethane volumes to increase or decrease with corresponding increases or decreases in overall ngl production. however, ethane volumes may experience growth or decline greater than corresponding growth or decline in overall ngl production due to ethane economics causing producers to recover or reject ethane.
natural gas pipelines capital projects - our natural gas pipelines segment invests in capital projects that provide transportation and storage services to end users. in february 2024, the ferc approved our saguaro connector pipeline, l.l.c.'s presidential permit application to construct and operate new international border-crossing facilities at the u.s. and mexico border. the proposed border facilities would connect upstream with a potential intrastate pipeline, the saguaro connector pipeline. additionally, the proposed border facilities would connect at the international boundary with a new pipeline under development in mexico for delivery to a liquefied natural gas export facility on the west coast of mexico. the final investment decision on the saguaro connector pipeline is expected by mid-year 2024.
in 2023, we completed an expansion of our injection capabilities of our oklahoma natural gas storage facilities, which allowed us to utilize and subscribe an additional 4 bcf of our existing storage capacity, which is fully subscribed through 2027 and 90% subscribed through 2029. we are reactivating previously idled storage facilities with 3 bcf of working gas storage capacity in texas, which is already fully subscribed on a firm basis. we are also further expanding our injection capabilities in oklahoma to allow us to subscribe additional firm storage capacity.

in april 2022, the ferc initiated a review of guardian's rates pursuant to section 5 of the natural gas act. in august 2022, guardian reached a settlement in principle with the participants in the section 5 rate case.  the ferc approved the settlement in february 2023, which resulted in a reduction of rates starting in april 2023. the reduced rates did not have a material impact on our results of operations.
in july 2023, viking filed a proposed increase in rates pursuant to section 4 of the natural gas act with the ferc. the ferc is currently reviewing the filing. while the ultimate outcome of the filing cannot be predicted, we do not expect it to materially impact our results of operations.
refined products and crude capital projects - our refined products and crude segment invests in capital projects to transport, store and distribute refined products and crude oil primarily throughout the central united states. our growth strategy is focused on expanding our core business and marketing presence.

(c) - beginning in 2023, we updated our calculation methodology of adjusted ebitda to include adjusted ebitda from our unconsolidated affiliates using the same recognition and measurement methods used to record equity in net earnings from investments. in prior periods, our calculation included equity in net earnings from investments. this change resulted in an additional $62 million of adjusted ebitda in 2023, and we have not restated prior periods.
(d) - includes segment adjusted ebitda for the period september 25, 2023, through december 31, 2023.
other legal proceedings - we are a party to various legal proceedings that have arisen in the normal course of our operations. while the results of these proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty, we believe the reasonably possible losses from such proceedings, individually and in the aggregate, are not material. additionally, we believe the probable final outcome of such proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.
liquidity and capital resources general - our primary sources of cash inflows are operating cash flows, proceeds from our commercial paper program and our $2.5 billion credit agreement, debt issuances and the issuance of common stock for our liquidity and capital resources requirements.
table of contents in january 2023, we reached an agreement with our insurers to settle all claims for physical damage and business interruption related to the medford incident. under the terms of the settlement agreement, we agreed to resolve the claims for total insurance payments of $930 million, $100 million of which was received in 2022. the remaining $830 million was received in the first quarter of 2023. the proceeds serve as settlement for property damage, business interruption claims to the date of settlement and as payment in lieu of future business interruption insurance claims. we expect our cash from operations in 2024 to be impacted by incurred costs resulting from the medford incident for which we no longer receive business interruption proceeds.
we expect our sources of cash inflows to provide sufficient resources to finance our operations, capital expenditures, quarterly cash dividends, maturities of long-term debt, share repurchases and contributions to unconsolidated affiliates. we believe we have sufficient liquidity due to our $2.5 billion credit agreement, which expires in june 2027, and access to $1.0 billion available through our "at-the-market" equity program. as of the date of this report, no shares have been sold through our "at-the-market" equity program.
we may manage interest-rate risk through the use of fixed-rate debt, floating-rate debt, treasury locks and interest-rate swaps. for additional information on our interest-rate swaps, see note e of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this annual report.
cash management - at december 31, 2023, we had $338 million of cash and cash equivalents. we use a centralized cash management program that concentrates the cash assets of our nonguarantor operating subsidiaries in joint accounts for the purposes of providing financial flexibility and lowering the cost of borrowing, transaction costs and bank fees. our centralized cash management program provides that funds in excess of the daily needs of our operating subsidiaries are concentrated, consolidated or otherwise made available for use by other entities within our consolidated group. our operating subsidiaries participate in this program to the extent they are permitted pursuant to ferc regulations or their operating agreements. under the cash management program, depending on whether a participating subsidiary has short-term cash surpluses or cash requirements, we provide cash to the subsidiary or the subsidiary provides cash to us.
guarantees - in december 2023, oneok assumed the debt obligations of magellan under its previous debt indentures and magellan provided a guarantee of the outstanding notes. as of december 31, 2023, magellan no longer had debt obligations outstanding. we guarantee certain debt securities of oneok partners, and oneok partners, the intermediate partnership and magellan guarantee certain of our debt securities. the guarantees in place for our and oneok partners' indebtedness are full, irrevocable, unconditional and absolute joint and several guarantees to the holders of each series of outstanding securities. liabilities under the guarantees rank equally in right of payment with all existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness. the intermediate partnership holds all of oneok partners' interests and equity in its subsidiaries, which are nonguarantors, and substantially all the assets and operations reside with nonguarantor operating subsidiaries. magellan holds interests in its subsidiaries, which are nonguarantors, and substantially all the assets and operations reside with nonguarantor operating subsidiaries. therefore, as allowed under rule 13-01, we have excluded the summarized financial information for each issuer and guarantor as the combined financial information of the subsidiary issuers and parent guarantor, excluding our ownership of all the interests in oneok partners and magellan, reflect no material assets, liabilities or results of operations, apart from the guaranteed indebtedness. for additional information on our and oneok partners' indebtedness, please see note h of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this annual report.
short-term liquidity - our principal sources of short-term liquidity consist of cash generated from operating activities, distributions received from our equity-method investments, proceeds from our commercial paper program and our $2.5 billion credit agreement. as of december 31, 2023, we had no borrowings under our $2.5 billion credit agreement and we are in compliance with all covenants.
we had working capital (defined as current assets less current liabilities) deficits of $344 million and $503 million as of december 31, 2023, and december 31, 2022, respectively due primarily to current maturities of long-term debt. generally, our working capital is influenced by several factors, including, among other things: (i) the timing of (a) debt and equity issuances, (b) the funding of capital expenditures, (c) scheduled debt repayments, and (d) accounts receivable and payable; and (ii) the volume and cost of inventory and commodity imbalances. we may have working capital deficits in future periods as our long-term debt becomes current. we do not expect a working capital deficit of this nature to have a material adverse impact to our cash flows or operations.
for additional information on our $2.5 billion credit agreement, see note h of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this annual report.
table of contents long-term financing - in addition to our principal sources of short-term liquidity discussed above, we expect to fund our longer-term financing requirements by issuing long-term notes, as needed. other options to obtain financing include, but are not limited to, issuing common stock, loans from financial institutions, issuance of convertible debt securities or preferred equity securities, asset securitization and the sale and lease-back of facilities.
we may, at any time, seek to retire or purchase our or oneok partners' outstanding debt through cash purchases and/or exchanges for equity or debt, in open-market repurchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. such repurchases and exchanges, if any, will be on such terms and prices as we may determine, and will depend on prevailing market conditions, or liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. the amounts involved may be material.
debt issuances - in august 2023, we completed an underwritten public offering of $5.25 billion senior unsecured notes consisting of $750 million, 5.55% senior notes due 2026; $750 million, 5.65% senior notes due 2028; $500 million, 5.80% senior notes due 2030; $1.5 billion, 6.05% senior notes due 2033; and $1.75 billion, 6.625% senior notes due 2053. the net proceeds, after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions and offering expenses, were $5.2 billion. the net proceeds were used to fund the cash consideration and other costs related to the magellan acquisition. in connection with the underwritten public offering, we terminated the undrawn commitment letter for the $5.25 billion unsecured 364-day bridge loan facility.
debt repayments - in 2023, we repurchased in the open market outstanding principal of certain of our senior notes in the amount of $322 million for an aggregate repurchase price of $280 million, including accrued and unpaid interest, with cash on hand. in connection with these open market repurchases, we recognized $41 million of net gains on extinguishment of debt.
in november 2023, we made an equity contribution of $91 million to northern border, which in combination with an equal contribution from our joint venture partner, was used to partially repay the outstanding balance of its revolving credit facility and fund capital projects.
in june 2023, we redeemed our $500 million, 7.5% senior notes due september 2023 at 100% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, with cash on hand.
in june 2023, we made an equity contribution of $105 million to roadrunner, which, in combination with an equal contribution from our joint venture partner, was used to repay roadrunner's outstanding debt.
in february 2023, we redeemed our $425 million, 5.0% senior notes due september 2023 at 100% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, with cash on hand.
equity issuances - on september 25, 2023, we completed the magellan acquisition. pursuant to the merger agreement, each common unit of magellan was exchanged for a fixed ratio of 0.667 shares of oneok common stock and $25.00 of cash, for a total consideration of $14.1 billion. we issued approximately 135 million shares of common stock, with a fair value of approximately $9.0 billion as of the closing date of the magellan acquisition.
share repurchase program - in january 2024, our board of directors authorized a share repurchase program to buy up to $2.0 billion of our outstanding common stock and targets the program to be largely utilized over the next four years. we expect shares to be acquired from time to time in open-market transactions or through privately negotiated transactions at our discretion, subject to market conditions and other factors. we expect any purchases to be funded by cash on hand, cash flow from operations and short-term borrowings. the program will terminate upon completion of the repurchase of $2.0 billion of common stock or on january 1, 2029, whichever occurs first. as of february 20, 2024, no shares have been repurchased under the program.
material commitments - we have material cash commitments related to our capital expenditures, senior notes and corresponding interest payments, which we expect to fund through our sources of cash inflows discussed above. our senior notes and interest payments are discussed in note h of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this annual report. we also have cash commitments related to transportation, storage and other commercial contracts, as well as our financial and physical derivative obligations, which we expect to fund with cash from operations.
capital expenditures - we proactively monitor lead times on materials and equipment used in constructing capital projects, and we enter into procurement agreements for long-lead items for potential projects to plan for future growth. our capital expenditures are financed typically through operating cash flows and short- and long-term debt.
table of contents the following table sets forth our capital expenditures, excluding afudc, for the periods indicated:
capital expenditures                                           2023                        2022                      2021
total capital expenditures                               $1,595                      $1,202                      $697
(a) - includes capital expenditures for the period september 25, 2023, through december 31, 2023.
capital expenditures increased in 2023, compared with 2022, due primarily to our capital projects, including our mb-6 fractionator, ngl pipeline expansion projects and the viking compression project. see discussion of our announced capital projects in the "recent developments" section.
we expect total capital expenditures, excluding afudc and capitalized interest, of $1.75-$1.95 billion in 2024.
credit ratings - our long-term debt credit ratings as of february 20, 2024, are shown in the table below:
rating agency        long-term rating        short-term rating       outlook moody's              baa2                    prime-2                 stable s&amp;p              bbb                     a-2                     stable fitch                bbb                     f2                      stable our credit ratings, which are investment grade, may be affected by our leverage, liquidity, credit profile or potential transactions. in april 2023, moody's upgraded the rating on our long-term debt to baa2 from baa3, the rating on our short-term debt to prime-2 from prime-3 and changed the outlook to stable from positive. the most common criteria for assessment of our credit ratings are the debt-to-ebitda ratio, interest coverage, business risk profile and liquidity. if our credit ratings were downgraded, our cost to borrow funds under our $2.5 billion credit agreement could increase and a potential loss of access to the commercial paper market could occur. in the event that we are unable to borrow funds under our commercial paper program and there has not been a material adverse change in our business, we would continue to have access to our $2.5 billion credit agreement, which expires in 2027. an adverse credit rating change alone is not a default under our $2.5 billion credit agreement.
in the normal course of business, our counterparties provide us with secured and unsecured credit. in the event of a downgrade in our credit ratings or a significant change in our counterparties' evaluation of our creditworthiness, we could be required to provide additional collateral in the form of cash, letters of credit or other negotiable instruments as a condition of continuing to conduct business with such counterparties. we may be required to fund margin requirements with our counterparties with cash, letters of credit or other negotiable instruments.
dividends - holders of our common stock share equally in any common stock dividends declared by our board of directors, subject to the rights of the holders of outstanding preferred stock. in 2023, we paid common stock dividends totaling $3.82 per share, an increase of 2% compared to the 2022 dividend of $3.74 per share. in february 2024, we paid a quarterly common stock dividend of $0.99 per share ($3.96 per share on an annualized basis), an increase of 3.7% compared with the same quarter in the prior year.
for the year ended december 31, 2023, our cash flows from operations exceeded dividends paid by $2.6 billion, due in part to the insurance proceeds received from the medford settlement in 2023. we expect our cash flows from operations to continue to sufficiently fund our cash dividends. to the extent operating cash flows are not sufficient to fund our dividends, we may utilize cash on hand from other sources of short- and long-term liquidity to fund a portion of our dividends.
table of contents cash flow analysis we use the indirect method to prepare our consolidated statements of cash flows. under this method, we reconcile net income to cash flows provided by operating activities by adjusting net income for those items that affect net income but do not result in actual cash receipts or payments during the period and for operating cash items that do not impact net income. these reconciling items can include depreciation and amortization, deferred income taxes, impairment charges, allowance for equity funds used during construction, gain or loss on sale of assets, net undistributed earnings from equity-method investments, share-based compensation expense, other amounts and changes in our assets and liabilities not classified as investing or financing activities.
the following table sets forth the changes in cash flows by operating, investing and financing activities for the periods indicated:
operating activities                                                 $4,421                      $2,906                      $2,546
investing activities                                                (6,404)                     (1,139)                       (665)
financing activities                                                  2,101                     (1,693)                     (2,259)
operating cash flows - operating cash flows are affected by earnings from our business activities and changes in our operating assets and liabilities. changes in commodity prices and demand for our services or products, whether because of general economic conditions, changes in supply, changes in demand for the end products that are made with our products or increased competition from other service providers, could affect our earnings and operating cash flows. our operating cash flows can also be impacted by changes in our inventory balances, which are driven primarily by commodity prices, supply, demand and the operation of our assets.
2023 vs. 2022 - cash flows from operating activities, before changes in operating assets and liabilities increased $1.1 billion for the year ended december 31, 2023, compared with the same period in 2022, due primarily to higher operating income resulting from higher volumes from increased production and higher average fee rates in our natural gas gathering and processing segment, higher exchange services in our natural gas liquids segment, higher transportation and storage services in our natural gas pipelines segment and an increase due to the impact of the magellan acquisition in our refined products and crude segment; and insurance proceeds received from the medford settlement. please see "financial results and operating information" for a discussion of operating results.
the changes in operating assets and liabilities increased operating cash flows $358 million for the year ended december 31, 2023, compared with a decrease of $58 million for the same period in 2022. this change is due primarily to changes in accounts receivable resulting from the timing of receipt of cash from counterparties and from inventory, both of which vary from period to period, and with changes in commodity prices; offset partially by changes in risk management assets and liabilities.
2023 vs. 2022 - cash used in investing activities for the year ended december 31, 2023, increased $5.3 billion, compared with the same period in 2022, due primarily to the $5.0 billion of cash paid for the magellan acquisition.
2023 vs. 2022 - cash from financing activities for the year ended december 31, 2023, increased $3.8 billion compared with the same period in 2022, due primarily to the issuance of $5.25 billion senior unsecured notes associated with the magellan acquisition.
cash flow analysis for the year ended december 31, 2022 vs. 2021 - the cash flow analysis for the year ended december 31, 2022, compared with the year ended december 31, 2021, is included in part ii, item 7, management's table of contents discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of our 2022 annual report on form 10-k, which is available via the sec's website at www.sec.gov and our website at www.oneok.com.
critical accounting estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in accordance with gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions with respect to values or conditions that cannot be known with certainty that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements. these estimates and assumptions also affect the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. although we believe these estimates and assumptions are reasonable, actual results could differ from our estimates.
the following is a summary of our most critical accounting estimates, which are defined as those estimates most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and requiring management's most difficult, subjective or complex judgment, particularly because of the need to make estimates concerning the impact of inherently uncertain matters. we have discussed the development and selection of our critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors. see note a of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this annual report for the description of our accounting policies.
fair value estimates in business combination accounting - business combination accounting requires that assets and liabilities be recorded at their estimated fair value in connection with the initial recognition of the transaction. estimating the fair value of assets and liabilities in connection with business combination accounting requires management to make estimates, assumptions and judgments, and in some cases management may also utilize third-party specialists to assist and advise on those estimates.
in order to estimate the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, we utilized widely accepted valuation techniques that included discounted cash flow and cost methods. the discounted cash flow method utilizes assumptions that include, but are not limited to, estimated future cash flows, discount rates applied to estimated future cash flows, estimated rates of return and estimated customer attrition rates. cost methods estimate the fair value of assets based on the estimated construction cost of the assets, and requires the use of various inputs and assumptions. while we believe we have made reasonable assumptions to estimate the fair value, these assumptions are inherently uncertain. an estimate of the sensitivity to changes in our assumptions is not practicable given the numerous assumptions, and their interdependence, that can materially affect our estimates.
the purchase price allocation recorded in a business combination may change during the measurement period, which is a period not to exceed one year from the date of acquisition, as additional information about conditions existing at the acquisition date becomes available.
see note b of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this annual report for additional discussion of the business combination.
derivatives and risk-management activities - we utilize derivatives to reduce our market-risk exposure to commodity price and interest-rate fluctuations and to achieve more predictable cash flows. the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative instrument depends on whether it qualifies and has been designated as part of a hedging relationship. when possible, we implement effective hedging strategies using derivative financial instruments that qualify as hedges for accounting purposes. we have not used derivative instruments for trading purposes. for a derivative designated as a cash flow hedge, the gain or loss from a change in fair value of the derivative instrument is deferred in accumulated other comprehensive loss until the forecasted transaction affects earnings, at which time the fair value of the derivative instrument is reclassified into earnings.
we assess hedging relationships at the inception of the hedge, and periodically thereafter, to determine whether the hedging relationship is, and is expected to remain, highly effective. we do not believe that changes in our fair value estimates of our derivative instruments have a material impact on our results of operations, as the majority of our derivatives are accounted for as effective cash flow hedges. however, if a derivative instrument is ineligible for cash flow hedge accounting or if we fail to appropriately designate it as a cash flow hedge, changes in fair value of the derivative instrument would be recorded currently table of contents in earnings. additionally, if a cash flow hedge ceases to qualify for hedge accounting treatment because it is no longer probable that the forecasted transaction will occur, the change in fair value of the derivative instrument would be recognized in earnings. for more information on commodity price sensitivity and a discussion of the market risk of pricing changes, see item 7a, quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk.
see notes a, d and e of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this annual report for additional discussion of fair value measurements and derivatives and risk-management activities.
impairment of goodwill, long-lived assets, including intangible assets and equity method investments - we assess our goodwill for impairment at least annually as of july 1, unless events or changes in circumstances indicate an impairment may have occurred before that time. as part of our goodwill impairment test, we may first assess qualitative factors (including macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors and overall financial performance) to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of each of our reporting units with goodwill was less than its carrying amount. if further testing is necessary or a quantitative test is elected, we perform a step 1 analysis for goodwill impairment.
in a step 1 analysis, an assessment is made by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.
we assess our long-lived assets, including intangible assets, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset's carrying amount may not be recoverable. an impairment is indicated if the carrying amount of a long-lived asset exceeds the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. if an impairment is indicated, we record an impairment loss equal to the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the long-lived asset.
we evaluate equity method investments in unconsolidated affiliates for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that there is an other-than-temporary loss in value of the investment. when evidence of loss in value has occurred, we compare our estimate of fair value of the investment to the carrying value of the investment to determine whether an impairment has occurred. if the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value and we consider the decline in value to be other-than-temporary, the excess of the carrying value over the fair value is recognized in our consolidated financial statements as an impairment charge.
our impairment tests require the use of assumptions and estimates, such as industry economic factors and the profitability of future business strategies. to estimate undiscounted future cash flows of long-lived assets we may apply a probability-weighted approach that incorporates different assumptions and potential outcomes related to the underlying long-lived assets. the evaluation is performed at the lowest level for which separately identifiable cash flows exist. to estimate the fair value of these assets, we use two generally accepted valuation approaches, an income approach and a market approach. under the income approach, our discounted cash flow analysis includes the following inputs that are not readily available: a discount rate reflective of industry cost of capital, our estimated contract rates, volumes, operating margins, operating and maintenance costs and capital expenditures. under the market approach, our inputs include ebitda multiples, which are estimated from recent peer acquisition transactions, and forecasted ebitda, which incorporates inputs similar to those used under the income approach. if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and estimates or our assumptions and estimates change due to new information, we may be exposed to future impairment charges.
see notes a, f, g and n of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this annual report for additional discussion of goodwill and intangible assets, long-lived assets and investments in unconsolidated affiliates.
depreciation methods and estimated useful lives of property, plant and equipment - our property, plant and equipment are depreciated using the straight-line method that incorporates management assumptions regarding useful economic lives and residual values. as we place additional assets in service or acquire assets as a result of an acquisition or asset purchase, our estimates related to depreciation expense have become more significant and changes in estimated useful lives of our assets could have a material effect on our results of operations. at the time we place our assets in service, we believe such assumptions are reasonable; however, circumstances may develop that would cause us to change these assumptions, which would change our depreciation expense prospectively. examples of such circumstances include changes in (i) competition, (ii) laws and regulations that limit the estimated economic life of an asset, (iii) technology that render an asset obsolete, (iv) expected salvage values, (v) results of rate cases or rate settlements on regulated assets and (vi) forecasts of the remaining economic life for the resource basins where our assets are located, if any. for the fiscal years presented in this form 10-k, no changes were made to the determinations of useful lives that would have a material effect on the timing of depreciation expense in future periods.

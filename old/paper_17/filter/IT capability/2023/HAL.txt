table of contents management's report on internal control over financial reporting the management of halliburton company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in the securities exchange act rule 13a-15(f).
internal control over financial reporting, no matter how well designed, has inherent limitations. therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. further, because of changes in conditions, the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting may vary over time.
under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, we conducted an evaluation to assess the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31, 2023 based upon criteria set forth in the internal control - integrated framework
(2013) issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission.
based on our assessment, we believe that, as of december 31, 2023, our internal control over financial reporting is effective. the effectiveness of halliburton's internal control over financial reporting as of december 31, 2023 has been audited by kpmg llp, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report that is included herein.
table of contents report of independent registered public accounting firm to the shareholders and board of directors halliburton company:
opinion on the consolidated financial statements we have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of halliburton company and subsidiaries (the company)
as of december 31, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, cash flows and shareholders' equity for each of the years in the three-year period ended december 31, 2023, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). in our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the company as of december 31, 2023
and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended december 31, 2023, in conformity with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles.
we also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board (united states) (pcaob), the company's internal control over financial reporting as of december 31, 2023, based on criteria established in internal control - integrated framework (2013) issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission, and our report dated february 6, 2024 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the company's internal control over financial reporting.
basis for opinion these consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the company's management. our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. we are a public accounting firm registered with the pcaob and are required to be independent with respect to the company in accordance with the u.s. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the securities and exchange commission and the pcaob.
we conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the pcaob. those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. we believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
critical audit matter the critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1)
relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. the communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.
evaluation of the realizability of deferred tax assets as discussed in notes 1 and 12 to the consolidated financial statements, the company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the financial statements. a valuation allowance is provided for deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that these items will not be realized, which is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income. as of december 31,
2023, the company had gross deferred tax assets of $3.6 billion and a related valuation allowance of $0.8 billion.
we identified the evaluation of the realizability of domestic deferred tax assets as a critical audit matter. the evaluation of the realizability of domestic deferred tax assets, specifically related to foreign tax credits, required subjective auditor judgment to assess the forecasts of future taxable income over the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. changes in assumptions regarding forecasted taxable income, specifically revenue growth rates, could have an impact on the company's evaluation of the realizability of the domestic deferred tax assets.
table of contents the following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. we evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the critical audit matter.
this included controls related to the development of forecasts of future taxable income. we evaluated the assumptions used in the development of forecasts of future taxable income, specifically revenue growth rates, by comparing to historical actuals while considering current and anticipated future commodity prices or market events.
we also evaluated the company's history of realizing domestic deferred tax assets by evaluating the expiration of foreign tax credits.
/s/ kpmg llp we have served as the company's auditor since 2002.

opinion on internal control over financial reporting we have audited halliburton company and subsidiaries' (the company) internal control over financial reporting as of december 31, 2023, based on criteria established in internal control - integrated framework (2013) issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission. in our opinion, the company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31, 2023, based on criteria established in internal control - integrated framework (2013) issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission.

basis for opinion the company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying management's report on internal control over financial reporting. our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. we are a public accounting firm registered with the pcaob and are required to be independent with respect to the company in accordance with the u.s. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the securities and exchange commission and the pcaob.
we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the pcaob. those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.
our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
definition and limitations of internal control over financial reporting a company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. a company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

table of contents    item 8 | notes to consolidated financial statements halliburton company notes to consolidated financial statements note 1. description of company and significant accounting policies description of company halliburton company is one of the world's largest providers of products and services to the energy industry. its predecessor was established in 1919 and incorporated under the laws of the state of delaware in 1924. we help our customers maximize asset value throughout the lifecycle of the reservoir - from locating hydrocarbons and managing geological data, to drilling and formation evaluation, well construction and completion, and optimizing production throughout the life of the asset. we serve major, national, and independent oil and natural gas companies throughout the world and operate under twodivisions, which form the basis for the twooperating segments we report, the completion and production segment and the drilling and evaluation segment.
use of estimates our financial statements are prepared in conformity with united states generally accepted accounting principles, requiring us to make estimates and assumptions that affect:
- the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements; and
we believe the most significant estimates and assumptions are associated with the forecasting of our income tax
(provision) benefit and the valuation of deferred taxes, legal reserves, long-lived asset valuations, and allowance for credit losses. ultimate results could differ from our estimates.
basis of presentation the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of our company and all of our subsidiaries that we control or variable interest entities for which we have determined that we are the primary beneficiary. all material intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated. investments in companies in which we do not have a controlling interest, but over which we do exercise significant influence, are accounted for using the equity method of accounting, unless we elect the fair value option. if we do not have significant influence and the investment has no readily determinable fair value, we elect the measurement alternative. in addition, certain reclassifications of prior period balances have been made to conform to the current period presentation.
revenue recognition our services and products are generally sold based upon purchase orders or contracts with our customers that include fixed or determinable prices but do not include right of return provisions or other significant post-
delivery obligations. the vast majority of our service and product contracts are short-term in nature. we recognize revenue based on the transfer of control or our customers' ability to benefit from our services and products in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those services and products. we also assess our customers' ability and intention to pay, which is based on a variety of factors, including our historical payment experience with, and the financial condition of our customers. rates for services are typically priced on a per day, per meter, per man-hour, or similar basis.see note 4 for further information on revenue recognition.
research and development we maintain an active research and development program. the program improves products, processes, and engineering standards and practices that serve the changing needs of our customers. research and development costs are expensed as incurred and were $ 408million in 2023, $ 345million in 2022, and $ 321million in 2021.
cash equivalents we consider all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three monthsor less to be cash equivalents.
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. cost represents invoice or production cost for new items and original cost. production cost includes material, labor, and manufacturing overhead. our inventory is recorded on the weighted average cost method. we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and record provisions for excess or obsolete inventory based primarily on historical usage, estimated product demand, and technological developments.
table of contents    item 8 | notes to consolidated financial statements allowance for credit losses we establish an allowance for credit losses through a review of several factors, including historical collection experience, current aging status of the customer accounts, and current financial condition of our customers. losses are charged against the allowance when the customer accounts are determined to be uncollectible.
property, plant, and equipment other than those assets that have been written down to their fair values due to impairment, property, plant, and equipment are reported at cost less accumulated depreciation, which is generally provided on the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. accelerated depreciation methods are often used for tax purposes, when permitted. upon sale or retirement of an asset, the related costs and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any gain or loss is recognized. planned major maintenance costs are generally expensed as incurred. expenditures for additions, modifications, and conversions are capitalized when they increase the value or extend the useful life of the asset.
goodwill and other intangible assets we record as goodwill the excess purchase price over the fair value of the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business acquisition. changes in the carrying amount of goodwill are detailed below by reportable segment.

current year acquisitions                        8                             -           8

the reported amounts of goodwill for each reporting unit are reviewed for impairment on an annual basis, during the third quarter, and more frequently when circumstances indicate an impairment may exist. as a result of our goodwill impairment assessments performed in the years ended december 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, we determined that the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its net book value and, therefore, nogoodwill impairments were deemed necessary.
we amortize other identifiable intangible assets with a finite life on a straight-line basis over the period which the asset is expected to contribute to our future cash flows, ranging from one yearto twenty-eight years. the components of these other intangible assets generally consist of patents, license agreements, non-compete agreements, trademarks, and customer lists and contracts.
evaluating impairment of long-lived assets when events or changes in circumstances indicate that long-lived assets other than goodwill may be impaired, an evaluation is performed. for assets classified as held for use, we first group individual assets based on the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows from other assets. we then compare estimated future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset group to its carrying amount. if the asset group's undiscounted cash flows are less than its carrying amount, we then determine the asset group's fair value by using a discounted cash flow analysis and recognize any resulting impairment. when an asset is classified as held for sale, the asset's book value is evaluated and adjusted to the lower of its carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell. in addition, depreciation and amortization is ceased while it is classified as held for sale.see note 2 for further information on impairments and other charges.
income taxes we recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the year. in addition, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the financial statements or tax returns. a valuation allowance is provided for deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that these items will not be realized.
table of contents    item 8 | notes to consolidated financial statements in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. based upon the level of historical taxable income and projections for future taxable income over the periods in which the deferred tax assets are deductible, management believes it is more likely than not that we will realize the benefits of these deductible differences, net of the existing valuation allowances.
we recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the provision for income taxes on continuing operations in our consolidated statements of operations.
derivative instruments at times, we enter into derivative financial transactions to hedge existing or projected exposures to changing foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. we do not enter into derivative transactions for speculative or trading purposes. we recognize all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value. derivatives that are not hedges are adjusted to fair value which are reflected within "other, net" on our consolidated statements of operations. if the derivative is designated as a hedge, depending on the nature of the hedge, changes in the fair value of derivatives are either offset against:
- the change in fair value of the hedged assets, liabilities, or firm commitments through earnings; or
- recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings.
the ineffective portion of a derivative's change in fair value is recognized in earnings. recognized gains or losses on derivatives entered into to manage foreign currency exchange risk are included in "other, net" on the consolidated statements of operations. gains or losses on interest rate derivatives are included in "interest expense, net."
foreign currency translation foreign entities whose functional currency is the united states dollar translate monetary assets and liabilities at year-end exchange rates, and nonmonetary items are translated at historical rates. revenue and expense transactions are translated at the average rates in effect during the year, except for those expenses associated with nonmonetary balance sheet accounts, which are translated at historical rates. gains or losses from remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities due to changes in exchange rates are recognized in our consolidated statements of operations in "other, net" in the year of occurrence.
stock-based compensation stock-based compensation cost is measured at the date of grant, based on the calculated fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the employee's service period, which is generally the vesting period of the equity grant. additionally, compensation cost is recognized based on awards ultimately expected to vest, therefore, we have reduced the cost for estimated forfeitures based on historical forfeiture rates. forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and revised in subsequent periods to reflect actual forfeitures.see note 14 for additional information related to stock-based compensation.

during the year ended december 31, 2022, due to russia's invasion of ukraine and resulting sanctions imposed on russia, we made the decision to sell our russian operations and completed the sale in the third quarter of 2022. we wrote down the disposal group to fair value less costs to sell, which resulted in a pre-tax charge of $ 344million.
of this pre-tax charge, approximately $ 131million was attributable to our completion and production segment, approximately $ 178million was attributable to our drilling and evaluation segment, and $ 35million was selling costs and was attributable to corporate and other. we no longer conduct operations in russia. additionally, during the first quarter of 2022, we recorded a pre-tax charge of $ 22million primarily related to the write down of all our assets in ukraine. included in this charge is a $ 16million allowance for credit loss as we do not expect to collect our receivables in ukraine. long-lived asset impairments include impairments of property, plant, and equipment.
for the year ended december 31, 2021, $ 12million of impairments and other charges was recorded due to the decision to discontinue the proposed sale of our pipeline and process services business and as a result we recorded a $
36million charge for accumulated unrecognized depreciation and amortization expense during the period the associated assets were classified as held for sale. additionally, we finalized a structured transaction relating to most of our owned united states real estate. as a result of the transaction, we derecognized $ 358million of assets previously held for sale included in other current assets and recognized an investment in an unconsolidated subsidiary of $ 349million included in other assets, which resulted in a gain of $ 74million, due to specific assets with a carrying amount less than the fair value.
note 3. business segment and geographic information we operate under twodivisions, which form the basis for the twooperating segments we report: the completion and production segment and the drilling and evaluation segment. our equity in earnings and losses of unconsolidated affiliates that are accounted for using the equity method of accounting are included within cost of services and cost of sales on our statements of operations, which is part of operating income of the applicable segment.

operations by geographic region the following tables present information by geographic area. in 2023, 2022, and 2021, based on the location of services provided and products sold, 44%, 45%, and 40%, respectively, of our consolidated revenue was from the united states. no other country accounted for more than 10% of our revenue or property, plant, and equipment during the periods presented. as of december 31, 2023 and december 31, 2022, 59% and 54%, respectively, of our property, plant, and equipment was located in the united states.
note 4. revenue revenue is recognized based on the transfer of control or our customers' ability to benefit from our services and products in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those services and products. most of our service and product contracts are short-term in nature. in recognizing revenue for our services and products, we determine the transaction price of purchase orders or contracts with our customers, which may consist of fixed and variable consideration. we also assess our customers' ability and intention to pay, which is based on a variety of factors, including our historical payment experience with, and the financial condition of our customers. payment terms and conditions vary by contract type, although terms generally include a requirement of payment within 20to 60days. other judgments involved in recognizing revenue include an assessment of progress towards completion of performance obligations for certain long-term contracts, which involve estimating total costs to determine our progress towards contract completion, and calculating the corresponding amount of revenue to recognize.
disaggregation of revenue we disaggregate revenue from contracts with customers into types of services or products, consistent with our tworeportable segments, in addition to geographical area. based on the location of services provided and products sold, 44%, 45%, and 40% of our consolidated revenue was from the united states for the years ended december 31,
2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. no other country accounted for more than 10% of our revenue.
table of contents    item 8 | notes to consolidated financial statements the following table presents information on our disaggregated revenue.

contract balances we perform our obligations under contracts with our customers by transferring services and products in exchange for consideration. the timing of our performance often differs from the timing of our customer's payment, which results in the recognition of receivables and deferred revenue. deferred revenue represents advance consideration received from customers for contracts where revenue is recognized on future performance of service. deferred revenue, as well as revenue recognized during the period relating to amounts included as deferred revenue at the beginning of the period, was not material to our consolidated financial statements.
transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations remaining performance obligations represent firm contracts for which work has not been performed and future revenue recognition is expected. we have elected the practical expedient permitting the exclusion of disclosing remaining performance obligations for contracts that have an original expected duration of one yearor less. we have some long-term contracts related to software and integrated project management services such as lump sum turnkey contracts. for software contracts, revenue is generally recognized over the duration of the contract period when the software is considered to be a right to access our intellectual property. for lump sum turnkey projects, we recognize revenue over time using an input method, which requires us to exercise judgment. revenue allocated to remaining performance obligations for these long-term contracts is not material.
note 5. receivables as of december 31, 2023, 33% of our net trade receivables were from customers in the united states and 9% were from customers in mexico. as of december 31, 2022, 38% of our net trade receivables were from customers in the united states and 11% were from customers in mexico. receivables from our primary customer in mexico accounted for approximately 6% and 9% of our total receivables as of december 31, 2023 and december 31, 2022, respectively. while we have experienced payment delays in mexico, these amounts are not in dispute and we have not historically had, and we do not expect, any material write-offs due to collectability from this customer. noother country or single customer accounted for more than 10% of our receivables at those dates.
although the market environment has been improving, we continue to have risk of delayed customer payments and payment defaults associated with customer liquidity issues. we routinely monitor the financial stability of our customers and employ an extensive process to evaluate the collectability of outstanding receivables. this process, which involves judgment and estimates, includes analysis of our customers' historical time to pay, financial condition and various financial metrics, debt structure, credit ratings, and production profile, as well as political and economic factors in countries of operations and other customer-specific factors.

note 6. leases for operating leases, lease expense for lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term and accretion of the lease liability, while finance leases include both an operating expense and an interest expense component. for all leases with a term of 12 months or less, we recognize lease expense for these short-term leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
we are a lessee for numerous operating leases, primarily related to real estate, transportation, and equipment. the vast majority of our operating leases have remaining lease terms of 10years or less, some of which include options to extend the leases, and some of which include options to terminate the leases. we generally do not include renewal or termination options in our assessment of the leases unless extension or termination for certain assets is deemed to be reasonably certain. the accounting for some of our leases may require judgment, which includes determining whether a contract contains a lease, determining the incremental borrowing rates to utilize in our net present value calculation of lease payments for lease agreements which do not provide an implicit rate, and assessing the likelihood of renewal or termination options. we also have some lease agreements with lease and non-
lease components, which are generally accounted for as a single lease component. for certain equipment leases, such as offshore vessels and drilling rigs, we account for the lease and non-lease components separately.
the following tables illustrate the financial impact of our leases as of and for the years ended december 31, 2023,

we have agreements with third parties that allow our participating suppliers to finance payment obligations from us with designated third-party financial institutions who act as our paying agent. we have generally extended our payment terms with suppliers to 90 days. a participating supplier may request a participating financial institution to finance one or more of our payment obligations to such supplier prior to the scheduled due date thereof at a discounted price. we are not required to provide collateral to the financial institutions.
our obligations to participating suppliers, including amounts due and scheduled payment dates, are not impacted by the suppliers' decisions to finance amounts due under these financing arrangements. our outstanding payment obligations under these agreements were $ 322million as of december 31, 2023, and $ 273million as of december 31,

our tax returns are subject to review by the taxing authorities in the jurisdictions where we file tax returns. in most cases we are no longer subject to examination by tax authorities for years before 2012. the only significant operating jurisdiction that has tax filings under review or subject to examination by the tax authorities is the united states. the united states federal income tax filings for tax years 2016 through 2022 are currently under review or remain open for review by the irs.
as of december 31, 2023, the primary unresolved issue for the irs audit for 2016 relates to the classification of the $ 3.5billion ordinary deduction that we claimed for the termination fee we paid to baker hughes in the second quarter of 2016 for which we received a nopa from the irs on september 28, 2023. we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from tax examinations to determine the adequacy of our tax reserves, and we believe our income tax reserves are appropriately provided for all open tax years. we do not expect a final resolution of this issue in the next 12 months.
based on the information currently available, we do not anticipate a significant increase or decrease to our tax contingencies within the next 12 months.
note 13. shareholders' equity shares of common stock the following table summarizes total shares of common stock outstanding:
table of contents    item 8 | notes to consolidated financial statements our board of directors has authorized a program to repurchase a specified dollar amount of our common stock from time to time. the program does not require a specific number of shares to be purchased and the program may be effected through solicited or unsolicited transactions in the market or in privately negotiated transactions. the program may be terminated or suspended at any time. we purchased 22.7million shares of our common stock under the program during the year ended december 31, 2023. during the year ended december 31, 2022 we purchased 6.8million shares of our common stock under the program. approximately $ 4.1billion remained authorized for repurchases as of december 31, 2023. from the inception of this program in february 2006 through december 31, 2023, we repurchased approximately 253million shares of our common stock for a total cost of approximately $ 10.1billion.
paid-in capital in excess of par value during 2023, 2022 and 2021, we issued common stock from treasury shares under our employee stock purchase plan awards and for restricted stock grants. as a result, additional paid in capital would have resulted in a balance below zero. therefore, for the years ended december 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, we reduced retained earnings by $
98million, $ 275million, and $ 277million, respectively. additional issuances from treasury shares could similarly impact additional paid in capital and retained earnings.

tax our stock and incentive plan, as amended (stock plan), provides for the grant of any or all of the following types of stock-based awards:
- stock options, including incentive stock options and nonqualified stock options;
- restricted stock unit awards;
- stock value equivalent awards.
there are currently no stock appreciation rights, stock value equivalent awards, or incentive stock options outstanding. under the terms of the stock plan, approximately 264million shares of common stock have been reserved for issuance to employees and non-employee directors. at december 31, 2023, approximately 11million shares were available for future grants under the stock plan. the stock to be offered pursuant to the grant of an award under the stock plan may be authorized but unissued common shares or treasury shares.
table of contents    item 8 | notes to consolidated financial statements in addition to the provisions of the stock plan, we also have stock-based compensation provisions under the restricted stock plan for non-employee directors and the employee stock purchase plan (espp).
stock options there were nostock options granted during 2023 and there are no plans to grant stock options in 2024. all stock options under the stock plan were granted at the fair market value of our common stock at the grant date. employee stock options generally vest ratably over a period of three yearsand expire 10years from the grant date.
compensation expense for stock options is generally recognized on a straight line basis over the entire vesting period.

as of december 31, 2023, there was nounrecognized compensation cost, net of estimated forfeitures, related to nonvested stock options.
cash received from issuance of common stock for 2023, 2022, and 2021 was $ 136million, $ 229million, and $
79million, respectively, of which $ 48million, $ 148million, and $ 4million, respectively, are related to proceeds from exercises of stock options. all other cash received from issuance of common stock during 2023, 2022 and 2021
the fair value of options at the date of grant was estimated using the black-scholes option pricing model. the expected volatility of options granted was a blended rate based upon implied volatility calculated on actively traded options on our common stock and upon the historical volatility of our common stock. the expected term of options granted was based upon historical observation of actual time elapsed between date of grant and exercise of options for all employees. there were nostock options granted for the years ended december 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021.
restricted stock restricted shares issued under the stock plan are restricted as to sale or disposition. these restrictions generally lapse periodically over a period of five years. restrictions may also lapse for early retirement and other conditions in accordance with our established policies. upon termination of employment, shares on which restrictions have not lapsed must be returned to us, resulting in restricted stock forfeitures. the fair market value of the stock on the date of grant is amortized and charged to income on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award.
in 2023, we also granted performance based restricted stock units, with the actual number of shares earned to be determined at the end of a three year performance period based on our achievement of certain predefined targets.
these targets are based upon our average return on capital employed as compared to certain competitors and a modifier based upon stock performance compared to the oilfield services index (osx). a monte carlo simulation that uses a probabilistic approach was performed by an actuary to measure grant date fair value. the fair value of these performance based restricted stock units is recognized on a straight-line basis over the three year performance cycle.

$ 117million during 2021. as of december 31, 2023, there was $ 377million of unrecognized compensation cost, net of estimated forfeitures, related to nonvested restricted stock, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of three years.
employee stock purchase plan under the espp, eligible employees may have up to 10% of their earnings withheld, subject to some limitations, to be used to purchase shares of our common stock. the espp contains fourthree-month offering periods commencing on january 1, april 1, july 1, and october 1 of each year. the price at which common stock may be purchased under the espp in 2021, 2022, and 2023 is equal to 90% of the lower of the fair market value of the common stock on the commencement date or last trading day of each offering period. under the espp, 104million shares of common stock have been reserved for issuance, of which 76million shares have been sold through the espp since the inception of the plan through december 31, 2023 and 28million shares are available for future issuance. the stock to be offered may be authorized but unissued common shares or treasury shares.
the fair value of espp shares was estimated using the black-scholes option pricing model. the expected volatility was a one-year historical volatility of our common stock. the assumptions and resulting fair values were as follows:

table of contents    item 8 | notes to consolidated financial statements note 16. financial instruments and risk management the carrying amount of cash and equivalents, receivables, and accounts payable, as reflected in the consolidated balance sheets, approximates fair value due to the short maturities of these instruments.
the carrying amount and fair value of our total debt is as follows:

debt the total fair value of our debt increased during 2023 as a result of lower treasury yields which was partially offset by $ 300million in debt repurchases, as discussed in note 10.
our debt categorized within level 1 on the fair value hierarchy is calculated using quoted prices in active markets for identical liabilities with transactions occurring on the last two daysof period-end. our debt categorized within level 2 on the fair value hierarchy is calculated using significant observable inputs for similar liabilities where estimated values are determined from observable data points on our other bonds and on other similarly rated corporate debt or from observable data points of transactions occurring prior to two daysfrom period-end and adjusting for changes in market conditions. differences between the periods presented in our level 1
and level 2 classification of our long-term debt relate to the timing of when third party market transactions on our debt are executed. we have nodebt categorized within level 3 on the fair value hierarchy.
we are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. we selectively manage these exposures through the use of derivative instruments, including forward foreign exchange contracts, foreign exchange options and interest rate swaps. the objective of our risk management strategy is to minimize the volatility from fluctuations in foreign currency and interest rates. we do not use derivative instruments for trading purposes. the fair value of our forward contracts, options, and interest rate swaps was not material as of december 31, 2023 or december 31, 2022. the counterparties to our derivatives are primarily global commercial and investment banks.
foreign currency exchange risk we have operations in many international locations and are involved in transactions denominated in currencies other than the united states dollar, our functional currency, which exposes us to foreign currency exchange rate risk.
techniques in managing foreign currency exchange risk include, but are not limited to, foreign currency borrowing and investing, and the use of currency exchange instruments. we attempt to selectively manage significant exposures to potential foreign currency exchange losses based on current market conditions, future operating activities, and the associated cost in relation to the perceived risk of loss. the purpose of our foreign currency risk management activities is to minimize the risk that our cash flows from the purchase and sale of products and services in foreign currencies will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates.
we use forward contracts and options to manage our exposure to fluctuations in the currencies of certain countries in which we do business internationally. these instruments are not treated as hedges for accounting purposes, generally have an expiration date of one yearor less, and are not exchange traded. while these instruments are subject to fluctuations in value, the fluctuations are generally offset by the value of the underlying exposures being managed. the use of some of these instruments may limit our ability to benefit from favorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.
derivatives are not utilized to manage exposures in some currencies due primarily to the lack of available markets, cost considerations, or immaterial exposures (non-hedged currencies). we attempt to minimize foreign currency exposure in non-hedged currencies and recognize that pricing for the services and products offered in these countries should account for the cost of exchange rate devaluations.
table of contents    item 8 | notes to consolidated financial statements the notional amounts of open foreign exchange derivatives were $ 715million at december 31, 2023 and $ 650million at december 31, 2022. the notional amounts of these instruments do not generally represent amounts exchanged by the parties, and thus are not a measure of our exposure or of the cash requirements related to these contracts. the fair value of our foreign exchange derivatives as of december 31, 2023 and december 31, 2022 is included in both
"other current assets" and in "other current liabilities" in our consolidated balance sheets and was immaterial.
the fair value of these instruments is categorized within level 2 on the fair value hierarchy and was determined using a market approach with certain inputs, such as notional amounts hedged, exchange rates, and other terms of the contracts that are observable in the market or can be derived from or corroborated by observable data.
interest rate risk we are subject to interest rate risk on our debt and investment portfolios. we had fixed rate long-term debt totaling $ 7.6billion at december 31, 2023 and $ 7.9billion at december 31, 2022. we maintain an interest rate management strategy that is intended to mitigate the exposure to changes in interest rates.
credit risk financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk are primarily cash equivalents and net trade receivables. it is our practice to place our cash equivalents in high quality investments with various institutions. our net trade receivables are from a broad and diverse group of customers and are generally not collateralized. as of december 31, 2023, 33% of our net trade receivables were from customers in the united states and 9% were from customers in mexico. as of december 31, 2022, 38% of our net trade receivables were from customers in the united states and 11% were from customers in mexico. we maintain an allowance for credit losses based upon several factors, including historical collection experience, current aging status of the customer accounts and financial condition of our customers. see note 5 for further information.
during the fourth quarter of 2023, we entered into a credit default swap ("cds") with a third-party financial institution. the notional amount of the cds, which was $300 million at the end of january 2024, will reduce on a monthly basis over its 26-month term. the cds relates to a borrowing provided by the financial institution to one of our primary customers in mexico, a portion of the proceeds of which was utilized by this customer to pay certain of our outstanding receivables. the fair value of this derivative liability was not material at december 31, 2023.
we do not have any significant concentrations of credit risk with any individual counterparty to our derivative contracts. we select counterparties to those contracts based on our belief that each counterparty's profitability, balance sheet, and capacity for timely payment of financial commitments is unlikely to be materially adversely affected by foreseeable events.
note 17. retirement plans our company and subsidiaries have various plans that cover a significant number of our employees. these plans include defined contribution plans, defined benefit plans, and other postretirement plans:
- our defined contribution plans provide retirement benefits in return for services rendered. these plans provide an individual account for each participant and have terms that specify how contributions to the participant's account are to be determined rather than the amount of pension benefits the participant is to receive.
contributions to these plans are based on a percentage of pre-tax income, after-tax income, or discretionary amounts determined on an annual basis. our expense for the defined contribution plans totaled $ 181million in 2023,
$ 160million in 2022, and $ 136million in 2021. the increase in expense from 2022 to 2023 was due to headcount and salary increase for the year ended december 31, 2023.
- our defined benefit plans, which include both overfunded and underfunded pension plans, define an amount of pension benefit to be provided, usually as a function of age, years of service and/or compensation. the underfunded obligations and net periodic benefit cost of our united states defined benefit plans were not material for the periods presented; and
- our postretirement plans other than pensions are offered to specific eligible employees. the accumulated benefit obligations and net periodic benefit cost for these plans were not material for the periods presented.
funded status for our international pension plans, at december 31, 2023, the projected benefit obligation was $ 745million and the fair value of plan assets was $ 622million, which resulted in an underfunded obligation of $ 123million. at december 31, 2022, the projected benefit obligation was $ 669million and the fair value of plan assets was $
665million, which resulted in an underfunded obligation of $ 4million. the accumulated benefit obligation for our international plans was $ 672million at december 31, 2023 and $ 601million at december 31, 2022. the increase in projected benefit obligation and accumulated benefit obligation from 2022 to 2023 was due to assumption changes, mainly a decrease in discount rate.

risk management practices for these plans include diversification by issuer, industry, and geography, as well as the use of multiple asset classes and investment managers within each asset class. our investment strategy for our united kingdom pension plan, which constituted 75% of our international pension plans' projected benefit obligation at december 31, 2023 and is no longer accruing service benefits, aims to achieve full funding of the benefit obligation, with the plan's assets increasingly composed of investments whose cash flows match the projected liabilities of the plan.

table of contents    item 8 | notes to consolidated financial statements actuarial assumptions certain weighted-average actuarial assumptions used to determine benefit obligations of our international pension plans at december 31 were as follows:
certain weighted-average actuarial assumptions used to determine net periodic benefit cost of our international pension plans for the years ended december 31 were as follows:
expected long-term return on plan assets    3.8%    3.0%    2.7%
assumed long-term rates of return on plan assets, discount rates for estimating benefit obligations, and rates of compensation increases vary by plan according to local economic conditions. where possible, discount rates were determined based on the prevailing market rates of a portfolio of high-quality debt instruments with maturities matching the expected timing of the payment of the benefit obligations. expected long-term rates of return on plan assets were determined based upon an evaluation of our plan assets and historical trends and experience, taking into account current and expected market conditions.
other information contributions. funding requirements for each plan are determined based on the local laws of the country where such plan resides. in certain countries the funding requirements are mandatory, while in other countries they are discretionary. we currently expect to contribute $ 2million to our international pension plans in 2024.
benefit payments. expected benefit payments over the next 10years for our international pension plans are as follows: $ 38million in 2024, $ 35million in 2025, $ 37million in 2026, $ 39million in 2027, $ 42million in 2028, and an aggregate $ 247million in years 2029 through 2033.
note 18. new accounting pronouncements in november 2023, the financial accounting standard board (fasb) issued asu 2023-07, "segment reporting (topic
280)", which is intended to improve reportable segment disclosure requirements through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. the amendments require disclosure of significant segment expenses regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker (codm) as well as other segment items, extend certain annual disclosures to interim periods, clarify the applicability to single reportable segment entities, permit more than one measure of profit or loss to be reported under certain conditions, and require disclosure of the title and position of the codm. we expect to adopt the new disclosures as required for the year ended december 31, 2024. we are currently evaluating the impact on the related disclosures.
in december 2023, the fasb issued asu 2023-09, income taxes (topic 740): improvements to income tax disclosures, which requires the annual financial statements to include consistent categories and greater disaggregation of information in the rate reconciliation, and income taxes paid disaggregated by jurisdiction. asu 2023-09 is effective for the company's annual reporting periods beginning after december 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted, and should be applied on a prospective basis, with a retrospective option. we are currently evaluating the effect that adoption of asu 2023-09 will have on our disclosures.

item 7 | executive overview item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (md&a) should be read in conjunction with the consolidated and combined financial statements included in "item 8. financial statements and supplementary data" contained herein.
executive overview market conditions since early 2020, world-wide oil and natural gas supply and demand imbalances and related volatility of oil and natural gas prices (including as a result of the covid-19 pandemic) have resulted in dramatic fluctuations in oil and natural gas markets. the volatility continued in 2023 as markets were impacted by central bank rate hikes, macroeconomic uncertainty, non-opec supply growth, and renewed geopolitical unrest in the middle east. in the u.s., oil and natural gas production in 2023 remained elevated, despite a generally declining rig count, as a result of the industry's focus on efficiencies, higher service intensity, and high-quality acreage. lower commodity pricing and u.s. land rig counts generally contributed to softness in the market for energy products and services in north america, particularly in natural gas basins during the second half of 2023. conversely, the international rig count showed steady growth in 2023 largely driven by national oil companies (nocs) in the middle east/asia and africa.
globally, we continue to be impacted by increased supply chain lead times for the supply of select raw materials. we monitor market trends and work to mitigate cost impacts through economies of scale in global procurement, technology modifications, and efficient sourcing practices. also, while we have been impacted by inflationary cost increases, primarily related to chemicals, cement, and logistics costs, we generally try to pass much of those increases on to our customers and we believe we have effective solutions to minimize their operational impact.
financial results the following graph illustrates our revenue and operating margins for each operating segment over the past three years.
during 2023, we generated total company revenue of $23.0 billion, a 13% increase from the $20.3 billion of revenue generated in 2022, with our completion and production (c&p) segment revenue increasing by 18% and our drilling and evaluation (d&e) segment revenue increasing by 7%. we reported total company operating income of approximately $4.1 billion in 2023, compared to operating income of $2.7 billion in 2022. these increases were driven by increased demand for our products and services in all four of our geographic regions.
our north america revenue increased 9% in 2023 compared to 2022, despite a 4% decrease in average rig count from 2022, resulting from higher pressure pumping and artificial lift activity in north america land, increased completion tool sales in the gulf of mexico, and improved fluid and wireline services across the region.
internationally, revenue improved 17% in 2023 compared to 2022, primarily driven by higher activity for drilling and completions related services in latin america, africa, and the middle east/asia, which was partially offset by our exit from russia in the third quarter of 2022. the international average rig count for 2023 increased 11% compared to 2022.
item 7 | executive overview our operating performance and liquidity are described in more detail in "liquidity and capital resources" and "business environment and results of operations."
sustainability and energy mix transition in the first quarter of 2021, we announced our target to achieve a 40% reduction in our scope 1 and 2 emissions by 2035 from the 2018 baseline. during 2023, we continued to execute on priorities we set up to help us progress toward our 2035 emissions reduction target. as our customers have begun to invest more in emissions reduction, we have developed or are developing solutions intended to reduce our own carbon footprint while advancing our customers' decarbonization efforts. as the energy mix transition unfolds, we seek to apply our expertise and products and services across different parts of the energy value chain. we have also applied our experience and resources in sectors adjacent to our traditional oilfield services space, including carbon capture, utilization, and storage, hydrogen, and geothermal. finally, we will continue to focus on accelerating the success of clean tech start-ups via halliburton labs. as of december 31, 2023, halliburton labs had 32 participating companies and alumni. halliburton labs allows us to participate in the energy mix transition at relatively low risk by investing our expertise, resources, and team without a significant outlay of capital.
our sustainability efforts were recognized in 2023 as we were named to the dow jones sustainability north america index for the third consecutive year. the djsi assesses the sustainability performances of companies using a transparent, rules-based process based on the annual s&p global corporate sustainability assessment (csa), among its industry peers.
additionally, we published our 2022 annual and sustainability report (asr) in april of 2023, which details our strategy and progress on sustainability issues, as well as our efforts on increased environmental reporting transparency, including conducting a climate-risk scenario analysis. information on our website, including the asr, is not incorporated by reference into this annual report on form 10-k.
item 7 | liquidity and capital resources liquidity and capital resources we had $2.3 billion of cash and equivalents as of december 31, 2023 and december 31, 2022, respectively.
•cash flows from operating activities were $3.5 billion. working capital, which consists of receivables, inventories, and accounts payable, collectively had a negative impact of $511 million, primarily due to increased receivables and inventory.
•capital expenditures were $1.4 billion.
•we repurchased 22.7 million shares of our common stock for $800 million.
future sources and uses of cash we manufacture most of our own equipment, which provides us with some flexibility to increase or decrease our capital expenditures based on market conditions. we currently expect capital spending for 2024 to be approximately 6% of revenue. we believe this level of spend will allow us to invest in our key strategic technologies, including the construction and deployment of our zeus electric fracturing systems in north america, our istar intelligent drilling and logging platform, and our icruise intelligent rotary steerable system. we will continue to maintain capital discipline and monitor the rapidly changing market dynamics, and we may adjust our capital spend accordingly.
in 2024, we expect to pay approximately $518 million for contractual purchase obligations (with another $211 million due through 2026), $397 million of interest on debt, and $391 million under our leasing arrangements. payments for interest on our debt arrangements are expected to remain relatively flat for the foreseeable future. see note 6 and note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on expected future payments under our leasing arrangements and debt maturities.
we are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of cash outflows associated with our uncertain tax positions, in part because we are unable to predict the timing of potential tax settlements with applicable taxing authorities. as of december 31, 2023, we had $268 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits, excluding penalties and interest, of which we estimate $235 million may require us to make a cash payment. we estimate that approximately $158 million of the cash payment will not be settled within the next 12 months.
while we maintain focus on liquidity and debt reduction, we are also focused on providing cash returns to our shareholders. in january of 2023, our board approved a capital return framework with a goal of returning at least 50% of our annual free cash flow to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. we returned $1.4 billion of capital to shareholders in 2023 through buybacks and dividends. during 2023, our quarterly dividend rate was $0.16 per common share, or approximately $144 million in the aggregate. in january 2024, we announced that our board of directors declared a dividend of $0.17 per common share for the first quarter of 2024, or approximately $152 million in the aggregate.
we may utilize share repurchases as part of our capital return framework. our board of directors has authorized a program to repurchase our common stock from time to time. we repurchased 22.7 million shares of common stock during the year ended december 31, 2023. approximately $4.1 billion remained authorized for repurchases under our program as of december 31, 2023 and may be used for open market and other share purchases.
during the second quarter of 2023, we began our migration to sap s4 which we expect to complete by the end of 2025. the migration is estimated to cost approximately $250 million, of which we have incurred $51 million through december 31, 2023. for 2024, we expect to spend approximately $120 million. we believe the new system will enhance visibility to our operations and provide important efficiency benefits, cost savings, and advanced analytics that will benefit us and our customers.
we do not intend to incur additional debt in 2024, as we believe our cash on hand and earnings from operations are sufficient to cover our obligations for the year.
item 7 | liquidity and capital resources other factors affecting liquidity financial position in current market. as of december 31, 2023, we had $2.3 billion of cash and equivalents and $3.5 billion of available committed bank credit under a revolving credit facility with an expiration date of april 27, 2027. we believe we have a manageable debt maturity profile, with approximately $472 million coming due beginning in 2025 through 2027. furthermore, we have no financial covenants or material adverse change provisions in our bank agreements, and our debt maturities extend over a long period of time. we believe our cash on hand, cash flows generated from operations, and our available credit facility provide sufficient liquidity to address the challenges and opportunities of the current market and our expected global cash needs for 2024, including capital expenditures, working capital investments, shareholder returns, if any, and debt repurchases, if any, and scheduled interest and principal payments.
guarantee agreements. in the normal course of business, we have agreements with financial institutions under which approximately $2.6 billion letters of credit, bank guarantees, or surety bonds were outstanding as of december 31, 2023. some of the outstanding letters of credit have triggering events that would entitle a bank to require cash collateralization, however, none of these triggering events have occurred. as of december 31, 2023, we had no material off-balance sheet liabilities and were not required to make any material cash distributions to our unconsolidated subsidiaries.
during the fourth quarter of 2023, we entered into a credit default swap ("cds") with a third-party financial institution. the notional amount of the cds, which was $300 million at the end of january 2024, will reduce on a monthly basis over its 26-month term. the cds relates to a borrowing provided by the financial institution to one of our primary customers in mexico, a portion of the proceeds of which was utilized by this customer to pay certain of our outstanding receivables.
credit ratings. our credit ratings with standard & poor's (s&p) remained bbb+ for our long-term debt and a-2 for our short-term debt, with an upgrade to positive outlook from stable outlook in november 2023. during the third quarter of 2023, our long-term debt rating with moody's investors service (moody's) was upgraded to a3 from baa1 and the short-term debt rating remained p-2, with a stable outlook. as of the end of the year our long-term debt rating with moody's remained a3 and short-term debt rating remained p-2, with a stable outlook.
customer receivables. in line with industry practice, we bill our customers for our services in arrears and are, therefore, subject to our customers delaying or failing to pay our invoices. in weak economic environments, we may experience increased delays and failures to pay our invoices due to, among other reasons, a reduction in our customers' cash flow from operations and their access to the credit markets, as well as unsettled political conditions.
receivables from our primary customer in mexico accounted for approximately 6% of our total receivables as of december 31, 2023. while we have experienced payment delays from our primary customer in mexico, these amounts are not in dispute and we have not historically had, and we do not expect to have, any material write-offs due to collectability of receivables from this customer.
item 7 | business environment and results of operations business environment and results of operations we operate in more than 70 countries throughout the world to provide a comprehensive range of services and products to the energy industry. our revenue is generated from the sale of services and products to major, national, and independent oil and natural gas companies worldwide. the industry we serve is highly competitive with many substantial competitors in each segment of our business. in 2023, 2022, and 2021, based on the location of services provided and products sold, 44%, 45%, and 40%, respectively, of our consolidated revenue was from the united states. no other country accounted for more than 10% of our revenue.
activity within our business segments is significantly impacted by spending on upstream exploration, development, and production programs by our customers. also impacting our activity is the status of the global economy, which impacts oil and natural gas consumption.
some of the more significant determinants of current and future spending levels of our customers are oil and natural gas prices and our customers' expectations about future prices, global oil supply and demand, completions intensity, the world economy, the availability of capital, government regulation, and global stability, which together drive worldwide drilling and completions activity. lower oil and natural gas prices usually translate into lower exploration and production budgets and lower rig count, while the opposite is usually true for higher oil and natural gas prices. our financial performance is therefore significantly affected by oil and natural gas prices and worldwide rig activity, which are summarized in the tables below.
the table below shows the average prices for west texas intermediate (wti) crude oil, united kingdom brent crude oil, and henry hub natural gas.
(2)                     natural gas price measured in dollars per million british thermal units (btu), or mmbtu.
the historical average rig counts based on the weekly baker hughes rig count data were as follows:
item 7 | business environment and results of operations business outlook looking ahead, we expect oil and natural gas demand to continue to grow over the next several years as easing inflationary pressures across the organization for economic co-operation and development (oecd) countries increase the likelihood for central bank rate cuts, abating fears of a macroeconomic slowdown. we believe long-term expansion of the global economy will continue to increase demands on all forms of energy. we expect oil and natural gas remains a critical component of the global energy mix. the international energy agency's december 2023 "oil market report" forecasts 2024 global oil demand to reach 102.7 million barrels per day, an increase of 1% from 2023.
we believe that oil demand growth will be driven by resilient global economic growth and increases in transportation activity. in addition, we think oil supply dynamics have fundamentally changed due to, among other things, investor return requirements, and regulatory initiatives adverse to oil and natural gas exploration and production and that promote alternative energy, any of which could limit supply growth. we believe that despite the changes in oil supply dynamics, increased investment in existing and new sources of production is the only solution to increase supply and that production will be needed from conventional and unconventional, deep-water and shallow-water, and short and long-cycle projects. we expect that increased production requirements will in turn create demand for our products and services.
internationally, we expect oil and natural gas exploration and production activity to grow during 2024. although we anticipate regional differences in growth rates for 2024, we believe the middle east/asia regions will likely experience the greatest increases in activity, with other regions closely behind. we expect growth in both onshore and offshore markets, as well as services related to carbon capture, utilization, and storage. the "short term energy outlook" published by the united states energy information administration (eia) predicts that u.s. oil production will average 13.1 million barrels per day in 2024, an increase of 1% as compared to 2023. as a result, we expect stable exploration and production activity levels in the u.s.
item 7 | results of operations in 2023 compared to 2022
favorable                 percentage millions of dollars                       2023            2022        (unfavorable)                     change revenue:

n/m = not meaningful operating segments completion and production completion and production revenue was $13.7 billion in 2023, an increase of $2.1 billion, or 18%, compared to 2022. operating income was $2.8 billion in 2023, a 39% increase from $2.0 billion in 2022. these results were primarily driven by higher pressure pumping activity in north america land, as well as improved completion tool sales globally. partially offsetting these increases was decreased activity in russia due to our exit from the country.
drilling and evaluation drilling and evaluation revenue was $9.3 billion in 2023, an increase of $614 million, or 7%, from 2022. operating income was $1.5 billion in 2023, an increase of $251 million, or 19%, compared to 2022. these results were primarily attributable to increased fluid services and drilling activity globally and higher wireline activity in the western hemisphere, africa, and the middle east/asia. partially offsetting these increases were decreased activity in russia due to our exit from the country and lower project management activity in saudi arabia.
geographic regions north america north america revenue was $10.5 billion in 2023, a 9% increase compared to 2022, resulting from improved pressure pumping and artificial lift activity in north america land, increased fluid and wireline services across the region, and higher completion tool sales in the gulf of mexico. partially offsetting these increases were lower drilling-related activity and decreased well intervention services in north america land.
item 7 | results of operations in 2023 compared to 2022
latin america latin america revenue was $4.0 billion in 2023, a 25% increase compared to 2022, resulting from improvements across multiple product service lines in brazil, mexico, and argentina. partly offsetting these increases was lower project management activity in the caribbean, ecuador, and colombia.
europe/africa/cis europe/africa/cis revenue was $2.9 billion in 2023, a 6% increase compared to 2022, resulting from increased activity across multiple product service lines in africa and higher drilling-related services in norway. partially offsetting these increases were the sale of our russian operations during the third quarter of 2022, as well as decreased wireline activity, lower completion tool sales and decreased testing services in norway, and lower drilling-related activity and decreased testing services in algeria.
middle east/asia middle east/asia revenue was $5.7 billion in 2023, an 18% increase compared to 2022, resulting from increased activity across multiple product service lines in saudi arabia, the united arab emirates, qatar, indonesia, and malaysia, and higher drilling services and improved wireline activity in thailand. partially offsetting these improvements were lower project management activity in saudi arabia and lower stimulation activity and decreased well intervention services in kuwait.
other operating items impairments and other charges. during 2023, there were no amounts recorded in impairment and other charges. during 2022, we recognized $366 million of charges, primarily related to a $344 million write down of all our net assets in russia as a result of our decision to sell our russia operations due to the sanctions enacted against russia arising from the conflict in ukraine. see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion on these charges.
nonoperating items argentina blue chip swap. the central bank of argentina maintains currency controls that limit our ability to access u.s. dollars in argentina and remit cash from our argentine operations. the execution of certain trades known as blue chip swaps, effectively results in a parallel u.s. dollar exchange rate. this parallel rate, which cannot be used as the basis to remeasure our net monetary assets in u.s. dollars under u.s. gaap, was 20% higher than argentina's official exchange rate at december 31, 2023. for the year ended december 31, 2023, we entered into blue chip swap transactions, which resulted in a $110 million pre-tax loss on investment.
argentina currency impact. argentina devalued its peso by more than 50% during december 2023. consequently, we incurred a loss of $131 million for the year ended december 31, 2023 due to the devaluation of the currency in argentina.
loss on early extinguishment of debt. during the year ended december 31, 2022, we recorded a $42 million loss on the early redemption of $600 million aggregate principal amount of our 3.8% senior notes due november 2025, which included premiums and unamortized expenses. see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for further information.
income tax provision. during the year ended december 31, 2023, we recorded a total income tax provision of $701 million on pre-tax income of $3.4 billion, resulting in an effective tax rate of 20.8%. the effective tax rate for 2023 was primarily impacted by our geographic mix of earnings, tax adjustments related to the reassessment of prior year tax accruals, and changes of valuation allowance on some of our deferred tax assets. during 2022, we recorded a total income tax provision of $515 million on pre-tax income of $2.1 billion, resulting in an effective tax rate of 24.4%. see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for significant drivers of these tax provisions.
item 7 | results of operations in 2023 compared to 2022
pillar two. the oecd recently enacted model rules for a new global minimum tax framework, also known as pillar two, and certain governments globally have enacted, or are in the process of enacting, legislation considering these model rules. we have considered the possible implication of the legislation passed or in consideration of being passed, and we do not believe these rules will have a material impact on our taxes in the near future.
internal revenue service notice of proposed adjustment. we are subject to taxes in the united states and in numerous jurisdictions where we operate or where our subsidiaries are organized. our tax returns are routinely subject to examination by the taxing authorities in the jurisdictions where we file tax returns. in most cases we are no longer subject to examination by tax authorities for years before 2012. the only significant operating jurisdiction that has tax filings under review or subject to examination by the tax authorities is the united states. our united states federal income tax filings for tax years 2016 through 2022, including carry back of 2016 net operating losses to 2014, are currently under review or remain open for review by the internal revenue service (the irs).
on september 28, 2023, we received a notice of proposed adjustment (nopa) from the irs covering our 2016 us tax return. the nopa proposed an adjustment to reclassify approximately 95% of the $3.5 billion termination fee paid to baker hughes in 2016 from an ordinary expense deduction to a capital loss. the termination fee was paid to baker hughes under the merger agreement after antitrust regulators in multiple jurisdictions failed to approve our proposed merger. it is common commercial practice to include a termination fee in a merger agreement to compensate the target for damages incurred when the acquisition does not go forward. the irs's long-understood position at the time of the payment had been to treat such payments as an ordinary and necessary business expense. we strongly disagree with the proposed adjustment on both a factual and legal basis, and we plan to vigorously contest it.
we expect that resolving this dispute will take substantial time. in december 2023, we initiated the irs administrative appeals process, which may take more than 12 months to complete. failing a resolution through that process, the matter would ultimately be resolved by the united states federal courts.
we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from tax examinations to determine the adequacy of our tax reserves, and we believe our income tax reserves are appropriately provided for all open tax years. we cannot assure you that the matter will be determined in our favor or against us, and if the matter is ultimately determined unfavorably to us, it could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and cash flows. based on tax attributes currently available, we estimate that, should the irs's position prevail through its appellate process and subsequent litigation, the proposed adjustment could result in cash taxes due of approximately $650 million (plus interest thereon in the case of amounts due for previous tax years). our estimates are calculated under current tax law and on the bases of our assumptions regarding taxable income and loss and other tax attributes over the relevant period, which law could change and which assumptions could and likely will differ materially from actual results. in any event, no payment of any additional tax is currently required, nor do we anticipate that the proposed adjustment would materially and adversely impact our ability to meet our expected uses of cash, including future capital expenditures, working capital investments, and scheduled debt repayments, or our ability to return cash to shareholders, even if a final determination of the matter is reached that is adverse to us.
item 7 | results of operations in 2022 compared to 2021
information related to the comparison of our operating results between the years 2022 and 2021 is included in "item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" of our 2022 form 10-k filed with the sec and is incorporated by reference into this annual report on form 10-k.
item 7 | critical accounting estimates critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements requires the use of judgments and estimates. our critical accounting policies are described below to provide a better understanding of how we develop our assumptions and judgments about future events and related estimates and how they can impact our financial statements. a critical accounting estimate is one that requires our most difficult, subjective, or complex judgments and assessments and is fundamental to our results of operations. we identified our most critical accounting estimates to be:
-    forecasting our income tax (provision) benefit, including our future ability to utilize foreign tax credits and the realizability of deferred tax assets (including net operating loss carryforwards), and providing for uncertain tax positions;
-    legal and investigation matters;
-    valuations of long-lived assets, including intangible assets and goodwill; and
-    allowance for credit losses.
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions we believe to be reasonable according to the current facts and circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. we believe the following are the critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements, as well as the significant estimates and judgments affecting the application of these policies. this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this report.
income tax accounting we recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and use an asset and liability approach in recognizing the amount of deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. we apply the following basic principles in accounting for our income taxes:
-    a current tax liability or asset is recognized for the estimated taxes payable or refundable on tax returns for the current year;
-    a deferred tax liability or asset is recognized for the estimated future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards;
-    the measurement of current and deferred tax liabilities and assets is based on provisions of the enacted tax law, and the effects of potential future changes in tax laws or rates are not considered; and
-    the value of deferred tax assets is reduced, if necessary, by the amount of any tax benefits that, based on available evidence, are not expected to be realized.
we determine deferred taxes separately for each tax-paying component (an entity or a group of entities that is consolidated for tax purposes) in each tax jurisdiction. that determination includes the following procedures:
-    measuring the total deferred tax liability for taxable temporary differences using the applicable tax rate;
-    measuring the total deferred tax asset for deductible temporary differences and operating loss carryforwards using the applicable tax rate;
-    measuring the deferred tax assets for each type of tax credit carryforward; and
-    reducing the deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if, based on available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
our methodology for recording income taxes requires a significant amount of judgment and the use of assumptions and estimates. additionally, we use forecasts of certain tax elements, such as taxable income and foreign tax credit utilization, as well as evaluate the feasibility of implementing tax planning strategies. given the inherent uncertainty involved with the use of such variables, there can be significant variation between anticipated and actual results that could have a material impact on our income tax accounts related to continuing operations.
item 7 | critical accounting estimates we have operations in more than 70 countries. consequently, we are subject to the jurisdiction of a significant number of taxing authorities. the income earned in these various jurisdictions is taxed on differing bases, including net income actually earned, net income deemed earned, and revenue-based tax withholding. our tax filings are routinely examined in the normal course of business by tax authorities. the final determination of our income tax liabilities involves the interpretation of local tax laws, tax treaties and related authorities in each jurisdiction, as well as the significant use of estimates and assumptions regarding the scope of future operations and results achieved, the timing and nature of income earned and expenditures incurred. the final determination of tax audits or changes in the operating environment, including changes in tax law and currency/repatriation controls, could impact the determination of our income tax liabilities for a tax year and have an adverse effect on our financial statements. for example, we received a nopa from the irs on september 28, 2023. see "managements's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - nonoperating items, internal revenue service notice of proposed adjustment" and note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for further information.
tax filings of our subsidiaries, unconsolidated affiliates and related entities are routinely examined in the normal course of business by tax authorities. these examinations may result in assessments of additional taxes, which we work to resolve with the tax authorities and through the judicial process. predicting the outcome of disputed assessments involves some uncertainty. factors such as the availability of settlement procedures, willingness of tax authorities to negotiate, and the operation and impartiality of judicial systems vary across the different tax jurisdictions and may significantly influence the ultimate outcome. we review the facts for each assessment, and then utilize assumptions and estimates to determine the most likely outcome and provide taxes, interest, and penalties, as needed based on this outcome. we provide for uncertain tax positions pursuant to current accounting standards, which prescribe a minimum recognition threshold and measurement methodology that a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements. the standards also provide guidance for derecognition classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and transition.
legal and investigation matters as discussed in note 11 of our consolidated financial statements, we are subject to various legal and investigation matters arising in the ordinary course of business. as of december 31, 2023, we have accrued an estimate of the probable and estimable costs for the resolution of some of our legal and investigation matters, which is not material to our consolidated financial statements. for other matters for which the liability is not probable and reasonably estimable, we have not accrued any amounts. attorneys in our legal department monitor and manage all claims filed against us and review all pending investigations. generally, the estimate of probable costs related to these matters is developed in consultation with internal and outside legal counsel representing us. our estimates are based upon an analysis of potential results, assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies. the accuracy of these estimates is impacted by, among other things, the complexity of the issues and the amount of due diligence we have been able to perform. we attempt to resolve these matters through settlements, mediation, and arbitration proceedings when possible. if the actual settlement costs, final judgments, or fines, after appeals, differ from our estimates, there may be a material adverse effect on our future financial results. we have in the past recorded significant adjustments to our initial estimates of these types of contingencies.
value of long-lived assets, including intangible assets and goodwill we carry a variety of long-lived assets on our balance sheet including property, plant, and equipment, goodwill, and other intangibles. impairment is the condition that exists when the carrying amount of a long-lived asset exceeds its fair value, and any impairment charge that we record reduces our operating income. goodwill is the excess of the cost of an acquired entity over the net of the amounts assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed. we conduct impairment tests on goodwill annually, during the third quarter, or more frequently whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate an impairment may exist. we conduct impairment tests on long-lived assets, other than goodwill, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
when conducting an impairment test on long-lived assets, other than goodwill, we first group individual assets based on the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows from other assets. this requires some judgment. we then compare estimated future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset group to its carrying amount. if the undiscounted cash flows are less than the asset group's carrying amount, we then determine the asset group's fair value by using a discounted cash flow analysis. this analysis is based on estimates such as management's short-term and long-term forecast of operating performance, including revenue growth rates and expected profitability margins, estimates of the remaining useful life and service potential of the assets within the asset group, and a discount rate based on our weighted average cost of capital. an impairment loss is measured and recorded as the amount by which the asset group's carrying amount exceeds its fair value. see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of impairments and other charges.
item 7 | critical accounting estimates we perform our goodwill impairment assessment for each reporting unit, which is the same as our reportable segments, the completion and production division and the drilling and evaluation division, comparing the estimated fair value of each reporting unit to the reporting unit's carrying value, including goodwill. we estimate the fair value for each reporting unit using a discounted cash flow analysis based on management's short-term and long-term forecast of operating performance. this analysis includes significant assumptions regarding discount rates, revenue growth rates, expected profitability margins, forecasted capital expenditures, and the timing of expected future cash flows based on market conditions. if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is not considered impaired. if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, an impairment loss is measured and recorded.
the impairment assessments discussed above incorporate inherent uncertainties, including projected commodity pricing, supply and demand for our services, and future market conditions, which are difficult to predict in volatile economic environments and could result in impairment charges in future periods if actual results materially differ from the estimated assumptions utilized in our forecasts. if market conditions deteriorate, including crude oil prices significantly declining and remaining at low levels for a sustained period of time, we could be required to record additional impairments of the carrying value of our long-lived assets in the future which could have a material adverse impact on our operating results. see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for our accounting policies related to long-lived assets.
allowance for credit losses we evaluate our global accounts receivable through a continuous process of assessing our portfolio on an individual customer and overall basis. this process consists of a thorough review of historical collection experience, current aging status of the customer accounts, financial condition of our customers, and whether the receivables involve retainages. we also consider the economic environment of our customers, both from a marketplace and geographic perspective, in evaluating the need for an allowance. based on our review of these factors, we establish or adjust allowances for specific customers. this process involves judgment and estimation, and frequently involves significant dollar amounts. accordingly, our results of operations can be affected by adjustments to the allowance due to actual write-offs that differ from estimated amounts.
at december 31, 2023, our allowance for credit losses totaled $742 million, or 13.9% of notes and accounts receivable before the allowance. at december 31, 2022, our allowance for credit losses totaled $731 million, or 14.7% of notes and accounts receivable before the allowance. the allowance for credit losses in both years is primarily comprised of accounts receivable from our primary customer in venezuela. a hypothetical 100 basis point change in our estimate of the collectability of our notes and accounts receivable balance as of december 31, 2023 would have resulted in a $54 million adjustment to 2023 total operating costs and expenses. see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for further information.
financial instrument market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. we selectively manage these exposures through the use of derivative instruments, including forward foreign exchange contracts, foreign exchange options, and interest rate swaps. the objective of our risk management strategy is to minimize the volatility from fluctuations in foreign currency and interest rates. we do not use derivative instruments for trading purposes. the counterparties to our forward contracts, options, and interest rate swaps are global commercial and investment banks.
we use a sensitivity analysis model to measure the impact of potential adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. with respect to foreign exchange sensitivity, after consideration of the impact from our forward foreign exchange contracts and options, a hypothetical 10% adverse change in the value of all our foreign currency positions relative to the united states dollar as of december 31, 2023 would result in a $85 million, pre-tax loss for our net monetary assets denominated in currencies other than united states dollars. as of december 31, 2023, we did not have any interest rate swaps outstanding and our outstanding debt has fixed interest rates.
there are certain limitations inherent in the sensitivity analysis presented, primarily due to the assumption that exchange rates and interest rates change instantaneously in an equally adverse fashion. in addition, the analyses are unable to reflect the complex market reactions that normally would arise from the market shifts modeled. while this is our best estimate of the impact of the various scenarios, these estimates should not be viewed as forecasts.

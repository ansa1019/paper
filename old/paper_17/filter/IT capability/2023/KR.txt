item 1a.   risk factors.
there are risks and uncertainties that can affect our business. the significant risk factors are discussed below. the following information should be read together with "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations," which includes forward-looking statements and factors that could cause us not to realize our goals or meet our expectations.
our proposed transaction with albertsons creates incremental business, regulatory and reputational risks on october 13, 2022, we entered into a merger agreement with albertsons companies inc. ("albertsons"), which sets forth the terms of our proposed transaction. in connection with the proposed transaction, kroger and albertsons entered into a comprehensive divestiture plan with c&s wholesale grocers, llc for the combined sale of certain stores, distribution centers, offices and private label brands. the proposed transaction with albertsons and the divestiture plan entails important risks, including, among others: the expected timing and likelihood of completion of the proposed transaction and divestiture plan, including the timing, receipt and terms and conditions of any required governmental and regulatory clearance of the proposed transaction and divestiture plan, and/or resolution of pending litigation challenging the merger; the effect of the proposed divestiture plan; the occurrence of any event, change or other circumstances that could give rise to the termination of the merger agreement or divestiture agreement; the outcome of any legal proceedings that have been instituted and may in the future be instituted against the parties and others following announcement of the merger agreement and proposed transaction or divestiture plan; the inability to consummate the proposed transaction or divestiture plan due to the failure to satisfy other conditions to complete the proposed transaction or divestiture plan; risks that the proposed transaction or divestiture plan disrupts our current plans and operations; the ability to identify and recognize, including on the expected timeline, the anticipated total shareholder return ("tsr"), revenue and ebitda expectations; the amount of the costs, fees, expenses and charges related to the proposed transaction or divestiture plan; the risk that transaction and/or integration costs are greater than expected, including as a result of conditions regulators put on any approvals of the transaction; the potential effect of the announcement and/or consummation of the proposed transaction or divestiture plan on relationships, including with associates, suppliers and competitors; our ability to maintain an investment grade credit rating; the risk that management's attention is diverted from other matters; risks related to the potential effect of general economic, political and market factors, including changes in the financial markets as a result of inflation or measures implemented to address inflation, and any epidemic, pandemic or disease outbreaks, on kroger, albertsons or the proposed transaction or divestiture plan; the risk of adverse effects on the market price of our or albertsons's securities or on albertsons's or our operating results for any reason; the occurrence of any event, change or other circumstances that could give rise to the termination of the merger agreement or divestiture agreement; and other risks described in our filings with the sec.
integration of new business and strategic alliances in addition to the above, we enter into mergers, acquisitions and strategic alliances with expected benefits including, among other things, operating efficiencies, procurement savings, innovation and sharing of best practices, that may allow for future growth. achieving the anticipated or desired benefits may be subject to a number of significant challenges and uncertainties, including, without limitation, whether unique corporate cultures will work collaboratively in an efficient and effective manner, the coordination of geographically separate organizations, the possibility of imprecise assumptions underlying expectations regarding potential synergies, capital requirements, and the integration process (including the integration of internal controls into our business operations), unforeseen expenses and delays and competitive factors in the marketplace. we could also encounter unforeseen transaction and integration-related costs or other circumstances such as unforeseen liabilities or other issues. many of these potential circumstances are outside of our control and any of them could result in increased costs, decreased revenue, decreased synergies and the diversion of management time and attention. if we are unable to achieve our objectives within the anticipated time frame, or at all, the expected benefits may not be realized fully or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
competitive environment the operating environment for the food retailing industry continues to be characterized by the proliferation of local, regional, and national retailers, including both retail and digital formats, and intense and ever-increasing competition ranging from online retailers, mass merchant, club stores, regional chains, deep discounters, and dollar stores, as well as ethnic, specialty and natural food stores. with the proliferation of grocery delivery - both by retailers and third-party delivery service providers - customers have an even wider range of retailers from which to choose. customers continue to expect a great shopping experience both in-store and online. the industry continues to be shaped by e-commerce, cooking at home and prepared foods to go and other customer needs and preferences. customers want to be able to shop on their own terms with zero compromise whether at brick and mortar stores or online, pick-up or delivery, depending on their particular trip needs and other factors. if we do not appropriately or accurately anticipate customer preferences or fail to quickly adapt to these ever-changing preferences, our sales and profitability could be adversely affected. if we fail to meet the evolving needs of our customers, our ability to compete and our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows could be adversely affected.
we are continuing to enhance the customer connection with investments in our four strategic pillars - seamless, personalization, fresh, and our brands. each of these strategies is designed to better serve our customers and to generate customer loyalty and sustainable growth momentum. we believe our plans to continue to improve these four strategic pillars will enable us to meet the wide-ranging needs and expectations of our customers. if we are unable to continue to enhance the foregoing key elements of our connection with customers, or they fail to strengthen customer loyalty, our ability to compete and our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows could be adversely affected. our ecosystem monetizes the traffic and data insights generated by our retail grocery business to create fast-growing, asset-light and margin-rich revenue streams. growth in loyal households, customer traffic and digitally engaged customers allow us to grow profits and power the flywheel in our model. we may be unsuccessful in implementing our alternative profit strategy, which could adversely affect our business growth and our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. the nature and extent to which our competitors respond to the evolving and competitive industry by developing and implementing their competitive strategies could adversely affect our profitability.
in addition, evolving customer preferences and the advancement of online, delivery, ship to home and mobile channels in our industry increase the competitive environment. we must anticipate and meet these evolving customer preferences and continue to implement technology, software and processes to be able to conveniently and cost-effectively fulfill customer orders. providing flexible fulfillment options and implementing new technology is complex and may not meet customer preferences. if we are not successful in reducing or offsetting the cost of fulfilling orders outside of our in-store channel with efficiencies, cost-savings, expense reductions, or alternative revenues, our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows could be adversely affected.
in addition, if we do not successfully develop and maintain a relevant digital experience for our customers, our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows could be adversely affected. digital retailing is rapidly evolving, and we must keep pace with new developments by our competitors as well as the evolving needs and preferences of our customers. we must compete by offering a convenient shopping experience for our customers regardless of how they choose to shop with us, and by investing in providing and maintaining relevant customer-facing apps and interfaces that have the features customers want that are also reliable and easy to use. the future success of the digital business will also depend on the efficiency and cost effectiveness of fulfilling orders across our modalities, whether in store, in pickup-only locations or through customer fulfillment centers powered by ocado.
product safety customers count on kroger to provide them with safe food and drugs and other merchandise. concerns regarding the safety of the products that we sell could cause shoppers to avoid purchasing certain products from us, or to seek alternative sources of supply even if the basis for the concern is outside of our control. any lost confidence on the part of our customers would be difficult and costly to reestablish. we could be adversely affected by personal injury or product liability claims, product recalls, or other health and safety issues, which occur from time to time. if we sell products that cause illness or injury to customers, resulting from product contamination or spoilage, the presence of certain substances, or damage caused in handling, storage or transportation, we could be exposed to claims or litigation. any issue regarding the safety of items, whether our brands items manufactured by us or for us or cpg products we sell, regardless of the cause, could have a substantial and adverse effect on our reputation, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
employee matters nearly two-thirds of our associates are covered by collective bargaining agreements with unions, and our relationship with those unions, including a prolonged work stoppage affecting a substantial number of locations, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. we are a party to approximately 350 collective bargaining agreements. upon the expiration of our collective bargaining agreements, work stoppages by the affected workers could occur (and have occurred in the past) if we are unable to negotiate new contracts with labor unions. in addition, changes to national labor policy could affect labor relations with our associates and relationships with unions. further, if we are unable to control health care, pension and wage costs, or if we have insufficient operational flexibility under our collective bargaining agreements, we may experience increased operating costs and an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
we have committed to paying fair wages and providing the benefits that were collectively bargained with the united food and commercial workers ("ufcw") and other labor unions representing associates. our ability to control labor and benefit costs is subject to numerous internal and external factors, including regulatory changes, wage rates, and healthcare and other insurance costs. changes to wage regulations, including further increases in the minimum wage or ordinances related to pay or working conditions enacted by local governments, could have an effect on our future financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. our ability to meet our labor needs, while controlling wages and other costs, is subject to numerous external factors, including the available qualified workforce in each area where we are located, unemployment levels within those areas, wage rates, and changes in employment and labor laws.
our continued success depends on the ongoing contributions of our associates, including members of our senior management and other key personnel. we must recruit, hire, develop and retain qualified associates with an increasingly large range of skills to meet the needs of our evolving and complex business. we compete with other retail and non-retail businesses for these associates and invest significant resources in training and motivating them. competition among potential employers has resulted, and may in the future result, in increased associate costs and has from time to time affected our ability to recruit and retain associates. we may not be able to attract or retain sufficient highly qualified associates in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
data and technology our business is increasingly dependent on information technology systems that are complex and vital to continuing operations, resulting in an expansion of our technological presence and corresponding risk exposure. if we were to experience difficulties maintaining or operating existing systems or implementing new systems, we could incur significant losses due to disruptions in our operations. as we modernize legacy systems, if we are unable to successfully implement those systems in a coordinated manner across internal and external stakeholders, we could be subject to business interruption or reputation risk with our customers, suppliers or associates.
through our sales and marketing activities, we collect and store some personal information that our customers provide to us. we also gather and retain information about our associates in the normal course of business. under certain circumstances, we may share information with vendors that assist us in conducting our business, as required by law, or otherwise in accordance with our privacy policy.
our technology systems have been, and may be in the future, disrupted from circumstances beyond our control, as we regularly defend against and respond to data security incidents. cyber-attackers have targeted and accessed, and may in the future again target and, if successful, access information stored in our or our vendors' systems in order to misappropriate confidential customer or business information. due to ongoing geopolitical conflicts, there is an increased possibility of cyberattacks that could either directly or indirectly affect our operations. although we have implemented procedures to protect our information, and require our vendors to do the same, we cannot be certain that our security systems will successfully defend against, or be able to effectively respond to, rapidly evolving, increasingly sophisticated cyber-attacks as they become more difficult to detect and defend against. further, a kroger associate, a contractor or other third party with whom we do business may in the future circumvent our security measures in order to obtain information or may inadvertently cause a breach involving information. in addition, hardware, software or applications we may use may have inherent defects, vulnerabilities, or could be inadvertently or intentionally applied or used in a way that could compromise our information security.
our cybersecurity program, continued investment in our information technology systems, and our processes to evaluate and select vendors with reasonable information security controls may not effectively insulate us from potential attacks, data breaches or disruptions to our business operations, which could result in a loss of customers or business information, negative publicity, damage to our reputation, and exposure to claims from customers, financial institutions, regulatory authorities, payment card associations, associates and other persons. any such events could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows and may not be covered by our insurance. in addition, compliance with privacy and information security laws and standards may result in significant expense due to increased investment in technology and the development of new operational processes and may require us to devote significant management resources to address these issues. the costs of attempting to protect against the foregoing risks and the costs of responding to cyber-attacks are significant. following a cyber-attack, our and/or our vendors' remediation efforts may not be successful, and a cyber-attack could result in interruptions, delays or cessation of service, and loss of existing or potential customers. in addition, breaches of our and/or our vendors' security measures and the unauthorized dissemination of sensitive personal information or confidential information about us or our customers could expose our customers' private information and our customers to the risk of financial or medical identity theft, or expose us or other third parties to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, and result in investigations, regulatory enforcement actions, material fines and penalties, loss of customers and business relationships, litigation or other actions which could have a material adverse effect on our brands, reputation, business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
data governance failures can adversely affect our reputation and business. our business depends on our customers' willingness to entrust us with their personal information. events that adversely affect that trust, including inadequate disclosure to our customers of our uses of their information, failures to honor new and evolving data privacy rights, failing to keep our information technology systems and our customers' sensitive information secure from significant attack, theft, damage, loss or unauthorized disclosure or access, whether as a result of our action or inaction (including human error) or that of our business associates, vendors or other third parties, could adversely affect our brand and reputation and operating results and also could expose and/or has exposed us to mandatory disclosure to the media, litigation (including class action litigation), governmental investigations and enforcement proceedings, material fines, penalties and/or remediation costs, and compensatory, special, punitive and statutory damages, consent orders, and/or injunctive relief, any of which could adversely affect our businesses, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. large scale data breaches at other entities, including supply chain security vulnerabilities, increase the challenge we and our vendors face in maintaining the security of our information technology systems and proprietary information and of our customers' information. there can be no assurance that such failures will not occur, or if any do occur, that we will detect them or that they can be sufficiently remediated.
the use of data by our business and our business associates is highly regulated. privacy and information-security laws and regulations change, and compliance with them may result in cost increases due to, among other things, systems changes and the development of new processes. if we, our third-party service providers, or those with whom we share information fail to comply with laws and regulations, or self-regulatory regimes, that apply to all or parts of our business, such as section 5 of the ftc act, the california consumer privacy act (ccpa), the health insurance portability and accountability act (hipaa), or applicable international laws such as the eu general data protection regulation (gdpr), our reputation could be damaged, possibly resulting in lost business, and we could be subjected to additional legal risk or financial losses as a result of non-compliance.
payment systems we accept payments using a variety of methods, including cash and checks, select credit and debit cards, and kroger pay, a mobile payment solution. as we offer new payment options to our customers, we may be subject to additional rules, regulations, compliance requirements, and higher fraud losses. for certain payment methods, we pay interchange and other related acceptance fees, along with additional transaction processing fees. we rely on third parties to provide payment transaction processing services for credit and debit cards. it could disrupt our business if these companies become unwilling or unable to provide these services to us, including due to short term disruption of service. we are also subject to evolving payment card association and network operating rules, including data security rules, certification requirements and rules governing electronic funds transfers. for example, we are subject to payment card industry data security standards ("pci dss"), which contain compliance guidelines and standards with regard to our security surrounding the physical and electronic storage, processing and transmission of individual cardholder data. if our payment card terminals or internal systems are breached or compromised, we may be liable for card re-issuance costs and other costs, subject to fines and higher transaction fees, and lose our ability to accept card payments from our members, or if our third-party service providers' systems are breached or compromised, our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows could be adversely affected.
indebtedness our indebtedness could reduce our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, mergers and acquisitions or other purposes and could make us vulnerable to future economic downturns as well as competitive pressures. if debt markets do not permit us to refinance certain maturing debt, we may be required to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness. changes in our credit ratings, or in the interest rate environment, could have an adverse effect on our financing costs and structure.
legal proceedings and insurance from time to time, we are a party to legal proceedings, including matters involving personnel and employment issues, personal injury, contract disputes, regulatory claims and other proceedings. other legal proceedings purport to be brought as class actions on behalf of similarly situated parties. some of these proceedings could result in a substantial loss to kroger. we estimate our exposure to these legal proceedings and establish accruals for the estimated liabilities, where it is reasonably possible to estimate and where an adverse outcome is probable. assessing and predicting the outcome of these matters involves substantial uncertainties. adverse outcomes in these legal proceedings, or changes in our evaluations or predictions about the proceedings, could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. please also refer to the "litigation" section in note 12 to the consolidated financial statements.
we use a combination of insurance and self-insurance to provide for potential liability for workers' compensation, automobile and general liability, property, director and officers' liability, cyber risk exposure and associate health care benefits. any actuarial projection of losses is subject to a high degree of variability. with respect to insured matters, we are liable for retention amounts that vary by the nature of the claim, and some losses may not be covered by insurance. changes in legal claims, trends and interpretations, variability in inflation rates, changes in the nature and method of claims settlement, benefit level changes due to changes in applicable laws, insolvency of insurance carriers, and changes in discount rates could all affect our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
multi-employer pension obligations as discussed in more detail below in "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations-critical accounting policies-multi-employer pension plans," kroger contributes to several multi-employer pension plans based on obligations arising under collective bargaining agreements with unions representing associates covered by those agreements. we believe the present value of actuarially accrued liabilities in most of these multi-employer plans exceeds the value of the assets held in trust to pay benefits, and we expect that kroger's contributions to most of these funds will increase over the next few years. a significant increase to those funding requirements could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. despite the fact that the pension obligations of these funds are not the liability or responsibility of the company, except as noted below, there is a risk that the agencies that rate our outstanding debt instruments could view the underfunded nature of these plans unfavorably, or adjust their current views unfavorably, when determining their ratings on our debt securities. any downgrading of our debt ratings likely would adversely affect our cost of borrowing and access to capital.
we also currently bear the investment risk of two multi-employer pension plans in which we participate. in addition, we have been designated as the named fiduciary of these funds with sole investment authority of the assets of these funds. if investment results fail to meet our expectations, we could be required to make additional contributions to fund a portion of or the entire shortfall, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
fuel we sell a significant amount of fuel in our 1,665 fuel centers, which could face increased regulation, including due to climate change or other environmental concerns, and demand could be affected by concerns about the effect of emissions on the environment as well as retail price increases. we are unable to predict future regulations, environmental effects, political unrest, acts of war or terrorism, disruptions to the economy, including but not limited to pandemics and other health crises, geopolitical conflicts and other matters that affect the cost and availability of fuel, and how our customers will react to such factors, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
economic conditions our operating results could be materially affected by changes in overall economic conditions and other economic factors that affect consumer confidence and spending, including discretionary spending. future economic conditions affecting disposable consumer income such as employment levels, business conditions, overall economic slowdown or recession, changes in housing market conditions, changes in government benefits such as snap/ebt, student loan relief, or child care credits, the availability of credit, interest rates, inflation, disinflation or deflation, tax rates and other matters could reduce consumer spending. inflation could materially affect our operating results through increases to our cost of goods, supply chain costs and labor costs. in addition, the economic factors listed above, or any other economic factors or circumstances resulting in higher transportation, labor, insurance or healthcare costs or commodity prices, and other economic factors can increase our merchandise costs and operating, general and administrative expenses and otherwise adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. increased fuel prices also have an effect on consumer spending and on our costs of producing and procuring products that we sell. a deterioration in overall economic conditions, including the uncertainty caused by inflation rate volatility, could adversely affect our business in many ways, including slowing sales growth, reducing overall sales and reducing gross margins. geopolitical and catastrophic events, such as wars and conflicts, civil unrest, acts of terrorism or other acts of violence, including active shooter situations (which have occurred in the past at our locations), or the loss of merchandise as a result of shrink or industry-wide theft and organized retail crime, or pandemics or other health crises, and other matters that could reduce consumer spending, could materially affect our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. we regularly maintain cash balances at third-party financial institutions in excess of the federal deposit insurance corporation ("fdic") insurance limit and are therefore reliant on banks and other financial institutions to safeguard and allow ready access to these assets. if banks or financial institutions enter receivership or become insolvent in the future in response to financial conditions affecting the banking system and financial markets, our ability to access our existing cash, cash equivalents and investments may be threatened. we are unable to predict how the global economy and financial markets will perform. if the global economy and financial markets do not perform as we expect, it could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
our operating results could be adversely affected by any future disease outbreak, including pandemics, epidemics, or similar widespread health concerns. we cannot predict with certainty the extent that our operations may be affected by any effects of the foregoing on us or on our customers, suppliers, vendors, and other business partners, and each of their financial conditions; however, any adverse effect on these parties could materially and adversely affect us. to the extent that any health crisis affects the u.s. and global economy and our business, it may also heighten other risks described in this section, including but not limited to those related to consumer behavior and expectations, competition, implementation of strategic initiatives, cybersecurity threats, payment-related risks, supply chain disruptions, labor availability and cost, litigation and operational risk as a result of regulatory requirements.
legal and government regulation we are subject to various laws, regulations, and administrative practices that affect our business, including laws and regulations involving antitrust and competition, privacy, data protection, environmental, healthcare, anti-bribery, anti-corruption, tax, accounting, and financial reporting or other matters. these and other rapidly changing laws, regulations, policies and related interpretations, as well as increased enforcement actions by various governmental and regulatory agencies, create challenges for us, may alter the environment in which we do business and may increase the ongoing costs of compliance, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. if we are unable to continue to meet these challenges and comply with all laws, regulations, policies and related interpretations, it could negatively affect our reputation and our business results. additionally, we are currently, and in the future may be, subject to a number of inquiries, investigations, claims, proceeding, and requests for information from governmental agencies or private parties, the adverse outcomes of which could harm our business. failure to successfully manage these new or pending regulatory and legal matters and resolve such matters without significant liability or damage to our reputation may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. furthermore, if new or pending legal or regulatory matters result in fines or costs in excess of the amounts accrued to date, that may also materially affect our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
in addition, increasing governmental and societal attention to environmental, social, and governance ("esg") matters, including expanding voluntary reporting, diligence, and disclosure on topics such as climate change, waste production, water usage, human capital, labor, and risk oversight, could expand the nature, scope, and complexity of matters that we are required to control, assess, and report and could negatively affect our reputation. given our commitment to our esg strategy, we have established and publicly announced certain goals which we may refine or even expand further in the future. the execution of this strategy to achieve these goals is subject to risks and uncertainties, many of which may be outside of our control and prove to be more costly than we anticipate. these risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, our ability to achieve our goals within the currently projected costs and the expected timeframes; unforeseen operational and technological difficulties; the outcome of research efforts and future technology developments; and the success of our collaborations with and reliance on third parties. any failure, or perceived failure, to achieve these goals or the setting or publication of certain targets could damage our reputation and customer, investor and other stakeholder relationships, and may even result in regulatory enforcement action. such conditions could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
additionally, we must comply with numerous provisions regulating, among other things, health and sanitation standards, food labeling and safety, equal employment opportunity, minimum wages and licensing for the sale of food, drugs, and alcoholic beverages. we cannot predict future laws, regulations, interpretations, administrative orders, or applications, or the effect they will have on our operations. they could, however, significantly increase the cost of doing business. they also could require the reformulation of some of the products that we sell (or manufacture for sale to third parties) to meet new standards. we also could be required to recall or discontinue the sale of products that cannot be reformulated. these changes could result in additional record keeping, expanded documentation of the properties of certain products, expanded or different labeling, or scientific substantiation. any or all of these requirements could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
weather, natural disasters and other events a large number of our stores, distribution facilities and fulfillment centers are geographically located in areas that are susceptible to hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, droughts, ice and snow storms and earthquakes. weather conditions and natural disasters have, and may again in the future, disrupt our operations at one or more of our facilities, interrupt the delivery of products to our stores, substantially increase the cost of products, including supplies and materials and substantially increase the cost of energy needed to operate our facilities or deliver products to our facilities. moreover, the effects of climate change, including those associated with extreme weather events, may affect our ability to procure needed commodities at costs and in quantities that are optimal for us or at all. adverse weather or natural disasters and other matters that could reduce consumer spending, could materially affect our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
climate impact the long-term effects of global climate change present both physical risks, such as extreme weather conditions or rising sea levels, and transition risks, such as regulatory or technology changes, which are expected to be widespread and unpredictable. these changes could over time affect, for example, the availability and cost of products, commodities and energy including utilities, which in turn may affect our ability to procure goods or services required for the operation of our business at the quantities and levels we require. in addition, many of our operations and facilities are in locations that may be affected by the physical risks of climate change, and we face the risk of losses incurred as a result of physical damage to stores, distribution or fulfillment centers, loss or spoilage of inventory and business interruption caused by such events. we also use natural gas, diesel fuel, gasoline and electricity in our operations, all of which could face increased regulation and cost increases as a result of climate change or other environmental concerns. transitioning to alternative energy sources, such as renewable electricity or electric vehicles, and investments in new technologies, could incur higher costs. regulations limiting greenhouse gas emissions and energy inputs will also increase in coming years, which may increase our costs associated with compliance, tracking, reporting, and sourcing. these events and their effects could otherwise disrupt and adversely affect our operations and could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
supply chain disruption in our global supply chain could negatively affect our business. the products we sell are sourced from a wide variety of domestic and international vendors, and any future disruption in our supply chain or inability to find qualified vendors and access products that meet requisite quality and safety standards in a timely and efficient manner could adversely affect our business. the loss or disruption of such supply arrangements for any reason, labor disputes, loss or impairment of key manufacturing sites, acts of war or terrorism, disruptive global political events, quality control issues, a supplier's financial distress, natural disasters or health crises, regulatory actions or ethical sourcing issues, trade sanctions or other external factors over which we have no control, could interrupt product supply and, if not effectively managed and remedied, have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.
the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of the kroger co. should be read in conjunction with the "forward-looking statements" section set forth in part i and the "risk factors" section set forth in item 1a of part i. md&a is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto contained in item 8 of this report, as well as part ii, item 7 "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" of our form 10-k for the year ended january 28, 2023, which provides additional information on comparisons of fiscal years 2022 and 2021.
our value creation model - delivering consistent and attractive total shareholder return kroger's proven value creation model is allowing us to deliver today and invest for the future. the foundation of our value creation model is our omnichannel retail business, including fuel and health and wellness. by executing on our go-to-market strategy built on the four pillars of fresh, our brands, personalization and seamless, we are creating a shopping experience that builds loyalty and grows sales. our retail business generates traffic and data which accelerates growth in our high operating margin alternative profit businesses, like kroger precision marketing. in turn, the value generated from these businesses enables us to reinvest back into our retail business.
we are focused on enhancing our pillars and delivering an exceptional customer experience to accelerate this flywheel effect. by expanding our store network and improving our digital capabilities, we expect to grow households and increase sales. kroger has evolved into a more diverse business, with a model that provides more ways than ever to generate net earnings growth.
●   growing identical sales without fuel. our plan involves maximizing growth opportunities in our retail business and is supported by continued strategic investments in our associates, greater value for our customers and our seamless ecosystem to ensure we deliver a full, fresh and friendly experience for every customer, every time. as more and more customers incorporate ecommerce into their permanent routines, we expect digital sales to grow at a double-digit rate - a faster pace than other food at home sales - over time; and
●   expanding operating margin through long-term initiatives in gross margin, growing alternative profit businesses, and productivity and cost saving initiatives that are focused on simplifying processes and utilizing technology to enhance the associate experience without affecting the customer experience. together, these will enable us to improve operating margin, while balancing strategic price investments for customers and wage and benefit investments for associates.
we expect to continue to generate strong free cash flow and are committed to being disciplined with capital deployment in support of our value creation model and stated capital allocation priorities. our first priority is to invest in the business through attractive high return opportunities that drive long-term sustainable net earnings growth. we are committed to maintaining our current investment grade debt rating and our net total debt to adjusted ebitda ratio target range of 2.30 to 2.50. we also expect to continue to grow our dividend over time and return excess cash to shareholders via stock repurchases, subject to board approval. during the third quarter of 2022, we paused our share repurchase program to prioritize de-leveraging following the proposed merger with albertsons.
we expect our value creation model will result in total shareholder return within our target range of 8% to 11% over time, which does not contemplate the effect of the proposed merger with albertsons.
2023 executive summary we achieved strong results in 2023, in line with our long-term growth model and built on three consecutive years of growth, despite navigating a challenging operating environment. by maintaining our long-term commitment to lower prices, through personalized promotions and rewards, we are increasing customer visits and growing loyal households through the strength of our retail business, continuing our evolution into a more diverse business, and our value creation model is providing us multiple ways to drive sustainable future growth.
our results provided another proof point of the strength and resilience of our value creation model, which supported another year of strong free cash flow and adjusted net earnings per diluted share growth, excluding the 53rd week in fiscal year 2023 (the "extra week"). this was the result of continued momentum across several margin expansion initiatives, strong our brands performance, strong growth in alternative profit businesses, our ability to effectively manage product cost through strong sourcing practices, lower supply chain costs and a lower year-over-year lifo charge. during the year, we continued to invest in wages and the associate experience as a way to support the delivery of a full, fresh and friendly customer experience. in 2023, we increased associate wages resulting in an average hourly rate of nearly $19, and a rate of nearly $25 with comprehensive benefits factored in, which is a 33% increase in rate in the last five years.

(1)   identical sales without fuel would have grown 2.3% in fiscal 2023 if not for the reduction in pharmacy sales from the previously communicated termination of our agreement with express scripts effective december 31, 2022. in fiscal 2023, the terminated agreement had a positive effect on the fifo gross margin rate, excluding fuel and the extra week, and a negative effect on the og&amp;a rate, excluding fuel, the extra week and the 2023 and 2022 adjusted items, as defined below. the overall net effect on adjusted fifo operating profit was slightly positive.
overview notable items for 2023 are:
●   achieved operating profit of $3.1 billion, which represents a 25% decrease compared to 2022. the 2023 results reflect charges of $1.5 billion related to our opioid settlement charges.
●   achieved adjusted fifo operating profit excluding the extra week of $4.8 billion, which represents a 6% decrease compared to 2022. including the extra week, adjusted fifo operating profit decreased 2% compared to 2022.
●   identical sales, excluding fuel, increased 0.9%. identical sales, excluding fuel, would have grown 2.3% in 2023 if not for the reduction in pharmacy sales from our termination of our agreement with express scripts effective december 31, 2022. this terminated agreement had no material effect on profitability.
●   digital sales grew to $12 billion in annual sales. digital sales include products ordered online and picked up at our stores and our delivery and ship solutions. excluding the extra week, digital sales increased 12%, which was led by strength in our delivery solutions, which grew by 25%. delivery solutions growth was driven by our boost membership program and expansion of our kroger delivery network. our delivery solutions include orders delivered to customers from retail store locations, customer fulfillment centers powered by ocado and orders placed through third-party platforms. our ship solutions primarily include online orders placed through our owned platforms that are dispatched using mail service or third-party courier.
●   alternative profit streams contributed $1.3 billion of operating profit in 2023.
●   during the second quarter of 2023, we recognized opioid settlement charges of $1.4 billion, $1.1 billion net of tax, related to the nationwide opioid settlement framework to settle substantially all opioid lawsuits and claims against kroger. we have agreed to make settlement payments related to the nationwide settlement framework of approximately $1.2 billion in equal installments over 11 years, and $177 million in equal installments over six years. during the first quarter of 2023, we recognized opioid settlement charges of $62 million, $49 million net of tax, related to all pending and future opioid litigation claims with the state of west virginia, which are payable over 10 years. for additional information about our opioid settlement charges in 2023, see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements.
●   on september 8, 2023, kroger and albertsons announced they have entered a definitive agreement with c&amp;s wholesale grocers, llc for the combined sale of 413 stores, eight distribution centers, two offices and five private label brands for approximately $1.9 billion cash, in connection with the proposed merger, subject to customary adjustments. the financial terms of this divestiture plan are in line with what we expected and allow us to reaffirm the shareholder value creation opportunity the proposed merger creates. for additional information about the proposed merger with albertsons, see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements.
we also utilize the data and traffic generated by our retail business to deliver incremental value and services for our customers that generate alternative profit streams. these alternative profit streams would not exist without our core retail business.
our revenues are predominately earned and cash is generated as consumer products are sold to customers in our stores, fuel centers and via our online platforms. we earn income predominately by selling products at price levels that produce revenues in excess of the costs we incur to make these products available to our customers. such costs include procurement and distribution costs, facility occupancy and operational costs, and overhead expenses. our retail operations, which represent 97% of our consolidated sales, is our only reportable segment.
stores as of february 3, 2024, kroger operates supermarkets under a variety of local banner names in 35 states and the district of columbia. as of february 3, 2024, kroger operated, either directly or through its subsidiaries, 2,722 supermarkets, of which 2,257 had pharmacies and 1,665 had fuel centers. we connect with customers through our expanding seamless ecosystem and the consistent delivery of a full, fresh, and friendly customer experience. fuel sales are an important part of our revenue, net earnings and loyalty offering. our fuel strategy is to include a fuel center at each of our supermarket locations when it is feasible and it is expected to be profitable.
seamless digital ecosystem we offer a convenient shopping experience for our customers regardless of how they choose to shop with us, including pickup, delivery and ship. we offer pickup and harris teeter expresslanetm - personalized, order online, pick up at the store services - at 2,350 of our supermarkets and provide delivery, which allows us to offer digital solutions to substantially all of our customers. our delivery solutions include orders delivered to customers from retail store locations, customer fulfillment centers powered by ocado and orders placed through third-party platforms. these channels allow us to serve customers anything, anytime, and anywhere with zero compromise on selection, convenience, and price. we also provide relevant customer-facing apps and interfaces that have the features customers want that are also reliable, easy to use and deliver a seamless customer experience across our store and digital channels.
merchandising and manufacturing our brands products play an important role in our merchandising strategy and represented over $31 billion of our sales in 2023. we own 33 food production plants, primarily bakeries and dairies, which supply approximately 30% of our brands units and 43% of the grocery category our brands units sold in our supermarkets; the remaining our brands items are produced to our strict specifications by outside manufacturers.
our data we are evolving into a more diverse business. the traffic and data generated by our retail business, including pharmacies and fuel centers, is enabling this transformation. kroger serves approximately 62 million households annually and because of our rewards program, over 95% of customer transactions are tethered to a kroger loyalty card. our 20 years of investment in data science capabilities is allowing us to utilize this data to create personalized experiences and value for our customers and is also enabling our fast-growing, high operating margin alternative profit businesses, including data analytic services and third-party media revenue. our retail media business - kroger precision marketing - provides best in class media capabilities for our consumer packaged goods partners and other industry verticals. it is a key driver of our digital profitability and alternative profit.
proposed merger with albertsons as previously disclosed, on october 13, 2022, we entered into a merger agreement with albertsons. the proposed merger is expected to accelerate our go-to-market strategy that includes fresh, our brands, personalization and seamless, and continue our track record of investments across lowering prices, enhancing the customer experience, and increasing associate wages and benefits. for additional information about the proposed merger with albertsons, see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements.
use of non-gaap financial measures the accompanying consolidated financial statements, including the related notes, are presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("gaap"). we provide non-gaap measures, including first-in, first-out ("fifo") gross margin, fifo operating profit, adjusted fifo operating profit, adjusted net earnings and adjusted net earnings per diluted share because management believes these metrics are useful to investors and analysts. these non- gaap financial measures should not be considered as an alternative to gross margin, operating profit, net earnings and net earnings per diluted share or any other gaap measure of performance. these measures should not be reviewed in isolation or considered as a substitute for our financial results as reported in accordance with gaap.
we calculate fifo gross margin as fifo gross profit divided by sales. fifo gross profit is calculated as sales less merchandise costs, including advertising, warehousing, and transportation expenses, but excluding the last-in, first-out ("lifo") charge. merchandise costs exclude depreciation and rent expenses. fifo gross margin is an important measure used by management, and management believes fifo gross margin is a useful metric to investors and analysts because it measures the merchandising and operational effectiveness of our go-to-market strategy.
we calculate fifo operating profit as operating profit excluding the lifo charge. fifo operating profit is an important measure used by management, and management believes fifo operating profit is a useful metric to investors and analysts because it measures the operational effectiveness of our financial model.
the adjusted net earnings, adjusted net earnings per diluted share and adjusted fifo operating profit metrics are important measures used by management to compare the performance of core operating results between periods. we believe adjusted net earnings, adjusted net earnings per diluted share and adjusted fifo operating profit are useful metrics to investors and analysts because they present more accurate year-over-year comparisons of our net earnings, net earnings per diluted share and fifo operating profit because adjusted items are not the result of our normal operations. net earnings for 2023 include $179 million, $144 million net of tax, due to the extra week. in addition, net earnings for 2023 include the following, which we define as the "2023 adjusted items:"
●   charges to operating, general and administrative expenses ("og&amp;a") of $316 million, $268 million net of tax, for merger related costs and $1.5 billion, $1.2 billion net of tax, for opioid settlement charges (the "2023 og&amp;a adjusted items").
●   a gain in other income (expense) of $151 million, $116 million net of tax, for the unrealized gain on investments (the "2023 other income (expense) adjusted items").
net earnings for 2022 include the following, which we define as the "2022 adjusted items:"
●   charges to operating, general and administrative expenses ("og&amp;a") of $25 million, $19 million net of tax, for obligations related to withdrawal liabilities for certain multi-employer pension funds, $20 million, $15 million net of tax, for the revaluation of home chef contingent consideration, $44 million, $34 million net of tax, for merger related costs, $85 million, $67 million net of tax, for opioid settlement charges and $164 million for goodwill and fixed asset impairment charges related to vitacost.com (the "2022 og&amp;a adjusted items").
●   losses in other income (expense) of $728 million, $561 million net of tax, for the unrealized loss on investments (the "2022 other income (expense) adjusted items").
net earnings for 2021 include the following, which we define as the "2021 adjusted items:"
●   charges to og&amp;a of $449 million, $344 million net of tax, for obligations related to withdrawal liabilities for a certain multi-employer pension fund, $66 million, $50 million net of tax, for the revaluation of home chef contingent consideration and $136 million, $104 million net of tax, for transformation costs (the "2021 og&amp;a adjusted items").
●   losses in other income (expense) of $87 million, $68 million net of tax, related to company-sponsored pension plan settlements and $821 million, $628 million net of tax, for the unrealized loss on investments (the "2021 other income (expense) adjusted items").
●   a reduction to income tax expense of $47 million primarily due to the completion of income tax audit examinations covering multiple years.

(1)   the 2023 adjusted column represents the items presented in the 2023 column adjusted to remove the extra week.
(4)   digital sales are included in the "total sales to retail customers without fuel" line above. digital sales include products ordered online and picked up at our stores and our delivery and ship solutions. our delivery solutions include orders delivered to customers from retail store locations, customer fulfillment centers powered by ocado and orders placed through third-party platforms. our ship solutions primarily include online orders placed through our owned platforms that are dispatched using mail service or third-party courier. digital sales increased approximately 12% in 2023 excluding the extra week, increased approximately 4% in 2022 and decreased approximately 3% in 2021. digital sales growth for 2023 and 2022 was led by strength in our delivery solutions, which grew by 25% in 2023 excluding the extra week and 25% in 2022. delivery solutions growth was driven by our boost membership program and expansion of our kroger delivery network.
total 2023 adjusted sales represent total sales for 2023 excluding the extra week. total 2023 adjusted sales decreased in 2023, compared to 2022, by 0.6%. the decrease was primarily due to the decrease in supermarket fuel sales, partially offset by the increase in total sales to retail customers without fuel. total sales, excluding fuel, adjusted for the extra week, increased 1.1% in 2023, compared to 2022, which was primarily due to our identical sales increase, excluding fuel, of 0.9%. identical sales, excluding fuel, in 2023, compared to 2022, increased primarily due to an increase in the number of loyal households shopping with us and an increase in basket value due to retail inflation, partially offset by a reduction in the number of items in basket and the termination of our agreement with express scripts effective december 31, 2022. identical sales, excluding fuel, would have grown 2.3% in 2023 if not for the approximately $1.8 billion reduction in pharmacy sales from the termination of our agreement with express scripts effective december 31, 2022. total adjusted fuel sales decreased 12.3% in 2023, compared to 2022, primarily due to a decrease in the average retail fuel price of 11.1% and a decrease in fuel gallons sold of 1.5%. the decrease in the average retail fuel price was caused by a decrease in the product cost of fuel.
total sales increased in 2022, compared to 2021, by 7.5%. the increase was primarily due to increases in supermarket fuel sales and total sales to retail customers without fuel. total sales, excluding fuel, increased 5.2% in 2022, compared to 2021, which was primarily due to our identical sales increase, excluding fuel, of 5.6%, partially offset by discontinued patient therapies at kroger specialty pharmacy. identical sales, excluding fuel, for 2022, compared to 2021, increased primarily due to an increase in the number of households shopping with us and an increase in basket value due to retail inflation, partially offset by a reduction in the number of items in basket and the termination of our agreement with express scripts. identical sales without fuel would have grown 5.8% in 2022 if not for the reduction in pharmacy sales from our termination of our agreement with express scripts effective december 31, 2022. total supermarket fuel sales increased 26.9% in 2022, compared to 2021, primarily due to an increase in the average retail fuel price of 28.5%, partially offset by a decrease in fuel gallons sold of 1.2%, which was less than the national average decline. the increase in the average retail fuel price was caused by an increase in the product cost of fuel.
we calculate identical sales, excluding fuel, as sales to retail customers, including sales from all departments at identical supermarket locations, kroger specialty pharmacy businesses and delivery and ship solutions. we define a supermarket as identical when it has been in operation without expansion or relocation for five full quarters. we define kroger specialty pharmacy businesses as identical when physical locations have been in operation continuously for five full quarters; discontinued patient therapies are excluded from the identical sales calculation starting in the quarter of transfer or termination. we define kroger delivery identical sales powered by ocado based on geography. we include kroger delivery sales powered by ocado as identical if the delivery occurs in an existing kroger supermarket geography. if the kroger delivery sales powered by ocado occur in a new geography, these sales are included as identical when deliveries have occurred to the new geography for five full quarters. although identical sales is a relatively standard term, numerous methods exist for calculating identical sales growth. as a result, the method used by our management to calculate identical sales may differ from methods other companies use to calculate identical sales. it is important to understand the methods used by other companies to calculate identical sales before comparing our identical sales to those of other such companies. our identical sales, excluding fuel, results are summarized in the following table. we used the identical sales, excluding fuel, dollar figures presented below to calculate percentage changes for 2023 and 2022.
our gross margin rates, as a percentage of sales, were 22.24% in 2023 and 21.43% in 2022. this increase in rate was achieved while also investing in price to maintain a competitive price position and deliver greater value for our customers. the increase in rate in 2023, compared to 2022, resulted primarily from a decreased lifo charge, an increase in our fuel gross margin, strong our brands performance, our ability to effectively manage product cost through strong sourcing practices, lower transportation costs, as a percentage of sales, and the effect of our terminated agreement with express scripts, partially offset by higher shrink, as a percentage of sales, and increased promotional price investment.
our fifo gross margin rate, which excludes the lifo charge, was 22.31% in 2023, compared to 21.86% in 2022. our fuel sales lower our fifo gross margin rate due to the very low fifo gross margin rate, as a percentage of sales, of fuel sales compared to non-fuel sales. excluding the effect of fuel and the extra week, our fifo gross margin rate increased 18 basis points in 2023, compared to 2022. this increase in rate was achieved while also investing in price to maintain a competitive price position and deliver greater value for our customers. this increase resulted primarily from strong our brands performance, our ability to effectively manage product cost through strong sourcing practices, lower transportation costs, as a percentage of sales, and the effect of our terminated agreement with express scripts, partially offset by increased promotional price investment and higher shrink, as a percentage of sales.
operating, general and administrative expenses og&a expenses consist primarily of employee-related costs such as wages, healthcare benefit costs, retirement plan costs, utilities, and credit card fees. rent expense, depreciation and amortization expense, and interest expense are not included in og&a.
og&a expenses, as a percentage of sales, were 17.50% in 2023 and 16.09% in 2022. the increase in 2023, compared to 2022, resulted primarily from planned investments in associates, costs related to strategic investments that are expected to drive future growth and the effect of our terminated agreement with express scripts and the 2023 og&a adjusted items, partially offset by the 2022 og&a adjusted items, broad-based cost savings initiatives that drive administrative efficiencies, store productivity and sourcing cost reductions and lower incentive plan costs.
our fuel sales lower our og&a rate, as a percentage of sales, due to the very low og&a rate, as a percentage of sales, of fuel sales compared to non-fuel sales. excluding the effect of fuel, the extra week, the 2023 og&a adjusted items, the 2022 og&a adjusted items, our og&a rate increased 21 basis points in 2023, compared to 2022. this increase resulted primarily from planned investments in associates, costs related to strategic investments that are expected to drive future growth and the effect of our terminated agreement with express scripts, partially offset by broad-based cost savings initiatives that drive administrative efficiencies, store productivity and sourcing cost reductions and lower incentive plan costs.
depreciation and amortization expense depreciation and amortization expense increased, as a percentage of sales, in 2023, compared to 2022, primarily due to depreciation of equipment recorded under finance leases related to our kroger delivery customer fulfillment center location openings and additional depreciation associated with higher capital investments, partially offset by the extra week.
operating profit and fifo operating profit operating profit was $3.1 billion, or 2.06% of sales, for 2023, compared to $4.1 billion, or 2.78% of sales, for 2022. operating profit, as a percentage of sales, decreased 72 basis points in 2023, compared to 2022, due to increased og&a and depreciation and amortization expenses, as a percentage of sales, and a decrease in fuel operating profit, partially offset by a higher fifo gross margin rate, a decreased lifo charge and the extra week.
fifo operating profit was $3.2 billion, or 2.14% of sales, for 2023, compared to $4.8 billion, or 3.21% of sales, for 2022. fifo operating profit, as a percentage of sales, excluding the 2023 and 2022 adjusted items and the extra week, decreased 15 basis points in 2023, compared to 2022, due to increased og&a and depreciation and amortization expenses, as a percentage of sales and a decrease in fuel operating profit, partially offset by a higher fifo gross margin rate.
specific factors contributing to the trends driving operating profit and fifo operating profit identified above are discussed earlier in this section.
the following table provides a reconciliation of operating profit to fifo operating profit, and to adjusted fifo operating profit, excluding the 2023 and 2022 adjusted items:

(1)   merger related costs primarily include third-party professional fees and credit facility fees associated with the proposed merger with albertsons.
(2)   opioid settlement charges include settlements with the nationwide opioid settlement framework and the states of west virginia and new mexico.
income taxes our effective income tax rate was 23.5% in 2023 and 22.5% in 2022. the 2023 tax rate differed from the federal statutory rate due to the effect of state income taxes and non-deductible portion of opioid settlement charges, partially offset by the benefit from share-based payments and the utilization of tax credits. the 2022 tax rate differed from the federal statutory rate due to the effect of state income taxes and non-deductible goodwill impairment charges related to vitacost.com, partially offset by the benefits from share-based payments and the utilization of tax credits.
net earnings of $2.96 per diluted share for 2023 represented a decrease of 3.3% compared to net earnings of $3.06 per diluted share for 2022. excluding the 2023 and 2022 adjusted items and the extra week, adjusted net earnings of $4.56 per diluted share for 2023 represented an increase of 7.8% compared to adjusted net earnings of $4.23 per diluted share for 2022. the increase in adjusted net earnings per diluted share resulted primarily from a decreased lifo charge and lower interest expense, partially offset by decreased fuel earnings, higher income tax expense and decreased fifo operating profit, excluding fuel.
return on invested capital we calculate return on invested capital ("roic") by dividing adjusted roic operating profit for the prior four quarters by the average invested capital. adjusted operating profit for roic purposes is calculated by excluding certain items included in operating profit, and adding back our lifo charge, depreciation and amortization and rent to our u.s. gaap operating profit of the prior four quarters.  average invested capital is calculated as the sum of (i) the average of our total assets, (ii) the average lifo reserve and (iii) the average accumulated depreciation and amortization; minus (i) the average taxes receivable, (ii) the average trade accounts payable, (iii) the average accrued salaries and wages and (iv) the average other current liabilities, excluding accrued income taxes. averages are calculated for roic by adding the beginning balance of the first quarter and the ending balance of the fourth quarter, of the last four quarters, and dividing by two. roic is a non-gaap financial measure of performance. roic should not be reviewed in isolation or considered as a substitute for our financial results as reported in accordance with gaap. roic is an important measure used by management to evaluate our investment returns on capital. management believes roic is a useful metric to investors and analysts because it measures how effectively we are deploying our assets.

critical accounting estimates we have chosen accounting policies that we believe are appropriate to report accurately and fairly our operating results and financial position, and we apply those accounting policies in a consistent manner. our significant accounting policies are summarized in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements.
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. we base our estimates on historical experience and other factors we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. actual results could differ from those estimates.
we believe the following accounting estimates are the most critical in the preparation of our financial statements because they involve the most difficult, subjective or complex judgments about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain.
impairments of long-lived assets we monitor the carrying value of long-lived assets for potential impairment each quarter based on whether certain triggering events have occurred. these events include current period losses combined with a history of losses or a projection of continuing losses or a significant decrease in the market value of an asset. when a triggering event occurs, we perform an impairment calculation, comparing projected undiscounted cash flows, utilizing current cash flow information and expected growth rates related to specific stores, to the carrying value for those stores. if we identify impairment for long-lived assets to be held and used, we compare the assets' current carrying value to the assets' fair value. fair value is determined based on market values or discounted future cash flows. we record impairment when the carrying value exceeds fair market value. with respect to owned property and equipment held for disposal, we adjust the value of the property and equipment to reflect recoverable values based on our previous efforts to dispose of similar assets and current economic conditions. we recognize impairment for the excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair market value, reduced by estimated direct costs of disposal. we recorded asset impairments in the normal course of business totaling $69 million in 2023 and $68 million in 2022. we record costs to reduce the carrying value of long-lived assets in the consolidated statements of operations as og&a expense.
the factors that most significantly affect the impairment calculation are our estimates of future cash flows.  our cash flow projections look several years into the future and include assumptions on variables such as inflation, the economy and market competition. application of alternative assumptions and definitions, such as reviewing long-lived assets for impairment at a different level, could produce significantly different results.
business combinations we account for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting. all the assets acquired, liabilities assumed and amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests are recorded at their respective fair values at the date of acquisition once we obtain control of an entity. the determination of fair values of identifiable assets and liabilities involves estimates and the use of valuation techniques when market value is not readily available. we use various techniques to determine fair value in such instances, including the income approach. significant estimates used in determining fair value include, but are not limited to, the amount and timing of future cash flows, growth rates, discount rates and useful lives. the excess of the purchase price over fair values of identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. see note 2 for further information about goodwill.
goodwill our goodwill totaled $2.9 billion as of february 3, 2024. we review goodwill for impairment in the fourth quarter of each year and also upon the occurrence of triggering events. we perform reviews of each of our operating divisions and other consolidated entities (collectively, "reporting units") that have goodwill balances. generally, fair value is determined using a multiple of earnings, or discounted projected future cash flows, and we compare fair value to the carrying value of a reporting unit for purposes of identifying potential impairment. we base projected future cash flows on management's knowledge of the current operating environment and expectations for the future. we recognize goodwill impairment for any excess of a reporting unit's carrying value over its fair value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit.
in 2022, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge for vitacost.com totaling $160 million. the talent and capabilities gained through the merger with vitacost in 2014 have been key to advancing kroger's digital platform and growing our digital business to more than $10 billion in annual sales. as our digital strategy has evolved, our primary focus looking forward will be to effectively utilize our pickup and delivery capabilities. this reprioritization resulted in reduced long-term profitability expectations and a decline in the market value for one underlying channel of business and led to the impairment charge. vitacost.com will continue to operate as an online platform providing great value natural, organic, and eco-friendly products for customers.
the annual evaluation of goodwill performed in 2023, 2022 and 2021 did not result in impairment for any of our reporting units other than vitacost.com described above. based on current and future expected cash flows, we believe additional goodwill impairments are not reasonably likely. a 10% reduction in fair value of our reporting units would not indicate a potential for impairment of our goodwill balance.
the 2023 fair value of our kroger specialty pharmacy ("ksp") reporting unit was estimated using multiple valuation techniques: a discounted cash flow model (income approach), a market multiple model and a comparable mergers and acquisition model (market approaches), with each method weighted in the calculation. the income approach relies on management's projected future cash flows, estimates of revenue growth rates, margin assumptions and an appropriate discount rate. the market approaches require the determination of an appropriate peer group, which is utilized to derive estimated fair values based on selected market multiples. our ksp reporting unit has a goodwill balance of $243 million.
for additional information relating to our results of the goodwill impairment reviews performed during 2023, 2022 and 2021, see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements.
the impairment review requires the extensive use of management judgment and financial estimates. application of alternative estimates and assumptions could produce significantly different results. the cash flow projections embedded in our goodwill impairment reviews can be affected by several factors such as inflation, business valuations in the market, the economy, market competition and our ability to successfully integrate recently acquired businesses.
multi-employer pension plans we contribute to various multi-employer pension plans based on obligations arising from collective bargaining agreements. these multi-employer pension plans provide retirement benefits to participants based on their service to contributing employers. the benefits are paid from assets held in trust for that purpose. trustees are appointed in equal number by employers and unions. the trustees typically are responsible for determining the level of benefits to be provided to participants as well as for such matters as the investment of the assets and the administration of the plans.
we recognize expense in connection with these plans as contributions are funded or when commitments are probable and reasonably estimable, in accordance with gaap. we made cash contributions to these plans of $635 million in 2023, $620 million in 2022 and $1.1 billion in 2021. the decrease in 2023 and 2022, compared to 2021 is due to the contractual payments we made in 2021 related to our commitments established for the restructuring of certain multi-employer pension plan agreements.
we continue to evaluate and address our potential exposure to under-funded multi-employer pension plans as it relates to our associates who are beneficiaries of these plans. these under-fundings are not our liability. when an opportunity arises that is economically feasible and beneficial to us and our associates, we may negotiate the restructuring of under-funded multi-employer pension plan obligations to help stabilize associates' future benefits and become the fiduciary of the restructured multi-employer pension plan. the commitments from these restructurings do not change our debt profile as it relates to our credit rating since these off-balance sheet commitments are typically considered in our investment grade debt rating. we are currently designated as the named fiduciary of the ufcw consolidated pension plan and the international brotherhood of teamsters ("ibt") consolidated pension fund and have sole investment authority over these assets. significant effects of these restructuring agreements recorded in our consolidated financial statements are:
●   in 2022, we incurred a $25 million charge, $19 million net of tax, for obligations related to withdrawal liabilities for certain multi-employer pension funds.
●   in 2021, we incurred a $449 million charge, $344 million net of tax, for obligations related to withdrawal liabilities for a certain multi-employer pension fund.
as we continue to work to find solutions to under-funded multi-employer pension plans, it is possible we could incur withdrawal liabilities for certain funds.
based on the most recent information available to us, we believe the present value of actuarially accrued liabilities in most of these multi-employer plans exceeds the value of the assets held in trust to pay benefits, and we expect that our contributions to most of these funds will increase over the next few years. we have attempted to estimate the amount by which these liabilities exceed the assets, (i.e., the amount of underfunding), as of december 31, 2023. because we are only one of a number of employers contributing to these plans, we also have attempted to estimate the ratio of our contributions to the total of all contributions to these plans in a year as a way of assessing our "share" of the underfunding. nonetheless, the underfunding is not a direct obligation or liability of ours or of any employer.
as of december 31, 2023, we estimate our share of the underfunding of multi-employer pension plans to which we contribute was approximately $2.5 billion, $1.9 billion net of tax, which remained consistent with the estimated amount of underfunding as of december 31, 2022. our estimate is based on the most current information available to us including actuarial evaluations and other data (that include the estimates of others), and such information may be outdated or otherwise unreliable.
we have made and disclosed this estimate not because, except as noted above, this underfunding is a direct liability of ours. rather, we believe the underfunding is likely to have important consequences. in the event we were to exit certain markets or otherwise cease making contributions to these plans, we could trigger a substantial withdrawal liability. any adjustment for withdrawal liability will be recorded when it is probable that a liability exists and can be reasonably estimated, in accordance with gaap.
the amount of underfunding described above is an estimate and could change based on contract negotiations, returns on the assets held in the multi-employer pension plans, benefit payments or future restructuring agreements. the amount could decline, and our future expense would be favorably affected, if the values of the assets held in the trust significantly increase or if further changes occur through collective bargaining, trustee action or favorable legislation. on the other hand, our share of the underfunding could increase, and our future expense could be adversely affected if the asset values decline, if employers currently contributing to these funds cease participation or if changes occur through collective bargaining, trustee action or adverse legislation. we continue to evaluate our potential exposure to under-funded multi-employer pension plans. although these liabilities are not a direct obligation or liability of ours, any commitments to fund certain multi-employer pension plans will be expensed when our commitment is probable and an estimate can be made.
the american rescue plan act ("arp act"), which was signed into law on march 11, 2021, established a special financial assistance program for financially troubled multi-employer pension plans. under the arp act, eligible multi-employer plans can apply to receive a cash payment in an amount projected by the pension benefit guaranty corporation to pay pension benefits through the plan year ending 2051. at the end of 2023, we expect certain multi-employer pension plans in which we participate, for which our estimated share of underfunding is approximately $1.1 billion, $850 million net of tax, to apply for funding in 2024, which may reduce a portion of our share of unfunded multi-employer pension plan liabilities.
liquidity and capital resources cash flow information the following table summarizes our net increase (decrease) in cash and temporary cash investments for 2023 and 2022:
operating activities                                                 $6,788               $4,498
investing activities                                                       (3,750)              (3,015)
financing activities                                                       (2,170)              (2,289)
net cash provided by operating activities we generated $6.8 billion of cash from operations in 2023, compared to $4.5 billion in 2022. net earnings including noncontrolling interests, adjusted for non-cash items, generated approximately $6.0 billion of operating cash flow in 2023 compared to $7.7 billion in 2022. the change in operating assets and liabilities, including working capital, was $808 million in 2023 compared to $(3.2) billion in 2022. the change in operating assets and liabilities, including working capital, was primarily due to the following:
●   an increase in long-term liabilities at the end of 2023, compared to the end of 2022, primarily due to an increase in the noncurrent portion of our accrued opioid settlement charges;
●   cash flows for accounts payable were more favorable in 2023, compared to 2022, due to increased accounts payable at the end of 2023, compared to the end of 2022, primarily due to timing of payments and management's focus on working capital improvements;
●   cash flows for accounts receivable were more favorable in 2023, compared to 2022, due to decreased pharmacy receivables at the end of 2023, compared to the end of 2022, primarily due to timing of cash receipts and the termination of our agreement with express scripts.
net cash used by investing activities investing activities used cash of $3.8 billion in 2023, compared to $3.0 billion in 2022. the amount of cash used by investing activities increased in 2023, compared to 2022, primarily due to increased payments for property and equipment in 2023.
net cash used by financing activities we used $2.2 billion of cash for financing activities in 2023, compared to $2.3 billion in 2022. the amount of cash used for financing activities decreased in 2023, compared to 2022, primarily due to decreased treasury stock purchases, partially offset by increased payments on long-term debt including obligations under finance leases.
capital investments capital investments, including changes in construction-in-progress payables and excluding the purchase of leased facilities, totaled $3.6 billion in 2023 and $3.3 billion in 2022. capital investments for the purchase of leased facilities totaled $21 million in 2022. we did not purchase any leased facilities in 2023. our capital priorities align directly with our value creation model and our target to consistently grow net earnings. our capital program includes initiatives to enhance the customer experience in stores, improve our process efficiency and enhance our digital capabilities through technology developments. capital investments increased in 2023, compared to 2022, due to increasing our store capital investments compared to prior years. these investments are expected to drive sales growth and improve operating efficiency by removing cost and waste from our business.

supermarket storing activity
common share repurchase programs we maintain share repurchase programs that comply with rule 10b5-1 of the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended (the "exchange act") and allow for the orderly repurchase of our common shares, from time to time.  the share repurchase programs do not have an expiration date but may be suspended or terminated by our board of directors at any time. we made open market purchases of our common shares totaling $821 million in 2022. during the third quarter of 2022, we paused our share repurchase program to prioritize de-leveraging following the proposed merger with albertsons.
in addition, we also repurchase common shares under a program announced on december 6, 1999 to repurchase common shares to reduce dilution resulting from our employee stock option and long-term incentive plans, under which repurchases are limited to proceeds received from exercises of stock options and the tax benefits associated therewith ("1999 repurchase program"). this program is solely funded by proceeds from stock option exercises, and the tax benefit from these exercises. we repurchased approximately $62 million in 2023 and $172 million in 2022 of our common shares under the 1999 repurchase program.
on september 9, 2022, our board of directors approved a $1.0 billion share repurchase program to reacquire shares via open market purchase or privately negotiated transactions, block trades, or pursuant to trades intending to comply with rule 10b5-1 under the exchange act (the "september 2022 repurchase program"). no shares have been repurchased under the september 2022 authorization. during the third quarter of 2022, we paused our share repurchase program to prioritize de-leveraging following the proposed merger with albertsons. as of february 3, 2024, there was $1.0 billion remaining under the september 2022 repurchase program.
liquidity needs we held cash and temporary cash investments of $1.9 billion, as of the end of 2023, which reflects our elevated operating performance over the last few years and paused share repurchase program. we actively manage our cash and temporary cash investments in order to internally fund operating activities, support and invest in our core businesses, make scheduled interest and principal payments on our borrowings and return cash to shareholders through cash dividend payments and share repurchases. our current levels of cash, borrowing capacity and balance sheet leverage provide us with the operational flexibility to adjust to changes in economic and market conditions. we remain committed to our dividend, and growing our dividend over time, subject to board approval, as well as share repurchase programs and we will evaluate the optimal use of any excess free cash flow, consistent with our capital allocation strategy.
the table below summarizes our short-term and long-term material cash requirements, based on year of maturity or settlement, as of february 3, 2024 (in millions of dollars):
self-insurance liability(5)                    281             159             108              68              40                 105               761

(1)   the contractual obligations table excludes funding of pension and other postretirement benefit obligations, which totaled approximately $65 million in 2023. for additional information about these obligations, see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements. this table also excludes contributions under various multi-employer pension plans, which totaled $635 million in 2023. for additional information about these multi-employer pension plans, see note 15 to the consolidated financial statements.
(2)   the liability related to unrecognized tax benefits has been excluded from the contractual obligations table because a reasonable estimate of the timing of future tax settlements cannot be determined.
(3)   as of february 3, 2024, we had no outstanding commercial paper and no borrowings under our credit facility.
(5)   the amounts included for self-insurance liability related to workers' compensation claims have been stated on a present value basis.
(7)   amounts include scheduled opioid settlement commitments related to the nationwide opioid settlement framework and the state of west virginia. for additional information about our opioid settlement charges, see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements.
(8)   amounts include commitments, many of which are short-term in nature, to be utilized in the normal course of business, such as several contracts to purchase raw materials utilized in our food production plants and several contracts to purchase energy to be used in our stores and food production plants. our obligations also include management fees for facilities operated by third parties and outside service contracts. any upfront vendor allowances or incentives associated with outstanding purchase commitments are recorded as either current or long-term liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. we included our future commitments for customer fulfillment centers for which we have placed an order as of february 3, 2024. we did not include our commitments associated with additional customer fulfillment centers that have not yet been ordered. we expect our future commitments for customer fulfillment centers will continue to grow as we place orders for additional customer fulfillment centers.
we expect to meet our short-term and long-term liquidity needs with cash and temporary cash investments on hand as of february 3, 2024, cash flows from our operating activities and other sources of liquidity, including borrowings under our commercial paper program and bank credit facility. our short-term and long-term liquidity needs include anticipated requirements for working capital to maintain our operations, pension plan commitments, interest payments and scheduled principal payments of debt and commercial paper, servicing our lease obligations, self-insurance liabilities, capital investments, scheduled opioid settlement payments and other purchase obligations. we may also require additional capital in the future to fund organic growth opportunities, additional customer fulfillment centers, joint ventures or other business partnerships, property development, acquisitions, dividends and share repurchases. in addition, we generally operate with a working capital deficit due to our efficient use of cash in funding operations and because we have consistent access to the capital markets. we believe we have adequate coverage of our debt covenants to continue to maintain our current investment grade debt ratings and to respond effectively to competitive conditions.
as previously disclosed, on october 13, 2022, we entered into a merger agreement with albertsons. we expect to meet our liquidity needs for the proposed merger with cash and temporary cash investments on hand as of the merger closing date, cash flows from our operating activities and other sources of liquidity, including borrowings under our commercial paper program, senior notes issuances, bank credit facility and other sources of financing. in connection with the proposed merger, we entered into a commitment letter for a bridge term loan facility and executed a term loan credit agreement. for additional information about the proposed merger with albertsons, see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements.
for additional information about our debt activity in 2023, see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements.
factors affecting liquidity we can currently borrow on a daily basis approximately $2.75 billion under our commercial paper program.  at february 3, 2024, we had no outstanding commercial paper. commercial paper borrowings are backed by our credit facility and reduce the amount we can borrow under the credit facility. if our short-term credit ratings fall, the ability to borrow under our current commercial paper program could be adversely affected for a period of time and increase our interest cost on daily borrowings under our commercial paper program. this could require us to borrow additional funds under the credit facility, under which we believe we have sufficient capacity. however, in the event of a ratings decline, we do not anticipate that our borrowing capacity under our commercial paper program would be any lower than $500 million on a daily basis. factors that could affect our credit rating include changes in our operating performance and financial position, the state of the economy, conditions in the food retail industry and changes in our business model. further information on the risks and uncertainties that can affect our business can be found in the "risk factors" section set forth in item 1a of part i of this annual report on form 10-k. although our ability to borrow under the credit facility is not affected by our credit rating, the interest cost and applicable margin on borrowings under the credit facility could be affected by a downgrade in our public debt rating. "public debt rating" means, as of any date, the rating that has been most recently announced by either s&p or moody's, as the case may be, for any class of non-credit enhanced long-term senior unsecured debt issued by kroger. as of march 27, 2024, we had no commercial paper borrowings outstanding.
our credit facility requires the maintenance of a leverage ratio (our "financial covenant").  a failure to maintain our financial covenant would impair our ability to borrow under the credit facility. this financial covenant is described below:
●   our leverage ratio (the ratio of net debt to adjusted ebitda, as defined in the credit facility) was 1.10 to 1 as of february 3, 2024. if this ratio were to exceed 3.50 to 1, we would be in default of our revolving credit facility and our ability to borrow under the facility would be impaired.
our credit facility is more fully described in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements. we were in compliance with our financial covenant at february 3, 2024.
as of february 3, 2024, we maintained a $2.75 billion (with the ability to increase by $1.25 billion), unsecured revolving credit facility that, unless extended, terminates on july 6, 2026. outstanding borrowings under the credit facility, commercial paper borrowings, and some outstanding letters of credit reduce funds available under the credit facility. as of february 3, 2024, we had no outstanding commercial paper and no borrowings under our revolving credit facility. the outstanding letters of credit that reduce funds available under our credit facility totaled $2 million as of february 3, 2024.
in connection with the proposed merger with albertsons, on october 13, 2022, we entered into a commitment letter with certain lenders pursuant to which the lenders have committed to provide a 364-day $17.4 billion senior unsecured bridge term loan facility. the commitments are intended to be drawn to finance the proposed merger with albertsons only to the extent we do not arrange for alternative financing prior to closing. as alternative financing for the proposed merger is secured, the commitments with respect to the bridge term loan facility under the commitment letter will be reduced.
on november 9, 2022, we executed a term loan credit agreement with certain lenders pursuant to which the lenders committed to provide, contingent upon the completion of the proposed merger with albertsons and certain other customary conditions to funding, (1) senior unsecured term loans in an aggregate principal amount of $3.0 billion maturing on the third anniversary of the proposed merger closing date and (2) senior unsecured term loans in an aggregate principal amount of $1.75 billion maturing on the date that is 18 months after the proposed merger closing date (collectively, the "term loan facilities"). borrowings under the term loan facilities will be used to pay a portion of the consideration and other amounts payable in connection with the proposed merger with albertsons. the duration of the term loan facilities will allow us to achieve our net total debt to adjusted ebitda ratio target range of 2.30 to 2.50 within the first 18 to 24 months after the proposed merger closing date. the entry into the term loan credit agreement reduced the commitments under our bridge facility commitment letter from $17.4 billion to $12.65 billion. borrowings under the term loan facilities will bear interest at rates that vary based on the type of loan and our debt rating.
in addition to the available credit mentioned above, as of february 3, 2024, we had authorized for issuance $5 billion of securities remaining under a shelf registration statement filed with the sec and effective on may 20, 2022.
we maintain surety bonds related primarily to our self-insured workers' compensation claims. these bonds are required by most states in which we are self-insured for workers' compensation and are placed with predominately third-party insurance providers to insure payment of our obligations in the event we are unable to meet our claim payment obligations up to our self-insured retention levels. these bonds do not represent liabilities of ours, as we already have reserves on our books for the claims costs. market changes may make the surety bonds more costly and, in some instances, availability of these bonds may become more limited, which could affect our costs of, or access to, such bonds. although we do not believe increased costs or decreased availability would significantly affect our ability to access these surety bonds, if this does become an issue, we would issue letters of credit, in states where allowed, to meet the state bonding requirements. this could increase our cost or decrease the funds available under our credit facility if the letters of credit were issued against our credit facility. we had $473 million of outstanding surety bonds as of february 3, 2024. these surety bonds expire during fiscal year 2024 and are expected to be renewed.
we have standby letters of credit outstanding as part of our insurance program and for other business purposes. the letters of credit for our insurance program collateralize obligations to our insurance carriers in connection with the settlement of potential claims. we have also provided a letter of credit which supports our commitment to build a certain number of fulfillment centers. the balance of this letter of credit reduces primarily upon the construction of each fulfillment center. if we do not reach our total purchase commitment, we will be responsible for the balance remaining on the letter of credit. we had $314 million of outstanding standby letters of credit as of february 3, 2024. these standby letters of credit expire during fiscal year 2024 or early fiscal year 2025 and most are expected to be renewed. letters of credit do not represent liabilities of ours and are not reflected in our consolidated balance sheets.
we also are contingently liable for leases that have been assigned to various third parties in connection with facility closings and dispositions. we could be required to satisfy obligations under the leases if any of the assignees are unable to fulfill their lease obligations. due to the wide distribution of our assignments among third parties, and various other remedies available to us, we believe the likelihood that we will be required to assume a material amount of these obligations is remote. we have agreed to indemnify certain third-party logistics operators for certain expenses, including multi-employer pension plan obligations and withdrawal liabilities.
in addition to the above, we enter into various indemnification agreements and take on indemnification obligations in the ordinary course of business. such arrangements include indemnities against third-party claims arising out of agreements to provide services to us; indemnities related to the sale of our securities; indemnities of directors, officers and employees in connection with the performance of their work; and indemnities of individuals serving as fiduciaries on benefit plans. while our aggregate indemnification obligation could result in a material liability, we are not aware of any current matter that could result in a material liability.

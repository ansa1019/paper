strategic update we are focused on continuous improvement throughout the business. during 2023, we made significant strides in all four pillars of our strategic objectives: 1) people first 2) customer loyalty 3) growth mindset and 4) operational efficiency.
people first during 2023, we focused on the safety of our people. we are continuously improving our safety culture and monitoring our measurable safety goals. for example, throughout the year we made considerable progress with respect to the implementation and adoption of our driver safety application, which monitors driver behaviors once a vehicle is in motion. our average driver safety score for drivers that we monitor showed improvement in 2023. we also executed a restructuring program during the year to modernize our workforce and enable us to make more strategic improvements in our support functions. we remain committed to developing exceptional talent and investing in our teams, including a focus on strategic hiring in both support functions, as well as the customer-facing side of our business.
customer loyalty we remain committed to providing our customers with the best customer experience. effective sales and service staffing levels helped us to capitalize on continued demand and deliver solid results for the year, with organic revenues* growing by 8.2% compared to 2022.
2023 marked a record year in terms of revenues, totaling $3.1 billion, an increase of 14.0% over 2022, with acquisition revenues* growing by 5.9% compared to 2022. we completed the acquisition of fox pest control ("fox"), one of the largest acquisitions in the company's history, for $339.5 million. we also completed 23 additional acquisitions in 2023, driving inorganic growth at several of our brands.
operational efficiency we saw healthy margins in 2023, with gross margin improving 70 basis points to 52.2% in 2023 compared to 51.5% in

impact of economic trends the continued disruption in economic markets due to high inflation, increases in interest rates, business interruptions due to natural disasters and changes in weather patterns, employee shortages, and supply chain issues, all pose challenges which may adversely affect our future performance. the company continues to execute various strategies previously implemented to help mitigate the impact of these economic disruptors.
however, the company cannot reasonably estimate whether these strategies will help mitigate the impact of these economic disruptors in the future.
table of contents the company's consolidated financial statements reflect estimates and assumptions made by management that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and related disclosures as of the date of the condensed consolidated financial statements. the company considered the impact of economic trends on the assumptions and estimates used in preparing the consolidated financial statements. in the opinion of management, all material adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the company's financial results for the year have been made. these adjustments are of a normal recurring nature but are complicated by the continued uncertainty surrounding these macro economic trends.
the severity, magnitude and duration of certain economic trends continue to be uncertain and are difficult to predict. therefore, our accounting estimates and assumptions may change over time in response to economic trends and may change materially in future periods.
the extent to which increasing interest rates, inflation and other economic trends will continue to impact the company's business, financial condition and results of operations is uncertain. therefore, we cannot reasonably estimate the full future impacts of these matters at this time.

revenues for the year ended december 31, 2023 were $3.1 billion, an increase of $377.5 million, or 14.0%, from 2022
revenues of $2.7 billion. the increase in revenues was driven by demand from our customers that remained strong throughout the year across all major service offerings. comparing 2023 to 2022, organic revenue* growth was 8.2%
while acquisitions drove 5.9% of total growth. looking at the service offerings, residential pest control revenue increased approximately 17%, commercial pest control revenue increased approximately 11% and termite and ancillary services grew approximately 13% including both organic and acquisition-related growth in each area. organic revenue* growth was strong across our service offerings, growing over 6% in residential, approximately 10% in commercial, and over 10% in termite and ancillary activity. the company's foreign operations accounted for approximately 7% of total revenues for the years ended december 31, 2023 and 2022.
we continue to maintain a very healthy balance sheet that positions us well to continue to invest in growth initiatives across our business as we enter 2024, from an organic perspective, we are proactively managing pricing across our portfolio. additionally, while lead generation and the overall demand environment are healthy to start the new year, we continue to navigate the negative impact of a colder january in certain parts of our business.
*amounts are non-gaap financial measures. see the schedules below for definitions and a discussion of non-gaap financial metrics, including a reconciliation to the most directly comparable gaap measure.
gross profit gross profit for the year ended december 31, 2023 was $1.6 billion, an increase of $216.0 million, or 15.6%, compared to $1.4 billion for the year ended december 31, 2022. gross margin improved 70 basis points to 52.2% in
2023 compared to 51.5% in 2022. the acquisition of fox drove 20 basis points of leverage in 2023. excluding this, gross margin improved 50 basis points as pricing more than offset increases in our cost structure. looking specifically at people related costs, materials and supplies, and fleet, which comprise 87% of total cost of services, we saw an improvement of 90 basis points associated with leverage in these categories, as pricing more than offset inflationary pressures. insurance and claims experience decreased gross margins in 2023 by 10 basis points.
we expect the normal seasonality to drive lower gross profit margins in the first and fourth quarters of 2024
relative to the second and third quarters on the lower level of business activity.
sales, general and administrative for the twelve months ended december 31, 2023, sales, general and administrative (sg&a) expenses increased $112.5
million, or 14.0%, compared to the twelve months ended december 31, 2022. the increase is driven by people-related costs, advertising and selling expenses associated with growth initiatives. as a percentage of revenue, sg&a was consistent at 29.8% in 2023 and 2022, as we continue to manage our cost structure while investing in growth initiatives.
restructuring costs during the twelve months ended december 31, 2023, we executed a restructuring program to modernize our workforce.
this effort resulted in expense of approximately $5.2 million in the year. the large majority of the costs incurred are related to severance-related costs for employees who were terminated as part of this effort. the changes were primarily across corporate-related functions and will enable us to make more strategic improvements in our support functions.
depreciation and amortization for the twelve months ended december 31, 2023, depreciation and amortization increased $8.4 million, or 9.2%, compared to the twelve months ended december 31, 2022. the increase was due to higher amortization of intangible assets from acquisitions, most notably fox, offset by lower depreciation of operating equipment and internal-use software.
operating income for the twelve months ended december 31, 2023, operating income increased $89.8 million or 18.2% compared to the prior year. as a percentage of revenue, operating income increased to 19.0% from 18.3% in the prior year. the improvement in operating income as a percentage of sales is primarily driven by the improvement in gross profit discussed previously.
we expect the first and fourth quarters to represent our lowest level for margins and profitability due primarily to the lower level of volume generated in those quarters due to the impact of seasonality.
interest expense, net during the twelve months ended december 31, 2023, interest expense, net increased $16.4 million compared to the prior year, due to the increase in the average debt balance associated primarily with the acquisition of fox and the share repurchase completed during 2023.
debt levels and corresponding interest expense are expected to remain elevated in the first half of 2024 due primarily to the higher level of debt associated with the acquisition of fox and the share repurchases during 2023.
table of contents other income, net during the twelve months ended december 31, 2023, other income, net increased $13.9 million primarily due to the company recognizing a $15.5 million gain on the sale of certain businesses during 2023, offset by lower gains from asset sales.
income taxes the company's effective tax rate was 25.8% in 2023 compared to 26.1% in 2022. the 2023 rate was favorably impacted by lower state income taxes and federal tax credits compared to 2022.
non-gaap financial measures reconciliation of gaap and non-gaap financial measures the company has used the non-gaap financial measures of organic revenues, adjusted operating income, adjusted operating margin, adjusted net income, and adjusted earnings per share ("eps"), earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("ebitda"), ebitda margin, adjusted ebitda, adjusted ebitda margin, and free cash flow in this form 10-k. organic revenue is calculated as revenue less the revenue from acquisitions completed within the prior 12 months and excluding the revenue from divested businesses. adjusted operating income and adjusted operating margin are calculated by adding back to the gaap measures those expenses resulting from the amortization of certain intangible assets and adjustments to the fair value of contingent consideration resulting from the acquisition of fox pest control and restructuring costs related to restructuring and workforce reduction plans. adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin are calculated by adding back to net income interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization expense those expenses resulting from the adjustments to the fair value of contingent consideration resulting from the acquisition of fox pest control, restructuring costs related to restructuring and workforce reduction plans, and gains on the sale of businesses. adjusted net income and adjusted eps are calculated by adding back those acquisition-related expenses, restructuring costs, and gains on the sale of businesses to the gaap measures and by further subtracting the tax impact of those expenses and/or gains. free cash flow is calculated by subtracting capital expenditures from cash provided by operating activities. these measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for revenues, net income, earnings per share or other performance measures prepared in accordance with gaap.
management uses adjusted operating income, adjusted operating margin, adjusted net income, adjusted eps, ebitda, ebitda margin, adjusted ebitda, adjusted ebitda margin, and free cash flow as measures of operating performance because this measure allows the company to compare performance consistently over various periods. management also uses organic revenues to compare revenues over various periods excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures. management uses free cash flow to demonstrate the company's ability to maintain its asset base and generate future cash flows from operations. an analysis of any non-gaap financial measure should be used in conjunction with results presented in accordance with gaap.
a non-gaap financial measure is a numerical measure of financial performance, financial position, or cash flows that either 1) excludes amounts, or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of excluding amounts, that are included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap in the statement of operations, balance sheet or statement of cash flows, or 2) includes amounts, or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of including amounts, that are excluded from the most directly comparable measure so calculated and presented.

2022. however, in 2023 the company purchased $4.2 million of shares on behalf of employees for the employee stock purchase plan. the company also repurchased $10.8 million and $7.1 million of common stock for the twelve months ended december 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, from employees for the payment of taxes on vesting restricted shares.

contractual commitments we have material cash requirements for known contractual obligations and commitments in the form of operating leases and debt obligations. we expect to fund these obligations primarily through cash generated from our operations. refer to note 6, leases and note 10, debt to the accompanying financial statements for further details.
critical accounting estimates the company views critical accounting estimates to be those that are very important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations, and that require management's most difficult, complex or subjective judgments. the circumstances that make these judgments difficult or complex relate to the need for management to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. we believe our critical accounting estimates to be as follows:
accrued insurance- the company retains, up to specified limits, certain risks related to u.s. general liability, workers' compensation and auto liability. risks are managed through either high deductible insurance or, for clark pest control only, a non-affiliated group captive insurance member arrangement. the estimated costs of existing and future claims under the retained loss program are accrued based upon historical trends as incidents occur, whether reported or unreported (although actual settlement of the claims may not be made until future periods) and may be subsequently revised based on developments relating to such claims. the group captive is subject to a third-party actuarial study retained by the captive manager, independent from the company. for the high deductible insurance program, the company contracts with an independent third-party actuary to provide the company an estimated liability based upon historical claims information. the actuarial study is a major consideration in establishing the reserve, along with management's knowledge of changes in business practice and existing claims compared to current balances. management's judgment is inherently subjective as a number of factors are outside management's knowledge and control. additionally, historical information is not always an accurate indication of future events.
the company continues to be proactive in safety and risk management to develop and maintain ongoing programs to reduce and prevent incidents and claims. initiatives that have been implemented include required pre-employment screening and ongoing motor vehicle record review for all drivers, post-offer physicals for new employees, pre-
hire, random and post incident drug testing, driver training and post-injury nurse triage for work-related injuries. the accruals and reserves we hold are based on estimates that involve a degree of judgment and are inherently variable and could be overestimated or insufficient. if actual claims exceed our estimates, our operating results could be materially affected, and our ability to take timely corrective actions to limit future costs may be limited.
business combinations- we account for business combinations by recognizing the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date fair value. in valuing certain acquired assets and liabilities, fair value estimates use significant, non-observable inputs (level 3), including future expected cash flows and discount rates. goodwill is measured as the excess of consideration transferred over the fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. while we use our best estimates and assumptions to value assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date, our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. as a result, during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. upon the conclusion of the measurement period, any subsequent adjustments arising from new facts and circumstances are recorded to the consolidated statements of operations. the results of operations of acquisitions are reflected in our consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition.
accounting for business combinations requires our management to make significant estimates and assumptions about intangible assets, assets and obligations assumed, contingent consideration, and other contingencies. critical inputs and assumptions in valuing certain of the intangible assets include, but are not limited to, future expected cash flows from customer contracts; the acquired company's trademarks & tradenames, and competitive position, as well as assumptions about the period of time the acquired trademarks & tradenames will continue to be used in the combined company's product portfolio; and discount rates. these significant assumptions are forward-looking and could be affected by future economic and market conditions.

market risk the company is subject to interest rate risk exposure through borrowings on its $1.0 billion revolving credit facility (the "credit facility"). as of december 31, 2023, the company had outstanding borrowings of $493.0 million under the credit facility. see note 10, debt to the accompanying financial statements for further details regarding debt. we do not believe that a one percent increase in interest rates, for example, would have a material effect on our results of operations or cash flows. the company is also exposed to market risks arising from changes in foreign exchange rates. the company believes that this foreign exchange rate risk will not have a material impact upon the company's results of operations going forward. for a discussion of the company's activities to manage risks relative to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, see note 1, summary of significant accounting policies to the accompanying financial statements.

management's report on internal control over financial reporting to the stockholders of rollins, inc.:
the management of rollins, inc. and subsidiaries is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the company. rollins, inc. maintains a system of internal accounting controls designed to provide reasonable assurance, at a reasonable cost, that assets are safeguarded against loss or unauthorized use and that the financial records are adequate and can be relied upon to produce financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america. the internal control system is augmented by written policies and procedures, an internal audit program and the selection and training of qualified personnel. this system includes policies that require adherence to ethical business standards and compliance with all applicable laws and regulations.
under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial and principal accounting officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of internal controls over financial reporting as of december 31, 2023 based on criteria established in the 2013 internal control-integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission.
during the year ended december 31, 2023, we completed the acquisition of fox pest control ("fox"). see note 2, acquisitions, for more information. we are currently in the process of integrating fox into our assessment of our internal control over financial reporting. consistent with guidance issued by the securities and exchange commission that an assessment of a recently acquired business may be omitted from management's report on internal control over financial reporting in the year of acquisition, management's assessment and conclusions on the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of december 31, 2023 excludes an assessment of the internal control over financial reporting of fox. fox represented approximately 4% of our revenues for the year ended december 31, 2023 and approximately 1% of our total assets at december 31, 2023.
excluding the above, management's assessment is that rollins, inc. maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31, 2023.
the independent registered public accounting firm, deloitte & touche llp has audited the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended december 31, 2023, and has also issued their report on the effectiveness of the company's internal control over financial reporting, included in this report on page 35 .

opinion on internal control over financial reporting we have audited the internal control over financial reporting of rollins, inc. and subsidiaries (the "company") as of december 31, 2023, based on criteria established in internal control - integrated framework (2013) issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission (coso). in our opinion, the company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31, 2023, based on criteria established in internal control - integrated framework (2013) issued by coso.
we have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board (united states) (pcaob), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended december 31, 2023, of the company and our report dated february 15, 2024, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.
as described in management's report on internal control over financial reporting, management excluded from its assessment the internal control over financial reporting at fox pest control, which was acquired on april 1, 2023, and whose financial statements constitute 1% of total assets and 4% of revenues of the consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended december 31, 2023. accordingly, our audit did not include the internal control over financial reporting at fox pest control.
basis for opinion the company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying management's report on internal control over financial reporting. our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. we are a public accounting firm registered with the pcaob and are required to be independent with respect to the company in accordance with the u.s. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the securities and exchange commission and the pcaob.
we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the pcaob. those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
definition and limitations of internal control over financial reporting a company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. a company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

("rollins," "we," "us," "our," or the "company"), is an international services company headquartered in atlanta, georgia that provides pest and termite control services to both residential and commercial customers through its wholly-owned subsidiaries and independent franchises in the united states
("u.s."), canada, australia, europe, and asia with international franchises in canada, central and south america, the caribbean, europe, the middle east, asia, africa, and australia.
principles of consolidation -the company's consolidated financial statements include the accounts of rollins, inc.
and the company's wholly-owned subsidiaries and have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the u.s. ("gaap"). the company does not consolidate the financial statements of any company in which it does not have a controlling financial interest. the company is not the primary beneficiary of, nor does it have a controlling financial interest in, any variable interest entity. accordingly, the company has not consolidated any variable interest entity. all material intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.
segment reporting -effective january 1, 2023, we reorganized our reporting structure in connection with our chief executive officer succession. as a result of the transition, we reevaluated our segment reporting and determined that we have twooperating segments and twogoodwill reporting units. we continue to operate under onereportable segment which contains our residential, commercial, and termite service offerings.
subsequent events -the company evaluates its financial statements through the date the financial statements are issued.refer to note 19, subsequent events for further details.
use of estimates -the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenue and expenses and certain financial statement disclosures. estimates and assumptions are used for, but not limited to, accrued insurance, revenue recognition, right-of-use ("rou") asset and liability valuations, accounts and financed receivable reserves, inventory (materials and supplies) valuation, employee benefit plans, income tax contingency accruals and valuation allowances, contingency accruals, goodwill and other intangible asset valuations. although these estimates are based on management's knowledge of current events and actions it may undertake in the future, actual results may ultimately differ from these estimates and assumptions. in the opinion of management, all adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the company's financial results for the year have been made. these adjustments are of a normal recurring nature. the results of operations for the year ended december 31, 2023 are not necessarily indicative of results for future years.
revenue recognition -the company's revenue recognition policy is to recognize revenue upon transfer of control of promised products and services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products or services. we enter into contracts that can include various combinations of products and services, each of which are distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations. revenue is recognized net of allowances for returns and any taxes collected from customers, which are subsequently remitted to governmental authorities.
nature of goods and services and performance obligations the company contracts with its customers to provide the following goods and services, each of which is a distinct performance obligation:
pest control services - rollins provides pest control services to protect residential and commercial properties from common pests, including rodents and insects. pest control generally consists of assessing a customer's property for conditions that invite pests, tackling current infestations, and stopping the life cycle to prevent future invaders. revenue from pest control services is recognized as services are rendered.
the company's revenue recognition policies are designed to recognize revenues upon satisfaction of the performance obligation at the time services are performed. residential and commercial pest control services are primarily recurring in nature on a monthly, bi-monthly or quarterly basis, while certain types of commercial customers may receive multiple treatments within a given month. in general, pest control customers sign an initial one-
table of contents recognized at the time services are performed. the company defers recognition of advance payments and recognizes the revenue as the services are rendered. the company classifies discounts related to the advance payments as a reduction in revenues.
termite control services - rollins provides a variety of termite protection services. termite protection programs include liquid treatments, wet and dry foam applications, termite baiting and wood treatments. revenue from initial termite treatment services is recognized as services are provided.
maintenance/monitoring/inspection - in connection with the initial service offerings, rollins provides recurring maintenance, monitoring or inspection services to help protect consumers' property from any future sign of termite activities after the original treatment. this recurring service is a service-type warranty under asc 606, "revenue from contracts with customers," as it is routinely sold and purchased separately from the initial treatment services and is typically purchased or renewed annually.
termite baiting revenues are recognized based on the transfer of control of the individual units of accounting. at the inception of a new baiting services contract, upon quality control review of the installation, the company recognizes revenue for the installation of the monitoring stations, initial directed liquid termiticide treatment and servicing of the monitoring stations. a portion of the contract amount is deferred for the undelivered monitoring performance obligation. this portion is recognized as income on a straight-line basis over the remaining contract term, which results in recognition of revenue that depicts the company's performance in transferring control of the service. the allocation of the transaction price to the twodeliverables is based on the relative stand-alone selling price. there are no contingencies related to the delivery of additional items or meeting other specified performance conditions. baiting renewal revenue is deferred and recognized over the annual contract period on a straight-line basis that depicts the company's performance in transferring control of the service.
revenue received for conventional termite renewals is deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the remaining contract term that depicts the company's performance in transferring control of the service, and the cost of reinspections, reapplications and repairs and associated labor and chemicals are expensed as incurred. for outstanding claims, an estimate is made of the costs to be incurred (including legal costs) based upon current factors and historical information. the performance of reinspections tends to be close to the contract renewal date, and while reapplications and repairs involve an insubstantial number of the contracts, these costs are incurred over the contract term. as the revenue is being deferred, the future cost of reinspections, reapplications and repairs and associated labor and chemicals applicable to the deferred revenue are expensed as incurred. the company accrues for known claims. the costs of providing termite services upon renewal are compared to the expected revenue to be received and a provision is made for any expected losses.
miscellaneous services - in certain agreements with customers, rollins may offer other miscellaneous services, including restroom cleaning (eliminating foul odors, grease and grime which could attract pests) and training
(seminars covering good manufacturing practices and product stewardship). revenue from miscellaneous services is recognized when services are provided.
the company's international operations accounted for approximately 7%, 7%, and 8% of revenues for the years ended december 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively.
contract balances timing of revenue recognition may differ from the timing of invoicing to customers. we record unearned revenue when revenue is recognized subsequent to billing. unearned revenue mainly relates to the company's termite baiting offering, conventional renewals, and year-in-advance pest control services for which we have been paid in advance and earn the revenue when we transfer control of the product or service. for multi-year agreements, we generally invoice customers annually at the beginning of each annual coverage period. refer to note 3, revenue for further information, including changes in unearned revenue for the year.
the company extends terms to certain customers on higher dollar termite and ancillary work, as well as to certain franchisees for initial funding on the sale of franchises. these financed receivables are segregated from our trade receivables. the allowance for expected credit losses reflects our best estimate of probable losses inherent in the accounts receivable balance. we determine the allowance based on known troubled accounts, historical experience, and other currently available evidence. see note 4, allowance for credit losses for further information.
table of contents payment terms and conditions vary by contract type, although terms generally include a requirement of payment within 30 to 60 days. in instances where the timing of revenue recognition differs from the timing of invoicing, we have determined our contracts generally do not include a significant financing component. the primary purpose of our invoicing terms is to provide customers with simplified and predictable ways of purchasing our products and services, not to receive financing from our customers or to provide customers with financing.
incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer incremental costs of obtaining a contract include only those costs that we incur to obtain a contract that we would not have incurred if the contract had not been obtained, primarily sales commissions. these costs are considered incremental costs to obtain a contract and are, therefore, recognized as an asset and amortized to expense over the life of the contract to the extent such costs are expected to be recovered. capitalized costs of obtaining a contract are recorded within other current assets and other assets on our consolidated statements of financial position. amortization of capitalized costs is recorded within sales, general and administrative expense on our consolidated statements of income.
practical expedients and exemptions in certain cases, we expense sales commissions when incurred because the amortization period would have been one year or less. these costs are recorded within selling, general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of income.
we do not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for (i) contracts with an original expected length of one year or less and (ii) contracts for which we recognize revenue at the amount to which we have the right to invoice for services performed.
allowance for expected credit losses -the company maintains an allowance for expected credit losses based on the expected collectability of accounts receivable. management uses historical collection results as well as accounts receivable aging in order to determine the expected collectability of accounts receivable. substantially all of the company's receivables are due from pest control and termite services in the united states and select international locations. the company's allowance for expected credit losses is determined using a combination of factors. the company's established credit evaluation procedures seek to minimize the amount of business we conduct with higher risk customers. provisions for expected credit losses are recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses.
accounts are written off against the allowance for expected credit losses when the company determines that amounts are uncollectible, and recoveries of amounts previously written off are recorded when collected. significant recoveries will generally reduce the required provision in the period of recovery. therefore, the provision for expected credit losses can fluctuate from period to period. we record specific provisions when we become aware of a customer's inability to meet its financial obligations to us, such as in the case of bankruptcy filings or deterioration in the customer's operating results or financial position. if circumstances related to customers change, our estimates of the realizability of receivables would be further adjusted, either upward or downward.
advertising - advertising costs are charged to sales, general and administrative expense during the year in which they are incurred.
cash and cash equivalents -the company considers all investments with an original maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents.
the company's $ 103.8million of total cash at december 31, 2023 is held at various banking institutions.
approximately $ 52.1million is held in cash by foreign subsidiaries and the remaining $ 51.7million is primarily held in federal deposit
cash held in foreign bank accounts    $  52,141    $  68,580
rollins maintains adequate liquidity and capital resources, without regard to its foreign deposits, that are directed to finance domestic operations and obligations and to fund expansion of its business for the foreseeable future.
marketable securities -from time to time, the company maintains investments held by several large, well-capitalized financial institutions. the company's investment policy does not allow investment in any securities rated less than
"investment grade" by national rating services.
management determines the appropriate classification of debt securities at the time of purchase and re-evaluates such designations as of each balance sheet date. debt securities are classified as available-for-sale because the company does not have the intent to hold the securities to maturity. available-for-sale securities are stated at their fair values, with the unrealized gains and losses reported in other comprehensive income.
the company had no other marketable securities other than those held in the defined benefit pension plan and the non-qualified deferred compensation plan at december 31, 2023 and 2022. see note 11 for further details.
materials and supplies -materials and supplies are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. cost is determined on the first-in, first-out method.
other current assets -other current assets include prepaid assets, the current portion of capitalized costs to obtain a contract, and an international bond investment.
income taxes -the company provides for income taxes based on fasb asc topic 740 "income taxes," which requires recognition of deferred tax liabilities and assets for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the consolidated financial statements or tax returns. the company provides an allowance for deferred tax assets when it determines that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be utilized. the company establishes additional provisions for income taxes when, despite the belief that tax positions are fully supportable, there remain certain positions that do not meet the minimum probability threshold.
equipment and property -equipment and property are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation, and are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the related assets. depreciation expense is computed using the following asset lives: buildings, 10to 40years; and furniture, fixtures and operating equipment,
2to 10years. expenditures for additions, major renewals and betterments are capitalized and expenditures for maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. the cost of assets retired or otherwise disposed of and the related accumulated depreciation and amortization are eliminated from the accounts in the year of disposal with the resulting gain or loss credited or charged to other income, net on our consolidated statements of income.
certain internal-use software and systems development costs are capitalized. accordingly, the specific identified costs incurred to develop and obtain software, which is intended for internal use, are not capitalized until the software is put into use. management, with the relevant authority, authorizes and commits to funding a software project and it is probable that the project will be completed and the software will be used to perform the function intended. costs incurred during a software development's discovery phase and post-integration stage, are expensed as incurred. application development activities that are eligible for capitalization include software design and configuration, development of interfaces, coding, testing and installation. capitalized internal-use software and systems costs are subsequently amortized on a straight-line basis over a threeto seven yearsperiod after project completion and when the related software or system is ready for intended use.
impairment of long-lived assets -in accordance with the fasb asc topic 360, "property, plant and equipment," the company's long-lived assets, such as property and equipment and intangible assets with definite lives are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be
table of contents recoverable. recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated undiscounted future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized in the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset. we periodically evaluate the appropriateness of remaining depreciable lives assigned to long-lived assets, including customer contracts and assets that may be subject to a management plan for disposition.
goodwill and other intangible assets -in accordance with the fasb asc topic 350, "intangibles - goodwill and other," the company classifies intangible assets into three categories: (1) intangible assets with definite lives subject to amortization; (2) intangible assets with indefinite lives not subject to amortization; and (3) goodwill.
the company does not amortize intangible assets with indefinite lives or goodwill. goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate the assets might be impaired. such conditions may include an economic downturn or a change in the assessment of future operations. the company performs impairment tests of goodwill at the reporting unit level. such impairment tests for goodwill include comparing the fair value of the appropriate reporting unit with its carrying value. if the fair value of the reporting unit is below the carrying value, the company recognizes a goodwill impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the reporting unit's fair value. the company performs impairment tests for indefinite-lived intangible assets by comparing the fair value of each indefinite-lived intangible asset to its carrying value. the company recognizes an impairment charge if the asset's carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value.
following the reorganization of our reporting structure, as discussed previously, and determination that we have twogoodwill reporting units, we changed the date of our annual goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment test from september 30 to october 1. the change in the date of the annual assessment represents a change in accounting principle. management believes this change in accounting principle is preferable, as the later date better aligns the timing of the tests with the availability of key inputs, such as forecasts for our tworeporting units, and provides additional time for the completion of our annual impairment testing in advance of our year-end reporting.
this change was not material to our consolidated financial statements and was not intended to nor did it delay, accelerate, or avoid an impairment charge. we determined that it was impracticable to objectively apply this change retrospectively as it would require application of significant estimates and assumptions with the use of hindsight.
any change in testing date for goodwill or an indefinite-lived intangible asset should not result in more than one year elapsing between impairment tests. we performed a goodwill impairment analysis as of january 1, 2023 and october 1, 2023. we performed an impairment analysis of our indefinite-lived intangible assets on september 30,
2023 and october 1, 2023. based upon the results of these analyses, the company has concluded that noimpairment of its goodwill or intangible assets with indefinite lives was indicated.
other assets -other assets is mostly comprised of deferred compensation assets, the non-current portion of capitalized costs to obtain a contract, and an international bond investment.
accrued insurance -the company retains, up to specified limits, certain risks related to general liability, workers' compensation and auto liability. risks are managed through either high deductible insurance or, for clark pest control only, a non-affiliated group captive insurance member arrangement. the estimated costs of existing and future claims under the retained loss program are accrued based upon historical trends as incidents occur, whether reported or unreported (although actual settlement of the claims may not be made until future periods) and may be subsequently revised based on developments relating to such claims. the group captive is subject to a third-party actuary retained by the captive manager, independent from the company. for the high deductible insurance program, the company contracts with an independent third-party actuary to provide the company an estimated liability based upon historical claims information. the actuarial study is a major consideration in establishing the reserve, along with management's knowledge of changes in business practice and existing claims compared to current balances.
management's judgment is inherently subjective as a number of factors are outside management's knowledge and control. additionally, historical information is not always an accurate indication of future events. the company continues to be proactive in safety and risk management to develop and maintain ongoing programs to reduce and prevent incidents and claims. initiatives that have been implemented include required pre-employment screening and ongoing motor vehicle record review for all drivers, post-offer physicals for new employees, pre-hire, random and post incident drug testing, driver training and post-injury nurse triage for work-related injuries. the accruals and reserves we hold are based on estimates that involve a degree of judgment and are inherently variable and could be overestimated or insufficient. if actual claims exceed our estimates, our operating results could be materially affected, and our ability to take timely corrective actions to limit future costs may be limited.
table of contents accrual for termite contracts -the company maintains an accrual for termite claims representing the estimated costs of reapplications, repairs and associated labor and chemicals, settlements, awards and other costs relative to termite control services. factors that may impact future costs include termiticide life expectancy and government regulation. an accrual for termite contracts is included in other current liabilities and long-term accrued liabilities on the company's consolidated statements of financial position.
other current liabilities -other current liabilities are mostly comprised of the current portion of acquisition holdback and earnout liabilities (see note 9), contingency accruals, deferred compensation liabilities (see note
other long-term accrued liabilities -other long-term accrued liabilities include long-term balances for deferred compensation, acquisition holdback and earnout liabilities, deferred tax liabilities, contingency accruals, and the long-term portion of unearned revenue.
contingency accruals -the company is a party to legal proceedings with respect to matters in the ordinary course of business. in accordance with the fasb asc topic 450 "contingencies," management estimates and accrues for its liability and costs associated with the pending and threatened legal and regulatory proceedings. estimates and accruals are determined in consultation with outside counsel. because it is not possible to accurately predict the ultimate result of the proceedings, judgments concerning accruals for liabilities and costs associated with litigation are inherently uncertain and actual liability may vary from amounts estimated or accrued. however, in the opinion of management, the outcome of the proceedings will not have a material adverse impact on the company's financial condition or results of operations. contingency accruals are included in other current liabilities and long-term accrued liabilities on the company's consolidated statements of financial position.
earnings per share -the fasb asc topic 260-10 "earnings per share-overall," requires a basic earnings per share and diluted earnings per share presentation. further, all outstanding unvested share-based payment awards that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents, whether paid or unpaid, are considered participating securities and an entity is required to include participating securities in its calculation of basic earnings per share.
the company calculates basic and diluted earnings per share using the two-class method. under the two-class method, net earnings are allocated to each class of common stock and participating security as if all of the net earnings for the period had been distributed. the company's participating securities consist of share-based payment awards that contain a nonforfeitable right to receive dividends and, therefore, are considered to participate in undistributed earnings with common shareholders. see note 13 for further information on restricted stock granted to employees. see note 18 for the calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share under the two-class method.
translation of foreign currencies -assets and liabilities reported in functional currencies other than u.s. dollars are translated into u.s. dollars at the year-end rate of exchange. revenues and expenses are translated at the weighted average exchange rates for the year. the resulting translation adjustments are charged or credited to other comprehensive income. gains or losses from foreign currency transactions, such as those resulting from the settlement of receivables or payables, denominated in foreign currency are included in the earnings of the current period.
stock-based compensation -the company accounts for its stock-based compensation in accordance with the fasb asc topic 718 " compensation - stock compensation ." time-lapsed restricted stock awards and restricted stock units
("restricted shares") have been issued to officers and other management employees under the company's employee stock incentive plan. in addition, in 2023, performance share units ("psus") were granted to the company's executive officers. the psus will vest and convert to shares of common stock at the end of a three-yearperformance period upon the company's successful achievement of certain financial and market performance goals. the company issues new shares from its authorized but unissued share pool.
restricted shares and psus provide for the issuance of a share of the company's common stock at no cost to the holder and generally vest after a certain stipulated number of years from the grant date, depending on the terms of the issue. during these years, certain restricted shares award grantees receive all dividends declared and retain voting rights for the granted shares. the agreements under which the restricted shares are issued provide that shares awarded may not be sold or otherwise transferred until restrictions established under the plans have lapsed.
the fair value of each restricted share and psus with company-specific performance criteria is equal to the market value of a share of the company's common stock on the grant date. for psus that are granted with a total shareholder return
("tsr") component, management estimates the fair value using a monte carlo simulation valuation model, as these awards are subject to a market condition. the fair value of these awards is recognized as compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures, on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.
comprehensive income (loss) -other comprehensive income (loss) results from foreign currency translations, minimum pension liability adjustments, cash flow hedge of interest rate risks and unrealized gains and losses on available for sale securities.
franchising program -the company has franchise programs through orkin, critter control and its australian subsidiaries. we had a total of 138, 137and 135domestic franchise agreements as of december 31, 2023, 2022 and
2021, respectively. international franchise agreements totaled 86, 89and 103as of december 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. transactions with our franchises involve sales of territories and customer contracts to establish new franchises and the payment of initial franchise fees and royalties by franchisees. the territories, customer contracts and initial franchise fees are typically paid for by a combination of cash and notes.
combined domestic and international revenues from orkin, critter control and australia franchises were $
16.5million, $ 15.6million and $ 15.5million for the years ended december 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
total franchising revenues were less than 1.0% of the company's annual revenues for each of the three years.
right to access intellectual property (franchise) -the right to access orkin's, critter control's and our australia franchisors' intellectual property is an essential part of our franchise agreements. these agreements provide the franchisee a license to use the brand name and trademark when advertising and selling services to end customers in their normal course of business. orkin and critter control franchise agreements contain a clause allowing the respective franchisor to purchase certain assets of the franchisee at the conclusion of their franchise agreement or upon termination. this is only an option for the franchisor to re-purchase the assets selected by the franchisor and is not a performance obligation or a form of consideration.
recent accounting guidance recently adopted accounting standards in march 2022, the fasb issued accounting standards update ("asu") 2022-02, "financial instruments-credit losses
(topic 326): troubled debt restructurings and vintage disclosures." the amendments in this update eliminate the accounting guidance for troubled debt restructurings (tdrs) by creditors in subtopic 310-40, receivables-troubled debt restructurings by creditors, while enhancing disclosure requirements for certain loan refinancings and restructurings by creditors when a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty. additionally, for public business entities, the amendments in this asu require that an entity disclose current-period gross write-offs by year of origination for financing receivables. asu 2022-02 was effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15,
2022. the adoption of this asu did not have a material impact on the company's consolidated financial statements.
accounting standards issued but not yet adopted in october 2023, the fasb issued asu 2023-06, "disclosure improvements: codification amendments in response to the sec's disclosure update and simplification initiative," to amend certain disclosure and presentation requirements for a variety of topics within the asc. these amendments align the requirements in the accounting standards codification ("asc") to the removal of certain disclosure requirements set out in regulation s-x and regulation s-k, announced by the sec. the effective date for each amended topic in the asc is either the date on which the sec's removal of the related disclosure requirement from regulation s-x or regulation s-k becomes effective, or on june 30, 2027, if the sec has not removed the requirements by that date. early adoption is prohibited. the company does not expect that the application of this standard will have an impact on its consolidated financial statements and disclosures.
in november 2023, the fasb issued asu 2023-07, "segment reporting (topic 280): improvements to reportable segment disclosures ("asu 2023-07"), which is intended to improve reportable segment disclosure requirements, primarily through additional and more detailed information about a reportable segment's expenses. the guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after december 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. the guidance is to be applied retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the financial statements. upon transition, the segment expense categories and amounts disclosed in the prior periods should be based on the significant segment expense categories identified and disclosed in the period of adoption.
table of contents the company is currently evaluating the potential impact of adopting this new guidance on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
in december 2023, the fasb issued asu 2023-09, "income taxes (topic 740): improvements to income tax disclosures"
this amendment modifies the rules on income tax disclosures to require entities to disclose (1) specific categories in the rate reconciliation and additional information for reconciling items that meet a quantitative threshold, (2)
the amount of income taxes paid (net of refunds received) (disaggregated by federal, state, and foreign taxes) as well as individual jurisdictions in which income taxes paid is equal to or greater than 5 percent of total income taxes paid net of refunds, (3) the income or loss from continuing operations before income tax expense or benefit
(disaggregated between domestic and foreign) and (4) income tax expense or benefit from continuing operations
(disaggregated by federal, state and foreign). the guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after december 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted for annual financial statements that have not yet been issued or made available for issuance. asu 2023-09 should be applied on a prospective basis, while retrospective application is permitted. the company is currently evaluating the potential impact of adopting this new guidance on its disclosures.
2. acquisitions fox pest control acquisition on april 1, 2023, the company acquired 100% of fpc holdings, llc ("fox pest control", or "fox"). as part of funding the fox pest control acquisition, on april 3, 2023, the company borrowed incremental amounts under the credit agreement of $ 305.0million. the proceeds were used to pay cash consideration at closing.
management believes that the acquisition will expand the rollins family of brands and drive long term value given fox's attractive financial profile and complementary end market exposure.
the fox pest control acquisition has been accounted for as a business combination, and the fox results of operations are included in the company's results of operations from the april 1, 2023, acquisition date. fox contributed revenues of $ 117.8million and net earnings of $ 1.6million from april 1, 2023, through the period end date, december 31, 2023. these earnings include the attribution of interest expense incurred on the borrowings to purchase fox.
the valuation of the fox pest control acquisition was performed by a third-party valuation specialist under our management's supervision. the preliminary values of identified assets acquired, and liabilities assumed for fox pest control are summarized as follows (in thousands).

assets acquired and liabilities assumed    $           339,514
the company purchased fox pest control for $ 339.5million. included in the total consideration are cash payments of
$ 302.8million made upon closing, contingent consideration valued at $ 28.0million that is based on fox pest control's financial performance in the twelve months following acquisition, and holdback liabilities valued at $
table of contents by the company to settle indemnity claims and working capital adjustments. the fair value of the contingent consideration was estimated using a monte carlo simulation. during the year ended december 31, 2023, we recorded a fair value adjustment of $ 3.1million related to contingent consideration resulting from the acquisition of fox.
this charge is reported within sales, general and administrative expenses in our condensed consolidated statement of income.
acquired customer contracts are estimated to have a remaining useful life of 7years. the acquired trademarks and tradenames are expected to have an indefinite useful life. see note 8, customer contracts, tradenames and trademarks, and other intangible assets for further details.
goodwill from this acquisition represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets of the business acquired. the factors contributing to the amount of goodwill are based on strategic and synergistic benefits that are expected to be realized. the recognized goodwill is expected to be deductible for tax purposes.
valuations of certain assets and liabilities, including intangible assets and goodwill, as of the acquisition date have not been finalized at this time and are provisional.
pro forma financial information the following table presents unaudited consolidated pro forma information as if the acquisition of fox had occurred on january 1, 2022. the information presented below is for illustrative purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of results that would have been achieved if the acquisition had actually occurred as of the beginning of such years or results which may be achieved in the future.
the pro forma financial information above adjusts for the effects of material business combination items, including the alignment of accounting policies, the effect of fair value adjustments including the amortization of acquired intangible assets, interest expense related to the incremental borrowings under the credit agreement, and income tax effects as if fox had been part of rollins since january 1, 2022.
table of contents other 2023 acquisitions the company made 23 other acquisitions during 2023. the aggregate preliminary values of major classes of assets acquired and liabilities assumed recorded at the dates of acquisition, as adjusted during the valuation period, are included in the reconciliation of the total preliminary consideration as follows (in thousands):
other current assets                             198
customer contracts                            31,996
other intangible assets                        2,357
current liabilities                           -1,462
other assets and liabilities, net             -2,472
assets acquired and liabilities assumed    $  76,708
included in the total consideration of $ 76.7million are acquisition holdback liabilities of $ 7.8million.
goodwill from these acquisitions represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets of businesses acquired. the factors contributing to the amount of goodwill are based on strategic and synergistic benefits that are expected to be realized. a majority of the recognized goodwill is expected to be deductible for tax purposes. valuations of certain assets and liabilities, including intangible assets and goodwill, as of the acquisition date have not been finalized at this time and are provisional.

29.9million, respectively. unearned short-term revenue is recognized over the next 12-month period. the majority of unearned long-term revenue is recognized over a period of five yearsor less with immaterial amounts recognized through 2033.
incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer incremental costs of obtaining a contract include only those costs that we incur to obtain a contract that we would not have incurred if the contract had not been obtained, primarily sales commissions. these costs are recorded as an asset and amortized to expense over the life of the contract to the extent such costs are expected to be recovered. as of december 31, 2023, we have $ 22.0million of unamortized capitalized costs to obtain a contract, of which $ 15.3million is recorded within other current assets and $ 6.7million is recorded within other assets on our consolidated statement of financial position. during the year ended december 31, 2023, we recorded approximately $
8.6million amortization of capitalized costs, which is recorded within sales, general and administrative expense on our consolidated statement of income. as of december 31, 2022, we had nounamortized capitalized costs to obtain a contract and we recorded noamortization of capitalized costs.
4. allowance for expected credit losses the company is exposed to credit losses primarily related to accounts receivables and financed receivables derived from customer services revenue. to reduce credit risk for residential accounts receivable, we promote enrollment in our auto-pay programs. in general, we may suspend future services for customers with past due balances. the company's credit risk is generally low with a large number of entities comprising rollins' customer base and dispersion across many different geographical regions.
the company manages its financed receivables on an aggregate basis when assessing and monitoring credit risks. the company's established credit evaluation and monitoring procedures seek to minimize the amount of business we conduct with higher risk customers. the credit quality of a potential obligor is evaluated at the loan origination based on an assessment of the individual's beacon/credit bureau score. rollins requires a potential obligor to have good creditworthiness with low risk before entering into a contract. depending upon the individual's credit score, the company may accept with 100% financing or require a significant down payment or turn down the contract.
delinquencies of accounts are monitored each month. financed receivables include installment receivable amounts, some of which are due subsequent to one year from the balance sheet dates.
total financed receivables, net were $ 112.9million and $ 97.1million at december 31, 2023 and december 31, 2022, respectively. financed receivables are generally charged-off when deemed uncollectible or when 180days have elapsed since the date of the last full contractual payment. the company's charge-off policy has been consistently applied during the periods reported. management considers the charge-off policy when evaluating the appropriateness of the allowance for expected credit losses. gross charge-offs as a percentage of average financed receivables were 9.2%
and 5.6% for the twelve months ended december 31, 2023 and december 31, 2022, respectively.
the company offers 90days same-as-cash financing to some customers based on their creditworthiness. interest is not recognized until the 91st day at which time it is calculated retrospectively back to the first day if the contract has not been paid in full. in certain circumstances, such as when delinquency is deemed to be of an administrative nature, accounts may still accrue interest when they reach 180days past due. as of december 31, 2023, there were noaccounts greater than 180days past due.
included in financed receivables are notes receivable from franchise owners. the majority of these notes are low risk as the repurchase of these franchises is guaranteed by the company's wholly-owned subsidiary, orkin systems, llc, and the repurchase price of the franchise is currently estimated and has historically been well above the receivable due from the franchise owner. also included in notes receivables are franchise notes from other brands which are not guaranteed and do not have the same historical valuation.
the carrying amount of notes receivable approximates fair value as the interest rates approximate market rates for these types of contracts. long-term installment receivables, net were $ 75.9million and $ 63.5million at december
the company's allowances for credit losses for trade accounts receivable and financed receivables are developed using historical collection experience, current economic and market conditions, reasonable and supportable forecasts, and a
table of contents review of the current status of customers' receivables. the company's receivable pools are classified between residential customers, commercial customers, large commercial customers, and financed receivables. accounts are written off against the allowance for credit losses when the company determines that amounts are uncollectible, and recoveries of amounts previously written off are recorded when collected. the company stops accruing interest to these receivables when they are deemed uncollectible. below is a roll forward of the company's allowance for credit losses for the years ended december 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021.

6. leases the company leases certain buildings, vehicles, and equipment in order to reduce the risk associated with ownership. the company elected the practical expedient approach permitted under asc topic 842, "leases" not to include short-term leases with a duration of 12 months or less on the balance sheet. as of december 31, 2023 and
2022, all leases were classified as operating leases. building leases generally carry terms of 5to 10years with annual rent escalations at fixed amounts per the lease. vehicle leases generally carry a fixed term of one yearwith renewal options to extend the lease on a monthly basis resulting in lease terms up to 7years depending on the class of vehicle. the exercise of renewal options is at the company's sole discretion. it is reasonably certain that the company will exercise the renewal options on its vehicle leases. the measurement of right-of-use assets and liabilities for vehicle leases includes the fixed payments associated with such renewal periods. we separate lease and non-lease components of contracts. our lease agreements do not contain any material variable payments, residual value guarantees, early termination penalties or restrictive covenants.
table of contents the company uses the rate implicit in the lease when available; however, most of our leases do not provide a readily determinable implicit rate. accordingly, we estimate our incremental borrowing rate based on information available at lease commencement.
(in thousands, except other                                        years ended information)                   financial statement                december 31, components of lease expense    classification                             2023             2022            2021

operating leases subsequent to the issuance of the company's 2022 financial statements, management determined that certain immaterial short-term lease costs were omitted from the disclosure of short-term lease costs for the years ended december 31, 2022 and 2021. the disclosure of short-term leases costs has been restated from the amounts previously reported to correct the amount of short-term lease cost for the years ended december 31, 2022 and 2021. there was no impact on our consolidated statements of income, financial position, or cash flows.
lease commitments future minimum lease payments, including assumed exercise of renewal options at december 31, 2023 were as follows:
interest future commitments presented in the table above include lease payments in renewal periods for which it is reasonably certain that the company will exercise the renewal option. total future minimum lease payments for operating leases, including the amount representing interest, are comprised of $ 173.5million for building leases and $ 190.7million for
table of contents vehicle leases. as of december 31, 2023, the company had additional future obligations of $ 17.8million for leases that had not yet commenced.

8. customer contracts, tradenames and trademarks, and other intangible assets customer contracts are amortized on a straight-line basis as this best approximates the ratio that current revenues bear to the total of current and anticipated revenues based on the estimated lives of the assets. in accordance with the fasb asc topic 350 "intangibles - goodwill and other" , the expected lives of customer contracts were analyzed, and it was determined that customer contracts should be amortized over a life of 7to 20years dependent upon customer type.
the carrying amount and accumulated amortization for customer contracts were as follows:
customer contracts                $   625,920    $   502,689

9. fair value measurement the company's financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables, financed and notes receivable, accounts payable, other short-term liabilities, and debt. the carrying amounts of these financial instruments approximate their respective fair values. the company also has financial instruments related to its defined benefit pension plan and deferred compensation plan detailed in note 11.
the fair value hierarchy has three levels based on the reliability of the inputs used to determine fair value.
level 1 refers to fair values determined based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets. level 2
refers to fair values estimated using significant other observable inputs, and level 3 includes fair values estimated using significant non-observable inputs.
as of december 31, 2023 and 2022, the company had investments in international bonds of $ 10.2million and $
10.7million, respectively. these bonds are accounted for as available for sale securities and are level 2 assets under the fair value hierarchy. at december 31, 2022, $ 0.5million was included in other current assets and $

10. debt on february 24, 2023, the company entered into a revolving credit agreement ("the credit agreement") with, among others, jpmorgan chase bank, n.a. ("jpmorgan chase"), as administrative agent (in such capacity, the
"administrative agent"), which refinanced its previous credit facility described below. this credit agreement replaces the april 2019 facility that was set to expire in april 2024. our previous facility is more fully discussed in our annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2022.
the credit agreement provides for a $ 1.0billion revolving credit facility (the "credit facility"), which may be denominated in u.s. dollars and other currencies, including euros, australian dollars, canadian dollars, new zealand dollars, pounds sterling and japanese yen, subject to a $ 400million foreign currency sublimit. the credit facility also includes sub-facilities for the issuance of letters of credit of up to $ 150million and swing line loans at the administrative agent's discretion of up to $ 50million. certain subsidiaries of rollins provide unsecured guarantees of the credit facility. rollins has the ability to expand its borrowing availability under the credit agreement in the form of increased revolving commitments or one or more tranches of term loans by up to an additional $ 750million, subject to the agreement of the participating lenders and certain other customary conditions. the maturity date of the loans under the credit agreement is february 24, 2028.
loans under the credit agreement bear interest, at rollins' election, at (i) for loans denominated in u.s. dollars,
(a) an alternate base rate (subject to a floor of 0.00%), which is the greatest of (x) the prime rate publicly announced from time to time by jpmorgan chase, (y) the greater of the federal funds effective rate and the federal reserve bank of new york overnight bank funding rate, plus 50basis points, and (z) adjusted term sofr for a one month interest period, plus a margin ranging from 0.00% to 0.50% per annum based on rollins' consolidated total net leverage ratio; or (b) the greater of term sofr for the applicable interest period plus 10basis points ("adjusted term sofr") and zero, plus a margin ranging from 1.00% to 1.50% per annum based on rollins' consolidated total net leverage ratio; and (ii) for loans denominated in other currencies, including euros, australian dollars, canadian dollars, new zealand dollars, pounds sterling and japanese yen, such interest rates as set forth in the credit agreement.
the credit agreement contains customary terms and conditions, including, without limitation, certain financial covenants including covenants restricting rollins' ability to incur certain indebtedness or liens, or to merge or consolidate with or sell substantially all of its assets to another entity. further, the credit agreement contains a financial covenant restricting rollins' ability to permit the ratio of rollins' consolidated total net debt to ebitda to exceed 3.50to 1.00. following certain acquisitions, rollins may elect to increase the financial covenant level to 4.00to 1.00 temporarily. the ratio is calculated as of the last day of the fiscal quarter most recently ended. the credit agreement also contains provisions permitting a future environmental, social and governance amendment, subject to certain terms and conditions contained therein, by which pricing may be adjusted pursuant to the company's performance measured against certain sustainability-linked metrics. the company is in compliance with applicable financial debt covenants as of december 31, 2023.
as of december 31, 2023, the company had outstanding borrowings of $ 493.0million under the credit facility.

the company sponsors the waltham plan, which covers less than 80participants as of december 31, 2023. the waltham plan was amended, effective september 1, 2018, to freeze future benefit accruals for all participants. the company accounts for all defined benefit plans in accordance with the fasb asc topic 715 "compensation retirement benefits," and engages an outside actuary to calculate obligations and costs. with the assistance of the actuary, the company evaluates the significant assumptions used on a periodic basis, including the estimated future return on plan assets, the discount rate, and other factors, and makes adjustments to these liabilities as necessary. as of december 31, 2023, the fair value of waltham plan assets were $ 1.6million, with a projected liability of $
2.0million and an unfunded status of $ 0.4million. at december 31, 2023 the plan's assets were comprised of listed common stocks and u.s government and corporate securities and are classified as level 1 and level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.
defined contribution 401(k) savings plan the company sponsors a defined contribution 401(k) savings plan ("the plan") that is available to a majority of the company's full-time employees the first day of the calendar quarter following completion of three monthsof service.
the plan is available to non-full-time employees the first day of the calendar quarter following one yearof service upon completion of 1000hours in that year. the plan provides for a matching contribution of one dollar ($1.00) for each one dollar ($1.00) of a participant's contributions to the plan that do not exceed 3percent of his or her eligible compensation (which includes commissions, overtime, and bonuses) and fifty cents ($0.50) for each one dollar ($1.00) of a participant's contributions to the plan over the initial 3percent that do not exceed 6percent of his or her eligible compensation (which includes commissions, overtime and bonuses). the charge to expense for the company match was approximately $ 32.9million , $ 29.9million and $ 25.7million for the years ended december
31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. at december 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021 approximately 30.4%, 30.6%, and 28.7%, respectively, of the fair value of plan assets consisted of rollins, inc. common stock. total administrative fees paid by the company for the plan were insignificant for each of the years ended december 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021.
nonqualified deferred compensation plan the deferred compensation plan provides that participants may defer up to 50% of their base salary and up to 85% of their annual bonus with respect to any given plan year, subject to a $ 2thousand per plan year minimum. the company may make discretionary contributions to participant accounts but has not done so since 2011.
accounts will be credited with hypothetical earnings, and/or debited with hypothetical losses, based on the performance of certain "measurement funds." account values are calculated as if the funds from deferrals and company credits had been converted into shares or other ownership units of selected measurement funds by purchasing
table of contents such shares or units at the current purchase price of the relevant measurement fund at the time of the participant's selection. deferred compensation plan benefits are unsecured general obligations of the company to the participants, and these obligations rank in parity with the company's other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. the company has established a "rabbi trust," which it uses to voluntarily set aside amounts to indirectly fund any obligations under the deferred compensation plan. to the extent that the company's obligations under the deferred compensation plan exceed assets available under the trust, the company would be required to seek additional funding sources to fund its liability under the deferred compensation plan.
generally, the deferred compensation plan provides for distributions of any deferred amounts upon the earliest to occur of a participant's death, disability, retirement or other termination of employment (a "termination event").
however, for any deferrals of salary and bonus (but not company contributions), participants would be entitled to designate a distribution date which is prior to a termination event. generally, the deferred compensation plan allows a participant to elect to receive distributions under the deferred compensation plan in installments or lump-sum payments.
at december 31, 2023, the deferred compensation plan had 75life insurance policies with a net face value of $
48.4million compared to 75policies with a face value of $ 45.8million at december 31, 2022. the cash surrender value of these life insurance policies was $ 25.5million and $ 23.2million at december 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. these policies are valued using the nav practical expedient.
the following table presents our non-qualified deferred compensation plan assets using the fair value hierarchy as of december 31, 2023 and 2022.
cash and cash equivalents, which are used to pay benefits and deferred compensation plan administrative expenses, are held in money market funds.

12. commitments and contingencies in the normal course of business, the company and its subsidiaries are involved in, and will continue to be involved in, various claims, arbitrations, contractual disputes, investigations, litigation, environmental and tax and other regulatory matters relating to, and arising out of, our businesses and our operations. these matters may involve, but are not limited to, allegations that our services or vehicles caused damage or injury, claims that our services did not achieve the desired results, and claims related to acquisitions and allegations by federal, state or local authorities, including taxing authorities, of violations of regulations or statutes. in addition, we are parties to employment-related cases and claims from time to time, which may include claims on a representative or class action basis alleging wage and hour law violations or claims related to the operation of our retirement benefit plans. we are also involved from time to time in certain environmental matters primarily arising in the normal course of business. we evaluate pending and threatened claims and establish loss contingency reserves based upon outcomes we currently believe to be probable and reasonably estimable in accordance with asc 450.
the company retains, up to specified limits, certain risks related to general liability, workers' compensation and auto liability. the estimated costs of existing and future claims under the retained loss program are accrued based upon historical trends as incidents occur, whether reported or unreported (although actual settlement of the claims may not be made until future periods) and may be subsequently revised based on developments relating to such claims. the company contracts with an independent third party to provide the company an estimated liability based upon historical claims information. the actuarial study is a major consideration in establishing the reserve, along with management's knowledge of changes in business practice and existing claims compared to current balances.
management's judgment is inherently
table of contents subjective as a number of factors are outside management's knowledge and control. additionally, historical information is not always an accurate indication of future events. the accruals and reserves we hold are based on estimates that involve a degree of judgment and are inherently variable and could be overestimated or insufficient.
if actual claims exceed our estimates, our operating results could be materially affected, and our ability to take timely corrective actions to limit future costs may be limited.
item 103 of sec regulation s-k requires disclosure of certain environmental legal proceedings if the proceeding reasonably involves potential monetary sanctions of $300,000 or more. the company has received a notice of alleged violations and information requests from local governmental authorities in california for our orkin and clark pest control operations and is currently working with several local governments regarding compliance with environmental regulations governing the management of hazardous waste and pesticide disposal. the investigation appears to be part of a broader effort to investigate waste handling and disposal processes of a number of industries. while we are unable to predict the outcome of this investigation, we do not believe the outcome will have a material effect on our results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows.
management does not believe that any pending claim, proceeding or litigation, regulatory action or investigation, either alone or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on the company's financial position, results of operations or liquidity; however, it is possible that an unfavorable outcome of some or all of the matters could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an individual quarter or year.

the company recognizes compensation expense for the unvested portion of awards outstanding over the remainder of the service period. the compensation cost recorded for these awards is based on the company's closing stock price at the grant
table of contents date less the cost of estimated forfeitures. forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods to reflect actual forfeitures. for psus that are granted with a total shareholder return ("tsr") component, management estimates the fair value using a monte carlo simulation valuation model, as these awards are subject to a market condition.
restricted shares and psus provide for the issuance of a share of the company's common stock at no cost to the holder and generally vest after a certain stipulated number of years from the grant date, depending on the terms of the issue. restricted shares and psus typically vest over approximately oneto six-yearperiods. during these years, grantees of certain awards receive all dividends declared and retain voting rights for the granted shares. the agreements under which the one-time grant of restricted stock is issued provide that shares awarded may not be sold or otherwise transferred until restrictions established under the plans have lapsed.

certain income tax disclosures for prior periods have been restated to conform to current period presentation.
subsequent to the issuance of the company's 2022 financial statements, management determined that certain deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities presented on a net basis as of december 31, 2022 should have been presented as separate deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities in the disclosure. as a result, the presentation of deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities as of december 31, 2022 have been restated from the amounts previously reported to separately present certain deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities.
deferred tax assets are included in "other assets" and deferred tax liabilities are included in "other long-term accrued liabilities" on the balance sheet.
in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all the deferred tax assets will not be realized. as of december 31, 2023, the company increased its valuation allowance by approximately $ 6.9million related to deferred tax assets on intangible assets held in australia. the company does not expect to recognize such deferred tax assets as it expects to continue its operations in australia for the foreseeable future and the related intangible assets are not amortizable for tax purposes in australia.
table of contents the changes in the company's valuation allowance for deferred tax assets are as follows:
as of december 31, 2023, the company has nonet operating loss carryforwards in any federal, state, or foreign jurisdictions. the company has a $ 1.4million foreign tax credit carryforward which if not fully utilized will expire in 2026. the company also has state tax credit carryforwards of $ 1.8million which will expire in 2026 if not fully utilized.
we intend to continue to grow the business in the international markets where we have a presence. as of december
31, 2023, we assert that foreign cash earnings in excess of working capital and cash needed for strategic investments and acquisitions are not intended to be indefinitely reinvested offshore and we have included the tax effects of such current and/or future repatriations, including applicable state taxes and foreign withholding tax of such cash earnings in these financial statements. any non-cash unremitted earnings in our foreign subsidiaries are considered to be permanently reinvested and deferred taxes have not been provided on these earnings.
the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits as of december 31, 2023 that, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate is $ 1.8million. a reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:
unrecognized tax benefits at beginning      $  1,394    $  1,018    $    844
of year additions for tax positions of prior             653         376         174
years reductions for tax positions of prior           -263           -           -
years unrecognized tax benefits at end of year    $  1,784    $  1,394    $  1,018
as of december 31, 2023, the company believes it is reasonably possible that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits may decrease by $ 0.6million over the next 12 months as it relates to foreign jurisdictions.
the company files u.s. federal income tax returns, as well as separate and combined income tax returns in numerous state and foreign jurisdictions. the company is under examination in certain state jurisdictions for years ranging from 2016 through 2021. the company regularly assesses the outcomes of both ongoing and future examinations for the current or prior years to ensure the company's provision for income taxes is sufficient. the company recognizes liabilities based on estimates of whether additional taxes will be due and believes its reserves are adequate in relation to any potential assessments. the outcome of any one examination, some of which may conclude during the next 12 months, is not expected to have a material impact on the company's financial position or results of operations.

item 7.    management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.
presentation this discussion should be read in conjunction with our audited financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this document. discussions of 2021 items and year-to-year comparisons of 2022 and 2021 that are not included in this form 10-k can be found in "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" in part ii, item 7 of our annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2022. the following discussion (as well as other discussions in this document) contains forward-looking statements. please see "cautionary statement regarding forward-looking statements" and "risk factors" for a discussion of uncertainties, risks and assumptions associated with these statements.
the company rollins, inc. ("rollins," "we," "us," "our," or the "company"), is an international services company headquartered in atlanta, georgia that provides pest and termite control services to both residential and commercial customers through its wholly-owned subsidiaries and independent franchises in the united states, canada, australia, europe, and asia with international franchises in canada, central and south america, the caribbean, europe, the middle east, asia, africa, and australia. our pest and termite control services are performed pursuant to terms of contracts that specify the pricing arrangement with the customer. the company operates as one reportable segment and the results of operations and its financial condition are not reliant upon any single customer.
strategic update we are focused on continuous improvement throughout the business. during 2023, we made significant strides in all four pillars of our strategic objectives: 1) people first 2) customer loyalty 3) growth mindset and 4) operational efficiency.
people first during 2023, we focused on the safety of our people. we are continuously improving our safety culture and monitoring our measurable safety goals. for example, throughout the year we made considerable progress with respect to the implementation and adoption of our driver safety application, which monitors driver behaviors once a vehicle is in motion. our average driver safety score for drivers that we monitor showed improvement in 2023. we also executed a restructuring program during the year to modernize our workforce and enable us to make more strategic improvements in our support functions. we remain committed to developing exceptional talent and investing in our teams, including a focus on strategic hiring in both support functions, as well as the customer-facing side of our business.
customer loyalty we remain committed to providing our customers with the best customer experience. effective sales and service staffing levels helped us to capitalize on continued demand and deliver solid results for the year, with organic revenues* growing by 8.2% compared to 2022.
2023 marked a record year in terms of revenues, totaling $3.1 billion, an increase of 14.0% over 2022, with acquisition revenues* growing by 5.9% compared to 2022. we completed the acquisition of fox pest control ("fox"), one of the largest acquisitions in the company's history, for $339.5 million. we also completed 23 additional acquisitions in 2023, driving inorganic growth at several of our brands.
operational efficiency we saw healthy margins in 2023, with gross margin improving 70 basis points to 52.2% in 2023 compared to 51.5% in 2022. operating margin was 19.0% of revenue, an increase of 70 basis points over 2022 and adjusted operating income margin* at 19.7%, an increase of 140 basis points over the prior year.
*amounts are non-gaap financial measures. see the schedules below for definitions and a discussion of non-gaap financial metrics, including a reconciliation to the most directly comparable gaap measure.
impact of economic trends the continued disruption in economic markets due to high inflation, increases in interest rates, business interruptions due to natural disasters and changes in weather patterns, employee shortages, and supply chain issues, all pose challenges which may adversely affect our future performance. the company continues to execute various strategies previously implemented to help mitigate the impact of these economic disruptors.
however, the company cannot reasonably estimate whether these strategies will help mitigate the impact of these economic disruptors in the future.
the company's consolidated financial statements reflect estimates and assumptions made by management that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and related disclosures as of the date of the condensed consolidated financial statements. the company considered the impact of economic trends on the assumptions and estimates used in preparing the consolidated financial statements. in the opinion of management, all material adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the company's financial results for the year have been made. these adjustments are of a normal recurring nature but are complicated by the continued uncertainty surrounding these macro economic trends. the severity, magnitude and duration of certain economic trends continue to be uncertain and are difficult to predict. therefore, our accounting estimates and assumptions may change over time in response to economic trends and may change materially in future periods.
the extent to which increasing interest rates, inflation and other economic trends will continue to impact the company's business, financial condition and results of operations is uncertain. therefore, we cannot reasonably estimate the full future impacts of these matters at this time.

revenues for the year ended december 31, 2023 were $3.1 billion, an increase of $377.5 million, or 14.0%, from 2022 revenues of $2.7 billion. the increase in revenues was driven by demand from our customers that remained strong throughout the year across all major service offerings. comparing 2023 to 2022, organic revenue* growth was 8.2% while acquisitions drove 5.9% of total growth. looking at the service offerings, residential pest control revenue increased approximately 17%, commercial pest control revenue increased approximately 11% and termite and ancillary services grew approximately 13% including both organic and acquisition-related growth in each area. organic revenue* growth was strong across our service offerings, growing over 6% in residential, approximately 10% in commercial, and over 10% in termite and ancillary activity. the company's foreign operations accounted for approximately 7% of total revenues for the years ended december 31, 2023 and 2022.
we continue to maintain a very healthy balance sheet that positions us well to continue to invest in growth initiatives across our business as we enter 2024, from an organic perspective, we are proactively managing pricing across our portfolio. additionally, while lead generation and the overall demand environment are healthy to start the new year, we continue to navigate the negative impact of a colder january in certain parts of our business.
*amounts are non-gaap financial measures. see the schedules below for definitions and a discussion of non-gaap financial metrics, including a reconciliation to the most directly comparable gaap measure.
gross profit gross profit for the year ended december 31, 2023 was $1.6 billion, an increase of $216.0 million, or 15.6%, compared to $1.4 billion for the year ended december 31, 2022. gross margin improved 70 basis points to 52.2% in 2023 compared to 51.5% in 2022. the acquisition of fox drove 20 basis points of leverage in 2023. excluding this, gross margin improved 50 basis points as pricing more than offset increases in our cost structure. looking specifically at people related costs, materials and supplies, and fleet, which comprise 87% of total cost of services, we saw an improvement of 90 basis points associated with leverage in these categories, as pricing more than offset inflationary pressures. insurance and claims experience decreased gross margins in 2023 by 10 basis points.
we expect the normal seasonality to drive lower gross profit margins in the first and fourth quarters of 2024 relative to the second and third quarters on the lower level of business activity.
sales, general and administrative for the twelve months ended december 31, 2023, sales, general and administrative (sg&a) expenses increased $112.5 million, or 14.0%, compared to the twelve months ended december 31, 2022. the increase is driven by people-related costs, advertising and selling expenses associated with growth initiatives. as a percentage of revenue, sg&a was consistent at 29.8% in 2023 and 2022, as we continue to manage our cost structure while investing in growth initiatives.
restructuring costs during the twelve months ended december 31, 2023, we executed a restructuring program to modernize our workforce. this effort resulted in expense of approximately $5.2 million in the year. the large majority of the costs incurred are related to severance-related costs for employees who were terminated as part of this effort. the changes were primarily across corporate-related functions and will enable us to make more strategic improvements in our support functions.
depreciation and amortization for the twelve months ended december 31, 2023, depreciation and amortization increased $8.4 million, or 9.2%, compared to the twelve months ended december 31, 2022. the increase was due to higher amortization of intangible assets from acquisitions, most notably fox, offset by lower depreciation of operating equipment and internal-use software.
operating income for the twelve months ended december 31, 2023, operating income increased $89.8 million or 18.2% compared to the prior year. as a percentage of revenue, operating income increased to 19.0% from 18.3% in the prior year. the improvement in operating income as a percentage of sales is primarily driven by the improvement in gross profit discussed previously.
we expect the first and fourth quarters to represent our lowest level for margins and profitability due primarily to the lower level of volume generated in those quarters due to the impact of seasonality.
interest expense, net during the twelve months ended december 31, 2023, interest expense, net increased $16.4 million compared to the prior year, due to the increase in the average debt balance associated primarily with the acquisition of fox and the share repurchase completed during 2023.
debt levels and corresponding interest expense are expected to remain elevated in the first half of 2024 due primarily to the higher level of debt associated with the acquisition of fox and the share repurchases during 2023.
other income, net during the twelve months ended december 31, 2023, other income, net increased $13.9 million primarily due to the company recognizing a $15.5 million gain on the sale of certain businesses during 2023, offset by lower gains from asset sales.
income taxes the company's effective tax rate was 25.8% in 2023 compared to 26.1% in 2022. the 2023 rate was favorably impacted by lower state income taxes and federal tax credits compared to 2022.
non-gaap financial measures reconciliation of gaap and non-gaap financial measures the company has used the non-gaap financial measures of organic revenues, adjusted operating income, adjusted operating margin, adjusted net income, and adjusted earnings per share ("eps"), earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("ebitda"), ebitda margin, adjusted ebitda, adjusted ebitda margin, and free cash flow in this form 10-k. organic revenue is calculated as revenue less the revenue from acquisitions completed within the prior 12 months and excluding the revenue from divested businesses. adjusted operating income and adjusted operating margin are calculated by adding back to the gaap measures those expenses resulting from the amortization of certain intangible assets and adjustments to the fair value of contingent consideration resulting from the acquisition of fox pest control and restructuring costs related to restructuring and workforce reduction plans. adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin are calculated by adding back to net income interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization expense those expenses resulting from the adjustments to the fair value of contingent consideration resulting from the acquisition of fox pest control, restructuring costs related to restructuring and workforce reduction plans, and gains on the sale of businesses. adjusted net income and adjusted eps are calculated by adding back those acquisition-related expenses, restructuring costs, and gains on the sale of businesses to the gaap measures and by further subtracting the tax impact of those expenses and/or gains. free cash flow is calculated by subtracting capital expenditures from cash provided by operating activities. these measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for revenues, net income, earnings per share or other performance measures prepared in accordance with gaap.
management uses adjusted operating income, adjusted operating margin, adjusted net income, adjusted eps, ebitda, ebitda margin, adjusted ebitda, adjusted ebitda margin, and free cash flow as measures of operating performance because this measure allows the company to compare performance consistently over various periods. management also uses organic revenues to compare revenues over various periods excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures. management uses free cash flow to demonstrate the company's ability to maintain its asset base and generate future cash flows from operations. an analysis of any non-gaap financial measure should be used in conjunction with results presented in accordance with gaap.
a non-gaap financial measure is a numerical measure of financial performance, financial position, or cash flows that either 1) excludes amounts, or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of excluding amounts, that are included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap in the statement of operations, balance sheet or statement of cash flows, or 2) includes amounts, or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of including amounts, that are excluded from the most directly comparable measure so calculated and presented.

critical accounting estimates the company views critical accounting estimates to be those that are very important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations, and that require management's most difficult, complex or subjective judgments. the circumstances that make these judgments difficult or complex relate to the need for management to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. we believe our critical accounting estimates to be as follows:
accrued insurance-the company retains, up to specified limits, certain risks related to u.s. general liability, workers' compensation and auto liability. risks are managed through either high deductible insurance or, for clark pest control only, a non-affiliated group captive insurance member arrangement. the estimated costs of existing and future claims under the retained loss program are accrued based upon historical trends as incidents occur, whether reported or unreported (although actual settlement of the claims may not be made until future periods) and may be subsequently revised based on developments relating to such claims. the group captive is subject to a third-party actuarial study retained by the captive manager, independent from the company. for the high deductible insurance program, the company contracts with an independent third-party actuary to provide the company an estimated liability based upon historical claims information. the actuarial study is a major consideration in establishing the reserve, along with management's knowledge of changes in business practice and existing claims compared to current balances. management's judgment is inherently subjective as a number of factors are outside management's knowledge and control. additionally, historical information is not always an accurate indication of future events. the company continues to be proactive in safety and risk management to develop and maintain ongoing programs to reduce and prevent incidents and claims. initiatives that have been implemented include required pre-employment screening and ongoing motor vehicle record review for all drivers, post-offer physicals for new employees, pre-hire, random and post incident drug testing, driver training and post-injury nurse triage for work-related injuries. the accruals and reserves we hold are based on estimates that involve a degree of judgment and are inherently variable and could be overestimated or insufficient. if actual claims exceed our estimates, our operating results could be materially affected, and our ability to take timely corrective actions to limit future costs may be limited.
business combinations-we account for business combinations by recognizing the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date fair value. in valuing certain acquired assets and liabilities, fair value estimates use significant, non-observable inputs (level 3), including future expected cash flows and discount rates. goodwill is measured as the excess of consideration transferred over the fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. while we use our best estimates and assumptions to value assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date, our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. as a result, during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. upon the conclusion of the measurement period, any subsequent adjustments arising from new facts and circumstances are recorded to the consolidated statements of operations. the results of operations of acquisitions are reflected in our consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition.
accounting for business combinations requires our management to make significant estimates and assumptions about intangible assets, assets and obligations assumed, contingent consideration, and other contingencies. critical inputs and assumptions in valuing certain of the intangible assets include, but are not limited to, future expected cash flows from customer contracts; the acquired company's trademarks & tradenames, and competitive position, as well as assumptions about the period of time the acquired trademarks & tradenames will continue to be used in the combined company's product portfolio; and discount rates. these significant assumptions are forward-looking and could be affected by future economic and market conditions.

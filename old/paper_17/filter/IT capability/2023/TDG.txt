item 1a.    risk factors set forth below are material risks and uncertainties that could negatively affect our business and financial condition and could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed in forward-looking statements contained in this report. additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may impair our business operations and financial condition. you should not interpret the disclosure of any risk factor to imply that the risk has not already materialized.
during a prolonged period of significant market disruption in the aerospace and defense industry, such as the adverse impact that the covid-19 pandemic had on the commercial aerospace market, and other macroeconomic factors such as when recessions occur, our business may be disproportionately impacted compared to peer companies that are more diversified in the industries they serve. a more diversified company with significant sales and earnings derived from outside the aerospace and defense sector may be able to recover more quickly from significant market disruptions such as the covid-19 pandemic.
in fiscal year 2023, no customer individually accounted for 10% or more of the company's net sales; however, our top ten customers for fiscal year 2023 accounted for approximately 41% of our net sales. a material reduction in purchasing by one of our larger customers for any reason, including but not limited to general economic or aerospace downturns, decreased production, strike or resourcing, could have a material adverse effect on results of operations, financial position and cash flows.
we generally do not have guaranteed future sales of our products. further, when we enter into fixed price contracts with some of our customers, we take the risk for cost overruns.
as is customary in our business, we do not generally have long-term contracts with most of our aftermarket customers and, therefore, do not have guaranteed future sales. although we have long-term contracts with many of our oem customers, many of those customers may terminate the contracts on short notice and, in most cases, our customers have not committed to buy any minimum quantity of our products. in addition, in certain cases, we must anticipate the future volume of orders based upon the historic purchasing patterns of customers and upon our discussions with customers as to their anticipated future requirements, and this anticipated future volume of orders may not materialize.
we also have entered into multi-year, fixed-price contracts with some of our customers, pursuant to which we have agreed to perform the work for a fixed price and, accordingly, realize all the benefit or detriment resulting from any decreases or increases in the costs of making these products. this risk is greater in a high inflationary environment, such as currently. sometimes we accept a fixed-price contract for a product that we have not yet produced, and this increases the risk of cost overruns or delays in the completion of the design and manufacturing of the product. most of our contracts do not permit us to recover increases in raw material prices, taxes or labor costs.
we intend to pursue acquisitions. our business may be adversely affected if we cannot consummate acquisitions on satisfactory terms, or if we cannot effectively integrate acquired operations.
a significant portion of our growth has occurred through acquisitions. any future growth through acquisitions will be partially dependent upon the continued availability of suitable acquisition candidates at favorable prices and upon advantageous terms and conditions. we intend to pursue acquisitions that we believe will present opportunities consistent with our overall business strategy. however, we may not be able to find suitable acquisition candidates to purchase or may be unable to acquire desired businesses or assets on economically acceptable terms or may be unable to receive necessary regulatory approvals or support. in addition, we may not be able to raise the capital necessary to fund future acquisitions. because we may actively pursue a number of opportunities simultaneously, we may encounter unforeseen expenses, complications and delays, including regulatory complications or difficulties in employing sufficient staff and maintaining operational and management oversight.
we regularly engage in discussions with respect to potential acquisition and investment opportunities. if we consummate an acquisition, our capitalization and results of operations may change significantly. future acquisitions could result in margin dilution and further likely result in the incurrence of additional debt and contingent liabilities and an increase in interest and amortization expenses or periodic impairment charges related to goodwill and other intangible assets as well as significant charges relating to integration costs.
acquisitions involve risks that the businesses acquired will not perform in accordance with expectations and that business judgments concerning the value, strengths and weaknesses of businesses acquired will prove incorrect. in addition, we may not be able to successfully integrate any business we acquire into our existing business. the successful integration of new businesses, with the most significant recent acquisition being the calspan corporation ("calspan") acquisition in the third quarter of fiscal 2023, depends on our ability to manage these new businesses and cut excess costs. the successful integration of future acquisitions may also require substantial attention from our senior management and the management of the acquired business, which could decrease the time that they have to service, attract customers and develop new products and services or attend to other acquisition opportunities.
our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health and could harm our ability to react to changes to our business and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under our indebtedness.
we have a significant amount of indebtedness. as of september 30, 2023, our total indebtedness, excluding approximately $51 million in letters of credit outstanding, approximately $193 million of finance lease obligation liabilities and approximately $21 million of government refundable advances, was approximately $20 billion, which was approximately 111% of our total book capitalization.
in addition, we may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future. as of september 30, 2023, we had approximately $759 million of unused commitments under our revolving credit facility and $100 million of additional borrowing capacity under our trade receivable securitization facility (the "securitization facility"). although our senior secured credit facility and the indentures governing the various series of senior secured and senior subordinated notes outstanding (the "notes") contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of significant qualifications and exceptions, and the indebtedness incurred in compliance with these qualifications and exceptions could be substantial. a breach of any of the covenants or an inability to comply with the required leverage ratio could result in a default under the senior secured credit facility or the indentures.
an increase in our indebtedness could also have other important consequences to investors. for example, it could:
•increase our vulnerability to general economic downturns and adverse competitive and industry conditions;
•require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital requirements, capital expenditures, acquisitions, research and development efforts and other general corporate requirements;
•limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;
•place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to competitors that have less debt; and
•limit, along with the financial and other restrictive covenants contained in the documents governing our indebtedness, among other things, our ability to borrow additional funds, make investments and incur liens.
all of our debt under the senior secured credit facility, which includes $6.2 billion in term loans and a revolving credit facility of $810 million, and the securitization facility bears interest at variable rates primarily based on the term secured overnight financing rate ("term sofr"). accordingly, if term sofr or other variable interest rates increase, our debt service expense will also increase. in order to mitigate the interest rate risk of these variable rate borrowings, we have in the past entered into interest rate swap, cap, and collar agreements that cover a significant portion of the existing variable rate debt and may do so in the future, subject to market and other conditions. in connection with our term loans, we entered into various interest rate swap, cap and collar agreements associated with term sofr. the company's objective is to maintain an allocation of at least 75% fixed rate and 25% variable rate debt thereby limiting its exposure to changes in near-term interest rates. as of september 30, 2023, approximately 90% of our total debt was fixed rate. for information about our interest rate swap, cap and collar agreements, refer to note 21, "derivatives and hedging instruments," in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included herein.
our indebtedness increases the possibility that we may be unable to generate cash sufficient to pay, when due, the principal of, interest on or other amounts due in respect of our indebtedness, including debt under the senior secured credit facility and the notes. we cannot assure that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us under the senior secured credit facility or otherwise in amounts sufficient to enable us to service our indebtedness. if we cannot service our debt, we will have to take actions such as reducing or delaying capital investments, selling assets, restructuring or refinancing our debt or seeking additional equity capital.
to service our indebtedness, we will require a significant amount of cash. our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control and any failure to meet our debt service obligations could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.
our ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness, including the notes, amounts borrowed under the senior secured credit facility, amounts due under our securitization facility, and to fund our operations, will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future, which, to a certain extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control.
we cannot assure that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations, or that future borrowings will be available to us under the senior secured credit facility or otherwise in amounts sufficient to enable us to service our indebtedness, including the amounts borrowed under the senior secured credit facility, amounts borrowed under our securitization facility and the notes, or to fund our other liquidity needs. if we cannot service our debt, we will have to take actions such as reducing or delaying capital investments, selling assets, restructuring or refinancing our debt or seeking additional equity capital. we cannot assure that any of these remedies could, if necessary, be effected on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. our ability to restructure or refinance our debt will depend on the condition of the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations. the terms of existing or future debt instruments, the securitization facility, the indentures governing the notes and the senior secured credit facility may restrict us from adopting any of these alternatives. in addition, any failure to make payments of interest and principal on our outstanding indebtedness on a timely basis would likely result in a reduction of our credit rating, which could harm our ability to incur additional indebtedness on acceptable terms and could otherwise adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
the terms of the senior secured credit facility and indentures governing the notes may restrict our current and future operations, particularly our ability to respond to changes or to take certain actions.
our senior secured credit facility and the indentures governing the notes contain a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on td group, transdigm inc. and its subsidiaries (in the case of the senior secured credit facility) and transdigm inc. and its subsidiaries (in the case of the indentures) and may limit their ability to engage in acts that may be in our long-term best interests. the senior secured credit facility and indentures governing the notes include covenants restricting, among other things, the ability of td group, transdigm inc. and its subsidiaries (in the case of the senior secured credit facility) and transdigm inc. and its subsidiaries (in the case of the indentures) to:
•incur or guarantee additional indebtedness or issue preferred stock;
•pay distributions on, redeem or repurchase our capital stock or redeem or repurchase our subordinated debt;
•engage in transactions with affiliates;
•engage in certain business activities.
a breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under the senior secured credit facility or the indentures governing the notes. if any such default occurs, the lenders under the senior secured credit facility and the holders of the notes may elect to declare all outstanding borrowings, together with accrued interest and other amounts payable thereunder, to be immediately due and payable. the lenders under the senior secured credit facility also have the right in these circumstances to terminate any commitments they have to provide further borrowings. in addition, subject to the terms of an intercreditor agreement, following an event of default under the senior secured credit facility or the indentures governing our various series of outstanding senior secured notes, the lenders thereunder or the holders thereof, as applicable, will have the right to proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure the debt, which includes our available cash, and they will also have the right to prevent us from making debt service payments on the senior subordinated notes. if the debt under the senior secured credit facility or the notes were to be accelerated, we cannot assure that our assets would be sufficient to repay in full our debt.
because our products are complicated and highly engineered, we depend on an educated and trained workforce. historically, there has been substantial competition for skilled personnel in the aerospace and defense industry, and we could be adversely affected by a shortage of skilled employees. we may not be able to fill new positions or vacancies created by expansion or turnover or attract and retain qualified personnel. we cannot be assured that we can continue to hire, train and retain qualified employees at current wage rates since we operate in a competitive labor market, and there are currently significant inflationary and other pressures on wages.
although we believe that our relations with our employees are satisfactory, we cannot assure that we will be able to negotiate a satisfactory renewal of collective bargaining agreements or that our employee relations will remain stable. because we strive to limit the volume of finished goods inventory, any work stoppage could materially and adversely affect our ability to provide products to our customers.
in addition, our success depends in part on our ability to attract and motivate our senior management and key employees. achieving this objective may be difficult due to a variety of factors, including fluctuations in economic and industry conditions, competitors' hiring practices, and the effectiveness of our compensation programs. competition for qualified personnel can be intense. if we are unable to effectively provide for the succession of key personnel, senior management and our executive officers, including our president, chief executive officer and director, our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition may be adversely affected. the company's board of directors continually monitors this risk and we believe that the company's succession plan, together with our straightforward strategy, clear value drivers, decentralized nature and the quality of managers running our operating units helps to mitigate this risk.
a significant public health crisis, such as the covid-19 pandemic, could cause disruption to our operations. the covid-19 pandemic had a negative effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. it affected our business due to the impact on the global economy, including its effects on the commercial aerospace industry, the supply chain and raw material availability, production efforts and customer demand for our products and services. our ability to predict and respond to future changes resulting from potential health crises is uncertain. even after a public health crises subsides, there may be long-term effects on our business practices and customers in economies in which we operate that could severely disrupt our operations and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. as we cannot predict the duration, scope or severity of future public health crises, the negative financial impact to our results cannot be reasonably estimated and could be material.
our sales to manufacturers of large commercial aircraft, such as boeing, airbus, and related oem suppliers, as well as manufacturers of business jets have historically experienced periodic downturns. in the past, these sales have been affected by airline profitability, which is impacted by, among other things, fuel and labor costs, price competition, interest rates, downturns in the global economy and national and international events. in addition, sales of our products to manufacturers of business jets are impacted by, among other things, downturns in the global economy. in recent years, such as in fiscal 2021 and the second half of fiscal 2020, we experienced decreased sales across the commercial oem sector driven primarily by the decrease in production by boeing and airbus related to reduced demand in the commercial aerospace industry from the covid-19 pandemic, and airlines deferring or cancelling orders. regulatory and quality challenges, such as with boeing's 737 max aircraft and 787 aircraft, also has had an adverse impact. downturns adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.
our business is dependent on the availability of certain components and raw materials from suppliers.
our business is affected by the price and availability of the raw materials and component parts that we use to manufacture our components. our business, therefore, could be adversely impacted by factors affecting our suppliers (such as the destruction of our suppliers' facilities or their distribution infrastructure, a work stoppage or strike by our suppliers' employees or the failure of our suppliers to provide materials of the requisite quality), or by increased costs of such raw materials or components if we were unable to pass along such price increases to our customers.
we are currently experiencing supply shortages and inflationary pressures for certain components and raw materials that are important to our manufacturing process, particularly electronic parts, due to global supply chain constraints. expected growth in the global economy may exacerbate these pressures on us and our suppliers, and we expect these supply chain challenges and cost impacts to continue for the foreseeable future. because we strive to limit the volume of raw materials and component parts on hand, our business could be adversely affected if we were unable to obtain these raw materials and components from our suppliers in the quantities we require or on favorable terms. although we believe in most cases that we could identify alternative suppliers, or alternative raw materials or component parts, the lengthy and expensive aviation authority and oem certification processes associated with aerospace products could prevent efficient replacement of a supplier, raw material or component part.
we face significant competition.
we operate in a highly competitive global industry and compete against a number of companies. competitors in our product lines are both u.s. and foreign companies and range in size from divisions of large public corporations to small privately-held entities. we believe that our ability to compete depends on high product performance, consistent high quality, short lead-time and timely delivery, competitive pricing, superior customer service and support and continued certification under customer quality requirements and assurance programs. we may have to adjust the prices of some of our products to stay competitive.
climate-related regulations designed to address climate change may result in additional compliance costs.
our operations and the products we sell are currently subject to rules limiting emissions and to other climate-related regulations in certain jurisdictions where we operate. the increased prevalence of global climate change concerns may result in new regulations that may negatively impact us, our suppliers and customers. we are continuing to evaluate short-, medium- and long-term risks related to climate change. we cannot predict what environmental legislation or regulations will be enacted in the future, how existing or future laws or regulations will be administered or interpreted, or what environmental conditions may be found to exist. compliance with any new or more stringent laws or regulations, or stricter interpretations of existing laws, could require additional expenditures by us or our suppliers, in which case, the costs of raw materials and component parts could increase.
as a whole, because our manufacturing facilities primarily engage in assembly and light manufacturing and because we do not maintain any transportation infrastructure, we have relatively low scope 1 and scope 2 emissions. accordingly, we do not anticipate any material adverse impact from increased carbon regulation directly on our manufacturing operations. further, because of our wide portfolio of hundreds of thousands of products, we do not anticipate any material adverse impact from the reliance on a supplier or group of suppliers that may be subject to climate risks. however, regulation that would have a material adverse impact on air travel could have a material adverse impact on our business. given the political significance and uncertainty around these issues, we cannot predict how legislation, regulation, and increased awareness of these issues will affect our operations and financial condition. we have established a science-aligned greenhouse gas emissions reduction target of at least a 50% reduction in our scope 1 and scope 2 emissions on an absolute basis by the year 2031. fiscal 2019 is the selected baseline year for transdigm that we will compare against as we make progress towards our emissions reduction goal. we continue to evaluate ways to reduce our energy and water consumption and lower our greenhouse gas emissions through energy efficiency measures, the purchase of green power and other actions.
our operations depend on our manufacturing facilities, which are subject to physical and other risks that could disrupt production.
our operations and those of our customers and suppliers have been and may again be subject to natural disasters, climate change-related events, pandemics or other business disruptions, which could seriously harm our results of operation and increase our costs and expenses. some of our manufacturing facilities are located in regions that may be impacted by severe weather events, such as increased storm frequency or severity in the atlantic and fires in hotter and drier climates. these could result in potential damage to our physical assets as well as disruptions in manufacturing activities. some of our manufacturing facilities are located in areas that may be at risk due to rising sea levels. moreover, some of our manufacturing facilities are located in areas that could experience decreased access to water due to climate issues.
we are also vulnerable to damage from other types of disasters, including power loss, fire, explosions, floods, communications failures, terrorist attacks and similar events. disruptions could also occur due to health-related outbreaks and crises, cyber attacks, computer or equipment malfunction (accidental or intentional), operator error or process failures. should insurance or other risk transfer mechanisms, such as our existing disaster recovery and business continuity plans, be insufficient to recover all costs, we could experience a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows.
operations and sales outside of the united states may be subject to additional risks.
our net sales to foreign customers were approximately $2.3 billion for the fiscal year ended september 30, 2023. a number of risks inherent in international operations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, including war, sanctions, global health crises, currency fluctuations, difficulties in staffing and managing multinational operations, general economic and political uncertainties and potential for social unrest in countries in which we operate, limitations on our ability to enforce legal rights and remedies, restrictions on the repatriation of funds, change in trade policies, tariff regulation, difficulties in obtaining export and import licenses and the risk of government financed competition.
issues with the global supply chain can also rise due to some of the aforementioned risks, as well as the availability and cost of raw materials to suppliers, merchandise quality or safety issues, shipping and transport availability and cost, increases in wage rates and taxes, transport security, inflation and other factors relating to the suppliers and the countries in which they are located or from which they import. such issues are often beyond our control and could adversely affect our operations and profitability. furthermore, the company is subject to laws and regulations, such as the foreign corrupt practices act, u.k. bribery act and similar local anti-bribery laws, which generally prohibit companies and their employees, agents and contractors from making improper payments for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. failure to comply with these laws could subject the company to civil and criminal penalties that could materially adversely affect the company's results of operations, financial position and cash flows.
we are monitoring the ongoing conflicts between israel and hamas and between russia and ukraine and the related export controls and financial and economic sanctions imposed on certain industry sectors, including the aviation sector, and parties in russia by the u.s., the u.k., the european union and others. although the conflicts have not, nor are expected to, have a direct material adverse impact on transdigm's business, the implications of the israel and hamas and russia and ukraine conflicts in the short-term and long-term are difficult to predict at this time. factors such as increased energy costs, the availability of certain raw materials for aircraft manufacturers, embargoes on flights from certain airlines, sanctions on certain companies, and the stability of certain customers could impact the global economy and aviation sector.
companies engaged in supplying defense-related equipment and services to u.s. government agencies, whether through direct contracts with the u.s. government or as a subcontractor to customers contracting with the u.s. government, are subject to business risks specific to the defense industry. these risks include the ability of the u.s. government to unilaterally:
•revoke required security clearances; and
•audit contract-related costs and fees, including allocated indirect costs.
most u.s. government contracts can be terminated by the u.s. government at its convenience without significant notice. termination for convenience provisions provide only for recovery of costs incurred or committed, settlement expenses and profit on the work completed prior to termination.
most of our u.s. government contracts are based on a firm-fixed price. on contracts for which the price is based on the reimbursement of costs, the u.s. government may review our costs and performance, as well as our accounting and general business practices. based on the results of such audits, the u.s. government may adjust our contract-related costs and fees, including allocated indirect costs. in addition, under u.s. government purchasing regulations, some of our costs, including most financing costs, amortization of intangible assets, portions of research and development costs, and certain marketing expenses may not be subject to reimbursement under cost-reimbursement contracts.
furthermore, even where the price is not based on cost, the u.s. government may seek to review our costs to determine whether our pricing is "fair and reasonable." our subsidiaries are periodically subject to pricing reviews and government buying agencies that purchase some of our subsidiaries' products are periodically subject to audits by the dod with respect to prices paid for such products. as a result of these audits, we could be asked to enter into an arrangement whereby our prices would be based on cost, plus a nominal fee, the dod could seek to pursue alternative sources of supply for our parts, or the u.s. government could take other adverse actions with respect to our contracts. any of those occurrences could lead to a reduction in our revenue from, or the profitability of certain of our supply arrangements with, certain agencies and buying organizations of the u.s. government. further, negative publicity relating to the results of any audit, inquiry or subsequent hearing or the like could negatively impact our stock price.
if a government inquiry or investigation uncovers improper or illegal activities, we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties or administrative sanctions, including contract termination, fines, forfeiture of fees, suspension of payment and suspension or debarment from doing business with u.s. government agencies, any of which could materially adversely affect our reputation, business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
moreover, u.s. government purchasing regulations contain a number of additional operational requirements, which do not apply to entities not engaged in government contracting. failure to comply with such government contracting requirements could result in civil and criminal penalties that could have a material adverse effect on the company's results of operations.
the aerospace industry is highly regulated in the u.s. and in other countries. in order to sell our products, we and the products we manufacture must be certified by the faa, the dod and similar agencies in foreign countries and by individual manufacturers. if new and more stringent government regulations are adopted or if industry oversight increases, we might incur significant expenses to comply with any new regulations or heightened industry oversight. in addition, if material authorizations or approvals were revoked or suspended, our business would be adversely affected.
in addition to the aviation approvals, we are at times required to obtain approval from u.s. government agencies and similar agencies elsewhere in the world to export our products. u.s. laws and regulations applicable to us include the arms export control act, the international traffic in arms regulations ("itar"), the export administration regulations ("ear") and the trade sanctions laws and regulations administered by the united states department of the treasury's office of foreign assets control ("ofac"). ear restricts the export of commercial and dual-use products and technical data to certain countries, while itar restricts the export of defense products, technical data and defense services.
failure to obtain approval to export or determination by the u.s. government or similar agencies elsewhere in the world that we failed to receive required approvals or licenses could eliminate or restrict our ability to sell our products outside the united states or other country of origin, and the penalties that could be imposed by the u.s. government or other applicable government for failure to comply with these laws could be significant.
the interpretation and application of data protection laws in the u.s. and globally, including but not limited to the general data protection regulation (the "gdpr"), the california consumer privacy act (the "ccpa") and china's personal information protection law ("pipl"), are uncertain and evolving. it is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our data practices. complying with these various laws is difficult and could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business. further, although we have implemented internal controls and procedures designed to ensure compliance with the gdpr, ccpa, pipl and other privacy-related laws, rules and regulations (collectively, the "data protection laws"), there can be no assurance that our controls and procedures will enable us to be fully compliant with all data protection laws. any failure to comply with data protection laws could result in significant penalties, fines, legal challenges and reputational harm.
increased cybersecurity threats and more sophisticated and targeted computer crime have posed and could continue to pose a risk to our information technology systems and a disruption to or breach in the security of such systems, if material, could have adverse effects on our result of operations and financial condition.
we rely extensively on information technology systems to manage and operate our business, some of which are managed by third parties. the security and functionality of these information technology systems, and the processing of data by these systems, are critical to our business operations. if these systems, or any part of the systems, are damaged, intruded upon, attacked, shutdown or cease to function properly (whether by planned upgrades, force majeure, telecommunications failures, criminal acts, including hardware or software break-ins or extortion attempts, or viruses, or other cybersecurity incidents) and we suffer any resulting interruption in our ability to manage and operate our business or if our products are affected, our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. in fact, we have experienced data security incidents, although these have not had a material impact on our financial results. furthermore, the company has access to classified, sensitive, confidential, or personal data or information that is subject to privacy and security laws, regulations, or other contractually-imposed controls.
despite our use of reasonable and appropriate technical security controls and monitoring, security breaches, theft, misplaced, lost or corrupted data, programming, or employee errors and/or malfeasance have led and could in the future lead to the compromise or improper use of such sensitive, confidential, or personal data or information. such events may result in possible negative consequences, such as fines, ransom demands, penalties, failure to comply with laws governing sensitive data, negative publicity, loss of reputation, loss of intellectual property, loss of competitiveness or customers, increased security and compliance costs or other negative consequences. further, the amount of insurance coverage that we maintain may be inadequate to cover claims or liabilities relating to a cybersecurity incident. depending on the nature and magnitude of these events, they may have an adverse impact on our results of operations or financial condition.
risks related to legal and regulatory matters we could incur substantial costs as a result of violations of or liabilities under environmental laws and regulations.
our operations and facilities are subject to a number of federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and regulations that govern, among other things, discharges of pollutants into the air and water, the generation, handling, storage and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes, the remediation of contamination and the health and safety of our employees. environmental laws and regulations may require that the company investigate and remediate the effects of the release or disposal of materials at sites associated with past and present operations. certain facilities and third-party sites utilized by subsidiaries of the company have been identified as potentially responsible parties under the federal superfund laws and comparable state laws. the company is currently involved in the investigation and remediation of a number of sites under applicable laws.
estimates of the company's environmental liabilities are based on current facts, laws, regulations and technology. these estimates take into consideration the company's prior experience and professional judgment of the company's environmental advisors. estimates of the company's environmental liabilities are further subject to uncertainties regarding the nature and extent of site contamination, the range of remediation alternatives available, evolving remediation standards, imprecise engineering evaluations and cost estimates, the extent of corrective actions that may be required and the number and financial condition of other potentially responsible parties, as well as the extent of their responsibility for the remediation.
accordingly, as investigations and remediations proceed, it is likely that adjustments in the company's accruals will be necessary to reflect new information. the amounts of any such adjustments could have a material adverse effect on the company's results of operations or cash flows in a given period. based on currently available information, however, the company does not believe that future environmental costs in excess of those accrued with respect to sites for which the company has been identified as a potentially responsible party are likely to have a material adverse effect on the company's financial condition.
we may be subject to periodic litigation and regulatory proceedings, which may adversely affect our business and financial performance.
from time to time, we are involved in lawsuits and regulatory actions brought or threatened against us in the ordinary course of business. these actions and proceedings may involve claims for, among other things, compensation for alleged personal injury, workers' compensation, employment discrimination, or breach of contract. in addition, we may be subject to class action lawsuits, including those involving allegations of violations of consumer product statutes or the fair labor standards act and state wage and hour laws. due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation, we cannot accurately predict the ultimate outcome of any such actions or proceedings. the outcome of litigation, particularly class action lawsuits and regulatory actions, is difficult to assess or quantify, as plaintiffs may seek recovery of very large or indeterminate amounts in these types of lawsuits, and the magnitude of the potential loss may remain unknown for substantial periods of time. in addition, plaintiffs in many types of actions may seek punitive damages, civil penalties, consequential damages or other losses, or injunctive or declaratory relief. these proceedings could result in substantial cost and may require us to devote substantial resources to defend ourselves. the ultimate resolution of these matters through settlement, mediation, or court judgment could have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.
our operations expose us to potential liabilities for personal injury or death as a result of the failure of an aircraft product that we have designed, manufactured or serviced. while we maintain liability insurance to protect us from future product liability claims, in the event of product liability claims our insurers may attempt to deny coverage or any coverage we have may not be adequate. we also may not be able to maintain insurance coverage in the future at an acceptable cost. any liability not covered by insurance or for which third-party indemnification is not available could result in significant liability to us.
in addition, a crash caused by one of our products could damage our reputation for quality products. we believe our customers consider safety and reliability as key criteria in selecting a provider of aircraft products. if a crash were to be caused by one of our products, or if we were to otherwise fail to maintain a satisfactory record of safety and reliability, our ability to retain and attract customers may be materially adversely affected.
our ability to achieve our environmental, social and governance goals are subject to risks, many of which are outside of our control, and our reputation and brands could be harmed if we fail to meet such goals.
companies across all industries are facing increasing scrutiny from stakeholders related to environmental, social and governance ("esg") matters, including practices and disclosures related to environmental stewardship; social responsibility; diversity, equity and inclusion; and workplace rights. our ability to achieve our esg goals, including our goal to achieve our scope 1 and scope 2 emissions by the year 2031, and to accurately and transparently report our progress presents numerous operational, financial, legal and other risks, and may be dependent on the actions of suppliers and other third parties and significant technological advancements with respect to the development and availability of reliable, affordable and sustainable alternative solutions, all of which are outside of our control. if we are unable to meet our esg goals or evolving stakeholder expectations and industry standards, or if we are perceived to have not responded appropriately to the growing concern for esg issues, our reputation could be negatively impacted. in addition, in recent years, investor advocacy groups and certain institutional investors have placed increasing importance on esg matters. if, as a result of their assessment of our esg practices, certain investors are unsatisfied with our actions or progress, they may reconsider their investment in us.
as the nature, scope and complexity of esg reporting, diligence and disclosure requirements expand, including the sec's recently proposed disclosure requirements regarding, among other matters, greenhouse gas emissions, we may have to undertake additional costs to control, assess and report on esg metrics. any failure or perceived failure, whether or not valid, to pursue or fulfill our esg goals, targets and objectives or to satisfy various esg reporting standards within the timelines we announce, or at all, could increase the risk of litigation.
mergers and acquisitions have resulted in significant increases in identifiable intangible assets and goodwill. identifiable intangible assets, which primarily include trademarks, trade names, customer relationships, and technology, were approximately $2.7 billion at september 30, 2023, representing approximately 14% of our total assets. goodwill recognized in accounting for mergers and acquisitions was approximately $9.0 billion at september 30, 2023, representing approximately 45% of our total assets. we may never realize the full value of our identifiable intangible assets and goodwill, and to the extent we were to determine that our identifiable intangible assets or our goodwill were impaired within the meaning of applicable accounting standards, we would be required to write-off the amount of any impairment.
we may be subject to risks relating to changes in our tax rates or exposure to additional income tax liabilities.
we are subject to income taxes in the u.s. and various non-u.s. jurisdictions. the company's domestic and international tax liabilities are dependent upon the location of earnings among these different jurisdictions. the company's future results of operations could be adversely affected by changes in the company's effective tax rate as a result of changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets, challenges by tax authorities or changes in tax laws or regulations. from time to time, changes in tax laws or regulations may be proposed or enacted that could adversely affect our overall tax liability. there can be no assurance that changes in tax laws or regulations, both within the u.s. and the other jurisdictions in which we operate, such as the proposed 15% global minimum tax under the organisation for economic co-operation and development (the "oecd") pillar two, global anti-base erosion rules (the "pillar two rules"), will not materially and adversely affect our effective tax rate, tax payments, financial condition and results of operations. as of september 30, 2023, among the jurisdictions where the company operates, only the u.k. has enacted legislation adopting the pillar two rules, effective in fiscal 2025.
in addition, the amount of income taxes paid by the company is subject to ongoing audits by u.s. federal, state and local tax authorities and by non-u.s. tax authorities. if these audits result in assessments different from amounts reserved, future financial results may include unfavorable adjustments to the company's tax liabilities, which could have a material adverse effect on the company's results of operations.
notwithstanding special cash dividends, of which the most recent declaration by the company's board of directors was on november 9, 2023 in the amount of $35.00 per outstanding share of common stock, which is payable on november 27, 2023 to stockholders of record as of november 20, 2023, we do not anticipate declaring regular cash dividends, whether quarterly or annual, on our common stock or any other equity security in the foreseeable future.
the amounts that may be available to us to pay future special cash dividends are restricted under our debt and other agreements. any payment of special cash dividends on our common stock in the future will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our results of operations, earnings, capital requirements, financial condition, future prospects, contractual restrictions and other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors. therefore, shareholders should not rely on regular quarterly or annual dividend income from shares of our common stock and should not rely on special dividends with any regularity or at all.
general risks our commercial business is sensitive to the number of flight hours that our customers' planes spend aloft, the size and age of the worldwide aircraft fleet and our customers' profitability. these items are, in turn, affected by general economic and geopolitical and other worldwide conditions.
our commercial business is directly affected by, among other factors, changes in rpks, the size and age of the worldwide aircraft fleet, the percentage of the fleet that is out-of-warranty and changes in the profitability of the commercial airline industry. rpks and airline profitability have historically been correlated with the general economic environment, although national and international events also play a key role. for example, in addition to the covid-19 pandemic, past examples in which the airline industry has been negatively affected include downturns in the global economy, higher fuel prices, increased security concerns among airline customers following the events of september 11, 2001, the severe acute respiratory syndrome ("sars") epidemic, and conflicts abroad. additional examples include future geopolitical or other worldwide events, such as war, terrorist acts, or additional worldwide infectious disease outbreaks.
in addition, global market and economic conditions have been challenging due to turbulence in the u.s. and international markets and economies and have prolonged declines in business and consumer spending. as a result of the substantial reduction in airline traffic resulting from the aforementioned events, the airline industry incurred large losses and financial difficulties. some carriers parked or retired a portion of their fleets and reduced workforces and flights. during periods of reduced airline profitability, some airlines may delay purchases of spare parts, preferring instead to deplete existing inventories, and delay refurbishments and discretionary spending. if demand for spare parts decreases, there would be a decrease in demand for certain products. an adverse change in demand could impact our results of operations, collection of accounts receivable and our expected cash flow generation from current and acquired businesses which may adversely impact our financial condition and access to capital markets.
u.s. military spending is dependent upon the u.s. defense budget.
the military and defense market is significantly dependent upon government budget trends, particularly the dod budget. in addition to normal business risks, our supply of products to the u.s. government is subject to unique risks largely beyond our control. dod budgets could be negatively impacted by several factors, including, but not limited to, a change in defense spending policy as a result of the presidential election or otherwise, the u.s. government's budget deficits, spending priorities (e.g., shifting funds to assist ukraine in the russia and ukraine conflict or to assist israel), the cost of sustaining the u.s. military presence internationally and possible political pressure to reduce u.s. government military spending, each of which could cause the dod budget to remain unchanged or to decline. a significant decline in u.s. military expenditures could result in a reduction in the amount of our products sold to the various agencies and buying organizations of the u.s. government.
there has been significant volatility in the market price and trading volume of equity securities, which is unrelated to the operating performance of the companies issuing the securities. these market fluctuations may negatively affect the market price of our common stock. shareholders may not be able to sell their shares at or above the purchase price due to fluctuations in the market price of our common stock. such changes could be caused by changes in our operating performance or prospects, including possible changes due to the cyclical nature of the aerospace industry and other factors such as fluctuations in oem and aftermarket ordering, which could cause short-term swings in profit margins. or such changes could be unrelated to our operating performance, such as changes in market conditions affecting the stock market generally or the stocks of aerospace companies or changes in the outlook for our common stock, such as changes to or the confidence in our business strategy, changes to or confidence in our management, or expectations for future growth of the company.
item 7.    management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with td group's consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this report. the following discussion may contain predictions, estimates and other forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties, including those discussed under the heading entitled "risk factors" included elsewhere in this report. these risks could cause our actual results to differ materially from any future performance suggested below.
overview for fiscal year 2023, we generated net sales of $6,585 million, gross profit of $3,842 million or 58.3% of net sales, and net income attributable to td group of $1,298 million. we believe we have achieved steady, long-term growth in sales and improvements in operating performance due to our competitive strengths and through execution of our value-driven operating strategy. more specifically, we believe that focusing our businesses on our value-driven operating strategy of obtaining profitable new business, carefully controlling the cost structure and pricing our highly engineered value-added products to fairly reflect the value we provide and the resources required to do so has historically resulted in improvements in gross profit and income from operations over the long-term.
our selective acquisition strategy has also been an important contribution to the growth of our business. the integration of acquisitions into our existing businesses combined with implementing our proven operating strategy has historically resulted in improvements in the financial performance of the acquired business.
we believe our key competitive strengths include:
large and growing installed product base with aftermarket revenue stream. we provide components to a large and growing installed base of aircraft to which we supply aftermarket products. we estimate that our products are installed on over 100,000 commercial transport, regional transport, military and general aviation fixed wing turbine aircraft and rotary wing aircraft.
diversified revenue base. we believe that our diversified revenue base reduces our dependence on any particular product, platform or market channel and has been a significant factor in maintaining our financial performance. our products are installed on almost all of the major commercial aircraft platforms now in production. we expect to continue to develop new products for military and commercial applications. our current initiatives include creating new products that are more environmentally friendly, such as radiation-free exciters, and creating new products that will help further improve commercial airlines' efforts to keep passengers healthy and safe, such as touch-free aircraft lavatory suite products.
our business strategy is made up of two key elements: (1) a value-driven operating strategy focused around our three core value drivers and (2) a selective acquisition strategy.
•obtaining profitable new business. we attempt to obtain profitable new business by using our technical expertise and application skill and our detailed knowledge of our customer base and the individual niche markets in which we operate. we have regularly been successful in identifying and developing both aftermarket and oem products to drive our growth.
•improving our cost structure. we are committed to maintaining and continuously improving our lean cost structure through detailed attention to the cost of each of the products that we offer and our organizational structure, with a focus on reducing the cost of each.
selective acquisition strategy. we selectively pursue the acquisition of proprietary aerospace component businesses when we see an opportunity to create value through the application of our three core value-driven operating strategies. the aerospace industry, in particular, remains highly fragmented, with many of the companies in the industry being small private businesses or small non-core operations of larger businesses. we have significant experience among our management team in executing acquisitions and integrating acquired businesses into our company and culture. as of the date of this report, we have successfully acquired approximately 88 businesses and product lines since our formation in 1993. many of these acquisitions have been integrated into an existing transdigm production facility, which enables a higher production capacity utilization, which in turn improves gross profit levels due to the ability to spread the fixed manufacturing overhead costs over higher production volume. in the case of larger acquisitions that consist of multiple operating units (such as the esterline acquisition in fiscal 2019), we may pursue opportunities to divest certain acquired operating units that are not in line with our long-term acquisition strategy.
acquisitions and divestitures during the most recent three fiscal years is described in note 2, "acquisitions and divestitures," in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included herein. also as further disclosed in note 2, on november 9, 2023, transdigm announced that it entered into a definitive agreement to acquire the electron device business of communications & power industries for approximately $1,385 million in cash. the acquisition is expected to close by the end of transdigm's third quarter of fiscal 2024.
throughout fiscal 2023, we continued to see a rebound in our commercial aerospace end markets from the covid-19 pandemic and are encouraged by the progression of the commercial aerospace market recovery to date. commercial air travel in domestic markets continues to lead the air traffic recovery with most domestic markets nearing, achieving or surpassing pre-pandemic air traffic levels. the pace of the international recovery has been slower than the domestic recovery and remains below pre-pandemic levels. however, international rpks, a metric used to measure air traffic demand, continues to make positive strides as most countries have removed international traveler restrictions and there is pent-up demand for long-haul travel. current industry consensus indicates that worldwide rpks will recover or surpass calendar year 2019 (i.e., pre-pandemic levels) in calendar year 2024. therefore, we expect the company's commercial aerospace end markets to continue progressing into fiscal 2024 barring any significant disruptions or setbacks. in fiscal 2023, we experienced improved sales in the commercial oem sector primarily due to increased aircraft production by boeing and airbus. aircraft production rates continue to lag pre-pandemic levels, mainly due to continued commercial oem supply chain issues that are slowing the pace of new aircraft manufacturing. however, airline demand for new aircraft is strong and both boeing and airbus have disclosed further planned oem production rate increases for calendar 2024.
the pace of u.s. government defense spending outlays and government funding reprioritization provides for uncertainty in the defense aerospace market. defense sales rebounded in the second half of fiscal 2023 due to improving u.s. government defense spend outlays (though, in management's estimation, the current lag between spend authorizations and outlays remains longer than historical average levels). recent dod budgets have trended upwards; however, the ongoing conflicts between russia and ukraine and israel and hamas and potential impact on reprioritization of u.s. government defense spending and other ancillary impacts of these conflicts causes uncertainty.
in fiscal 2023, the pandemic continued to disrupt the global supply chain and labor markets, though the disruption has gradually improved. the disruption has resulted in delays in the availability of certain raw materials and increased freight costs, raw material costs and labor costs. our business has been adversely affected, though not materially, and could continue to be adversely affected by disruptions in our ability to timely obtain raw materials and components from our suppliers in the quantities we require or on favorable terms. although we believe in most cases that we could identify alternative suppliers, or alternative raw materials or component parts, the lengthy and expensive aviation authority and oem certification processes associated with aerospace products could prevent efficient replacement of a supplier, raw material or component part.

fiscal year ended september 30, 2023 compared with fiscal year ended september 30, 2022
•net sales. net organic sales and acquisition sales and the related dollar and percentage changes for the fiscal years ended september 30, 2023 and 2022 were as follows (amounts in millions):
acquisition sales                   171                           -                          171                                      3.1     %
organic sales represent net sales from existing businesses owned by the company, excluding sales from acquisitions. acquisition sales represent net sales from acquired businesses for the period up to one year subsequent to their respective acquisition date. we believe this measure provides investors with a supplemental understanding of underlying sales trends by providing sales growth on a consistent basis. refer to note 2, "acquisitions and divestitures," in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included herein for further information on the company's recent acquisitions activity.
the acquisition sales for the fiscal year ended september 30, 2023 are attributable to calspan, which was acquired in the third quarter of fiscal 2023, and dart aerospace ("dart"), which was acquired in the third quarter of fiscal 2022.
•cost of sales and gross profit. cost of sales increased by $413 million or 17.7%, to $2,743 million for the fiscal year ended september 30, 2023 compared to $2,330 million for the fiscal year ended september 30, 2022. cost of sales and the related percentage of net sales for the fiscal years ended september 30, 2023 and 2022 were as follows (amounts in millions):
gross profit (net sales less total cost of sales)                 $3,842                                    $3,099                        $743                         24.0    %
gross profit percentage (gross profit / net sales)                  58.3        %                             57.1        %
the change in cost of sales during the fiscal year ended september 30, 2023 decreased as a percentage of net sales despite increased inflationary pressures. this was primarily driven by the application of our three core value-driven operating strategies (obtaining profitable new business, continually improving our cost structure and providing highly engineered value-added products to customers) coupled with fixed overhead costs incurred being spread over a higher production volume. a favorable sales mix, specifically, higher commercial aftermarket sales as a percentage of net sales compared to commercial oem and defense net sales also contributed to the gross profit as a percentage of net sales increasing by 1.2 percentage points to 58.3% for the fiscal year ended september 30, 2023 from 57.1% for the fiscal year ended september 30, 2022.
regarding the specific components to cost of sales listed above, foreign exchange rates, particularly the u.s. dollar compared to the british pound and the euro, weakened particularly in the first half of fiscal 2023 resulting in unfavorable movement. in fiscal 2022, the u.s. dollar strengthened considerably in the fourth quarter resulting in foreign currency gains. no other material movement in the components to cost of sales were identified.
acquisition integration costs                                                   8                                         7                           1                      14.3    %
acquisition and divestiture transaction-related expenses                        6                                         4                           2                      50.0    %
selling and administrative expenses during the fiscal year ended september 30, 2023 improved as a percentage of net sales compared to the fiscal year ended september 30, 2022 as a result of higher net sales and our continued strategic cost mitigation efforts. the decrease in non-cash stock and deferred compensation expense is primarily attributable to fewer modifications to existing stock option grants compared to prior year. the change in bad debt expense in fiscal 2023 relates to the improving market conditions within commercial aerospace and the resulting reduction in assessed risk associated with the collectability of certain trade accounts receivable.
•amortization of intangible assets. amortization of intangible assets was $139 million for the fiscal year ended september 30, 2023 compared to $136 million for the fiscal year ended september 30, 2022. the increase in amortization expense of $3 million was primarily due to the amortization expense recognized on intangible assets from the third quarter of fiscal 2023 acquisition of calspan and the third quarter of fiscal 2022 acquisition of dart. the increase was partially offset by the cobham aero connectivity ("cac") acquisition backlog being fully amortized in fiscal 2022.
•interest expense-net. interest expense-net includes interest on borrowings outstanding, amortization of debt issuance costs, original issue discount and premium, revolving credit facility fees, finance leases, interest income and the impact of interest rate swaps and caps designated and qualifying as cash flow hedges. interest expense-net increased $88 million, or 8.2%, to $1,164 million for the fiscal year ended september 30, 2023 from $1,076 million for the fiscal year ended september 30, 2022. the increase in interest expense-net was primarily due to an increase in the base rates, i.e., term sofr and london interbank offered rate ("libor"), to the portion of our variable rate debt that is not hedged via an interest rate swap or cap. this was partially offset by a $93 million increase in interest income. the weighted average interest rate for cash interest payments on total borrowings outstanding for the fiscal year ended september 30, 2023 was 6.2% compared to 5.3% for the fiscal year ended september 30, 2022.
•refinancing costs. refinancing costs of $56 million incurred for the fiscal year ended september 30, 2023 were primarily related to third party fees incurred for the refinancing activity completed during the fiscal year ended september 30, 2023 as summarized in note 12, "debt," in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included herein. refinancing costs of $1 million were incurred for the fiscal year ended september 30, 2022.
•other (income) expense. other (income) expense was $(13) million for the fiscal year ended september 30, 2023 compared to $18 million for the fiscal year ended september 30, 2022. other (income) for the fiscal year ended september 30, 2023 primarily related to a $9 million cash refund received for the esterline retirement plan (the "erp") upon the finalizing of the group annuity purchase funding. refer to note 13, "retirement plans," in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included herein for further information. other expense for fiscal year ended september 30, 2022 was primarily driven by a pension settlement charge of approximately $22 million for the erp. partially offsetting this expense was the non-service related components of benefit costs on the company's benefit plans of $(3) million.
•gain on sale of businesses-net. no gain on sale of businesses-net was recorded for the fiscal year ended september 30, 2023. gain on sale of businesses-net of $7 million was recorded for the fiscal year ended september 30, 2022, and is primarily related to the net gain on sale recognized on the scioteq and treality simulation visual systems ("scioteq and treality") and technical airborne components ("tac") divestitures. refer to note 2, "acquisitions and divestitures," in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included herein for further information.
•income tax provision. income tax expense as a percentage of income before income taxes was approximately 24.3% for the fiscal year ended september 30, 2023 compared to 23.2% for the fiscal year ended september 30, 2022. the company's higher effective tax rate for the fiscal year ended september 30, 2023 was primarily due to an increase in the valuation allowance applicable to the company's net interest deduction limitation carryforward, partially offset by the impact of excess tax benefits associated with share-based payments.
•income from discontinued operations, net of tax. no income from discontinued operations, net of tax, was recorded for the fiscal year ended september 30, 2023. income from discontinued operations, net of tax, was $1 million for the fiscal year ended september 30, 2022 and related to a final working capital settlement received on the divestiture of the souriau-sunbank connection technologies business.
net sales for the airframe segment increased $703 million, an increase of 29.4%, for the fiscal year ended september 30, 2023 compared to the fiscal year ended september 30, 2022. the sales increase resulted primarily from increases in organic sales in the commercial aftermarket ($259 million, an increase of 33.2%), commercial oem ($181 million, an increase of 29.6%) and defense ($96 million, an increase of 10.8%). the increase in commercial aftermarket sales, commercial oem sales and defense sales for the airframe segment is attributable to the same factors described in the paragraph above for the power & control segment. acquisition sales increased by $171 million for the fiscal year ended september 30, 2023 due to the impact of the calspan and dart acquisitions. acquisition sales represent net sales from acquired businesses for the period up to one year subsequent to their respective acquisition date.
•ebitda as defined. refer to "non-gaap financial measures" in this discussion and analysis for additional information and limitations regarding these non-gaap financial measures, including a reconciliation to the comparable u.s. gaap financial measure. ebitda as defined by segment for the fiscal years ended september 30, 2023 and 2022 were as follows (amounts in millions):
total segment ebitda as defined                           3,484                          52.9      %                   2,717                          50.0      %                   767                    28.2    %

ebitda as defined for the power & control segment increased approximately $335 million, an increase of 21.9%, resulting from higher organic sales in the commercial aftermarket, commercial oem and defense channels. also contributing to the increase in ebitda as defined was the application of our three core value-driven operating strategies and positive leverage on our fixed overhead costs spread over a higher production volume despite the ongoing inflationary environment for freight, labor and certain raw materials.
ebitda as defined for the airframe segment increased approximately $426 million, an increase of 38.0%. the increase in ebitda as defined for the airframe segment is attributable to the same factors described in the paragraph above for the power & control segment. ebitda as defined for the airframe segment from acquisitions was approximately $48 million due to the impact of the calspan and dart acquisitions. ebitda as defined from acquisitions represents ebitda as defined from acquired businesses for the period up to one year subsequent to the respective acquisition date.
the change in non-aviation ebitda as defined compared to the prior fiscal year was not material.
corporate expenses consist primarily of compensation, benefits, professional services and other administrative costs incurred by the corporate offices. an immaterial amount of corporate expenses is allocated to the operating segments. the increase compared to the prior fiscal year is primarily attributable to the deferred compensation plan adopted in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 for certain members of non-executive management.

if the company has excess cash, it generally prioritizes allocating the excess cash in the following manner: (1) capital spending at existing businesses, (2) acquisitions of businesses, (3) payment of a special dividend and/or repurchases of our common stock and (4) prepayment of indebtedness or repurchase of debt.
the company's ability to make scheduled interest payments on, or to refinance, the company's indebtedness, or to fund non-acquisition related capital expenditures and research and development efforts, will depend on the company's ability to generate cash in the future. this is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond its control.
in fiscal 2023, the company refinanced over $9,800 million of its term loans and notes to extend maturity dates, reduce interest rates (in the case of refinancing the $1,100 million of 8.00% senior secured notes due 2025 - the "2025 secured notes") and transition the benchmark rate of our variable rate debt from based on libor to term sofr. as a result of the refinancing activity, there is no maturity on any tranche of term loans or notes until march 2026.
in connection with the refinancing activity in fiscal 2023, we entered into forward starting interest rate collar agreements aggregating to a notional amount of $1,600 million. for the remaining $4,700 million notional amount of interest rate swaps and cap, we entered into libor to term sofr basis interest rate swap and cap transactions to effectively convert our existing swaps and cap from libor-based to term sofr-based. the basis swaps and cap offset the libor exposure of the existing swaps and cap and effectively fix the term sofr rate for the notional amount.
the company's objective is to maintain an allocation of at least 75% fixed rate and 25% variable rate debt thereby limiting its exposure to changes in near-term interest rates. interest rate swaps, caps and collars used to hedge and offset, respectively, the variable interest rates on our term loans are further described in note 21, "derivatives and hedging activities," in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included herein. as of september 30, 2023, approximately 90% of our gross debt was fixed rate.
on july 25, 2023, the company amended the securitization facility to, among other things, increase the borrowing capacity from $350 million to $450 million and extend the maturity date to july 25, 2024 at an interest rate of three-month term sofr plus 1.60%, compared to an interest rate of three-month term sofr plus 1.30% that applied prior to the amendment. the total drawn on the securitization facility remains at $350 million as of september 30, 2023.
also, in fiscal 2023, we used existing cash on hand to fund the $729 million acquisition of calspan, which was completed on may 8, 2023.
as of september 30, 2023, the company has significant cash liquidity as illustrated in the table presented below (in millions):
availability on revolving credit facility                       759
availability on securitization facility                         100
cash liquidity (1)                                           $4,331
(1)when considering the impact of the estimated $2,020 million payment in special dividends and dividend equivalents in november 2023, described below, the pro forma cash liquidity as of september 30, 2023 is $2,311 million.
we believe our significant cash liquidity will allow us to meet our anticipated funding requirements. we expect to meet our short-term cash liquidity requirements (including interest obligations and capital expenditures) through net cash from operating activities, cash on hand and, if needed, draws on the revolving credit facility. long-term cash liquidity requirements consist primarily of obligations under our long-term debt agreements.
in connection with the continued application of our three core value-driven operating strategies (obtaining profitable new business, continually improving our cost structure and providing highly engineered value-added products to customers), we expect our efforts will continue to generate strong margins and provide sufficient cash provided by operating activities to meet our interest obligations and liquidity needs. we believe our cash provided by operating activities and available borrowing capacity will enable us to make strategic business acquisitions, pay dividends to our shareholders and make opportunistic investments in our own stock, subject to any restrictions in our existing credit agreement and market conditions.
on november 9, 2023, transdigm announced that it entered into a definitive agreement to acquire the electron device business of communications & power industries for approximately $1,385 million in cash. the acquisition is expected to close by the end of transdigm's third quarter of fiscal 2024 and is expected to be financed through a combination of existing cash on hand and new long-term debt.
on november 9, 2023, the company announced that td group's board of directors authorized and declared a special cash dividend of $35.00 on each outstanding share of common stock and cash dividend equivalent payments on eligible vested options outstanding under its stock option plans. the record date and payment date for the special dividend is november 20, 2023 and november 27, 2023, respectively. the total estimated cash payment, to be funded by existing cash on hand, related to the special dividend and dividend equivalent payments in the first quarter of fiscal 2024 is approximately $2,020 million.
the company estimates its capital expenditures in fiscal year 2024 to be approximately 2% to 3% of net sales, which is consistent with its historical annual spend as a percentage of net sales. the company's capital expenditures incurred from year-to-year are funded using existing cash on hand and are primarily for projects that are consistent with our three core value-driven operating strategies (obtaining profitable new business, continually improving our cost structure and providing highly engineered value-added products to customers).
the company may issue additional debt or refinance existing debt if prevailing market conditions are favorable to doing so. in addition, the company may increase its borrowings in connection with acquisitions, if cash flow from operating activities becomes insufficient to fund current operations or for other short-term cash needs or for common stock repurchases or dividends. our future leverage will also be impacted by the then current conditions of the credit markets.
operating activities. the company generated $1,375 million of net cash from operating activities during fiscal 2023 compared to $948 million during fiscal 2022.
the change in trade accounts receivable during fiscal 2023 was a use of cash of $212 million compared to a use of cash of $190 million in fiscal 2022. the increase in the use of cash of $22 million is primarily attributable to the increase in sales volume and related timing of cash receipts. the company continues to actively manage its accounts receivable, the related agings and collection efforts.
investing activities. net cash used in investing activities was $900 million during fiscal 2023, consisting primarily of the acquisition of calspan for approximately $729 million, certain product line acquisitions aggregating to approximately $33 million and capital expenditures of $139 million.
net cash used in investing activities was $553 million during fiscal 2022, consisting primarily of the acquisition of dart for approximately $360 million, certain product line acquisitions aggregating to approximately $62 million and capital expenditures of $119 million. this was slightly offset by $3 million in proceeds received from the final working capital settlement for the scioteq and treality divestiture.
financing activities. net cash used in financing activities was $16 million during fiscal 2023. the use of cash was primarily attributable to repayments on term loans of $7,334 million, which consists of the full repayment of the existing principal for the tranche e, tranche f and tranche g term loans ($7,284 million), plus normal course principal payments on the tranche e, tranche f, tranche h and tranche i term loans ($50 million), the redemptions of the (1) 2025 secured notes for $1,122 million, (2) 6.375% senior subordinated notes due 2026 (the "6.375% 2026 notes") for $950 million and (3) 6.875% senior subordinated notes due 2026 (the "6.875% 2026 notes") for $509 million, dividend equivalent payments of $38 million and other financing fees of $20 million. this was primarily offset by the total net proceeds from the issuance of tranche h and tranche i term loans of $6,238 million, net proceeds of $2,068 million from the completion of the 6.75% senior secured notes due 2028 (the "2028 secured notes") offering, net proceeds of $1,436 million from the completion of the 6.875% senior secured notes due 2030 (the "2030 secured notes") offering and $215 million in proceeds from stock option exercises.
net cash used in financing activities was $2,148 million during fiscal 2022. the use of cash was primarily attributable to $1,091 million of dividends and dividend equivalent payments, $912 million in common stock repurchases, the $200 million repayment of a previous draw on the revolving commitments and repayment on term loans of $75 million. this was partially offset by $132 million in proceeds from stock option exercises.
description of senior secured term loans and indentures senior secured term loans facility transdigm has $6,249 million in fully drawn term loans (the "term loans facility") and an $810 million revolving credit facility. the term loans facility consists of two tranches of term loans as follows (aggregate principal amount disclosed is as of september 30, 2023):

the term loans facility requires quarterly aggregate principal payments of $16 million. the revolving commitments consist of two tranches which include up to $152 million of multicurrency revolving commitments. at september 30, 2023, the company had $51 million in letters of credit outstanding and $759 million in borrowings available under the revolving commitments. draws on the revolving commitments are subject to an interest rate of 2.50% per annum. the unused portion of the revolving commitments is subject to a fee of 0.5% per annum.
the interest rates per annum applicable to the tranche h and tranche i term loans under the credit agreement are, at transdigm's option, equal to either an alternate base rate or an adjusted term sofr for one, three or six-month interest periods chosen by transdigm, in each case plus an applicable margin percentage. the adjusted term sofr related to the tranche h and tranche i term loans are not subject to a floor. refer to note 21, "derivatives and hedging activities," for information about how our interest rate swaps, caps and collar agreements are used to hedge and offset, respectively, the variable interest rates on our debt.

the restrictive covenants included in the credit agreement are subject to amendments executed periodically. the most recent amendment that impacted the restrictive covenants contained in the credit agreement is amendment no. 11.
under the terms of the credit agreement, transdigm is entitled, on one or more occasions, to request additional term loans or additional revolving commitments to the extent that the existing or new lenders agree to provide such incremental term loans or additional revolving commitments provided that, among other conditions, our consolidated net leverage ratio would be no greater than 7.25x and the consolidated secured net debt ratio would be no greater than 5.00x, in each case, after giving effect to such incremental term loans or additional revolving commitments.

as of september 30, 2023, the company was in compliance with all of its debt covenants and expects to remain in compliance with its debt covenants in subsequent periods.
trade receivable securitization facility during fiscal 2014, the company established a trade receivable securitization facility (the "securitization facility"). the securitization facility effectively increases the company's borrowing capacity depending on the amount of the domestic operations' trade accounts receivable. the securitization facility includes the right for the company to exercise annual one year extensions as long as there have been no termination events as defined by the agreement. the company uses the proceeds from the securitization facility as an alternative to other forms of debt, effectively reducing borrowing costs. the securitization facility is collateralized by substantially all of the company's domestic operations' trade accounts receivable.
on july 25, 2023, the company amended the securitization facility to, among other things, increase the borrowing capacity from $350 million to $450 million and extend the maturity date to july 25, 2024 at an interest rate of three-month term sofr plus 1.60%, compared to an interest rate of three-month term sofr plus 1.30% that applied prior to the amendment. as of september 30, 2023, the total drawn on the securitization facility remains at $350 million. for the fiscal years ended september 30, 2023 and 2022, the applicable interest rate was 6.95% and 3.84%, respectively.
dividend and dividend equivalent payments no dividends were declared during fiscal 2023. pursuant to the fourth amended and restated transdigm group incorporated 2006 stock incentive plan dividend equivalent plan, the amended and restated 2014 stock option plan dividend equivalent plan and the 2019 stock option plan dividend equivalent plan, all of the vested options granted under the existing stock option plans, except for grants to the members of the board of directors, are entitled to certain dividend equivalent payments in the event of the declaration of a dividend by the company. in august 2022, all members of the board of directors at that time executed amendments to their option agreements resulting in the directors no longer receiving dividend equivalent payments in cash, but rather for dividends declared after june 1, 2022, dividends result in a reduction of strike price.
on november 9, 2023, the company announced that td group's board of directors authorized and declared a special cash dividend of $35.00 on each outstanding share of common stock and cash dividend equivalent payments on eligible vested options outstanding under its stock option plans. the record date and payment date for the special dividend is november 20, 2023 and november 27, 2023, respectively. the total estimated cash payment, to be funded by existing cash on hand, related to the special dividend and dividend equivalent payments in the first quarter of fiscal 2024 is approximately $2,020 million. refer to note 18, "stock-based compensation," in the notes to the consolidated financial statements herein for further information on the company's dividend equivalent payments.
any future declaration of special cash dividends on our common stock will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon our results of operations, earnings, capital requirements, financial condition, future prospects, contractual restrictions under the credit agreement and indentures governing the notes, the availability of surplus under delaware law and other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors. td group is a holding company and conducts all of its operations through direct and indirect subsidiaries. unless td group receives dividends, distributions, advances, transfers of funds or other payments from our subsidiaries, td group will be unable to pay any dividends on our common stock in the future. the ability of any subsidiaries to take any of the foregoing actions is limited by the terms of our term loans facility and indentures and may be limited by future debt or other agreements that we may enter into.

(3)assumes that the variable interest rate on our tranche h and tranche i term loans under our term loans facility range from approximately 5.8% to 6.8% based on anticipated movements in term sofr, which given the ongoing volatility in rates, are highly uncertain. in addition, interest payments include the impact of the existing interest rate swap, cap and collar agreements described in note 21, "derivatives and hedging activities," in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included herein.
(4)represents future benefit payments expected to be paid from the pension and post-retirement benefit plans or from the company's assets.
off-balance sheet arrangements the company utilizes letters of credit to back certain payment and performance obligations. letters of credit are subject to limits based on amounts outstanding under the company's revolving credit facility. as of september 30, 2023, the company had $51 million in letters of credit outstanding.
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with u.s. gaap, which often requires the judgment of management in the selection and application of certain accounting principles and methods. management believes that the quality and reasonableness of our most critical policies enable the fair presentation of our financial position and results of operations. however, investors are cautioned that the sensitivity of financial statements to these methods, assumptions and estimates could create materially different results under different conditions or using different assumptions.
below are those policies applied in preparing our financial statements that management believes are the most dependent on the application of estimates and assumptions. for additional significant accounting policies, see note 3, "summary of significant accounting policies," in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included herein.
revenue recognition - the company recognizes revenue from contracts with customers using the five step model prescribed in asc 606. revenue is recognized from the sale of products or services when obligations under the terms of the contract are satisfied and control of promised goods or services have transferred to the customer. control is transferred when the customer has the ability to direct the use of and obtain benefits from the goods or services. revenue is measured at the amount of consideration the company expects to be paid in exchange for goods or services. a substantial portion of the company's revenue is recorded at a point in time. sales recognized over time are generally accounted for using an input measure to determine progress completed at the end of the period. sales for service contracts generally are recognized as the services are provided. for agreements with multiple performance obligations, judgment is required to determine whether performance obligations specified in these agreements are distinct and should be accounted for as separate revenue transactions for recognition purposes based on the standalone selling price of each performance obligation. the primary method used to estimate a standalone selling price is the price observed in standalone sales to customers for the same product or service. we consider the contractual consideration payable by the customer and assesses variable consideration that may affect the total transaction price. variable consideration is included in the estimated transaction price when there is a basis to reasonably estimate the amount, including whether the estimate should be constrained in order to avoid a significant reversal of revenue in a future period. these estimates are based on historical experience, anticipated performance under the terms of the contract and our best judgment at the time.
inventories - inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. cost of inventories is generally determined by the average cost and the first-in, first-out ("fifo") methods and includes material, labor and overhead related to the manufacturing process. because the company sells products that are installed on airframes that can be in-service for 25 or more years, it must keep a supply of such products on hand while the airframes are in use. where management estimated that the net realizable value was below cost or determined that future demand was lower than current inventory levels, based on historical experience, current and projected market demand, current and projected volume trends and other relevant current and projected factors associated with the current economic conditions, a reduction in inventory cost to estimated net realizable value was made by recording a provision included in cost of sales. additionally, management believes that the company's estimates of excess and obsolete inventory are reasonable and material changes in future estimates or assumptions used to calculate our estimate is unlikely. however, actual results may differ materially from the estimates and additional provisions may be required in the future. a 10% change in our excess and obsolete inventory reserve at september 30, 2023 would not have a material impact on our results. in accordance with industry practice, all inventories are classified as current assets as all inventories are available and necessary to support current sales, even though a portion of the inventories may not be sold within one year.
goodwill and other intangible assets - in accordance with asc 805, "business combinations," the company uses the acquisition method of accounting to allocate costs of acquired businesses to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the dates of acquisition. the excess costs of acquired businesses over the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recognized as goodwill. the valuations of the acquired assets and liabilities will impact the determination of future operating results. determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires management's judgment and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including assumptions with respect to future cash inflows and outflows, revenue growth rates and ebitda margins, discount rates, customer attrition rates, royalty rates, asset lives and market multiples, among other items. we determine the fair values of intangible assets acquired generally in consultation with third-party valuation advisors. fair value adjustments to the company's assets and liabilities are recognized and the results of operations of the acquired business are included in our consolidated financial statements from the effective date of the merger or acquisition.
intangible assets other than goodwill are recognized if the benefit of the intangible asset is obtained through contractual or other legal rights, or if the intangible asset can be sold, transferred, licensed or exchanged, regardless of the company's intent to do so. goodwill and identifiable intangible assets are recorded at their estimated fair value on the date of acquisition and are reviewed at least annually for impairment based on cash flow projections and fair value estimates.
u.s. gaap requires that the annual, and any interim, goodwill impairment assessment be performed at the reporting unit level. our reporting units have been identified at the operating unit level, which is one level below our operating segments. substantially all goodwill was determined and recognized for each reporting unit pursuant to the accounting for the merger or acquisition as of the date of each transaction. with respect to acquisitions integrated into an existing reporting unit, any acquired goodwill is combined with the goodwill of the reporting unit.
companies may perform a qualitative assessment as the initial step in the annual goodwill impairment testing process for all or selected reporting units. companies are also allowed to bypass the qualitative analysis and perform a quantitative analysis if desired. economic uncertainties and the length of time from the calculation of a baseline fair value are factors that we consider in determining whether to perform a quantitative test.
when we evaluate the potential for goodwill impairment using a qualitative assessment, we consider factors including, but not limited to, macroeconomic conditions, industry conditions, the competitive environment, changes in the market for our products and services, regulatory and political developments, entity specific factors such as strategy and changes in key personnel and overall financial performance. if, after completing this assessment, it is determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, we proceed to a quantitative impairment test. for the quantitative test, management determines the estimated fair value through the use of a discounted cash flow valuation model incorporating discount rates commensurate with the risks involved for each reporting unit. if the calculated estimated fair value is less than the current carrying value, impairment of goodwill of the reporting unit may exist. the key assumptions used in the discounted cash flow valuation model for impairment testing includes discount rates, revenue growth rates and ebitda margins, cash flow projections and terminal value rates. discount rates are set by using the weighted average cost of capital ("wacc") methodology. the wacc methodology considers market and industry data in determining the appropriate discount rates to be used, inclusive of company-specific risk factors. the company utilizes a third party valuation firm to assist in the determination of the wacc. the discount rate utilized for each reporting unit is indicative of the return an investor would expect to receive for investing in such a business.
management, considering industry and company-specific historical and projected data, develops growth rates, sales projections and cash flow projections for each reporting unit. terminal value rate determination follows a common methodology of capturing the present value of perpetual cash flow estimates beyond the last projected period assuming a constant wacc and low long-term growth rates.
the impairment test for indefinite-lived intangible assets consists of a comparison between the estimated fair values and carrying values. if the carrying amounts of intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives exceed their estimated fair values, an impairment loss will be recognized in an amount equal to the difference. management utilizes the royalty savings valuation method to determine the estimated fair value for each indefinite-lived intangible asset. in this method, management estimates the royalty savings arising from the ownership of the intangible asset. the key assumptions used in estimating the royalty savings for impairment testing include discount rates, royalty rates, growth rates, sales projections and terminal value rates. discount rates used are similar to the rates developed by the wacc methodology, inclusive of considering any differences in company-specific risk factors between reporting units and the indefinite-lived intangible assets. royalty rates are established by management with the advice of valuation experts. management, considering industry and company-specific historical and projected data, develops growth rates and sales projections for each significant intangible asset. terminal value rate determination follows common methodology of capturing the present value of perpetual sales estimates beyond the last projected period assuming a constant wacc and low long-term growth rates.
the discounted cash flow and royalty savings valuation methodologies require management to make certain assumptions based upon information available at the time the valuations are performed. actual results could differ from these assumptions. management believes the assumptions used are reflective of what a market participant would have used in calculating fair value considering the current economic conditions.
the company had 49 reporting units with goodwill and 46 reporting units with indefinite-lived intangible assets as of the first day of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, the date of the annual impairment test. based on its initial qualitative assessment over each of the reporting units, the company identified five reporting units to test for impairment using a quantitative test for both goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets. the reporting units selected for quantitative testing either have higher commercial aerospace content and, as a result, had been more adversely impacted by the covid-19 pandemic, or was a recent acquisition. the estimated fair values of each of these reporting units and other indefinite-lived intangible assets were in excess of their respective carrying values. we believe we incorporate conservative sensitivity ranges on certain company-specific projected data, including earnings before taxes and net sales, which are significant assumptions in the discounted cash flow valuation model to determine estimated fair value, such that actual results would need to be materially out of the range of the expected assumptions in order for an impairment to occur.
stock-based compensation - the cost of the company's stock-based compensation is recorded in accordance with asc 718, "stock compensation." the company uses a black-scholes pricing model to estimate the grant-date fair value of the stock options awarded. the black-scholes pricing model requires assumptions regarding the expected volatility of the company's common shares, the risk-free interest rate, the expected life of the stock options award and the company's dividend yield. the company primarily utilizes historical data in determining the assumptions. an increase or decrease in the assumptions or economic events outside of management's control could, and do, have an impact on the black-scholes pricing model. the company estimates stock option forfeitures based on historical data. the total number of stock options expected to vest is adjusted by actual and estimated forfeitures. changes to the actual and estimated forfeitures will result in a cumulative adjustment in the period of change. the company also evaluates any subsequent changes to the respective option holders terms under the modification rules of asc 718. if determined to be a modification, the black-scholes pricing model is updated as of the date of the modification resulting in a cumulative catch-up to expense.
income taxes - the company estimates income taxes in each jurisdiction in which it operates. this involves estimating taxable earnings, specific taxable and deductible items, the likelihood of generating sufficient future taxable income to utilize deferred tax assets and possible exposures related to future tax audits. to the extent these estimates change, adjustments to deferred and accrued income taxes are made in the period in which the changes occur. historically, such adjustments have not been significant.
non-gaap financial measures we present below certain financial information based on our ebitda and ebitda as defined. references to "ebitda" mean earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, and references to "ebitda as defined" mean ebitda plus, as applicable for each relevant period, certain adjustments as set forth in the reconciliations of income from continuing operations to ebitda and ebitda as defined and the reconciliations of net cash provided by operating activities to ebitda and ebitda as defined presented below.
neither ebitda nor ebitda as defined is a measurement of financial performance under u.s. gaap. we present ebitda and ebitda as defined because we believe they are useful indicators for evaluating operating performance and liquidity.
our management believes that ebitda and ebitda as defined are useful as indicators of liquidity because securities analysts, investors, rating agencies and others use ebitda to evaluate a company's ability to incur and service debt. in addition, ebitda as defined is useful to investors because the revolving credit facility under our senior secured credit facility requires compliance under certain circumstances, on a pro forma basis, with a financial covenant that measures the ratio of the amount of our secured indebtedness to the amount of our consolidated ebitda defined in the same manner as we define ebitda as defined herein.
in addition to the above, our management uses ebitda as defined to review and assess the performance of the management team in connection with employee incentive programs and to prepare its annual budget and financial projections. moreover, our management uses ebitda as defined to evaluate acquisitions.
although we use ebitda and ebitda as defined as measures to assess the performance of our business and for the other purposes set forth above, the use of these non-gaap financial measures as analytical tools has limitations, and you should not consider any of them in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of our results of operations as reported in accordance with u.s. gaap. some of these limitations are:
•neither ebitda nor ebitda as defined reflects the significant interest expense, or the cash requirements, necessary to service interest payments on our indebtedness;
•although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and neither ebitda nor ebitda as defined reflects any cash requirements for such replacements;
•the omission of the substantial amortization expense associated with our intangible assets further limits the usefulness of ebitda and ebitda as defined;
•neither ebitda nor ebitda as defined includes the payment of taxes, which is a necessary element of our operations; and
•ebitda as defined excludes the cash expense we have incurred to integrate acquired businesses into our operations, which is a necessary element of certain of our acquisitions.
because of these limitations, ebitda and ebitda as defined should not be considered as measures of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business. management compensates for these limitations by not viewing ebitda or ebitda as defined in isolation and specifically by using other u.s. gaap measures, such as net income, net sales and operating profit, to measure our operating performance. neither ebitda nor ebitda as defined is a measurement of financial performance under u.s. gaap, and neither should be considered as an alternative to net income or cash flow from operations determined in accordance with u.s. gaap. our calculation of ebitda and ebitda as defined may not be comparable to the calculation of similarly titled measures reported by other companies.

item 1a.     risk factors.
risks related to our business we operate in a very competitive business environment, which affects our ability to attract and retain customers and can adversely affect our business, operations and financial results.
the industry in which we operate is highly competitive and has become more so in recent years. in some instances, we compete against companies with fewer regulatory burdens, access to better financing and greater and more favorable brand name recognition. increasing consolidation in the telecommunications and content industries have provided additional benefits to certain of our competitors, either through access to financing, resources, or efficiencies of scale including the ability to launch new products and services.
our internet service faces competition from other companies' ftth, fixed wireless broadband, internet delivered via satellite and dsl services. various operators offer wireless internet services delivered over networks which they continue to enhance to deliver faster speeds and also continue to expand 5g mobile services. our voice and mobile services compete with wireless and wireline phone providers, as well as other forms of communication, such as text, instant messaging, social networking services, video conferencing and email. competition from these companies, including intensive marketing efforts with aggressive pricing, may have an adverse impact on our ability to attract and retain customers.
our video service faces competition from a number of sources, including dbs services, and companies that deliver linear network programming, movies and television shows on demand and other video content over broadband internet connections to televisions, computers, tablets and mobile devices often with password sharing among multiple users and security that makes content susceptible to piracy. newer products and services, particularly alternative methods for the distribution, sale and viewing of content may continue to be developed, further increasing the number of competitors that we face.
the increasing number of choices available to audiences, including low-cost or free choices, could negatively impact not only consumer demand for our products and services, but also advertisers' willingness to purchase advertising from us. we compete for the sale of advertising revenue with television networks and stations, as well as other advertising platforms, such as online media, radio and print. competition related to our service offerings to businesses continues to increase as well, as more companies deploy more fiber to more buildings, which may negatively impact our growth and put pressure on margins.
a failure to effectively anticipate or adapt to new technologies (including those that use artificial intelligence ("ai")) and changes in customer expectations and behavior could significantly adversely affect our competitive position with respect to the leisure time and discretionary spending of our customers and, as a result, affect our business and results of operations. competition may also reduce our expected growth of future cash flows which may contribute to future impairments of our franchises and goodwill and our ability to meet cash flow requirements, including debt service requirements. for additional information regarding the competition we face, see "item 1. business -competition" and "-regulation and legislation."
we depend on third-party service providers, suppliers and licensors; thus, if we are unable to procure the necessary services, equipment, software or licenses on reasonable terms and on a timely basis, our ability to offer services could be impaired, and our growth, operations, business, financial results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.
we depend on a limited number of third-party service providers, suppliers and licensors to supply some of the services, hardware, software and operational support necessary to provide some of our services and execute our network evolution and rural construction initiatives. some of our hardware, software and operational support vendors and service providers represent our sole source of supply or have, either through contract or as a result of intellectual property rights, a position of some exclusivity. our ability to provide some services and complete our network evolution and rural construction initiatives might be materially adversely affected, or the need to procure or develop alternative sources of the affected materials or services might interrupt or delay our ability to serve existing and new customers, if any of these parties experience or engage in the following:
•breach or terminate or elect not to renew their agreements with us or otherwise fail to perform their obligations in a timely manner;
•demand exceeds these vendors' capacity;
•tariffs are imposed that impact vendors' ability to perform their obligations or significantly increase the amount we pay;
•cease production of any necessary product due to lack of demand, profitability or a change in ownership or are otherwise unable to provide the equipment or services we need in a timely manner at our specifications and at reasonable prices.
in addition, the existence of only a limited number of vendors of key technologies can lead to less product innovation and higher costs. any of these events could materially and adversely affect our ability to retain and attract customers and our operations, business, financial results and financial condition.
we may not have the ability to pass on to our customers all of the increases in programming costs, which could adversely affect our cash flow and operating margins.
programming costs are one of our largest expense items. our programming costs have historically increased in excess of customary inflationary and cost-of-living type increases. while decreases in video customers combined with a change in the mix of customers choosing lower cost packages have offset total programming cost increases, we expect contractual programming rates per service subscriber to continue to increase as a result of annual increases pursuant to our programming contracts and contract renewals with programmers. although we pass along amounts paid for local broadcast station retransmission consent to the majority of our customers, the inability to fully pass programming cost increases on to our customers has had, and is expected in the future to have, an adverse impact on our cash flow and operating margins associated with the video product. additionally, the demands of large media companies, with additional selling power as a result of media and broadcast station group consolidation, who link carriage of their most popular networks to carriage and cost increases of their less popular networks, and require us to carry their most popular networks to a large percentage of our video subscribers, have limited our flexibility in selling more tailored and cost-sensitive programming packages for consumers. in order to mitigate impacts to our operating margins due to increasing programming rates, we continue to review our pricing and programming packaging strategies. further, some programmers have begun to simulcast and/or move popular programming to dtc apps which, in some cases, are no longer accessible by our customers through their current video subscription, despite increasing rates, driving customer dissatisfaction and in turn, customer losses. we are seeking to obtain access to these dtc apps, where applicable, as we renew agreements, so that we may include in our customers' video subscriptions.
increases in the cost of sports programming and the amounts paid for local broadcast station retransmission-consent have been the largest contributors to the growth in our programming costs over the last few years. federal law allows commercial television broadcast stations to make an election between "must-carry" rights and an alternative "retransmission-consent" regime. when a station opts for the retransmission-consent regime, we are not allowed to carry the station's signal without that station's permission. in retransmission-consent negotiations, broadcasters often condition consent with respect to one station on carriage of one or more other stations or programming services in which they or their affiliates have an interest. carriage of these other services, as well as increased fees for retransmission rights, may increase our programming expenses which could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results.
our programming contracts are generally for a fixed period of time, with potentially significant spend subject to negotiated renewal in any particular year. we will seek to renew these agreements on terms that we believe are favorable. there can be no assurance that these agreements will be renewed on favorable or comparable terms. to the extent that we are unable to reach agreement with certain programmers on terms that we believe are reasonable, we have been, and may in the future be, forced to remove such programming channels from our line-up, which may result in a loss of customers. any failure to carry programming that is attractive to our customers could adversely impact our customer levels, operations and financial results.
any failure to respond to technological developments and meet customer demand for new products and services could adversely affect our ability to compete effectively.
we operate in a highly competitive, consumer-driven and rapidly changing environment. from time to time, we may pursue strategic initiatives to launch products or enhancements to our products. our success is, to a large extent, dependent on our ability to acquire, develop, adopt, upgrade and exploit new and existing technologies to address consumers' changing demands and distinguish our services from those of our competitors. we may not be able to accurately predict technological trends or the success of new products and services. if we choose technologies or equipment that are less effective, cost-efficient or attractive to customers than those chosen by our competitors, if technologies or equipment on which we have chosen to rely cease to be available to us on reasonable terms or conditions, if we offer services that fail to appeal to consumers, are not available at competitive prices or that do not function as expected, if we are not able to fund the expenditures necessary to keep pace with technological developments, or if we are no longer able to make our services available to our customers on a third-party device on which a substantial number of customers have relied to access our services, our competitive position could deteriorate, and our business and financial results could suffer.
the ability of some of our competitors to introduce new technologies, products and services more quickly than we do may adversely affect our competitive position. furthermore, advances in technology, decreases in the cost of existing technologies or changes in competitors' product and service offerings may require us in the future to make additional research and development expenditures or to offer, at no additional charge or at a lower price, certain products and services that we currently offer to customers separately or at a premium. in addition, the uncertainty of our ability, and the costs, to obtain intellectual property rights from third parties could impact our ability to respond to technological advances in a timely and effective manner.
any failure to maintain and expand our upgraded systems and provide advanced services in a timely manner, or to anticipate the demands of the marketplace, could materially adversely affect our ability to attract and retain customers. in addition, as we continue to grow our mobile services using virtual network operator rights from a third party, we expect continued growth-related sales and marketing and other customer acquisition costs as well as negative working capital impacts from the timing of device-related cash flows when we provide devices pursuant to equipment installation plans. we also continue to consider and pursue opportunities in the mobile space which may include the acquisition of additional licensed spectrum and may include entering into or expanding joint ventures or partnerships with wireless or cable providers which may require significant investment. for example, we now hold cbrs pals to support existing and future mobile services. these licenses are subject to revocation and expiration. although we expect to be able to maintain and renew these licenses, the loss of one or more licenses could significantly impair our ability to offload mobile traffic and achieve cost reductions. if we are unable to continue to grow our mobile business and achieve the outcomes we expect from our investments in the mobile business, our growth, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.
we rely on patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws and licenses and other agreements with our employees, customers, suppliers and other parties to establish and maintain our intellectual property rights in technology and the products and services used in our operations. also, because of the rapid pace of technological change, we both develop our own technologies, products and services and rely on technologies developed or licensed by third parties. however, any of our intellectual property rights, or the rights of our suppliers, could be challenged or invalidated, or such intellectual property rights may not be sufficient to permit us to take advantage of current industry trends or otherwise to provide competitive advantages, which could result in costly redesign efforts, discontinuance of certain product or service offerings or other competitive harm. we may not be able to obtain or continue to obtain licenses from these third parties on reasonable terms, if at all. in addition, claims of intellectual property infringement could require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements on unfavorable terms, incur substantial monetary liability or be enjoined preliminarily or permanently from further use of the intellectual property in question, which could require us to change our business practices or offerings and limit our ability to compete effectively. even unsuccessful claims can be time-consuming and costly to defend and may divert management's attention and resources away from our business. infringement claims continue to be brought frequently in the communications and entertainment industries, and we are also often a party to such litigation alleging that certain of our services or technologies infringe the intellectual property rights of others.
various events could disrupt or result in unauthorized access to our networks, information systems or properties and could impair our operating activities and negatively impact our reputation and financial results.
network and information systems technologies are critical to our operating activities, both for our internal uses, such as network management, and supplying services to our customers, including customer service operations and programming delivery. network or information system shutdowns or other service disruptions caused by events such as computer hacking, phishing, dissemination of computer viruses, worms and other destructive or disruptive software, "cyber attacks" such as ransomware, process breakdowns, denial of service attacks and other malicious activity pose increasing risks. both unsuccessful and successful "cyber attacks" on companies have continued to increase in frequency, scope and potential harm in recent years, and the increasing use of ai may intensify these cybersecurity risks. while we develop and maintain systems seeking to prevent systems-related events and security breaches from occurring, the development and maintenance of these systems is costly and requires ongoing monitoring and updating as techniques used in such attacks become more sophisticated and change frequently. we, and the third parties on which we rely, may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventive measures. while from time to time attempts have been made to access our network, these events have not as yet resulted in any material release of information, degradation or disruption to our network and information systems.
our network and information systems are also vulnerable to damage or interruption from power outages, telecommunications failures, accidents, natural disasters (including extreme weather arising from short-term or any long-term changes in weather patterns), terrorist attacks and similar events. our system redundancy may be ineffective or inadequate, and our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities.
any of these events, if directed at, or experienced by, us or technologies upon which we depend, could have adverse consequences on our network, our customers and our business, including degradation of service, service disruption, excessive call volume to call centers, and damage to our or our customers' equipment and data. large expenditures may be necessary to repair or replace damaged property, networks or information systems or to protect them from similar events in the future. moreover, the amount and scope of insurance that we maintain against losses resulting from any such events or security breaches may not be sufficient to cover our losses or otherwise adequately compensate us for any disruptions to our business that may result. any such significant service disruption could result in damage to our reputation and credibility, customer dissatisfaction and ultimately a loss of customers or revenue. any significant loss of customers or revenue, or significant increase in costs of serving those customers, could adversely affect our growth, financial condition and results of operations.
furthermore, our operating activities could be subject to risks caused by misappropriation, misuse, leakage, falsification or accidental release or loss of information maintained in our information technology systems and networks and those of our third-party vendors, including customer, personnel and vendor data. we provide certain confidential, proprietary and personal information to third parties in connection with our business, and there is a risk that this information may be compromised.
we process, store, and transmit large amounts of data, including the personal information of our customers. ongoing increases in the potential for misuse of personal information, the public's awareness of the importance of safeguarding personal information, and the volume of legislation that has been adopted or is being considered regarding the protection, privacy and security of personal information have resulted in increases to our information-related risks. we could be exposed to significant costs if such risks were to materialize, and such events could damage our reputation, credibility and business and have a negative impact on our revenue. we could be subject to regulatory actions and claims made by consumers in private litigations involving privacy issues related to consumer data collection and use practices. we also could be required to expend significant capital and other resources to remedy any such security breach.
we currently incorporate ai technology in certain parts of our business operations. our research and development of such technology remains ongoing. ai presents risks, challenges and unintended consequences that could affect our and our customers' adoption and use of this technology. ai algorithms and training methodologies may be flawed. additionally, ai technologies are complex and rapidly evolving. while we aim to develop and use ai responsibly and attempt to identify and mitigate ethical and legal issues presented by its use, we may be unsuccessful in identifying or resolving issues before they arise. ai-related issues, deficiencies or failures could give rise to legal or regulatory action, including with respect to proposed legislation regulating ai or as a result of new applications of existing data protection, privacy, intellectual property and other laws, and could damage our reputation or otherwise materially harm our business.
our exposure to the economic conditions of our current and potential customers, vendors and third parties could adversely affect our cash flow, results of operations and financial condition.
we are exposed to risks associated with the economic conditions of our current and potential customers, the potential financial instability of our customers and their financial ability to purchase our products. if there were a prolonged general economic downturn, we may experience increased cancellations or non-payment by our customers or unfavorable changes in the mix of products purchased. this may include an increase in the number of homes that replace their video service with internet-delivered or over-air content, as well as an increase in the number of internet and voice customers substituting mobile data and voice products for wireline services, which would negatively impact our ability to attract customers, increase rates and maintain or increase revenue. in addition, our ability to gain new customers is dependent to some extent on growth in occupied housing in our service areas, which is influenced by both national and local economic conditions. weak economic conditions may also have a negative impact on our advertising revenue. these events have adversely affected us in the past, and may adversely affect our cash flow, results of operations and financial condition if a downturn were to continue.
in addition, we are susceptible to risks associated with the potential financial instability of the vendors and third parties on which we rely to provide products and services or to which we outsource certain functions. the same economic conditions that may affect our customers, as well as volatility and disruption in the capital and credit markets, also could adversely affect vendors and third parties and lead to significant increases in prices, reduction in output or the bankruptcy of our vendors or third parties upon which we rely. further, inflationary pressures may impact the ability of vendors and other third parties to satisfy their obligations to us. any interruption in the services provided by our vendors or by third parties could adversely affect our cash flow, results of operation and financial condition.
if we are unable to retain key employees, our ability to manage our business could be adversely affected.
our operational results have depended, and our future results will depend, upon the retention and continued performance of our management team. our ability to hire and retain key employees for management positions could be impacted adversely by the competitive environment for management talent in the broadband communications and technology industries. the loss of the services of key members of management and the inability or delay in hiring new key employees could adversely affect our ability to manage our business and our future operational and financial results.
risks related to our indebtedness we have a significant amount of debt and expect to incur significant additional debt, including secured debt, in the future, which could adversely affect our financial condition and our ability to react to changes in our business.
we have a significant amount of debt and expect to (subject to applicable restrictions in our debt instruments) incur additional debt in the future as charter maintains its stated objective of 4.0 to 4.5 times adjusted ebitda leverage (net debt divided by the last twelve months adjusted ebitda). as of december 31, 2023, our total principal amount of debt was approximately $97.6 billion and charter's leverage ratio was 4.42 times adjusted ebitda. as of december 31, 2023, $70.3 billion of our debt was rated investment grade and $27.3 billion was rated high yield debt. this split rating allows us to access both the investment grade debt market and the high yield debt market.
•impact our ability to raise additional capital at reasonable rates, or at all;
•expose us to increased interest expense to the extent we refinance existing debt with higher cost debt;
•require us to dedicate a significant portion of our cash flow from operating activities to make payments on our debt, reducing our funds available for capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes;
•limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business, the cable and telecommunications industries, and the economy at large;
•place us at a disadvantage compared to our competitors that have proportionately less debt; and
•adversely affect our relationship with customers and suppliers.
to the extent our current debt amounts increase more than expected, our operating results are lower than expected, or credit rating agencies downgrade our debt thereby increasing our costs of borrowing and potentially limiting our access to investment grade markets, the related risks that we now face will intensify.
the agreements and instruments governing our debt contain restrictions and limitations that could significantly affect our ability to operate our business, as well as significantly affect our liquidity.
the indentures governing the cco holdings, llc ("cco holdings") notes contain a number of significant covenants that could adversely affect our operations, liquidity and results of operations. these covenants restrict, among other things, cco holdings, cco holdings capital corp. and all of their restricted subsidiaries' ability to:
•incur additional debt;
•pay dividends on equity or repurchase equity;
•sell all or substantially all of their assets or merge with or into other companies;
•in the case of restricted subsidiaries, create or permit to exist dividend or payment restrictions with respect to cco holdings, guarantee their parent companies' debt, or issue specified equity interests;
•engage in certain transactions with affiliates; and
•grant liens (with respect to only cco holdings).
additionally, the charter communications operating, llc ("charter operating") credit facilities require charter operating to comply with a maximum total leverage covenant and a maximum first lien leverage covenant. the charter operating credit facilities, the charter operating notes, the time warner cable, llc ("twc, llc") senior notes and debentures, and the time warner cable enterprises, llc ("twce") debentures include customary negative covenants, including restrictions on the ability to incur liens securing indebtedness for borrowed money and consolidating, merging or conveying or transferring substantially all of the respective obligor's assets. the breach of any covenants or obligations in our indentures or credit facilities, not otherwise waived or amended, could result in a default under the applicable debt obligations and could trigger acceleration of those obligations, which in turn could trigger cross defaults under other agreements governing our long-term indebtedness. in addition, the secured lenders under our secured notes and the charter operating credit facilities could foreclose on their collateral, which includes equity interests in substantially all of our subsidiaries, and exercise other rights of secured creditors.
risks related to ownership position of liberty broadband corporation and advance/newhouse partnership liberty broadband corporation ("liberty broadband") and advance/newhouse partnership ("a/n") have governance rights that give them influence over corporate transactions and other matters.
liberty broadband currently owns a significant amount of charter class a common stock and is entitled to certain governance rights with respect to charter. a/n currently owns charter class a common stock and a significant amount of membership interests in our subsidiary, charter holdings, which are convertible into charter class a common stock, and is entitled to certain governance rights with respect to charter. members of charter's board of directors include a director who is also an officer and director of liberty broadband and directors who are current or former officers and directors of a/n. mr. greg maffei is the president and chief executive officer of liberty broadband. steven miron is the chief executive officer of a/n and michael newhouse is co-president of the parent of a/n and its affiliates. as of december 31, 2023, liberty broadband beneficially held approximately 28.50% of charter's voting stock and a/n beneficially held approximately 12.46% of charter's voting stock. pursuant to the amended and restated stockholders agreement among charter, liberty broadband and a/n, dated as of may 23, 2015 (as amended, the "stockholders agreement"), liberty broadband currently has the right to designate up to three directors as nominees for charter's board of directors and a/n currently has the right to designate up to two directors as nominees for charter's board of directors. each of a/n and liberty broadband is entitled to nominate at least one director to each of the committees of charter's board of directors, subject to applicable stock exchange listing rules and certain specified voting or equity ownership thresholds for each of a/n and liberty broadband, and provided that the nominating and corporate governance committee and the compensation and benefits committee each have at least a majority of directors independent from a/n, liberty broadband and charter (referred to as the "unaffiliated directors" in the stockholders agreement).
the stockholders agreement and charter's amended and restated certificate of incorporation fixes the size of the board at 13 directors. liberty broadband and a/n are required to vote (subject to the applicable voting cap) their respective shares of charter class a common stock and charter class b common stock for the director nominees nominated by the nominating and corporate governance committee, including the respective designees of liberty broadband and a/n, and against any other nominees, except that, with respect to the unaffiliated directors, liberty broadband and a/n must instead vote in the same proportion as the voting securities are voted by stockholders other than a/n and liberty broadband or any group which includes any of them are voted, if doing so would cause a different outcome with respect to the unaffiliated directors. as a result of their rights under the stockholders agreement and their significant equity and voting stakes in charter, liberty broadband and/or a/n, who may have interests different from those of other stockholders, will be able to exercise substantial influence over certain matters relating to the governance of charter, including the approval of significant corporate actions, such as mergers and other business combination transactions.
the stockholders agreement provides a/n and liberty broadband with preemptive rights with respect to issuances of charter equity in connection with certain transactions, and in the event that a/n or liberty broadband exercises these rights, holders of charter class a common stock may experience further dilution.
the stockholders agreement provides that a/n and liberty broadband will have certain contractual preemptive rights over issuances of charter equity securities in connection with capital raising transactions. holders of charter class a common stock will not be entitled to similar preemptive rights with respect to such transactions. as a result, if liberty broadband and/or a/n elect to exercise their preemptive rights, (i) these parties would not experience the dilution experienced by the other holders of charter class a common stock, and (ii) such other holders of charter class a common stock may experience further dilution of their interest in charter upon such exercise.

legislators and regulators at all levels of government frequently consider changing, and sometimes do change, existing statutes, rules, regulations, or interpretations thereof, or prescribe new ones. any future legislative, judicial, regulatory or administrative actions may increase our costs or impose additional restrictions on our businesses.
changes to the existing legal and regulatory framework under which we operate or the regulatory programs in which we or our competitors participate, including the possible elimination of the federal broadband acp subsidy for low-income consumers, could adversely affect our business.
there are ongoing efforts to amend or expand the federal, state and local regulation of some of the services offered over our cable systems, particularly our retail broadband internet access service. potential legislative and regulatory changes could adversely impact our business by increasing our costs and competition and limiting our ability to offer services in a manner that would maximize our revenue potential. these changes have in the past, and could in the future, include, for example, the reclassification of internet services as regulated telecommunications services or other utility-style regulation of internet services; restrictions on how we manage our internet access services and networks; the adoption of new customer service or service quality requirements for our internet access services; the adoption of new privacy restrictions on our collection, use and disclosure of certain customer information; new data security and cybersecurity mandates that could result in additional network and information security and cyber incident reporting requirements for our business; new restraints on our discretion over programming decisions; new restrictions on the rates we charge to consumers for one or more of the services or equipment options we offer; changes to the cable industry's compulsory copyright to retransmit broadcast signals; new requirements to assure the availability of navigation devices from third-party providers; new universal service fund contribution obligations on our internet service revenues that would add to the cost of that service; increases in government-administered broadband subsidies to rural areas that could result in subsidized overbuilding of our facilities; changes to the fcc's administration of spectrum; pending court challenges to the legality of the fcc's universal service programs, which, if successful, could adversely affect our receipt of universal service funds, including but not limited to fcc rdof grants to expand our network, fcc e-rate funds to serve schools and libraries and fcc rural health care funds to serve eligible health care providers; and changes in the regulatory framework for voip telephone service, including the scope of regulatory obligations associated with our voip telephone service and our ability to interconnect our voip telephone service with incumbent providers of traditional telecommunications service.
we participate in the federal acp that provides up to a $30 monthly subsidy enabling eligible low-income households to purchase our internet products at a discount or, for a portion of those households, at no cost. the fcc has announced that acp funding is expected to run out in april 2024 and has prohibited service providers from enrolling new acp customers after february 7, 2024. if congress does not provide additional funding, this will be disruptive to our business. we will lose customers and revenues and could face greater difficulty in providing services to low-income households in the future.
as a winning bidder in the fcc's rdof auction in 2020, we must comply with numerous fcc and state requirements to continue receiving such funding. to comply with these requirements, in rdof areas, we have chosen to offer certain of our voip telephone services, such as our lifeline services, subject to certain traditional federal and state common carrier regulations. additionally, in some areas where we are building pursuant to subsidy programs, we will offer certain of our broadband internet access services subject to required discounts and other marketing-related terms. if we fail to comply with those requirements, the governing regulatory agency could consider us in default and we could incur substantial penalties or forfeitures. if we fail to attain certain specified infrastructure build-out requirements under the rdof program, the fcc could also withhold future support payments until those shortcomings are corrected. any failure to comply with the rules and requirements of a subsidy grant could result in us being suspended or disbarred from future governmental programs or contracts for a significant period of time, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
if any laws or regulations are enacted that would expand the regulation of our services, they could affect our operations and require significant expenditures. we cannot predict future developments in these areas, and any changes to the regulatory framework for our internet, video, mobile or voip services could have a negative impact on our business and results of operations.
it remains uncertain what rule changes, if any, will ultimately be adopted by congress, the fcc, the ftc and state legislatures, and what operating or financial impact any such rules might have on us, including on the operation of our broadband networks, customer privacy and the user experience. in addition, the fcc, the ftc, and various state agencies and attorney generals actively investigate industry practices and could impose substantial forfeitures for alleged regulatory violations.
tax legislation and administrative initiatives or challenges to our tax and fee positions could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
we offer services and operate cable systems in locations throughout the united states and, as a result, we are subject to the tax laws and regulations of federal, state and local governments. from time to time, legislative and administrative bodies change laws and regulations that change our effective tax rate or tax payments. certain states and localities have imposed or are considering imposing new or additional taxes or fees on our services or changing the methodologies or base on which certain fees and taxes are computed. potential changes include additional taxes or fees on our services which could impact our customers, changes to income tax sourcing rules and other changes to general business taxes, central/unit-level assessment of property taxes and other matters that could increase our income, franchise, sales, use and/or property tax liabilities. in addition, federal, state and local tax laws and regulations are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations. there can be no assurance that our tax positions will not be challenged by relevant tax authorities or that we would be successful in any such challenge.
our cable system franchises are subject to non-renewal or termination and are non-exclusive. the failure to renew a franchise or the grant of additional franchises in one or more service areas could adversely affect our business.
our cable systems generally operate pursuant to franchises, permits and similar authorizations issued by a state or local governmental authority controlling the public rights-of-way. many franchises establish comprehensive facilities and service requirements, as well as specific customer service standards and monetary penalties for non-compliance. in many cases, franchises are terminable if the franchisee fails to comply with significant provisions set forth in the franchise agreement governing system operations. franchises are generally granted for fixed terms and must be periodically renewed. franchising authorities may resist granting a renewal if either past performance or the prospective operating proposal is considered inadequate. franchise authorities often demand concessions or other commitments as a condition to renewal. in some instances, local franchises have not been renewed at expiration, and we have operated and are operating under either temporary operating agreements or without a franchise while negotiating renewal terms with the local franchising authorities.
we cannot assure you that we will be able to comply with all significant provisions of our franchise agreements and certain of our franchisors have from time to time alleged that we have not complied with these agreements. additionally, although historically we have renewed our franchises without incurring significant costs, we cannot assure you that we will be able to renew, or to renew as favorably, our franchises in the future. a termination of or a sustained failure to renew a franchise in one or more service areas could adversely affect our business in the affected geographic area.
our cable system franchises are non-exclusive. consequently, local and state franchising authorities can grant additional franchises to competitors in the same geographic area or operate their own cable systems. in some cases, local government entities and municipal utilities may legally compete with us on more favorable terms.
item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.
reference is made to "part i. item 1a. risk factors" and "cautionary statement regarding forward-looking statements," which describe important factors that could cause actual results to differ from expectations and non-historical information contained herein. in addition, the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes thereto of charter included in "part ii. item 8. financial statements and supplementary data."
overview we are a leading broadband connectivity company and cable operator serving more than 32 million customers in 41 states through our spectrum brand. over an advanced communications network, we offer a full range of state-of-the-art residential and business services including spectrum internet, tv, mobile and voice. for small and medium-sized companies, spectrum business delivers the same suite of broadband products and services coupled with special features and applications to enhance productivity, while for larger businesses and government entities, spectrum enterprise provides highly customized, fiber-based solutions. spectrum reach delivers tailored advertising and production for the modern media landscape. we also distribute award-winning news coverage and sports programming to our customers through spectrum networks. see "part i. item 1. business - products and services" for further description of these services, including customer statistics for different services.
during the year ended december 31, 2023, we added 2,474,000 mobile lines and 155,000 internet customers. we spent $1.9 billion on our subsidized rural construction initiative during the year ended december 31, 2023 and activated approximately 295,000 subsidized rural passings. our mobile line and internet customer additions were supported by our spectrum one offering, which brings together spectrum internet, advanced wifi and unlimited spectrum mobile to offer consumers fast, reliable and secure online connections on their favorite devices at home and on-the-go in a high-value package, and were further supported by growth in our legacy and new subsidized rural markets.
we continue to upgrade our network to provide higher internet speeds and reliability and invest in our products and customer service platforms. we currently offer spectrum internet products with speeds up to 1 gbps across our entire footprint and we are upgrading our network to provide multi-gigabit speeds. our advanced wifi, a managed wifi service that provides customers an optimized home network and greater control over connected devices with enhanced security and privacy, is available to all of our internet customers. we continue to invest in our ability to provide a differentiated internet connectivity experience for our mobile and fixed internet customers with increasing availability of out-of-home wifi access points across our footprint. in addition, we continue to work towards the construction of our own 5g mobile data-only network in targeted areas of our footprint leveraging our cbrs priority access licenses.
we also continue to develop our video product. in september 2023, we entered into a new affiliation agreement with the walt disney company ("disney"), which provides a template for a new programming affiliation approach where we partner with content providers to provide access to both linear and app-based dtc content. in october 2023, we began deploying xumo to new video customers. xumo combines a live tv experience with access to hundreds of content applications, and features unified search and discovery along with a curated content offering based on the customer's interests and subscriptions. by continually improving our product set and offering consumers the opportunity to save money by switching to our services, we believe we can continue to penetrate our expanding footprint and sell additional products to our existing customers. we are also beginning to see operational benefits from the targeted investments we are making in employee wages and benefits to build employee skill sets and tenure, as well as the continued investments in digitization of our customer service platforms and proactive maintenance, all with the goal of improving the customer experience, reducing transactions and driving customer growth and retention.
we realized revenue, adjusted ebitda and income from operations during the periods presented as follows (in millions; all percentages are calculated using whole numbers; minor differences may exist due to rounding).
adjusted ebitda                 $21,894                     $21,616                       1.3    %
adjusted ebitda is defined as net income attributable to charter shareholders plus net income attributable to noncontrolling interest, net interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, stock compensation expense, other income (expense), net and other operating (income) expenses, net, such as special charges and (gain) loss on sale or retirement of assets. see "-use of adjusted ebitda and free cash flow" for further information on adjusted ebitda and free cash flow.
growth in total revenue was primarily due to growth in our residential internet customers and residential mobile lines partly offset by lower residential video and advertising sales revenues. adjusted ebitda and income from operations growth was driven by growth in revenue and increases in operating costs and expenses, primarily mobile device and other mobile direct costs and costs to service customers, partly offset by a decrease in programming expense. income from operations was also affected by a gain on the sale of towers and lower depreciation and amortization expense, partly offset by an increase in stock compensation expense.
approximately 90% of our revenues for each of the years ended december 31, 2023 and 2022 are attributable to monthly subscription fees charged to customers for our internet, video, voice, mobile and commercial services as well as regional sports and news channels. generally, these customer subscriptions may be discontinued by the customer at any time subject to a fee for certain commercial customers. the remaining 10% of our revenue is derived primarily from advertising revenues, franchise and other regulatory fee revenues (which are collected by us but then paid to local authorities), sales of mobile and video devices, processing fees or reconnection fees charged to customers to commence or reinstate service, installation, vod and pay-per-view programming, and commissions related to the sale of merchandise by home shopping services.
critical accounting policies and estimates certain of our accounting policies require our management to make difficult, subjective and/or complex judgments. management has discussed these policies with the audit committee of charter's board of directors, and the audit committee has reviewed the following disclosure. we consider the following policies to be the most critical in understanding the estimates, assumptions and judgments that are involved in preparing our financial statements, and the uncertainties that could affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows:
•capitalization of labor and overhead costs
•defined benefit pension plans capitalization of labor and overhead costs costs associated with network construction or upgrades, placement of the customer drop to the dwelling and the placement of outlets within a dwelling along with the costs associated with the deployment of new customer premise equipment necessary to provide internet, video or voice services, are capitalized.  costs capitalized include materials, direct labor and certain indirect costs. these indirect costs consist of compensation and overhead costs associated with support functions.  while our capitalization is based on specific activities, once capitalized, we track these costs on a composite basis by fixed asset category at the cable system level, and not on a specific asset basis.  for assets that are sold or retired, we remove the estimated applicable cost and accumulated depreciation.  the costs of disconnecting service and removing customer premise equipment from a dwelling and the costs to reconnect a customer drop or to redeploy previously installed customer premise equipment are charged to operating expense as incurred. costs for repairs and maintenance are charged to operating expense as incurred, while plant and equipment replacement, including replacement of certain components, betterments, and replacement of cable drops and outlets, are capitalized.
we make judgments regarding the installation and construction activities to be capitalized. we capitalized direct labor and overhead of $2.3 billion and $1.8 billion for the years ended december 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. we capitalize direct labor and overhead using standards developed from actual costs and applicable operational data. we calculate standards annually (or more frequently if circumstances dictate) for items such as the labor rates, overhead rates, and the actual amount of time required to perform a capitalizable activity. for example, the standard amounts of time required to perform capitalizable activities are based on studies of the time required to perform such activities. overhead rates are established based on an analysis of the nature of costs incurred in support of capitalizable activities, and a determination of the portion of costs that is directly attributable to capitalizable activities. the impact of changes that resulted from these studies were not material in the periods presented.
labor costs directly associated with capital projects are capitalized. capitalizable activities performed in connection with installations include such activities as:
•verification of serviceability to the customer's dwelling or business (i.e., determining whether the customer's dwelling is capable of receiving service by our cable network);
•customer premise activities performed by in-house field technicians and third-party contractors in connection with the installation, replacement and betterment of equipment and materials to enable internet, video or voice services; and
•verifying the integrity of the customer's network connection by initiating test signals downstream from the headend to the customer premise equipment, as well as testing signal levels at the utility pole or pedestal.
judgment is required to determine the extent to which overhead costs incurred result from specific capital activities, and therefore should be capitalized. the primary costs that are included in the determination of the overhead rate are (i) employee benefits and payroll taxes associated with capitalized direct labor, (ii) direct variable costs associated with capitalizable activities, (iii) the cost of support personnel, such as care personnel and dispatchers, who assist with capitalizable installation activities, and (iv) indirect costs directly attributable to capitalizable activities.
while we believe our existing capitalization policies are appropriate, a significant change in the nature or extent of our operating practices could affect management's judgment about the extent to which we should capitalize direct labor or overhead in the future. we monitor the appropriateness of our capitalization policies, and perform updates to our internal studies on an ongoing basis to determine whether facts or circumstances warrant a change to our capitalization policies.
income taxes we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of our assets and liabilities and expected benefits of utilizing loss carryforwards, including indefinite lived carryovers such as the section 163(j) interest limitation. valuation allowances are established when management determines that it is more likely than not that some portion or the entire deferred tax asset will not be realized. in evaluating the need for a valuation allowance, management takes into account various factors, including the expected level of future taxable income, available tax planning strategies and reversals of existing taxable temporary differences. the impact on deferred taxes of changes in tax rates and tax law, if any, applied to the years during which temporary differences are expected to be settled, are reflected in the consolidated financial statements in the period of enactment. in determining our tax provision for financial reporting purposes, we establish a reserve for uncertain tax positions unless such positions are determined to be "more likely than not" of being sustained upon examination, based on their technical merits. there is considerable judgment involved in making such a determination. we recognize interest and penalties accrued on uncertain income tax positions as part of the income tax provision.
defined benefit pension plans we sponsor qualified and unqualified defined benefit pension plans that provide pension benefits to a majority of employees who were employed by twc before the merger with twc. as of december 31, 2023, the accumulated benefit obligation and fair value of plan assets was $2.4 billion and $2.6 billion, respectively, and the net funded asset was recorded as a $149 million noncurrent asset, $3 million current liability and $19 million long-term liability. as of december 31, 2022, the accumulated benefit obligation and fair value of plan assets was $2.2 billion and $2.6 billion, respectively, and the net funded asset was recorded as a $362 million noncurrent asset, $5 million current liability and $17 million long-term liability. in june 2023, we purchased a buy-in group annuity contract from a highly rated insurer and in october 2023, we announced plans to fully terminate the qualified pension plan. the benefit obligation for the qualified pension plan as of december 31, 2023 of $2.4 billion was therefore determined on a plan termination basis for which it is assumed that a portion of eligible active and deferred vested participants will elect lump sum payments.
pension benefits are based on formulas that reflect the employees' years of service and compensation during their employment period. actuarial gains or losses are changes in the amount of either the benefit obligation or the fair value of plan assets resulting from experience different from that assumed or from changes in assumptions. we have elected to follow a mark-to-market pension accounting policy for recording the actuarial gains or losses annually during the fourth quarter, or earlier if a remeasurement event occurs during an interim period. we use a december 31 measurement date for our pension plans.
we recognized net periodic pension cost of $216 million in 2023 and net periodic pension benefit of $254 million in 2022. net periodic pension benefit or cost is determined using certain assumptions, including the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, discount rate and mortality assumptions. we determined the discount rate used to compute pension cost based on the yield of a large population of high-quality corporate bonds with cash flows sufficient in timing and amount to settle projected future defined benefit payments. in developing the expected long-term rate of return on assets, we considered the current pension portfolio's composition, past average rate of earnings, and our asset allocation targets. we used a discount rate of 4.65% to determine the december 31, 2023 pension plan benefit obligation. a decrease in the discount rate of 25 basis points would result in an $80 million increase in our pension plan benefit obligation as of december 31, 2023 and net periodic pension cost recognized in 2023 under our mark-to-market accounting policy. the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets used to determine net periodic pension benefit for the year ended december 31, 2024 is expected to be 5.00%. a decrease in the expected long-term rate of return of 25 basis points to 4.75%, while holding all other assumptions constant, would result in a decrease in our 2024 net periodic pension benefit of approximately $6 million. see note 21 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements contained in "part ii. item 8. financial statements and supplementary data" for additional discussion on these assumptions.
results of operations a discussion of changes in our results of operations during the year ended december 31, 2022 compared to the year ended december 31, 2021 has been omitted from this annual report on form 10-k, but may be found in "item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" in our annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2022, filed with the sec on january 27, 2023, which is available free of charge on the sec's website at www.sec.gov and on charter's investor relations website at ir.charter.com.
operating costs and expenses (exclusive of items shown separately below)                33,405                              32,876
revenues.  total revenues grew $585 million or 1.1% during the year ended december 31, 2023 as compared to 2022 primarily due to growth in residential internet revenue, mobile device sales and residential mobile service revenues partly offset by lower residential video and advertising sales revenues as well as $68 million of total customer credits related to the temporary loss of disney programming during 2023.
residential video customers decreased by 994,000 in 2023 compared to 2022. the decrease related to rate and product mix was primarily due to a higher mix of lower cost video packages within our video customer base and $63 million of customer credits related to the temporary loss of disney programming in 2023, offset by the pass-through of programming cost increases and promotional rate step-ups.
advertising sales revenues consist primarily of revenues from commercial advertising customers, programmers and other vendors, as well as local cable and advertising on regional sports and news channels. advertising sales revenues decreased $331 million during the year ended december 31, 2023 as compared to the corresponding period in 2022 primarily due to a decrease in political revenue.
operating costs and expenses. the increase in our operating costs and expenses, exclusive of items shown separately in the consolidated statements of operations, was attributable to the following (dollars in millions):
programming costs were approximately $10.6 billion and $11.6 billion for the years ended december 31, 2023 and 2022, representing 32% and 35% of total operating costs and expenses, respectively. programming costs consist primarily of costs paid to programmers for basic, premium, video on demand, and pay-per-view programming. programming costs decreased as a result of a higher mix of lower cost video packages within our video customer base, fewer customers and a $61 million benefit related to the temporary loss of disney programming during 2023, partly offset by contractual rate adjustments, including renewals and increases in amounts paid for retransmission consent.
costs to service customers increased $328 million during the year ended december 31, 2023 compared to the corresponding period in 2022 primarily due to adjustments to job structure, pay and benefits to build a more skilled and longer tenured workforce resulting in lower frontline employee attrition compared to 2022, and additional activity to support the accelerated growth of spectrum mobile.
stock compensation expense increased during the year ended december 31, 2023 compared to the corresponding prior period primarily due to an increase in equity awards granted. corporate, costs to sell and service bulk properties and enterprise costs increased primarily due to higher labor costs while property tax and insurance expense decreased during the year ended december 31, 2023 compared to the corresponding prior period primarily as a result of adjustments related to favorable development on prior year workers' compensation claims.
depreciation and amortization. depreciation and amortization expense decreased by $207 million during the year ended december 31, 2023 compared to the corresponding period in 2022 primarily due to certain assets acquired in acquisitions becoming fully depreciated offset by an increase in depreciation as a result of more recent capital expenditures.

see note 15 and the notes referenced above to the accompanying consolidated financial statements contained in "item 1. financial statements" for more information.
income tax expense. we recognized income tax expense of $1.6 billion for both the years ended december 31, 2023 and 2022.  for more information, see note 17 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements contained in "part ii. item 8. financial statements and supplementary data."
net income attributable to noncontrolling interest. net income attributable to noncontrolling interest for financial reporting purposes represents a/n's portion of charter holdings' net income based on its effective common unit ownership interest. for more information, see note 10 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements contained in "part ii. item 8. financial statements and supplementary data."
use of adjusted ebitda and free cash flow we use certain measures that are not defined by u.s. generally accepted accounting principles ("gaap") to evaluate various aspects of our business. adjusted ebitda and free cash flow are non-gaap financial measures and should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, net income attributable to charter shareholders and net cash flows from operating activities reported in accordance with gaap. these terms, as defined by us, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. adjusted ebitda and free cash flow are reconciled to net income attributable to charter shareholders and net cash flows from operating activities, respectively, below.
adjusted ebitda eliminates the significant non-cash depreciation and amortization expense that results from the capital-intensive nature of our businesses as well as other non-cash or special items, and is unaffected by our capital structure or investment activities. however, this measure is limited in that it does not reflect the periodic costs of certain capitalized tangible and intangible assets used in generating revenues and our cash cost of financing. these costs are evaluated through other financial measures.
free cash flow is defined as net cash flows from operating activities, less capital expenditures and changes in accrued expenses related to capital expenditures.
management and charter's board of directors use adjusted ebitda and free cash flow to assess our performance and our ability to service our debt, fund operations and make additional investments with internally generated funds. in addition, adjusted ebitda generally correlates to the leverage ratio calculation under our credit facilities or outstanding notes to determine compliance with the covenants contained in the facilities and notes (all such documents have been previously filed with the sec). for the purpose of calculating compliance with leverage covenants, we use adjusted ebitda, as presented, excluding certain expenses paid by our operating subsidiaries to other charter entities. our debt covenants refer to these expenses as management fees, which fees were in the amount of $1.4 billion for each of the years ended december 31, 2023 and 2022.
a reconciliation of adjusted ebitda and free cash flow to net income attributable to charter shareholders and net cash flows from operating activities, respectively, is as follows (dollars in millions):
adjusted ebitda                                                       $21,894                         $21,616
net cash flows from operating activities                              $14,433                         $14,925
change in accrued expenses related to capital expenditures                172                             553
liquidity and capital resources overview we have significant amounts of debt and require significant cash to fund principal and interest payments on our debt. the principal amount of our debt as of december 31, 2023 was $97.6 billion, consisting of $12.4 billion of credit facility debt, $57.9 billion of investment grade senior secured notes and $27.3 billion of high-yield senior unsecured notes. our split credit rating allows us to access both the investment grade debt market and the high yield debt market.
our projected cash needs and projected sources of liquidity depend upon, among other things, our actual results, and the timing and amount of our expenditures. as we continue to grow our market penetration of our mobile product, we will continue to experience negative working capital impacts from the timing of device-related cash flows when we sell devices to customers pursuant to equipment installment plans. further, in 2022, charter became a meaningful federal cash tax payer as the majority of our net operating losses had been utilized. free cash flow was $3.5 billion and $6.1 billion for the years ended december 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. see table below for factors impacting free cash flow during the year ended december 31, 2023 compared to 2022. as of december 31, 2023, the amount available under our credit facilities was approximately $5.2 billion and cash on hand was approximately $709 million. we expect to utilize free cash flow, cash on hand and availability under our credit facilities as well as future refinancing transactions to further extend the maturities of our obligations. the timing and terms of any refinancing transactions will be subject to market conditions among other considerations. additionally, we may, from time to time, and depending on market conditions and other factors, use cash on hand and the proceeds from securities offerings or other borrowings to retire our debt through open market purchases, privately negotiated purchases, tender offers or redemption provisions. we believe we have sufficient liquidity from cash on hand, free cash flow and charter operating's revolving credit facility as well as access to the capital markets to fund our projected cash needs.
we continue to evaluate the deployment of our cash on hand and anticipated future free cash flow, including investing in our business growth and other strategic opportunities, including expanding the capacity of our network, the expansion of our network through our rural broadband construction initiative, the build-out and deployment of our cbrs spectrum, and mergers and acquisitions as well as stock repurchases and dividends. charter's target leverage of net debt to the last twelve months adjusted ebitda remains at 4 to 4.5 times adjusted ebitda, and up to 3.5 times adjusted ebitda at the charter operating first lien level. charter's leverage ratio was 4.42 times adjusted ebitda as of december 31, 2023. as adjusted ebitda grows, we expect to increase the total amount of our indebtedness to maintain leverage within charter's target leverage range. excluding purchases from liberty broadband discussed below, during the years ended december 31, 2023 and 2022, charter purchased in the public market approximately 6.9 million and 14.5 million shares, respectively, of charter class a common stock for approximately $2.7 billion and $7.1 billion, respectively. since the beginning of its buyback program in september 2016 through the year ended december 31, 2023, charter has purchased in the public market approximately 158.3 million shares of class a common stock and charter holdings common units for approximately $72.0 billion, including purchases from liberty broadband and a/n discussed below.
in february 2021, charter and liberty broadband entered into a letter agreement (the "lbb letter agreement"). the lbb letter agreement implements liberty broadband's obligations under the stockholders agreement to participate in share repurchases by charter. under the lbb letter agreement, liberty broadband will sell to charter, generally on a monthly basis, a number of shares of charter class a common stock representing an amount sufficient for liberty broadband's ownership of charter to be reduced such that it does not exceed the ownership cap then applicable to liberty broadband under the stockholders agreement at a purchase price per share equal to the volume weighted average price per share paid by charter for shares repurchased during such immediately preceding calendar month other than (i) purchases from a/n, (ii) purchases in privately negotiated transactions or (iii) purchases for the withholding of shares of charter class a common stock pursuant to equity compensation programs of charter. charter purchased from liberty broadband 1.0 million and 6.2 million shares of charter class a common stock for approximately $394 million and $3.0 billion during the years ended december 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.
in december 2016, charter and a/n entered into a letter agreement, as amended in december 2017 (the "a/n letter agreement"), that requires a/n to sell to charter or to charter holdings, on a monthly basis, a number of shares of charter class a common stock or charter holdings common units that represents a pro rata participation by a/n and its affiliates in any repurchases of shares of charter class a common stock from persons other than a/n effected by charter during the immediately preceding calendar month, at a purchase price equal to the average price paid by charter for the shares repurchased from persons other than a/n during such immediately preceding calendar month. a/n and charter both have the right to terminate or suspend the pro rata repurchase arrangement on a prospective basis. during the years ended december 31, 2023 and 2022, charter holdings purchased from a/n 1.1 million and 3.2 million charter holdings common units, respectively, for approximately $427 million and $1.6 billion, respectively.
as of december 31, 2023, charter had remaining board authority to purchase an additional $170 million of charter's class a common stock and/or charter holdings common units, excluding purchases from liberty broadband. although charter expects to continue to buy back its common stock consistent with its leverage target range, charter is not obligated to acquire any particular amount of common stock, and the timing of any purchases that may occur cannot be predicted and will largely depend on market conditions and other potential uses of capital. purchases may include open market purchases, tender offers or negotiated transactions.
as possible acquisitions, swaps or dispositions arise, we actively review them against our objectives including, among other considerations, improving the operational efficiency, geographic clustering of assets, product development or technology capabilities of our business and achieving appropriate return targets, and we may participate to the extent we believe these possibilities present attractive opportunities. however, there can be no assurance that we will actually complete any acquisitions, dispositions or system swaps, or that any such transactions will be material to our operations or results.
recent events in january and february 2024, charter operating and charter communications operating capital corp. redeemed all of their outstanding senior secured floating rate notes due 2024 and paid in full all of their outstanding 4.500% senior secured notes due 2024 at maturity.

historical operating, investing, and financing activities cash and cash equivalents. we held $709 million and $645 million in cash and cash equivalents as of december 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.
operating activities.  net cash provided by operating activities decreased $492 million during the year ended december 31, 2023 compared to the year ended december 31, 2022, primarily due to a negative change in working capital and an increase in cash paid for interest and taxes, partly offset by an increase in adjusted ebitda and the payment of litigation settlements in 2022.
investing activities. net cash used in investing activities for the years ended december 31, 2023 and 2022 was $11.1 billion and $9.1 billion, respectively. the increase in cash used was primarily due to an increase in capital expenditures and changes in accrued expenses related to capital expenditures.
financing activities. net cash used in financing activities decreased $2.5 billion during the year ended december 31, 2023 compared to the year ended december 31, 2022 primarily due to a decrease in the purchase of treasury stock and noncontrolling interest partly offset by a decrease in the amount by which borrowings of long-term debt exceeded repayments.
capital expenditures we have significant ongoing capital expenditure requirements.  capital expenditures were $11.1 billion and $9.4 billion for the years ended december 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. the increase was primarily due to an increase in line extensions in connection with our subsidized rural construction initiative and continued residential and commercial network expansion. the increase in capital expenditures excluding line extensions was primarily driven by higher spend on network evolution, support capital and customer premise equipment, particularly xumo. see the table below for more details.
we currently expect full year 2024 capital expenditures to total between $12.2 billion and $12.4 billion, including line extensions of approximately $4.5 billion and network evolution spend of approximately $1.6 billion. the actual amount of capital expenditures in 2024 will depend on a number of factors including, but not limited to, the pace of our network evolution and expansion initiatives, supply chain timing and growth rates in our residential and commercial businesses.
our capital expenditures are funded primarily from cash flows from operating activities and borrowings on our credit facility. in addition, our accrued liabilities related to capital expenditures increased $172 million and $553 million for the years ended december 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.
the following tables present our major capital expenditures categories in accordance with national cable and telecommunications association ("ncta") disclosure guidelines for the years ended december 31, 2023 and 2022. these disclosure guidelines are not required disclosures under gaap, nor do they impact our accounting for capital expenditures under gaap (dollars in millions):

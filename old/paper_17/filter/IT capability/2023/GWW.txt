item 1a: risk factors the following represents a discussion of risk factors relevant to grainger's business that could adversely affect its financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, along with the accuracy of forward-looking statements. the risks included below are not exhaustive. as grainger operates in a rapidly changing environment, it is not possible for management to predict all risks and the corresponding impact of each such risk or a combination of risks. the presented risks and any new risks could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. the risk factors discussed in this section should be considered together with information included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k and should not be considered the only risks to which grainger is exposed.
market variables, such as inflation of product costs, labor rates and fuel, freight and energy costs, as well as geopolitical events, could negatively impact grainger's ability to effectively manage its operating and administrative expenses. for example, geopolitical conflicts and related international responses have and may continue to exacerbate inflationary pressures, including increases in fuel and other energy costs. in addition, grainger's inability to pass on increases in costs to customers in a timely manner, or at all, could cause grainger's operating and administrative expenses to grow, which could result in lower gross profit margins and lower net earnings.
grainger's logistics or supply chain network could be disrupted by the occurrence of: one or more natural or human induced disasters, including earthquakes, tsunamis, storms, hurricanes, floods, fires, droughts, tornados and other extreme weather events or conditions; pandemic diseases or viral contagions; geopolitical events, such as war, civil unrest or terrorist attacks in a country in which grainger operates or in which its suppliers are located; disruptions to transportation infrastructure and networks, including from transport providers or third-party work stoppages related to labor strikes or lockouts; and the imposition of measures that create barriers to or increases in costs associated with international trade. even when grainger is able to find alternate sources for certain products, they may cost more or require grainger to incur higher transportation costs, which could adversely impact grainger's profitability and financial condition. any of these circumstances could impair grainger's ability to meet customer demand for products and result in lost sales, increased supply chain costs, penalties or damage to grainger's reputation. grainger's ability to provide same-day shipping and next-day delivery is an integral component of grainger's business strategy and any such disruption could adversely impact results of operations and financial performance.
further escalation of geopolitical tensions across the world and potential actions taken in response to them could have a broad impact on markets where grainger does business, adversely affect its suppliers and disrupt the sourcing, manufacturing and transportation of products. it is not possible to predict whether certain geopolitical events which could adversely affect grainger's business will occur, or the broader consequences of these events if they did occur, which could include further instability, geopolitical shifts and adverse effects on the global economy or possible sanctions, embargoes or other trade barriers.
weakness in the economy, market trends and other conditions affecting the profitability and financial stability of grainger's customers could negatively impact grainger's sales growth and results of operations.
economic, political and industry trends affect grainger's business environment. grainger serves several industries and markets in which the demand for its products and services is sensitive to the production activity, capital spending and demand for products and services of grainger's customers. many of these customers operate in markets that are subject to fluctuations resulting from market uncertainty, trade and tariff policies, costs of goods sold, currency exchange rates, interest rate fluctuations, government spending and government shutdowns, economic downturns, recessions, foreign competition, offshoring of production, oil and natural gas prices, geopolitical developments, labor shortages, work stoppages, inflation, natural or human induced disasters, extreme weather, outbreaks of pandemic disease, inflation, deflation, and a variety of other factors beyond grainger's control. any of these factors could cause customers to idle or close facilities, delay purchases, reduce production levels, or experience reductions in the demand for their own products or services.
any of these events could also reduce the volume of products and services these customers purchase from grainger or impair the ability of grainger's customers to make full and timely payments and could cause increased pressure on grainger's pricing and terms of sale. accordingly, a significant or prolonged slowdown in economic activity in canada, japan, mexico, the u.k., the u.s. or any other major world economy, or a segment of any such economy, could negatively impact grainger's sales and results of operations.
unexpected product shortages, tariffs, product cost increases and risks associated with grainger's suppliers could negatively impact customer relationships or result in an adverse impact on results of operations.
disruptions in procuring sources of supply could occur due to factors beyond grainger's control. these factors could include economic downturns, recessions, outbreaks of pandemic disease, natural or human induced disasters, cybersecurity attacks, extreme weather, geopolitical unrest, new or increased tariffs, trade issues and policies, detention orders or withhold release orders on imported products, labor problems or shortages experienced by grainger's suppliers or others in the supply chain, transportation availability, staffing and cost, shortage of raw materials, supplier consolidation, unilateral product cost increases by suppliers of products in short supply, inflation and other factors, any of which could adversely affect a supplier's ability to manufacture or deliver products or could result in an increase in grainger's product costs.
further, grainger sources products from asia and other areas of the world. this increases the risk of supply disruption due to the additional lead time required, distances involved, and the range of potential consequences of various geopolitical risks. if grainger was unable to promptly replace sources of supply that become disrupted, there could be adverse effects on inventory levels, results of operations, customer relationships and grainger's reputation. in addition, grainger has strategic relationships with a number of vendors. in the event grainger was unable to maintain those relations, there might be a loss of competitive pricing arrangements which could, in turn, adversely affect results of operations.
for products sold in the u.s., canada, and mexico, grainger requires its suppliers and sub-suppliers, to comply with grainger's supplier code of ethics, or other similar responsible sourcing standards, as a condition of doing business with grainger. grainger's supplier code of ethics focuses on four main areas of ethical sourcing: (i) human rights and labor standards (including prohibitions on child and forced labor); (ii) environment, health and safety; (iii) sanctions, trade, bribery and corruption; and (iv) privacy and information security. the code also addresses how to report potential code violations and related concerns. grainger does not control its suppliers and their sub-suppliers, and neither grainger nor its suppliers or other partners may be able to uncover all instances of noncompliance with grainger's supplier code of ethics and ethical and lawful business practices. even an isolated incident, or the aggregate effect of individually insignificant incidents, can erode trust and confidence, particularly if they result in adverse publicity, governmental investigations, product recalls, or litigation, and as a result, could tarnish grainger's brand and lead to adverse effects on grainger's business.
volatility in commodity prices may adversely affect gross margins.
some of grainger's products contain significant amounts of commodity-priced materials, such as steel, copper, petroleum derivatives, rare earth minerals, or other materials or inputs required to manufacture certain products and are subject to price changes based on fluctuations in the commodities market. the recent global geopolitical and trade environment has resulted in raw material inflation and potential for increased escalation of domestic and international tariffs and retaliatory trade policies. further changes in u.s. trade policy (including new or additional increases in duties or tariffs) and retaliatory actions by u.s. trade partners could result in a worsening of economic conditions. the level of demand for grainger's products and services is influenced in multiple ways by the price and availability of raw materials and commodities, including fuel. fluctuations in the price of fuel or increased demand for freight services, including as a result of a pandemic, could affect transportation costs. grainger's ability to pass on such increases in costs in a timely manner depends on market conditions. the inability to pass along cost increases could result in lower gross margins. in addition, higher prices could reduce demand for these products, resulting in lower sales volumes.
grainger's exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency rates results primarily from the translation exposure associated with the preparation of the consolidated financial statements, as well as from transactions in currencies other than an entity's functional currency. while the consolidated financial statements are reported in u.s. dollars,
the financial statements of grainger's subsidiaries outside the u.s. are prepared using the local currency as the functional currency and translated into u.s. dollars. in addition, grainger is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk with respect to the u.s. dollar relative to the local currencies of grainger's international subsidiaries, primarily the japanese yen, mexican peso, canadian dollar, british pound sterling, chinese renminbi and euro, arising from transactions in the normal course of business, such as sales and loans to wholly owned subsidiaries, sales to customers, purchases from suppliers, and bank loans and lines of credit denominated in foreign currencies. the foreign currency exchange rate is driven by a variety of macroeconomic factors and fiscal decisions of various governments and central banks, all over which grainger has no control. grainger also has foreign currency exposure to the extent receipts and expenditures are not denominated in a subsidiary's functional currency and that could have an impact on sales, costs and cash flows. these fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have affected and may continue to affect grainger's results of operations and impact reported net sales and net earnings.
the facilities maintenance industry is highly competitive, and changes in competition and other risks could impact demand for grainger's products and services.
grainger competes in a variety of ways, including product assortment and availability, services offered to customers, pricing, purchasing convenience and the overall experience grainger offers. this includes the ease of use of grainger's high-touch operations, ecommerce platforms and delivery of products.
there are several large competitors in the industry, although most of the market is served by small local and regional competitors. grainger faces competition in all markets it serves from manufacturers (including some of its own suppliers) that sell directly to certain segments of the market, wholesale distributors, catalog houses, retail enterprises and online businesses.
to remain competitive, grainger must be willing and able to respond to market pressures. downward pressure on sales prices, changes in the volume of orders, and an inability to pass higher product costs on to customers could cause grainger's gross profit percentage to fluctuate or decline. grainger may not be able to pass rising product costs to customers if those customers have ready product or supplier alternatives in the marketplace. these pressures could have a material effect on grainger's sales and profitability.
to manage these potential pressures, grainger continuously considers the adoption of new operating initiatives, including new marketing programs, productivity improvements, inventory management and loss prevention initiatives, and other similar strategies. if grainger is unable to sustain or grow sales, reduce costs, and prevent loss and fraud, among other actions, grainger's results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.
moreover, grainger expects technological advancements, innovations and the increased use of ecommerce solutions within the industry to continue to evolve at a rapid pace. as a result, grainger's ability to effectively compete requires grainger to respond and adapt to new industry trends and developments. developing, upgrading, managing or implementing new technologies, business applications, strategies and innovations may require significant investment of resources by grainger, may result in unexpected costs and disruptions to operations, may take longer than expected, may increase grainger's vulnerability to cyber breaches, attacks or intrusions, and may not provide all anticipated benefits.
the growth of grainger's ecommerce platforms exposes grainger to additional risks which could adversely affect grainger's reputation, financial condition and operating results.
the successful execution of grainger's ecommerce growth strategy depends on a number of factors, including grainger's investment in its ecommerce platforms, consumer preferences and purchasing trends, and the ability to deliver a seamless procurement experience across digital and also physical retail channels. as its ecommerce platforms have grown in recent years, grainger has increased, and expects to continue to increase, its investments in developing, managing and implementing technology information systems, software development and other capabilities to provide simplified customer interactions and to provide high-quality, user-friendly service to its customers and streamline customer interactions. grainger has also made significant investments in digital advertising and customer acquisition and retention efforts for its ecommerce channels, including through paid and non-paid advertising such as display advertising, search engine optimization, email and mobile "push" notifications. if grainger's customer-facing technology systems are perceived as more difficult or less compelling for customers to use than those of grainger's competitors, or if digital marketing efforts are unsuccessful or if grainger is otherwise unsuccessful at realizing the benefits of these investments, its reputation, financial condition and operating results may be adversely affected. additionally, grainger faces many risks and uncertainties beyond the company's control, including theft, credit card fraud, and other fraudulent behavior.
grainger has also increased, and expects to continue to increase, its investments in developing, managing and implementing artificial intelligence (ai), machine learning and large language model technologies. while the use of these technologies can present significant benefits to grainger, it also creates risks and challenges. further, if these investments in grainger's ecommerce platforms are less successful at attracting and retaining customers than similar investments by our competitors, or if grainger is otherwise unsuccessful at realizing the benefits of these technological investments generally, its reputation, financial condition and operating results may be adversely affected.
in addition, the successful operation of grainger's ecommerce channels depends in part upon third parties and factors over which grainger has limited or no control. for example, grainger relies in part on internet search engines to drive traffic to its websites, and the reach of grainger's ecommerce channels is impacted by how and where its websites rank in both paid and unpaid search results. potential changes to search engine ranking rules could cause grainger's websites to place lower in search results and cause grainger to incur increased advertising costs in order to increase its visibility. further, ongoing changes in the legal and regulatory requirements surrounding data privacy, online tracking technologies such as cookies, digital advertising and other ecommerce matters could require grainger to modify its ecommerce strategy, incur significant additional costs to comply with such changes or otherwise adversely affect grainger's business, results of operations or financial condition. grainger also relies on email and other messaging services to promote its websites and product offerings, and changes in grainger's current or prospective customers' use of email or other messaging services or actions by third parties to block, restrict or charge for the delivery of such messages could adversely affect sales through grainger's ecommerce channels and grainger's results of operations.
changes in customer base or product mix could cause changes in grainger's revenue or gross margin, or affect grainger's competitive position.
from time to time, grainger experiences changes in its customer base and product mix that affect gross margin. changes in customer base and product mix result primarily from business acquisitions and divestitures, changes in customer demand, customer acquisitions, selling and marketing activities, competition and the increased use of ecommerce by grainger and its competitors.
in addition, grainger has entered, and may in the future continue to enter, into contracts with group purchasing organizations (gpos) that aggregate the buying power of their member customers in negotiating selling prices. if grainger is unable to enter into, or sustain, contractual arrangements on a satisfactory commercial basis with gpos, grainger's results of operations could be adversely affected.
as its customer base and product mix change over time, grainger must identify new products, product lines and services that respond to industry trends and customer needs. the inability to introduce new products and services and effectively integrate them into grainger's existing assortment could have a negative impact on future sales growth and grainger's competitive position. the inclusion of grainger-branded products in the product assortment could subject grainger to increased claims and litigation activity. in addition, any insurance or indemnification rights, including against the manufacturer of such products, may be insufficient or unavailable to protect grainger against potential loss exposures.
grainger's common stock may be subject to volatility or price declines.
the trading prices and volumes of grainger's common stock may be subject to broad and unpredictable fluctuations due to changes in economic, political and market conditions, the financial results and business strategies of grainger and its competitors, changes in expectations as to grainger's future financial or operating performance, including estimates by securities analysts and investors, grainger's failure to meet the financial performance guidance or other forward-looking statements provided to the public, speculation, coverage or sentiment in the media or investment community or by groups of individual investors, changes in capital structure, share repurchases or dividends, economic decline, political unrest or geopolitical conflict, outbreak of pandemic disease, and a number of other factors, including those discussed in this item 1a. these factors, many of which are outside of grainger's control, could cause stock price and trading volume volatility or grainger's stock price to decline. volatility in the price of grainger's securities could result in the filing of securities class action litigation, which could result in substantial costs and the diversion of management time and resources.
grainger has a controlling ownership interest in monotaro, which is listed on the tokyo stock exchange (tse). monotaro's disclosure and reporting obligations under tse listing requirements and japanese securities laws, including the timing of such obligations, may vary from grainger's obligations under new york stock exchange
listing requirements and u.s. securities laws. monotaro's listed securities may be subject to the same volatility, price and securities litigation risks to which grainger's common stock is subject.
the functioning of grainger's information systems is critical to the operation of its business. grainger continues to invest in software, hardware and network infrastructures to effectively manage its information systems. however, grainger may not be able to maintain or update its information systems to capture and use data in ways that result in operational efficiency, including as a result of ineffective software, difficulties obtaining the right talent and ability to manage the increasing volume of data available to, and managed by grainger. furthermore, although grainger's information systems are protected with backup and security systems, including physical and software safeguards and remote processing capabilities, information systems are still vulnerable to damage or interruption from natural or human induced disasters, extreme weather, power losses, telecommunication failures, user error, third-party actions such as malicious computer programs, denial-of-service attacks and cybersecurity breaches, and other problems. in addition, grainger relies on the information technology (it) systems of third parties to assist in conducting its business.
the implementation of new systems and upgrades to existing systems could impact grainger's operations by imposing substantial capital expenditures, demands on management's time and risks of delays or difficulties in transitioning to new systems. in addition, grainger's systems implementations may not result in productivity improvements at the levels anticipated. systems implementation disruption and any other it disruption could have an adverse effect on its business.
if grainger's systems or those of third parties on which grainger depends are damaged, breached, cease to function properly or are otherwise disrupted, grainger may require a significant investment to repair or replace them and may suffer interim interruptions in its business operations. if critical information systems fail or otherwise become unavailable, grainger's ability to operate its ecommerce platforms, process orders, maintain proper levels of inventories, collect accounts receivable, disburse funds, manage its supply chain, monitor results of operations, and process and store team member or customer data, among other functions, could be adversely affected. any such interruption of grainger's information systems could have a material adverse effect on its business or results of operations. grainger has experienced these incidents in the past, which it deemed immaterial to its business and operations individually and in the aggregate and may be subject to other incidents in the future. there can be no assurance that any future incidents will not be material to grainger's business, operations or financial condition.
cybersecurity incidents, including breaches of information systems security, could damage grainger's reputation, disrupt operations, increase costs and/or decrease revenues.
through grainger's sales and ecommerce channels, grainger collects and stores personally identifiable, confidential, proprietary and other information from customers so that they may, among other things, purchase products or services, enroll in promotional programs, register on grainger's websites or otherwise communicate or interact with grainger. moreover, grainger's operations routinely involve receiving, storing, processing and transmitting sensitive information pertaining to its business, customers, suppliers and team member, and other sensitive matters.
cyber threats are rapidly evolving and the means for obtaining access to information in digital and other storage media are becoming increasingly sophisticated. each year, cyber-attackers make numerous attempts to access the information stored in grainger's information systems. loss of customer, supplier, and team member information, intellectual property or other business information, or failure to comply with data privacy and security laws could, for example, disrupt operations, damage grainger's reputation and expose grainger to claims from customers, suppliers, financial institutions, regulators, payment card associations, team members and others, any of which could have a material adverse effect on grainger, including its financial condition and results of operations. if successful, cyber-attacks may expose grainger to risk of loss or misuse of proprietary or confidential information or disruptions of business operations.
the transition in recent years to remote and "hybrid" working arrangements may increase grainger's vulnerability to cybersecurity incidents, including breaches of information systems security, which could damage grainger's reputation and commercial relationships, disrupt operations, increase costs and/or decrease revenues, and expose grainger to claims or other actions from customers, suppliers, financial institutions, regulators, payment card associations, team members and others.
grainger's it infrastructure also includes products and services provided by suppliers, vendors and other third parties, and these providers can experience breaches of their systems and products that impact the security of systems and proprietary or confidential information. moreover, grainger shares information with these third parties in connection with the products and services they provide to the business. although grainger performs risk assessments on third parties where appropriate to learn about their security program, there is a risk that the confidentiality of data held or accessed by them may be compromised. moreover, grainger may face threats to its information systems, for example, unauthorized access, business email compromise, viruses, malicious code, ransomware, phishing, and organized cyber-attacks. if successful, those attempting to penetrate grainger's or its vendors' information systems may misappropriate intellectual property or personally identifiable, credit card, confidential, proprietary or other sensitive customer, supplier, team member or business information, or cause systems disruption. while many of grainger's agreements with these third parties include indemnification provisions, grainger may not be able to recover sufficiently, or at all, under such provisions to adequately offset any losses it may incur.
in addition, a grainger team member, contractor or other third party with whom grainger does business may attempt to circumvent security measures or otherwise access grainger's information. grainger's systems are integrated with customer systems and a breach of grainger's systems could be used as an attempt to gain illicit access to customer systems and information. grainger has been subject to unauthorized access in the past, which it deemed immaterial to its business and operations individually and in the aggregate and may be subject to other incidents in the future. there can be no assurance that any future incidents will not be material to grainger's business, operations or financial condition.
techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently and may not be recognized until they are launched against a target. grainger may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement preventative measures. any breach of grainger's security measures or any breach, error or malfeasance of those of its third-party service providers could cause grainger to incur significant costs to protect any customers, suppliers, team members and other parties whose information is compromised. such a breach could also cause grainger to make changes to its information systems and administrative processes to address security issues. although grainger maintains insurance coverage that may, subject to policy terms and conditions, cover certain aspects of cyber and information security risks, depending on the nature, location and extent of any event, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses.
grainger has experienced certain cybersecurity incidents and in each instance grainger provided notifications and adopted remedial measures. none of these incidents have been deemed to be material to grainger and grainger has neither incurred any material net expenses nor been materially penalized or subject to any material settlement amounts with respect to such incidents in the last three years. however, there can be no assurance that a future breach or incident would not be material to grainger's operations and financial condition.
for further information regarding grainger's cybersecurity risk management strategy and the board's oversight role, see part i, item 1c: cybersecurity of this form 10-k.
grainger accepts a variety of payment methods via its ecommerce channels, including credit card, debit card, paypal and other payment methods and other online transactions, including through its eprocurement technologies which communicate directly with grainger.com and grainger's other ecommerce channels. although grainger generally relies on third parties to facilitate ecommerce payments and payment processing services, grainger may become subject to additional compliance requirements and regulations regarding these transactions, and may also suffer losses from online fraudulent transactions on its ecommerce channels. in addition, grainger must pay certain transaction fees relating to these transactions, which may increase over time and could have an impact on product margin, profitability and operating costs. grainger's ecommerce channels may become subject to further rules and regulations, and changes in these rules and regulations, or their interpretation, could increase the cost of doing business and adversely affect results of operations.
grainger's inability to adequately protect its intellectual property or successfully defend against infringement claims by others may have an adverse impact on operations.
grainger's business relies on the use, validity and continued protection of certain proprietary information and intellectual property, which includes current and future patents, trade secrets, trademarks, service marks, copyrights and confidentiality agreements as well as license and sublicense agreements to use intellectual property owned by affiliated entities or third parties. unauthorized use of grainger's intellectual property by others could result in harm to various aspects of the business and may result in costly and protracted litigation in order to protect grainger's rights. in addition, grainger may be subject to claims that it has infringed on the intellectual property rights of others, which could subject grainger to liability, require grainger to obtain licenses to use those rights at significant cost or otherwise cause grainger to modify its operations.
in order to compete and have continued growth, grainger must attract, train, motivate, develop, and retain executives and other key team members, including those in managerial, technical, sales, supply chain, technology development and information technology positions. grainger competes to hire team members at increasingly competitive wage rates and then must train them and develop their skills and competencies. qualified individuals needed to fill open positions may be in short supply in some areas. further, changes in market compensation rates may adversely affect grainger's labor costs. competition for qualified team members could require grainger to pay higher wages to attract a sufficient number of team members.
additionally collective bargaining or unionization of team members could decrease grainger's operational flexibility and lead to work stoppages or slowdowns. the performance of grainger's stock price could impact grainger's use of equity-based compensation to attract and retain executives and other key team members. the success of grainger's team member hiring and retention also depends on grainger's ability to build and maintain a diverse and inclusive workplace culture that enables its team members to thrive.
generally, higher wages and benefit costs, competition for diverse talent, and the risk of an increase in team member turnover, could adversely affect grainger's results of operations. further, failure to successfully hire executives and key team members or adequately plan for the succession, transition, and assimilation of executive leaders and team members in key roles, or to plan for the loss of executives and key team members, could adversely affect grainger's business results and financial condition.
grainger's continued success is substantially dependent on positive perceptions of grainger's reputation.
one of the reasons customers choose to do business with grainger and team members choose grainger as a place of employment is the reputation that grainger has built over many years. grainger devotes time and resources to environmental, social and governance (esg) efforts that are consistent with its corporate values and are designed to strengthen its business and protect and preserve its reputation, including programs driving environmental sustainability, ethics and corporate responsibility, strong communities, diversity, equity and inclusion, and gender equality. these efforts and programs could be difficult to achieve and costly to implement, and grainger's actual or perceived failure to execute its esg programs as planned could adversely affect grainger's reputation, business and financial performance. to be successful in the future, grainger must continue to preserve, grow and leverage the value of grainger's brand. reputational value is based in large part on perceptions of subjective qualities. even an isolated incident, or the aggregate effect of individually insignificant incidents, can erode trust and confidence, particularly if they result in adverse publicity, governmental investigations or litigation, and as a result, could tarnish grainger's brand and lead to adverse effects on grainger's business.
regulatory, legal and tax risks grainger is subject to a complex array of laws, regulations and standards globally. failure to comply or unforeseen developments in related contingencies such as litigation and other regulatory proceedings could adversely affect grainger's financial condition, profitability and cash flows.
grainger's business is subject to legislative, legal, and regulatory risks and conditions specific to the countries in which it operates. in addition to grainger's u.s. operations, which in 2023 generated approximately 82% of its consolidated net sales, grainger operates its business principally through wholly owned subsidiaries in canada, mexico, and the u.k., and its majority-owned subsidiary in japan.
the wide array of laws, regulations and standards in each jurisdiction where grainger operates, include, but are not limited to, advertising, marketing and internet regulations (including the use of proprietary or third-party "cookies" in connection with grainger's ecommerce platforms), anti-bribery and corruption laws, competition and antitrust regulations, data protection (including, because grainger accepts credit cards, the payment card industry data security standard), data privacy (including in the u.s., the california consumer privacy act and privacy rights act,
in japan, the act on protection of personal information, and in the european union, the general data protection regulation) and cybersecurity requirements (including protection of information and incident responses), environmental protection laws, currency exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions, health and safety laws, import and export compliance (including the u.s. commerce department's export administration regulations, trade sanctions promulgated by the office of foreign asset control and anti-money laundering regulations), intellectual property laws, labor laws (including federal and state wage and hour laws), product compliance or safety laws, supplier regulations regarding the sources of supplies or products, tax laws (including as to u.s. taxes on international subsidiaries), unclaimed property laws and laws, regulations and standards applicable to other commercial matters. moreover, grainger is also subject to audits and inquiries in the normal course of business.
failure to comply with any of these laws, regulations and standards could result in civil, criminal, monetary and non-monetary fines, penalties, remediation costs and/or significant legal fees as well as potential damage to grainger's reputation. changes in these laws, regulations and standards, or in their interpretation, could increase the cost of doing business, including, among other factors, as a result of increased investments in technology and the development of new operational processes. furthermore, while grainger has implemented policies and procedures and provides training designed to facilitate compliance with these laws, regulations and standards, there can be no assurance that team members, contractors, suppliers, vendors, or other third parties will not violate such laws, regulations and standards or grainger's policies. any such failure to comply or violation could individually or in the aggregate materially adversely affect grainger's financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
grainger is subject to a number of rules and regulations related to its government contracts, which may result in increased compliance costs and potential liabilities.
grainger's contracts with federal, state and local government entities are subject to various and changing regulations related to procurement, formation and performance. in addition, grainger's government contracts may provide for termination, reduction or modification by the government at any time, with or without cause. from time to time, grainger is subject to governmental or regulatory investigations or audits related to its compliance with these rules and regulations. violations of these terms, rules, and regulations could result in fines, criminal sanctions, the inability to participate in existing or future government contracting and other administrative sanctions. any such penalties could result in damage to grainger's reputation, increased costs of compliance and/or remediation and could adversely affect grainger's financial condition and results of operations.
in conducting its business, grainger may become subject to legal proceedings or governmental investigations, including in connection with product liability or product compliance claims if people, property or the environment are harmed by grainger's products or services.
grainger is, and from time to time may become, party to a number of legal proceedings or governmental investigations for alleged violations of laws, rules or regulations. grainger also may be subject to disputes and proceedings incidental to its business, including product-related claims for personal injury or illness, death, environmental or property damage or other commercial disputes, and the types of matters discussed in note 14 to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8: financial statements and supplementary data of this form 10-k. the defense of any proceedings may require significant expenses and divert management's time and attention, and grainger may be required to pay damages that could individually or in the aggregate materially adversely affect its financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. in addition, any insurance or indemnification rights that grainger may have with respect to such matters may be insufficient or unavailable to protect grainger against potential loss exposures. grainger also may be requested or required to recall products or take other actions. grainger's reputation could also be adversely affected by any resulting negative publicity.
tax changes could affect grainger's effective tax rate and future profitability.
grainger's future results could be adversely affected by changes in the effective tax rate as a result of grainger's relative overall profitability and the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in tax legislation, the results of the examination of previously filed tax returns, and continuing assessment of grainger's tax exposures. the organization for economic cooperation and development (oecd) pillar two guidelines address the increasing digitization of the global economy, re-allocating taxing rights among countries. the oecd continues to release additional guidance and countries are implementing legislation with widespread adoption of the pillar two framework expected during 2024. grainger continues to evaluate the pillar two framework and its potential impact on future periods. based on information to date, grainger does not expect either the pillar one or two proposals to materially impact the company's global income tax liability or effective tax rate.
the potential impacts of climate change on grainger's suppliers, product offerings, operations, facilities and customers are accelerating and uncertain. increased public awareness and concern regarding global climate change have resulted in, and may continue to result in, more international, federal, and/or state or other stakeholder requirements or expectations that have resulted in, and could continue to result in, more restrictive or expansive standards, such as stricter limits on greenhouse gas emissions or more prescriptive reporting of environmental, social, and governance metrics. there continues to be a lack of consistent climate change legislation and standards, which creates economic and regulatory uncertainty. new laws, regulations and enforcement could strain grainger's suppliers and result in increased compliance-related costs, which could result in higher product costs that are passed to grainger. new or changing environmental laws and regulations could also increase grainger's operating costs, including through higher utility and transportation costs, and grainger is unable to predict the potential impact such laws and regulations could have on its financial condition and results of operations. in addition, the potential physical risks of climate change may impact the availability and cost of materials and natural resources, sources and supply of energy and product demand, impact grainger's transportation costs and supply chain network, and could increase grainger's operating costs. natural disasters as a result of climate change at locations where grainger, its suppliers or customers operate could cause disruptions to grainger's operations, which could adversely affect sales and could negatively impact grainger's business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. if environmental laws, regulations, and other stakeholder requirements impose significant operational restrictions or compliance requirements upon grainger or its suppliers, products, or customers, or grainger's operations are disrupted due to physical impacts of climate change, grainger's business, capital expenditures, financial condition, results of operations, reputation, and competitive position could be negatively impacted.
credit and liquidity risks changes in grainger's credit ratings and outlook may reduce access to capital and increase borrowing costs.
grainger's credit ratings are based on a number of factors, including the company's financial strength and factors outside of grainger's control, such as conditions affecting grainger's industry generally or the introduction of new rating practices and methodologies. grainger cannot provide assurances that its current credit ratings will remain in effect or that the ratings will not be lowered, suspended or withdrawn entirely by the rating agencies. if rating agencies lower, suspend or withdraw the ratings, the market price or marketability of grainger's securities may be adversely affected. in addition, any change in ratings could make it more difficult for the company to raise capital on favorable terms, impact the company's ability to obtain adequate financing, and result in higher interest costs for the company's existing credit facilities or on future financings.
grainger has incurred indebtedness and may incur additional indebtedness, which could adversely affect cash flow, decrease business flexibility, or prevent grainger from fulfilling its obligations.
as of december 31, 2023, grainger's consolidated indebtedness was approximately $2.3 billion. the company's indebtedness could, among other things, limit grainger's ability to respond to rapidly changing business and economic conditions, require the company to dedicate a substantial portion of its cash flows to the payment of principal and interest on its indebtedness, reducing the funds available for other business purposes, and make it more difficult to satisfy the company's financial obligations as they come due during periods of adverse economic and industry conditions.
the agreements governing grainger's debt agreements and instruments contain representations, warranties, affirmative, negative and financial covenants, and default provisions. grainger's failure to comply with these restrictions and obligations could result in a default under such agreements, which may allow grainger's creditors to accelerate the related indebtedness. any such acceleration could have a material adverse effect on grainger's business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and its ability to obtain financing on favorable terms in the future.
in addition, grainger may in the future seek to raise additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, refinancing of indebtedness, share repurchases or other general corporate purposes. grainger's ability to obtain additional financing will be dependent on, among other things, the company's financial condition, prevailing market conditions and numerous other factors beyond the company's control. such additional financing may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all. any inability to obtain financing when needed could materially adversely affect the company's business, financial condition or results of operations.

recent events inflationary cost environment and macroeconomic pressures the global economy continues to experience volatile disruptions including to the commodity, labor and transportation markets, arising from a combination of geopolitical events and various economic and financial factors. these disruptions have affected the company's operations and may continue to affect the company's business, financial condition and results of operations.
the company continues to monitor economic conditions in the u.s. and globally, and the impact of macroeconomic pressures, including repercussions from changes in interest rates, currency exchange fluctuations, inflation and a potential recession on the company's business, customers, suppliers and other third parties. as a result of continued inflation, the company has implemented strategies designed to mitigate certain adverse effects of higher costs while also remaining market price competitive. historically, the company's broad and diverse customer base and the nondiscretionary nature of the company's products to its customers has helped to insulate it from the effects of recessionary periods in the industrial mro market. the full extent and impact of these conditions are uncertain and cannot be predicted at this time.

results of operations in this section, grainger utilizes non-gaap measures where it believes it will assist users of its financial statements in understanding its business. non-gaap measures exclude certain items affecting comparability that can affect the year-over-year assessment of operating results and other one-time items that do not directly reflect ongoing operating results. for further information regarding the company's non-gaap measures including reconciliations to the most directly comparable gaap measures, see below "non-gaap measures."
gross profit                                                         6,496                                                       5,849                                                        11.1                                                        39.4                                                        38.4
(1) for further information regarding the company's disaggregated revenue, see note 2 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in part ii, item 8: financial statements and supplementary data of this form 10-k.
(2) daily net sales are adjusted for the difference in u.s. selling days relative to the prior year period. daily, organic constant currency net sales excludes the results of e &amp; r industrial sales, inc. in the comparable prior year period post date of divestiture and excludes the impact on net sales due to year-over-year foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. there were 254 and 255 sales days in the full year 2023 and 2022, respectively. for further information regarding the company's non-gaap measures, including reconciliations to the most directly comparable gaap measures, see below "non-gaap measures."
gross profit of $6,496 million for the year ended december 31, 2023 increased $647 million, or 11%, and gross profit margin of 39.4% increased 100 basis points compared to the same period in 2022. both segments contributed to margin expansion in 2023. for further discussion on the company's gross profit, see the segment analysis section below.
operating earnings of $2,565 million for the year ended december 31, 2023 increased $350 million, or 16%. adjusted operating earnings of $2,591 million increased $397 million, or 18%, compared to the same period in 2022 due to higher gross profit dollars, partially offset by increased sg&a consistent with sales growth in 2023. adjusted operating margin improved 130 basis points in 2023.
income tax expense of $597 million and $533 million represents effective tax rates of 23.9% and 24.8% for the years ended december 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. the company's effective tax rate was positively impacted by increased benefits related to stock compensation in 2023.
non-gaap measures grainger utilizes non-gaap measures where it believes it will assist users of its financial statements in understanding its business. non-gaap measures exclude certain items affecting comparability that can affect the year-over-year assessment of operating results and other one-time items that do not directly reflect ongoing operating results. organic net sales results exclude the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and results of certain divested businesses in the comparable prior year period post date of divestiture. adjusted results including adjusted sg&a, adjusted operating earnings, adjusted net earnings and adjusted diluted eps exclude certain non-recurring items, including restructuring charges, asset impairments, gains and losses associated with business divestitures and other non-recurring, infrequent or unusual gains and losses from the company's most directly comparable reported u.s. generally accepted accounting principles (gaap) results. the company believes its non-gaap measures provide meaningful information to assist investors in understanding financial results and assessing prospects for future performance as they provide a better baseline for analyzing the ongoing performance of its businesses by excluding items that may not be indicative of core operating results. grainger's non-gaap financial measures should be considered in addition to, and not as a replacement for or as a superior measure to its most directly comparable gaap measure and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.
business divestitures in the fourth quarter of 2023, grainger divested e & r industrial sales, inc. (e&r) and recorded a one-time pre-tax loss on the divestiture of $26 million in sg&a. in the fourth quarter of 2022, grainger divested cromwell's wholly owned software business in the u.k. and recorded a one-time pre-tax gain on the divestiture of $21 million in sg&a. the company does not expect these business exits to have a material effect on its future results of operations.
the following table provides a reconciliation of reported net sales growth from the prior year period in accordance with gaap to the company's non-gaap measures daily net sales and daily, organic constant currency net sales for the twelve months ended december 31, 2023 (in millions of dollars):

gross profit                                                    5,546                               4,951                     12.0
gross profit of $5,546 million for the year ended december 31, 2023 increased $595 million, or 12%, and gross profit margin of 41.8% increased 120 basis points compared to the same period in 2022. the increase was driven by freight and supply chain efficiencies in 2023.
gross profit                                                      864                                 817                      5.7
net sales of $2,916 million for the year ended december 31, 2023 increased $129 million, or 5%, and on a daily constant currency basis, increased 10% compared to the same period in 2022. the increase was due to sales growth of 10%, driven by customer acquisition for the segment and enterprise growth at monotaro, partially offset by declining sales at zoro and non-core, consumer-like customers for the segment. sales growth was offset by unfavorable currency exchange of 5% due to changes in the exchange rate between the u.s. dollar and the japanese yen.
gross profit of $864 million for the year ended december 31, 2023 increased $47 million, or 6%, and gross profit margin of 29.6% increased 30 basis points compared to the same period in 2022. the increase was driven by freight efficiencies at monotaro partially offset by unfavorable product mix at zoro in 2023.
sg&a of $631 million for the year ended december 31, 2023 increased $37 million, or 6%, compared to the same period in 2022. the increase was primarily due to higher marketing and payroll and benefit expenses to support the continued growth of the segment in 2023. sg&a leverage decreased 30 basis points compared to the same period in 2022.
operating earnings of $233 million for the year ended december 31, 2023 increased $10 million, or 4%, compared to the same period in 2022. the increase was due to higher gross profit dollars, partially offset by higher sg&a in 2023.
liquidity and capital resources grainger believes its current balances of cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and availability under its revolving credit facilities will be sufficient to meet its liquidity needs for the next twelve months. the company expects to continue to invest in its business and return excess cash to shareholders through cash dividends and share repurchases, which it plans to fund through cash flows generated from operations. grainger also maintains access to capital markets and may issue debt or equity securities from time to time, which may provide an additional source of liquidity.
sources of liquidity cash and cash equivalents as of december 31, 2023 and 2022, grainger had cash and cash equivalents of $660 million and $325 million, respectively. the increase in cash was primarily due to cash flows from operations and favorable year-over-year working capital, partially offset by higher capital expenditures and higher volume of share repurchases. the company had approximately $1.9 billion in available liquidity as of december 31, 2023.
cash flows the following table shows the company's cash flow activity for the periods presented (in millions of dollars):
operating activities                                                    $2,031                              $1,333
investing activities                                                     (422)                               (263)
financing activities                                                   (1,278)                               (972)
net cash provided by operating activities was $2,031 million and $1,333 million for the year ended december 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. the increase compared to the prior year period was due to higher earnings and favorable changes in year-over-year working capital largely driven by sales growth, inventory management and timing of cash receipts and payments.
net cash used in investing activities was $422 million and $263 million for the year ended december 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. the increase compared to the prior year period primarily reflects increased u.s. supply chain investments including capacity, automation and sustainability initiatives, as well as technology enhancements across the company.
net cash used in financing activities was $1,278 million and $972 million for the year ended december 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. the increase compared to the prior year period was primarily due to higher treasury stock repurchases.
debt grainger maintains a debt ratio and liquidity position that provides flexibility in funding working capital needs and long-term cash requirements. grainger has various sources of financing available. for further information regarding the company's debt instruments and available financing sources, see note 5 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in part ii, item 8: financial statements and supplementary data of this form 10-k.
total debt as a percent of total capitalization was 40.1% and 45.9%, as of december 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.
credit ratings grainger receives ratings from two independent credit ratings agencies: moody's investor service (moody's) and standard & poor's (s&p). both credit rating agencies currently rate the company's corporate credit at investment grade.
the following table summarizes the company's credit ratings as of december 31, 2023:
uses of liquidity internally generated cash flows are the primary source of grainger's working capital and growth initiatives, including
capital expenditures. the company expects to continue to return excess capital to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.
working capital working capital as of december 31, 2023 was $3,078 million, an increase of $214 million compared to $2,864 million as of december 31, 2022. the increase was primarily due to sustained sales growth and inventory management driven by supply chain efficiencies compared to the prior year period. as of december 31, 2023 and 2022, the ratio of current assets to current liabilities was 2.8 and 2.5, respectively.
capital expenditures in fiscal 2023, the company's capital expenditures were $445 million and $256 million for the years ended december 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. capital project spending for 2024 is expected to be in the range of $400 and $500 million. this includes continued supply chain capacity expansion and technology enhancements across the company. with grainger's strategic plan to expand its distribution network, the company completed land purchases in oregon and texas in the second and fourth quarters of 2023 for construction of approximately 500,000 and 1,200,000 square foot distribution centers (dc), respectively.
share repurchases for the years ended december 31, 2023 and 2022, grainger repurchased shares of its common stock in the open market for $850 million and $603 million, respectively. share repurchases are executed at prices the company determines appropriate subject to various factors, including market conditions and the company's financial performance and may be affected through accelerated share repurchase programs, open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions, including through rule 10b5-1 plans. share repurchases for 2024 are expected to be in the range of $900 and $1,100 million.
commitments and other contractual obligations the company's material cash requirements include the following commitments and other contractual obligations.
debt as of december 31, 2023, the company had outstanding debt obligations with varying maturities for an aggregate principal amount of $2,337 million, with $34 million payable within 12 months. total future interest payments associated with the company's outstanding debt obligations was $1,729 million, with $87 million payable within 12 months.
purchase obligations grainger had purchase obligations of approximately $1,453 million as of december 31, 2023, which includes approximately $1,175 million payable within 12 months. grainger's purchase obligations primarily include commitments to purchase inventory, uncompleted additions to property, buildings and equipment and other goods and services. purchase obligations are made in the normal course of business to meet operating needs and are primarily noncancelable.
leases the company has lease arrangements for certain properties, buildings and equipment (including branches, warehouses, dcs and office space). as of december 31, 2023, the company had fixed operating lease payment obligations of $492 million, with $87 million payable within 12 months.
critical accounting estimates the preparation of grainger's consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are in conformity with gaap and the company's discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the company's management to make assumptions and estimates that affect the reported amounts. the company considers an accounting policy to be a critical estimate if: (1) it involves assumptions that are uncertain when judgment was applied, and (2) changes in the estimate assumptions, or selection of a different estimate methodology, could have a significant impact on grainger's consolidated financial position and results. while the company believes the assumptions and estimates used are reasonable, the company's management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii, item 8: financial statements and supplementary data of this form 10-k describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the company's consolidated financial statements.
inventories company inventories primarily consist of merchandise purchased for resale and are valued at the lower of cost or market value. the majority of the company's inventory is accounted for using the last-in, first-out (lifo) method. market value is based on an analysis of inventory trends including, but not limited to, reviews of inventory levels, sales and cost information and on-hand quantities relative to the sales history for the product and shelf-life. the company's methodology for estimating whether adjustments are necessary is continually evaluated for factors including significant changes in product demand, liquidation or disposition history values and market conditions such as inflation and other acquisition costs, including freight and duties. if business or economic conditions change, estimates and assumptions may be adjusted as deemed appropriate.
goodwill and other intangible assets the company evaluates goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually during the fourth quarter and more frequently if impairment indicators exist. the fair value of reporting units is calculated primarily using the discounted cash flow method and utilizing value indicators from a market approach to evaluate the reasonableness of the resulting fair values. the company's indefinite-lived intangible assets are primarily trade names. the fair value of trade names is calculated primarily using the relief-from-royalty method, which estimates the expected royalty savings attributable to the ownership of the trade name asset.
the estimates used to calculate the fair values of reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets involve the use of significant assumptions, estimates and judgments and changes from year to year based on operating results, market conditions, macroeconomic developments and other factors. changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and impairment for each reporting unit and indefinite-lived intangible asset. for further information on the company's goodwill and other intangible assets, see note 4 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii, item 8: financial statements and supplementary data of this form 10-k.
contingencies and legal matters the company is subject to various claims and legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business, the outcomes of which are inherently uncertain. the company accrues for costs relating to litigation claims and other contingent matters when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the assessment can be reasonably estimated. for further information on the company's contingencies and legal matters, see note 14 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii, item 8: financial statements and supplementary data of this form 10-k.

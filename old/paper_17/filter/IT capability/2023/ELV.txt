item 1a. risk factors.
in evaluating our business, the risks described below, as well as the other information contained in this annual report on form 10-k, should be carefully considered. any one or more of such risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and stock price and could cause our actual results of operations and financial condition to vary materially from past or anticipated future results of operations and financial condition. additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect us.
business risks if we fail to appropriately predict, price for and manage healthcare costs, the profitability of our products and services could decline, which could materially adversely affect our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.
our profitability depends on accurately predicting and pricing healthcare costs and our ability to manage future healthcare costs through medical management, product design, negotiation of favorable provider contracts and underwriting criteria. total healthcare costs are affected by the type, number and cost of individual services rendered. numerous factors affecting healthcare costs may adversely affect our ability to predict and manage healthcare costs, and may impact our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations. these factors include, among others, changes in healthcare practices, demographic characteristics including the aging population, short and long-term risks associated with our members' lifestyle decisions, medical cost inflation, increased labor costs, evolution of new technologies, drugs and treatments, increased cost of individual services, increased number and cost of prescription drugs, clusters of high cost cases, increased use of services, including resulting from pandemics, large-scale medical emergencies, increasing natural disasters in connection with climate change and other public health crises, new mandated benefits and treatment guidelines and changes to other regulations impacting our business.
slight differences between predicted and actual medical costs or utilization rates as a percentage of premium revenues can result in significant changes in our results of operations. generally, our premiums on commercial policies and medicaid contracts are fixed for a 12-month period and are determined based on data from several months prior to the commencement of the premium period. our revenue from medicare policies is based on bids submitted to cms six months prior to the start of the contract year. cms has explicit gain and loss margin requirements within the bids, as well as contract-specific federal mlr annual requirements. accordingly, the costs we incur in excess of our benefit cost projections cannot be recovered in the contract year through higher premiums. existing medicaid contract rates are often established by the applicable state, and our actual costs may exceed those rates. many factors, including those discussed above, may cause actual costs to exceed those estimated and reflected in our commercial premiums and medicare and medicaid bids.
although federal and state premium and risk adjustment mechanisms could help offset health benefit costs above our projections if the assumptions we use to set our premium rates are significantly different than actual results, our results of operations and financial condition could still be adversely affected. the reserves that we establish for health insurance policy benefits and other contractual rights and benefits are based on assumptions concerning a number of factors, including trends in healthcare costs, expenses, general economic conditions and other factors. to the extent the actual claims experience is unfavorable compared to our underlying assumptions, our incurred losses would increase, and future earnings could be adversely affected.
in addition to the challenge of managing healthcare costs, we face pressure to contain premium rates. our customers may renegotiate their contracts to seek to contain their costs or may move to a competitor to obtain more favorable premiums. further, federal and state regulatory agencies may restrict or prevent entirely our ability to implement changes in premium rates. a limitation on our ability to increase or maintain our premium or reimbursement levels or a significant loss of membership resulting from our need to increase or maintain premium or reimbursement levels could adversely affect our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.
we expanded our participation in the public exchange markets for 2023 and as a result, offered individual public exchange products in most of the rating regions in which we operate. we further expanded in a limited number of additional counties in 2024. any variation from our expectations regarding acuity, enrollment levels, adverse selection, or other assumptions utilized in setting premium rates could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows, and may require further adjustments to our rates and participation in public exchanges going forward.
a significant reduction in the enrollment in our health benefits programs, pharmacy services or diversified products and services, particularly in states where we have large regional concentrations, could have an adverse effect on our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.
a significant reduction in the number of enrollees in our health benefits programs, pharmacy services, or diversified products and services could adversely affect our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations. factors that have contributed, and may continue to contribute to, a reduction in enrollment include: reductions in workforce by existing customers, a reduction in medicaid membership due to the end of the temporary suspension of eligibility redetermination for medicaid recipients in response to the covid-19 pandemic, a general economic upturn that results in fewer individuals being eligible for medicaid programs, a general economic downturn that results in business failures and high unemployment rates, employers no longer offering certain healthcare coverage as an employee benefit or electing to offer coverage on a voluntary, employee-funded basis, participation on public exchanges, federal and state regulatory changes, failure to obtain new customers or retain existing customers, premium increases and benefit changes, our exit from a specific market, negative publicity and news coverage, and failure to attain or maintain nationally recognized accreditations.
the states in which we operate with the largest concentrations of revenues include california, virginia, new york, ohio, indiana, florida, texas and georgia. due to this concentration of business in these states, we are exposed to potential losses resulting from the risk of state-specific or regional economic downturns impacting these states. if any such negative economic conditions do not improve, we may experience a reduction in existing and new business, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.
a cyber-attack or other privacy or data security incident could result in an unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential information, cause a loss of data, disrupt our operations, give rise to remediation or other expenses, expose us to liability under federal, state and international laws, and subject us to litigation and investigations, which could have an adverse effect on our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.
as part of our normal operations, we collect, store, process, retain and analyze certain sensitive and confidential information, including personal information subject to privacy, security and data breach notification requirements. some of the data we process, store and transmit is outside of the u.s. due to the structure of our information technology systems and our internal business operations. we are subject to a variety of continuously evolving federal, state and international laws and rules regarding collection, dissemination, receipt, maintenance, protection, use, transmission, disclosure, privacy, confidentiality, security, availability, integrity, creation, processing and disposal of sensitive or confidential information that, depending on the specific business and intended data use, include without limitation, hipaa's privacy and security rules, hipaa's hitech rule, the gramm-leach-bliley act, the general data protection regulation and numerous state laws governing personal information, including the california consumer privacy act, as amended by the california privacy rights act. we have programs in place to detect, contain and respond to data, privacy and security incidents and provide employee awareness training regarding phishing, malware, and other risks to protect against privacy and cybersecurity incidents. our facilities and systems, and those of our third-party service providers, including our business associates, are regularly the target of, and may be vulnerable to, cyber-attacks, security breaches, acts of vandalism, computer viruses, misplaced or lost data, programming and/or human errors, negligent or wrongful conduct by associates or others with permitted access to our systems and information, or other threats.
we cannot ensure that we or our third-party service providers will be able to identify, prevent or contain the effects of cyber-attacks or other cybersecurity risks that bypass our or their security measures or disrupt our or their information technology systems or business. hardware, software or applications we develop or procure from third parties may contain defects in design, manufacturer defects or other problems that could unexpectedly compromise information security. in addition, because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable, disrupt or degrade service or sabotage systems change frequently, are becoming increasingly sophisticated, and may not immediately produce signs of intrusion, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques, timely discover or counter them or implement adequate preventative measures. viruses, worms, malicious software programs or other unauthorized methods of acquiring data may be used to attack our systems or otherwise exploit any security vulnerabilities which may cause system disruptions or shutdowns, or may cause personal, proprietary or confidential information to be disclosed, misappropriated or compromised. we have business continuation and resiliency plans which are maintained, updated and tested regularly in an effort to ensure successful containment and remediation of potential disruptions or cyber events. cybersecurity and the continued development and enhancement of our
controls, processes and practices designed to protect our systems, computers, software, data and networks from attack, damage and unauthorized access remain a priority for us.
we have been, and may in the future be, subject to litigation and governmental investigations related to cyber-attacks, privacy incidents and security breaches. any such future litigation or governmental investigation could divert the attention of management from the operation of our business, result in reputational damage and have a material adverse impact on our business, cash flows, financial condition, and results of operations. moreover, our programs to detect, contain, and respond to data security incidents as well as contingency plans and insurance coverage for potential liabilities of this nature may not be sufficient to cover all claims and liabilities.
noncompliance with any privacy, security or data protection laws and regulations, or any security breach, cyber-attack or cyber-security breach, and any incident involving the misappropriation, theft, loss or other unauthorized disclosure or use of, or access to, sensitive or confidential information, whether by us or by one of our third-party service providers or their vendors, could require us to expend significant resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures and to remediate any damage. in addition, this could negatively affect our operations, cause system disruptions, damage our reputation, cause membership losses and contract breaches, and could also result in regulatory enforcement actions, material fines and penalties, litigation or other actions that could have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.
if we fail to responsibly use and protect data, or if such data is found to be inaccurate or unreliable, our business and customers could suffer adverse consequences.
we use de-identified and aggregated data to create analytic models designed to predict, and potentially improve, outcomes and patient care. the collection, maintenance, protection, use, transmission, disclosure and disposal of sensitive personal information is regulated at the federal, state, international and industry levels and requirements are also imposed on us and vendors through contracts with clients. we are also subject to various other consumer protection laws that regulate our communications with customers. certain of our businesses are also subject to the payment card industry data security standard, which is designed to protect credit card account data as mandated by payment card industry entities. in addition, more jurisdictions are regulating the collection, use and transfer of data across borders. these laws, rules, regulations and contractual requirements are subject to change, and the regulatory environment surrounding data protection and privacy is generally becoming more onerous. compliance with existing or new privacy, security or data protection laws, regulations and requirements may result in increased enforcement, costs, and may constrain or require us to alter our business model or operations.
further, if the data we rely upon to run our businesses is found to be inaccurate or unreliable or if we fail to maintain or protect our information systems and data integrity effectively, we could experience failures in our technology products; lose existing customers; have difficulty attracting new customers; experience problems in determining medical cost estimates and establishing appropriate pricing; have difficulty preventing, detecting and controlling fraud; have disputes with customers, physicians and other healthcare professionals; become subject to regulatory sanctions, penalties, investigations or audits; incur increases in operating expenses; or suffer other adverse consequences.
there are various risks associated with participating in medicare and medicaid programs, including dependence upon government funding and the timing of payments, compliance with government contracts and increased regulatory oversight.
we contract with various federal and state agencies, including cms, to provide managed health benefits services, such as medicare advantage, medicare part d, medicare supplement, medicaid, tanf, spd, ltss, chip, medicaid expansion programs and various specialty programs, products and services. we also provide various administrative services for other entities offering medical and/or prescription drug plans to their medicaid or medicare eligible members, and we offer employer group waiver plans which provide medical and/or prescription drug coverage to retirees. we also participate in programs in several states for the care of dual-eligible members. regulatory reform initiatives or changes in existing laws or regulations applicable to these programs, or their interpretations, are difficult to predict and could have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.
revenues from the medicare and medicaid programs are dependent, in whole or in part, upon annual funding from the federal government and/or applicable state governments, and base premium rates paid by each state or federal agency differ depending upon a combination of factors such as defined upper payment limits, a member's health status, age, gender, county
or region, benefit mix, member eligibility category and risk scores. future rates may be affected by continued government efforts to contain costs and federal and state budgetary constraints. certain state contracts are subject to cancellation in the event of the unavailability of state funds. additionally, ongoing cms changes to the calculation of risk in the medicare advantage program may impact our federal funding. the federal government or any state in which we operate could decrease rates paid to us, pay us less than the amount necessary to keep pace with our cost trends, cancel our contracts retroactively or seek an adjustment to previously negotiated rates. in addition, various states' medicare-medicaid dual-eligible plans are still subject to uncertainty surrounding payment rates and other requirements, which could affect where we seek to participate in these programs. an unexpected reduction in payments, inadequate government funding or significantly delayed payments for these programs may adversely affect our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.
other potential risks associated with medicare advantage and medicare part d plans include increased medical or pharmaceutical costs, data corrections identified as a result of ongoing auditing and monitoring activities, potential uncollectability of receivables resulting from processing and/or verifying enrollment, inadequacy of underwriting assumptions, inability to receive and process correct information (including inability due to systems issues by the federal government, the applicable state government or us), uncollectability of premiums from members and limited enrollment periods. actual results may be materially different than our assumptions and estimates and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
our contracts with cms and state governmental agencies contain certain provisions regarding data submission, risk adjustment, provider network and directory maintenance, quality measures, claims payment, timely and accurate processing of appeals and grievances, oversight of service providers, encounter data, continuity of care, call center performance and other requirements specific to federal and state program regulations. we have been subject in the past, and may again be in the future, to administrative actions, fines, penalties, liquidated damages or retrospective adjustments in payments made to our health plans as a result of a failure to comply with these requirements, which has impacted, and in the future could impact our profitability. we have experienced retroactive rate adjustments by certain state medicaid agencies in the past, and such rate adjustments may occur in the future. further, our state medicaid contracts have not always been renewed, we have not always been awarded new contracts as a result of the competitive procurement process, and in some cases, we have lost members under existing contracts as a result of a post-award challenge by unsuccessful bidders, each of which could take place again in the future and have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.
the star rating system utilized by cms to evaluate medicare advantage plans may have a significant effect on our revenue, as higher-rated plans tend to experience increased enrollment, plans with a star rating of 4.0 or higher are eligible for quality-based bonus payments and plans with a star rating of 5.0 can market to and enroll members year-round. cms continues to change its rating system to make achieving and maintaining a 4.0 or higher star rating more difficult. cms released our 2024 star ratings in october 2023, which will be used to determine our medicare advantage plans' quality bonus payments in 2025. based on our membership at september 1, 2023, 34% of our medicare advantage members were in plans with 2024 star ratings of at least 4.0 stars, compared to 64% of our medicare advantage members being in plans with 2023 star ratings of at least 4.0 stars based on our membership at september 1, 2022. this change in our 2024 star ratings is expected to negatively impact our medicare quality bonus payments, plan level rebates and operating revenue beginning in 2025 and our enrollment may be negatively impacted as consumers seek higher rated plans. further, if we do not improve our star ratings, or if quality-based bonus payments are reduced or eliminated, we will experience further negative impact on our revenues and the benefits that our plans can offer, which could materially and adversely affect the marketability of our plans, our membership levels, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. similarly, if we fail to meet or exceed any performance standards imposed by state medicaid programs in which we participate, we may not receive performance-based bonus payments or may incur penalties.
in addition, our failure to comply with federal and state healthcare laws and regulations applicable to our participation in medicaid and medicare programs, including those directed at preventing fraud, abuse and discrimination, could result in investigations, litigation, fines, restrictions on, or exclusions from, program participation, or the imposition of corporate integrity agreements or other agreements with a federal or state governmental agency, any of which could adversely impact our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.
we are periodically subject to government audits, including cms radv audits of our medicare advantage plans to validate diagnostic data, patient claims and financial reporting, and audits of our medicare part d plans by the medicare part d recovery audit contractor ("rac"), as well as state medicaid rac programs. in addition, we routinely perform ordinary
course reviews of, among other things, our medicare advantage data submitted to cms. these governmental audits, or changes in how these audits are conducted, including changes that may result from the final radv audit rule that was issued in 2023, and internal reviews, could result in reports or disclosures for prior, current or future filing years to federal or state regulatory agencies, submission of data corrections, and/or significant adjustments in payments made to our health plans and future medicare advantage bids, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. additionally, state regulators are increasingly conducting audits to assess the quality of services we provide to our medicare members. if we fail to report and correct errors discovered through our own auditing procedures, during a radv or rac audit or during state regulatory audits, or otherwise fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations, we could be subject to fines, civil penalties or other sanctions, which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to participate in these programs, and on our financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.
our medicare and medicaid contracts are also subject to various mlr rules, including minimum mlr thresholds, rebate requirements and audits, which could adversely affect our membership and revenues if any of our state medicare or medicaid plans do not meet an applicable minimum mlr threshold. if a medicare advantage, mmp or medicare part d contract pays minimum mlr rebates for three consecutive years, it will become ineligible to enroll new members. if a medicare advantage or medicare part d contract pays such rebates for five consecutive years, it will be terminated by cms.
a change in our healthcare product mix may impact our profitability.
our healthcare products that involve greater potential risk generally tend to be more profitable than administrative services products and those healthcare products where the employer groups assume the underwriting risks. individuals and small employer groups are more likely to purchase our higher-risk healthcare products because such purchasers are generally unable or unwilling to bear greater liability for healthcare expenditures. typically, government-sponsored programs also involve our higher-risk healthcare products. a shift of enrollees from more profitable products to less profitable products could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.
if we fail to develop and maintain satisfactory relationships with hospitals, physicians, pharmacy service providers and other healthcare providers, our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.
our profitability is dependent in part upon our ability to contract on favorable terms with hospitals, physicians, pharmacy services providers and supply chain partners and other healthcare providers. these partners may elect not to contract with us, and the failure to secure or maintain cost-effective contracts on competitive terms may result in a loss of membership or higher medical costs, which could adversely affect our business. in addition, consolidation among healthcare providers, accountable care organizations practice management companies, and other organizational structures that physicians, hospitals and other care providers choose, as well as the ability of larger employers to contract directly with providers, has changed and may continue to change the way that these providers interact with us and may alter the competitive landscape overall. such organizations or groups of physicians may compete directly with us or be owned by one of our competitors, which may impact our relationship with these providers or affect the way that we price our products and estimate our costs. such competition may require us to incur costs to change our operations, which could adversely affect our business, cash flows, financial condition, and results of operations. in addition, price transparency initiatives, such as the health plan transparency rule, may impact our ability to obtain or maintain favorable contract terms. for example, beginning in 2021, hospitals were required to publish online payer-specific negotiated charges for each item or service the hospital provides.
our inability to contract with providers, or if providers attempt to use their market position to negotiate more favorable contracts or place us at a competitive disadvantage, or the inability of providers to provide adequate care, could adversely affect our business. in addition, we do not have contracts with all providers that render services to our members and, as a result, may not have a pre-established agreement about the amount of compensation those out-of-network providers will accept for the services they render. state and federal laws, such as the no surprises act, define the compensation that must be paid to out-of-network providers in certain scenarios, and related litigation has lessened the weight of the qualifying payment amount during independent dispute resolution processes, which may result in an increase in rates we must pay to out-of-network providers. both our lack of contracts with certain providers and the development of new federal and state laws could result in significant litigation or arbitration proceedings, to the extent a provider attempts to obtain payment from our members for the difference between the amount we have paid and the amount they have charged, or other increases in rates paid to out-of-network providers.
we are dependent on the success of our relationships with third parties for various services and functions.
we contract with various third parties to perform certain functions and services and provide us with certain information technology systems. certain of these third parties provide us with significant portions of our business infrastructure and operating requirements. for example, a single vendor can provide to us a wide range of technology infrastructure services, such as end user (help desk and field support), data center, mainframe, payment card handling, storage and database services and multi-cloud management services, and we are subject to the risks of any operational failure, termination or other restraints in such an arrangement. we could become overly dependent on key vendors, which could cause us to lose core competencies. a termination of our agreements with, or disruption in the performance of, one or more of these service providers could result in service disruptions or unavailability, reduced service quality and effectiveness, increased or duplicative costs or an inability to meet our obligations to our customers. in addition, we may also have to seek alternative service providers, which may be unavailable or only available on less favorable contract terms. any of these outcomes could adversely affect our business, reputation, cash flows, financial condition and operating results.
our pharmacy services business would be adversely affected if we are unable to contract on favorable terms with third-party vendors, including pharmaceutical manufacturers. we delegate certain pbm services, including, but not limited to, claims adjudication, pharmacy network administration, rebate administration, advanced home delivery back-end dispensing, and customer service, to cvs pursuant to the cvs agreement. if cvs fails to provide pbm services as contractually required, we may not be able to meet the full demands of our customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation and results of operations. additionally, we may not maintain favorable terms and conditions, including financial terms, to compete in the market. for additional information on the cvs agreement, see "business - product and service descriptions," in part i, item 1 of this annual report on form 10-k.
the failure to effectively maintain and upgrade our information systems, or the availability and integrity of our data, could adversely affect our business.
our business depends significantly on effective information systems, and we have many different information systems for our various businesses, including those that we have acquired as a result of our merger and acquisition activities. our information systems require an ongoing investment, commitment of significant resources to maintain and enhance existing systems, and development of new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology, emerging cyber-security risks, changing customer preferences, evolving industry and regulatory standards and legal requirements, including as a result of the aca, the health plan transparency rule, the 2021 appropriations act and federal data interoperability regulations. in addition, we may obtain significant portions of our systems-related or other services from independent third parties (and their vendors), which may make our operations vulnerable if such third parties fail to perform and oversee adequately. further, unauthorized third parties present additional risk, including by propagating misinformation related to products, business and the health industry.
failure to adequately implement, consolidate, integrate, streamline, maintain and upgrade effective and efficient information systems with sufficiently advanced technological capabilities could result in investigations, audits, fines and penalties, competitive and cost disadvantages to us compared to our competitors, could divert management's time, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. failure or disruption of our performance of, or our ability to perform, key business functions, including as a result of the unavailability or cyber-attack of our information technology systems or those of third parties (including cloud service providers), could decrease response times, lower levels of service satisfaction and harm our reputation. our systems interface with and depend on third-party systems and we could experience service denials if demand for such service exceeds capacity, or these systems fail or experience interruption. despite our adoption and continued enhancement of business continuity and disaster recovery strategies, there is no guarantee that such efforts will be effective, which could interrupt the functionality of our information technology systems or those of third parties. our failure to implement adequate business continuity and disaster recovery strategies could significantly reduce our ability to provide products and services to our customers and clients, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
in addition, connectivity amongst technologies is becoming increasingly important, with recent trends bringing greater consumer engagement in healthcare; therefore, the pace at which our customers will need enhanced technologies with sophisticated applications for mobile interfaces will quicken. if the information systems we rely upon to run our business were found to be inaccurate or unreliable or if we fail to adequately maintain, upgrade, enhance, expand and protect our information systems, security controls and data integrity effectively, we could experience problems in determining medical
cost estimates and establishing appropriate pricing and reserves, have disputes with customers and providers, lengthen the pace of integration activities or otherwise delay the launch of acquired products, face regulatory problems, including sanctions and penalties, incur increases in operating expenses or suffer other adverse consequences, including a decrease in membership. further, as connectivity of technologies advances, artificial intelligence and business processes supported by large language models that are used by businesses and consumers may not operate as expected or may lead to unintentional bias, discrimination and/or data exposure.
we are subject to risks associated with pandemics, like the covid-19 pandemic, as well as other extreme events, large-scale medical emergencies and public health crises, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition and financial performance.
a pandemic or other large-scale medical emergency or public health crisis, such as the covid-19 pandemic, referred to collectively as "public health crises," may cause illness, death, quarantines, business and school shutdowns, reductions in business activity, travel and financial transactions, unemployment, inflation, labor shortages, supply chain interruptions and overall economic and financial market instability. the following are some risks that we could experience as a result of future public health crises, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations:
•increased healthcare costs due to higher utilization rates of medical facilities and services and behavioral health services, increased labor costs resulting from labor shortages and increases in medical expenses and associated hospital and pharmaceutical costs, including testing, treatment and the administration of vaccines and other therapeutics and costs due to care deferred during the public health crisis, which may lead to additional care resulting from missed treatments.
•increased estimation uncertainty for our claims liability, as well as decreased predictability of medicare and medicaid rates due to changes in utilization of medical facilities and services, medical expenses and other costs.
•a reduction in enrollment in our health benefits, pharmacy services, or other healthcare services and products or a change in membership mix to less profitable lines of business by existing customers due to reductions in workforce and other impacts of an economic downturn.
•cash flow volatility or shortfalls caused by delayed, delinquent or non-collectable payments.
if any future public health crisis occurs and continues for a prolonged period, these risks could be exacerbated, and cause further impact to our business and operations. additionally, other extreme events such as natural disasters, war, terrorism, increased crime, and civil unrest could create public health crises or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations. in the event of a public health crises, we may need to make temporary policy changes, such as waiving various medical requirements, assisting with replacement medications, transferring prescriptions and expanding our help line. natural disasters, such as wildfires, hurricanes and snow and ice storms, have impacted and may in the future impact our customers, associates, facilities and third-party vendors located in the affected area. furthermore, climate change could result in certain types of natural disasters occurring more frequently or with more intense effects, which could have a long-term impact on general economic conditions and the health benefits and pharmacy services industries in particular.
legal, regulatory and public policy risks we are subject to significant government regulation, and changes or proposed changes in the regulation of our business by federal and state regulators may adversely affect our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations and the market price of our securities.
we are subject to significant state and federal regulation associated with many aspects of our business, including, but not limited to, licensing, premiums, marketing activities, provider contracting, access and payment standards, and corporate governance and financial reporting matters, as described in greater detail in part i, item 1, "business-regulation" in this annual report on form 10-k. further, the integration into our business of entities that we acquire, or the expansion of our business into new businesses or jurisdictions, may affect the way in which existing laws and rules apply to us.
changes to existing laws, rules and regulations or judicial interpretation, application or enforcement thereof, or development of new laws, rules, regulatory interpretations or judgments could force us to change how we conduct our business, affect the products and services we offer (and where we offer them), restrict revenue and enrollment growth,
increase our costs, including operating, healthcare technology and administrative costs, restrict our ability to obtain new product approvals and implement changes in premium rates, and require enhancements to our compliance infrastructure and internal controls environment, which could adversely impact our business and results of operations. in addition, legislative and/or regulatory policies or proposals that seek to manage the healthcare industry or otherwise impact our business may cause the market price of our securities to decrease, even if such policies or proposals never become effective. in particular, further regulations and modifications to the aca and laws and regulations stemming from the aca could impact the market for our products, funding for aca programs, the regulations applicable to us and the fees and taxes payable by us and otherwise affect our business and future operations, some of which may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
we are required to obtain and maintain insurance, licenses and other regulatory approvals to market certain of our products and services, to increase prices for certain regulated products and services and to consummate some of our acquisitions and dispositions. delays in obtaining or failure to obtain or maintain these approvals, as well as future regulatory action by state or federal authorities, could have a material adverse effect on the profitability or marketability of our health benefits, pharmacy services, healthcare and other products and services or on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. in addition, changes in government regulations or policies that apply to government-sponsored programs such as medicare and medicaid including, among other things, reimbursement levels, quality-based bonus payment determinations, eligibility and redetermination requirements, benefit coverage requirements and additional governmental participation, could also adversely affect our business, cash flows, financial condition, and results of operations. the annual redetermination process for medicaid recipients was temporarily suspended in response to the covid-19 pandemic; however, pursuant to the 2023 appropriations act, states began removing ineligible beneficiaries from their medicaid programs starting april 1, 2023. where states allow certain programs to expire or have not opted for medicaid expansion under the aca or to expand managed care programs, we have experienced reduced medicaid enrollment and reduced growth opportunities. if future modifications to laws and regulations significantly reduce medicaid enrollment, our medicaid business will be negatively impacted.
we have experienced past assessments under state or federal insolvency or guaranty association laws applicable to insurance companies, hmos and other payers, and may experience assessments in the future if, for example, premiums established by other companies for their health insurance products, including certain long-term care products, are inadequate to cover their costs. any such assessment could expose us to the risk of paying a portion of an impaired or insolvent insurance company's claims through state guaranty associations. we are not currently able to estimate our potential financial obligations, losses or the availability of offsets associated with potential guaranty association assessments; however, any significant increase in guaranty association assessments could have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flows, financial condition, and results of operations.
we expect state legislatures will continue to focus on healthcare delivery and financing issues, including actions to reduce or limit increases to premium payments, provider billing protections, greater access to care and broader reforms of state health insurance markets. state ballot initiatives could also be put to voters that could materially impair our operating environment. if enacted into law, these state proposals and actions could have a material adverse impact on our business, cash flows, operations or financial condition. additionally, state legislative actions and litigation could impact erisa pre-emption. further, in the past, congress has considered, and may consider in the future, various forms of managed care reform legislation which, if adopted, could fundamentally alter the treatment of coverage decisions under erisa, including limiting erisa's preemptive effect on state laws, and other laws and could increase our costs, expose us to expanded liability, permit greater state regulation on our operations, or require us to revise the ways in which we conduct business.
we are subject to various risks associated with our international operations.
as we expand and operate our business outside of the u.s., we are presented with different challenges, including challenges in adapting to new markets, languages, business, labor and cultural practices, regulatory environments and local civil unrest or political controversy. adapting to these challenges could require us to devote significant senior management attention and other resources. if we are unable to successfully manage our international operations, our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. in the future, we may acquire or operate new businesses outside of the u.s., increasing our exposure to these risks.
certain of our subsidiaries operate internationally and are subject to regulation in the jurisdictions in which they are organized or conduct business related to, among other things, local and cross border taxation, intellectual property,
investment, management control, labor, anti-fraud, anti-corruption and privacy and data protection, which vary by jurisdiction. in addition, we are subject to u.s. laws that regulate the conduct and activities of u.s.-based businesses operating abroad, such as the foreign corrupt practices act. violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines, criminal sanctions against us, our officers or associates, restrictions or outright prohibitions on the conduct of our business and significant reputational harm and could adversely affect our ability to market our products and services, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
we face risks related to litigation.
we are, and may in the future be, a party to a variety of legal actions that may affect our business, such as administrative charges before government agencies, employment and employment discrimination-related suits, employee benefit claims, breach of contract actions, tort claims and intellectual property-related litigation. in addition, because of the nature of our business, we are subject to a variety of legal actions relating to our business operations, including the design, administration and offering of our products and services. these could include claims relating to the denial or limitation of health benefits; federal and state false claims act laws; dispensing of drugs associated with our pharmacy services business; professional liability claims arising out of the delivery of healthcare and related services to the public; development or application of medical policies and coverage and clinical guidelines; medical malpractice actions; allegations of anti-competitive and unfair business activities; provider disputes over reimbursement and contracts; provider tiering programs; narrow networks; termination of provider contracts; the recovery of overpayments from providers; fee-based business; disputes over co-payment calculations; reimbursement of out-of-network claims; the failure to disclose certain business practices; the failure to comply with various state or federal laws, including but not limited to, erisa and the mental health parity act; and customer audits and contract performance, including government contracts. these actions or proceedings could result in substantial costs to us, require management to spend substantial time focused on litigation, result in negative media attention, and may adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
we are also involved in, or may in the future be party to, pending or threatened litigation incidental to the business we transact or arising out of our operations, including, but not limited to, breaches of security and violations of privacy requirements, shareholder actions, compliance with federal and state laws and regulations (including qui tam or "whistleblower" actions), or sales and acquisitions of businesses or assets. from time to time, we are involved as a party in various governmental investigations, audits, reviews and administrative proceedings, including challenges relating to the award of government contracts. these investigations, audits and reviews include routine and special investigations by state insurance departments, various federal regulators including cms and the hhs office of inspector general, state attorneys general, the department of justice, and various offices of the u.s. attorney general. following an investigation, we may be subject to civil or criminal fines, penalties, and other sanctions if we are determined to be in violation of applicable laws or regulations. liabilities that may result from these actions could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, results of operations and financial condition.
recent court decisions and legislative activity may increase our exposure for any of these types of claims. in some cases, substantial non-economic (including injunctive relief), treble or punitive damages may be sought. our international footprint also subjects us to additional potential disputes or differing interpretations related to contractual rights, tax positions, and regulatory oversight. some liabilities and damages may not be covered by the insurance we carry, insurers may dispute coverage, or the amount of insurance may not be enough to cover the damages awarded. in addition, insurance coverage for all or certain forms of liability may become unavailable or prohibitively expensive in the future. any adverse judgment against us resulting in such damage awards could result in negative publicity and have an adverse effect on our cash flows, results of operations and financial condition.
there are various risks associated with providing health benefits and other healthcare diversified products and services.
we continue to evolve our business to offer products and services beyond traditional health insurance, including digital health technology, pharmacy services, behavioral and clinical care services, which subjects us to litigation and regulatory risks that are different from our traditional product and services offerings and may materially affect our exposure to other risks.
the direct provision of healthcare services by certain of our subsidiaries involves risks of additional litigation brought against us or our associates for alleged malpractice or professional liability claims arising out of the delivery of healthcare and related services. in addition, liability may arise from maintaining healthcare premises that serve the public. behavioral
health services may also raise the risk profile of our business given the critical and sensitive nature of the services provided. in addition, we are, to a certain extent, self-insured with regard to litigation risks, including claims of medical malpractice against our affiliated physicians and us, and it is possible that the level of actual losses will significantly exceed the liabilities recorded for our estimates of the probable costs resulting from self-insured matters. the defense of any actions may result in significant expenses, and if we fail to maintain adequate insurance coverage for these liabilities, or if such insurance is not available, the resulting costs could adversely affect our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations. as we become more involved in direct care delivery and the provision of other services, such as crisis management services, there will be an increased possibility of litigation.
additionally, many states in which certain of our subsidiaries operate limit the practice of medicine to licensed individuals or professional organizations comprised of licensed individuals. business corporations generally may not exercise control over the medical decisions of physicians, and we are not licensed to practice medicine. rules and regulations relating to the practice of medicine, fee-splitting between physicians and referral sources, and similar issues vary from state to state, and any enforcement actions by governmental officials alleging non-compliance with these rules and regulations could adversely affect our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations. further, in certain states we are required to use professional corporations that are not affiliates, which exposes us to risk in the event the physician owners of those professional corporations take actions that are in breach of the contractual obligations that exist between us.
we rely on agreements with customers, confidentiality agreements with associates and third parties, and our trademarks, trade secrets, copyrights and patents to protect our proprietary rights. these legal protections and precautions may not prevent misappropriation of our proprietary information. litigation and misappropriation of our proprietary information could hinder our ability to market and sell products and services, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. further, certain of our businesses use, develop or sell software products that may contain unexpected design defects or may encounter unexpected complications during integration or when used with other technologies utilized by the customer. a failure of these products to operate as intended and in a seamless fashion with other products could also materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.
our pharmacy services business and pharmacy related operations are subject to risks and uncertainties that are in addition to those we face in our core healthcare business.
we provide pharmacy services and are responsible to regulators and our customers for the delivery of those pharmacy services that we contract to provide. our pharmacy services business is subject to the risks inherent in the dispensing, packaging, fulfillment and distribution of pharmaceuticals and other healthcare products, including exposure to liabilities and reputational harm related to purported dispensing and other operational errors by us or our pharmacy services suppliers. any failure by us or one of our pharmacy services suppliers to adhere to the laws and regulations applicable to the dispensing of pharmaceuticals could subject our pharmacy services business to civil and criminal penalties.
our pharmacy services business is subject to federal and state laws and regulations that govern its relationships with pharmaceutical manufacturers, physicians, pharmacies and customers, including without limitation, federal and state anti-kickback laws, beneficiary inducement laws, consumer protection laws, erisa, hipaa and laws related to the operation of mail-service pharmacies, as well as an increasing number of licensure, registration and other laws and accreditation standards that impact the business practices of a pharmacy services business. in addition, the pharmacy services business, which conducts business through home delivery and specialty pharmacies, is subject to federal and state laws and regulations, including those of state boards of pharmacy, individual state-controlled substance authorities, the u.s. drug enforcement agency and the u.s. food and drug administration. growth of our home delivery and specialty pharmacy business subjects us to an increase in licensure requirements, and regulatory and operational risks as our pharmacy services business becomes more vertically integrated. also, we and our third-party vendors may be subject to certain registration requirements and state and federal laws related to the practice of pharmacy. noncompliance with applicable laws and regulations by us or our third-party vendors could have material adverse effects on our business, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and reputation.
federal and state legislatures and regulators also regularly consider new laws and regulations and changes to existing regulations and policies for the industry that could materially affect current industry practices and our business, including the regulation implemented by hhs in november 2020 related to drug manufacturer rebates, spread pricing contract arrangements, the pricing of pharmaceuticals, the 2021 appropriations act and potential new regulations regarding rebates, fees from pharmaceutical companies, the development and use of formularies and other utilization management tools, the use
of average wholesale prices or other pricing benchmarks, pricing for specialty pharmaceuticals, limited access to networks and pharmacy network reimbursement methodologies and reporting requirements. recent case law, such as the 2020 u.s. supreme court reinstatement of an arkansas law regulating pbms, as well as industry publications like the 2021 naic white paper on the topic, may increase and impact greater state regulation of pbms. further, various government agencies have conducted and continue to conduct investigations and studies into certain pharmacy services practices, which have resulted and may in the future result in pbms agreeing to civil penalties, including the payment of money and entry into corporate integrity agreements, or could materially and adversely impact the pharmacy services business model.
we are a party to license agreements with the bcbsa that entitle us to the exclusive and, in certain areas, non-exclusive use of the bcbs names and marks in our geographic territories. the termination of these license agreements or changes in the terms and conditions of these license agreements could adversely affect our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.
our license agreements with the bcbsa contain certain requirements and restrictions regarding our operations and our use of the bcbs names and marks, and failure to comply with those requirements could result in a termination of the license agreements. the license agreements may be modified by the bcbsa, which could have a material adverse effect on our future expansion plans or results of operations. further, bcbs licensees have certain requirements to perform administrative services for members of other bcbs licensees. as of december 31, 2023, we provided health benefit and other healthcare services to approximately 35 million blue cross and/or blue shield enrollees. if we or another bcbs licensee are not in compliance with all legal requirements or are unable to perform administrative services as required, this could have an adverse effect on our members and our ability to maintain our licenses, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.
upon the occurrence of an event causing termination of the license agreements, we would no longer have the right to use the bcbs names and marks or to sell bcbs health insurance products and services in one or more of our service areas. furthermore, the bcbsa would be free to issue a license to use the bcbs names and marks in these service areas to another entity. our existing bcbs members would be provided with instructions for obtaining alternative products and services licensed by the bcbsa. we believe that the bcbs names and marks are valuable identifiers of our products and services in the marketplace.
upon termination of either license agreement, the bcbsa would have the right to impose a "re-establishment fee" upon us, which would be used in part to fund the establishment of a replacement blue cross and/or blue shield licensee in the vacated service area. the fee is set at $98.33 per licensed enrollee. if the re-establishment fee was applied to our total blue cross and/or blue shield enrollees of approximately 35 million as of december 31, 2023, we would be assessed approximately $3 billion by the bcbsa. as a result, termination of the license agreements would have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations. for more information on the bcbsa license agreements, including requirements, restrictions and termination events set forth in these license agreements, see part i, item 1, "business - bcbsa licenses" of this annual report on form 10-k.
indiana law, other applicable laws, our articles of incorporation and bylaws, and provisions of our bcbsa license agreements may prevent or discourage takeovers and business combinations that our shareholders might consider to be in their best interest.
indiana law, other applicable laws and regulations and provisions in our articles of incorporation and bylaws may delay, defer, prevent or render more difficult a takeover attempt that our shareholders might consider to be in their best interests. for instance, they may prevent our shareholders from receiving the benefit from any premium to the market price of our common stock offered by a bidder in a takeover context or adversely affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our stock.
the insurance holding company system acts and certain health statutes of the states in which our insurance company or hmo subsidiaries are regulated restrict the ability of any person to obtain control of an insurance company or hmo without prior regulatory approval. further, the indiana business corporation law contains business combination provisions that, in general, prohibit for five years any business combination with a beneficial owner of 10% or more of our common stock unless the holder's acquisition of the stock was approved in advance by our board of directors.
our articles of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could have anti-takeover effects and may delay, defer or prevent a takeover attempt that our shareholders might consider to be in their best interests. our articles of incorporation
provide that no person may beneficially own shares of voting capital stock beyond specified ownership limits, except with the prior approval of a majority of the "continuing directors." the ownership limits, which may not be exceeded without the prior approval of the bcbsa, are the following: (1) for any institutional investor (as defined in our articles of incorporation), one share less than 10% of our outstanding voting securities; (2) for any non-institutional investor (as defined in our articles of incorporation), one share less than 5% of our outstanding voting securities; and (3) for any person, one share less than the number of shares of our common stock or other equity securities (or a combination thereof) representing a 20% ownership interest in us.
in addition, our articles of incorporation and bylaws: divide our board of directors into three classes serving staggered three-year terms (which is required by our license agreements with the bcbsa); permit our board of directors to determine the terms of and issue one or more series of preferred stock without further action by shareholders; restrict the maximum number of directors and the ability to increase that number; limit the ability of shareholders to remove directors; impose restrictions on shareholders' ability to fill vacancies on our board of directors; impose advance notice requirements for shareholder proposals and nominations of directors to be considered at meetings of shareholders; prohibit shareholders from amending certain provisions of our bylaws; and impose restrictions on who may call a special meeting of shareholders.
strategic risks we face competition in many of our markets, and if we fail to adequately adapt to changes in our industry and develop and implement strategic growth opportunities, our ability to compete and grow may be adversely affected.
as a health company offering health benefits, pharmacy services and other diversified products and services, we operate in a highly competitive industry that is subject to significant changes from and competition due to legislative reform, business consolidations, new strategic alliances, new market entrants, aggressive marketing practices, technological advancements and changing market practices such as increasing usage of telehealth. we also must respond to pricing and other actions taken by existing competitors and potentially disruptive new entrants in the public exchanges and in our other lines of business. these factors have produced and will continue to produce significant pressures on our profitability and membership. furthermore, decisions to buy our products and services are increasingly made or influenced by consumers, through means such as direct purchasing (for example, medicare advantage plans) and insurance exchanges that allow individual choice, or by large employers that may increasingly be able to contract directly with providers. to compete effectively under these unique market pressures in the consumer-driven marketplace, we are required to develop and deliver innovative and potentially disruptive products and services to satisfy evolving market demands.
in addition, the pharmacy services industry is highly competitive, and our pharmacy services business unit is subject to competition from national, regional and local pharmacy services providers, other insurers, health plans, large retail pharmacy chains, large retail stores, supermarkets, mail order and web pharmacies, discount cards and specialty pharmacies. strong competition within the pharmacy services business has generated greater demand for lower product and service pricing and enhanced product and service offerings. our inability to maintain positive trends, contract on favorable terms with cvs, wholesalers or pharmaceutical manufacturers for, among other things, rebates, discounts, administrative fees and inventory purchase prices, or a failure to identify and implement new ways to mitigate pricing pressures, could negatively impact our ability to attract or retain customers, negatively impact our margins and have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. in addition, legislative reforms such as the regulation issued by hhs related to rebates and the 2021 appropriations act, which requires reporting of plan spending, the cost of plan pharmacy benefits, enrollee premiums and any manufacturer rebates received by the plan or issuer, may adversely affect our competitive position, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.
in order to achieve our long-term financial targets, we need to not only grow our profitable medical membership, but also continue to profitably grow and diversify our sources of revenue and earnings, including through the increased sale of our pharmacy services, both integrated and external, other healthcare services and products, and specialty products, such as dental, vision and other supplemental products, expand our products and services and establish new cost of care solutions. if we are unable to execute our strategy with respect to the growth of our healthcare, pharmacy services, and other diversified products and services businesses, or if we are unable to acquire or develop and successfully manage new opportunities that further our strategic objectives and differentiate our products and services from our competitors, our ability to profitably grow our business could be adversely affected.
we are currently dependent on the non-exclusive services of independent agents and brokers in the marketing of our healthcare products, particularly with respect to individuals, seniors and certain group customers. we face intense competition for the services and allegiance of these independent agents and brokers, who may also market the products of our competitors. our relationship with our brokers and independent agents could be adversely impacted by changes in our business practices to address legislative changes, including potential reductions in commissions and consulting fees paid to agents and brokers. we cannot ensure that we will be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors for these services or that competitive pressures faced by us will not materially and adversely affect our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.
for additional information, see "business - competition" in part i, item 1 of this annual report on form 10-k.
we have built a significant portion of our current business through mergers and acquisitions, joint ventures, strategic alliances and investments, and although we expect to pursue such opportunities in the future, we are subject to risks resulting from such business combinations.
the following are some of the risks associated with mergers, acquisitions, divestitures, joint ventures and strategic alliances and investments, referred to collectively as business combinations, that could have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations:
•some business combinations may not achieve anticipated revenues, earnings or cash flow, business opportunities, synergies, growth prospects or other anticipated benefits;
•we may assume liabilities that were not disclosed to us, or which were underestimated, and which could lead to legal challenges, investigations and enforcement actions, and we may not be able to adequately recover from sellers or insurance carriers for such assumed liabilities;
•we may experience difficulties in integrating business combinations, including into our internal control environment and culture, be unable to integrate business combinations successfully or as quickly as expected and be unable to realize anticipated economic, operational and other benefits in a timely manner or at all;
•business combinations and proposed business combinations that are not completed could disrupt our ongoing business, lead to the incurrence of significant fees, distract management, result in the loss of key associates, divert resources, result in tax costs or inefficiencies and make it difficult to maintain our current business standards, controls, information technology systems, policies and procedures;
•it system vulnerabilities may be more acute for it systems associated with recently acquired businesses, and we may be unable to address such vulnerabilities, inadequacies, or failures immediately after acquiring a business, which could undermine integration activities, delay launch of acquired products, and increase infrastructure risk;
•we may finance future business combinations by issuing common stock for some or all of the purchase price, which could dilute the ownership interests of our shareholders;
•we may compete with other firms, some of which may have greater financial and other resources, to acquire attractive companies;
•we may experience disputes with or competition from our partners or former partners in our strategic alliances, investments and joint ventures, which could result in litigation or a loss of business;
•we may not be able to obtain the required regulatory approval for an acquisition in a timely manner, if at all, and government actions such as actions by the ftc or doj, may affect our ability to complete our business combinations; and
•future business combinations may make it difficult to comply with the requirements of the bcbsa and lead to a risk that our bcbsa license agreements may be terminated.
we face intense competition to attract and retain associates. further, managing key executive succession and retention is critical to our success.
our success depends on our ability to attract, develop and retain qualified associates, including those with diverse backgrounds, experience and skill sets, to operate and expand our business. we face intense competition for experienced and highly skilled associates, and we may be unable to attract and retain such associates or competition among potential associates may result in increasing salaries. adverse changes to our corporate culture could harm our business operations and our ability to retain key associates and executives. an inability to retain existing associates or attract additional associates could have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.
in addition, if we are unable to attract, retain and effectively manage the succession plans for key associates and executives, including our president and chief executive officer, our business, results of operations and future performance could be adversely affected. we may have difficulty in replacing key executives because of the limited number of qualified individuals with the breadth of skills and experience required to operate and successfully expand our business. the succession plans we have in place for members of our senior management and employment arrangements with certain key executives do not guarantee that the services of our senior executives will continue to be available to us or that we will be able to attract, transition and retain suitable successors.
restrictions on our ability to obtain funds from our regulated subsidiaries could limit our ability to repurchase shares, pay dividends and meet our obligations and materially adversely affect our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.
as a holding company, we are dependent on dividends and administrative expense reimbursements from our subsidiaries. among other restrictions, state insurance and hmo laws restrict the ability of most of our regulated subsidiaries to pay dividends. in some states, we have made special undertakings that may further limit the ability of our regulated subsidiaries to pay dividends. our ability to repurchase shares, pay dividends to our shareholders and meet our obligations, including paying operating expenses and debt service on our outstanding and future indebtedness, will depend upon the receipt of dividends from our subsidiaries. an inability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends in the future in an amount sufficient for us to meet our financial obligations may materially adversely affect our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.
in addition, most of our regulated subsidiaries are subject to minimum capital requirements and periodic financial reporting that require them to report their results of risk-based capital calculations to the departments of insurance and the naic. failure to maintain these minimum standards could subject our regulated subsidiaries to corrective action, including state supervision or liquidation. we are also a party to license agreements with the bcbsa which contain additional minimum capital and liquidity requirements. changes to existing minimum capital requirements could further restrict the ability of our regulated subsidiaries to pay dividends and adversely affect our business.
our regulated subsidiaries are subject to state laws and regulations that require diversification of their investment portfolios and limit the amount of investments in certain investment categories. failure to comply with these laws and regulations might cause investments exceeding regulatory limitations to be treated as non-admitted assets for purposes of measuring statutory surplus and risk-based capital, and in some instances, require the sale of those investments.
we have substantial indebtedness outstanding and may incur additional indebtedness in the future, which could adversely affect our ability to pursue desirable business opportunities and to react to changes in the economy or our industry.
our debt service obligations require us to use a portion of our cash flow to pay interest and principal on debt instead of for other corporate purposes, including funding future expansion. we are exposed to interest rate risk to the extent of our variable rate indebtedness. increases in interest rates have increased our cost of borrowing, and volatility in u.s. and global financial markets could impact our access to, or further increase the cost of, financing. if our cash flow and capital resources are insufficient to service our debt obligations, we may be forced to seek extraordinary dividends from our subsidiaries, sell assets, seek additional equity or debt capital or restructure our debt. however, these measures might be unsuccessful or inadequate to meet scheduled debt service obligations or may not be available on commercially reasonable terms.
we may also incur future debt obligations that might subject us to restrictive covenants that could affect our financial and operational flexibility. our breach or failure to comply with any of these covenants could result in a default under our credit facilities or other indebtedness. if we default under our credit agreement, the lenders could cease to make further extensions of credit or cause all of our outstanding debt obligations under our credit agreement to become immediately due and payable, together with accrued and unpaid interest. if the indebtedness under our notes or our credit agreement or our other indebtedness is accelerated, we may be unable to repay or finance the amounts due, on commercially reasonable terms, or at all.
a downgrade in our credit ratings could have an adverse effect on our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.
claims-paying ability, financial strength and debt ratings by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations are important factors in establishing the competitive position of insurance and health benefits companies. we believe our strong
credit ratings are an important factor in marketing our products to customers. in addition, if our credit ratings are downgraded or placed under review, our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted by limitations on future borrowings and a potential increase in our borrowing costs. each of the ratings organizations reviews our ratings periodically, and there can be no assurance that our current ratings will be maintained in the future.
the value of our intangible assets may become impaired.
as of december 31, 2023, we had $36 billion of goodwill and other intangible assets, representing 33% of our total consolidated assets. in accordance with applicable accounting standards, we periodically evaluate our goodwill and other intangible assets for potential impairment, using assumptions and judgments regarding the estimated fair value of our reporting units. estimated fair values might be significantly different if other reasonable assumptions and estimates were to be used. if estimated fair values are less than the carrying values of goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives in future impairment tests, or if significant impairment indicators are noted relative to other intangible assets subject to amortization, we may be required to record impairment losses against future income.
the value we place on intangible assets may be adversely impacted if existing or future business combinations fail to perform in a manner consistent with our assumptions. in addition, from time to time we divest businesses, and any such divestiture could result in significant asset impairment and disposition charges, including those related to goodwill and other intangible assets. further, the estimated value of our reporting units may be impacted because of business decisions we make associated with any future changes to laws and regulations, which could unfavorably affect the carrying value of certain goodwill and other intangible assets and result in impairment charges in future periods. any future evaluations requiring an impairment of our goodwill and other intangible assets could materially affect our results of operations and shareholders' equity which could, in turn, negatively impact our debt ratings or potentially impact our compliance with existing debt covenants.
the value of our investments is influenced by varying economic and market conditions, and a decrease in value may result in a loss charged to income.
we maintain a significant investment portfolio of cash equivalents and short-term and long-term investments in a variety of securities, which are subject to general credit, liquidity, market and interest rate risks. as a result, we may experience a reduction in value or loss of our investments, which may have a negative adverse effect on our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition. changes in the economic environment, including periods of increased volatility in the securities markets, recent changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates, can increase the difficulty of assessing investment impairment and increase the risk of potential impairment of these assets. there is continuing risk that declines in the fair value of our investments may occur and material impairments may be charged to income in future periods, resulting in recognized losses.
general risks we also face other risks that could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations, which include:
•adverse securities and credit market conditions, which could impact our ability to meet liquidity needs;
•any requirement to restate financial results in the event of inappropriate application of accounting principles;
•changes in tax laws and regulations or uncertainty in the interpretation of tax laws and regulations that could impact the future value of our deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities, or result in significant one-time charges in the current or future taxable years;
•a significant failure of our internal control over financial reporting;
•negative publicity, including as a result of governmental investigations, adverse media coverage and political debate surrounding industry regulation;
•provider fraud that is not prevented or detected and impacts our medical costs or those of self-insured customers; and
•failure of our corporate governance policies or procedures.
item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.
(in millions, except per share data or as otherwise stated herein)
references to the terms "we," "our," "us," "elevance health" or the "company" used throughout this management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ("md&a") refer to elevance health, inc., an indiana corporation, and, unless the context otherwise requires, its direct and indirect subsidiaries. references to the "states" include the district of columbia and puerto rico, unless the context otherwise requires.
this md&a should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k.
this md&a generally discusses 2023 and 2022 items and year-over-year comparisons between 2023 and 2022. a detailed discussion of 2021 items and year-over-year comparisons between 2022 and 2021 that are not included in this annual report on form 10-k can be found in "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" in part ii, item 7 included in exhibit 99.1 to our quarterly report on form 10-q for the three months ended september 30, 2023.
overview elevance health is a health company with the purpose of improving the health of humanity. we are one of the largest health insurers in the united states in terms of medical membership, serving approximately 47 million medical members through our affiliated health plans as of december 31, 2023. we are an independent licensee of the blue cross and blue shield association ("bcbsa"), an association of independent health benefit plans. we serve our members as the blue cross licensee for california and as the blue cross and blue shield ("bcbs") licensee for colorado, connecticut, georgia, indiana, kentucky, maine, missouri (excluding 30 counties in the kansas city area), nevada, new hampshire, new york (in the new york city metropolitan area and upstate new york), ohio, virginia (excluding the northern virginia suburbs of washington, d.c.) and wisconsin. in a majority of these service areas, we do business as anthem blue cross and anthem blue cross and blue shield. we also conduct business through arrangements with other bcbs licensees, as well as other strategic partners. in addition, we serve members in numerous states as amerigroup, freedom health, healthsun, mmm, optimum healthcare, simply healthcare and/or wellpoint. we are licensed to conduct insurance operations in all 50 states, the district of columbia and puerto rico through our subsidiaries. through various subsidiaries, we also offer pharmacy services through our carelonrx business, and other healthcare related services as carelon insights, carelon health, carelon behavioral health and caremore.
as we announced in 2022, we are organizing our brand portfolio into the following core go-to-market brands:
•wellpoint - we are uniting select non-bcbsa licensed medicare, medicaid and commercial plans under the wellpoint name; and
•carelon - this brand brings together our healthcare related services and capabilities, including our carelonrx and carelon services businesses, under a single brand name.
our branding strategy reflects the evolution of our business from a traditional health insurance company to a lifetime, trusted health partner. given this evolution, we reviewed and modified how we manage our business, monitor our performance and allocate resources, and made changes to our reportable segments beginning in the first quarter of 2023. we now report our results of operations in the following four reportable segments: health benefits (aggregates our previously reported commercial & specialty business and government business segments), carelonrx, carelon services (previously included in our other segment) and corporate & other (our businesses that do not individually meet the quantitative
thresholds for an operating segment, as well as corporate expenses not allocated to our other reportable segments). during the fourth quarter of 2023, we moved our carelon global solutions international businesses from the corporate & other reportable segment to the carelon services reportable segment. all prior period reportable segment information has been reclassified for comparability to conform to the current presentation.
our results of operations discussed throughout this md&a are determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("gaap"). we also calculate operating gain and operating margin to further aid investors in understanding and analyzing our core operating results. operating gain is calculated as total operating revenue less benefit expense, cost of products sold and operating expense. operating margin is calculated as operating gain divided by operating revenue. our definition of operating gain and operating margin may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. we use these measures as a basis for evaluating segment performance, allocating resources, forecasting future operating periods and setting incentive compensation targets. this information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for income before income tax expense, net income or fully-diluted shareholders' earnings per share ("eps") prepared in accordance with gaap. for additional details on operating gain, see our "reportable segments results of operations" discussion included in this md&a. for a reconciliation of reportable segment operating revenue to the amounts of total revenue included in the consolidated statements of income and a reconciliation of reportable segment operating gain to income before income tax expense, see note 20, "segment information," of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k.
our operating revenue consists of premiums, product revenue, and service fees. premium revenue is generated from risk-based contracts where we indemnify our policyholders against costs for covered health and life insurance benefits. product revenue represents services performed by carelonrx for unaffiliated pharmacy customers and includes ingredient costs (net of any rebates or discounts), including co-payments made by or on behalf of the customer, and service fees. unaffiliated pharmacy customers include our fee-based employer groups that contract with carelonrx for pharmacy services and external customers outside of the health plans we own. service fees are generated from our fee-based customers for the processing of transactions or network discount savings realized, revenues from our medicare processing business and revenues from other health-related businesses, including care management programs and miscellaneous other income.
our benefit expense primarily includes costs of care for health services consumed by our risk-based members, such as outpatient care, inpatient hospital care, professional services (primarily physician care) and pharmacy benefit costs. all four components are affected both by unit costs and utilization rates. unit costs include the cost of outpatient medical procedures per visit, inpatient hospital care per admission, physician fees per office visit and prescription drug prices. utilization rates represent the volume of consumption of health services and typically vary with the age and health status of our members and their social and lifestyle choices, along with clinical protocols and medical practice patterns in each of our markets. a portion of benefit expense recognized in each reporting period consists of actuarial estimates of claims incurred but not yet paid by us. any changes in these estimates are recorded in the period the need for such an adjustment arises. while we offer a diversified mix of managed care products and services through our managed care plans, our aggregate cost of care can fluctuate based on a change in the overall mix of these products and services. our managed care plans include: preferred provider organizations; health maintenance organizations; point-of-service plans; traditional indemnity plans and other hybrid plans, including consumer-driven health plans; and hospital only and limited benefit products.
we classify certain quality improvement costs as benefit expense. quality improvement activities are those designed to improve member health outcomes, prevent hospital readmissions and improve patient safety. they also include expenses for wellness and health promotion provided to our members. these quality improvement costs may be comprised of expenses incurred for: (i) medical management, including care coordination and case management; (ii) health and wellness, including disease management services for such conditions as diabetes, high-risk pregnancies, congestive heart failure and asthma management and wellness initiatives like weight-loss programs and smoking cessation treatments; and (iii) clinical health policy, such as identification and use of best clinical practices to avoid harm, identifying clinical errors and safety concerns, and identifying potential adverse drug interactions.
our cost of products sold represents the cost of pharmaceuticals dispensed by carelonrx for our unaffiliated pharmacy customers (net of rebates or discounts), including any co-payments made by or on behalf of the customer, per-claim administrative fees for prescription fulfillment and certain direct costs related to sales and administration of customer contracts.
our operating expenses consist of fixed and variable costs. examples of fixed costs are depreciation, amortization and certain facilities expenses. certain variable costs, such as premium taxes, vary directly with premium volume. commission expense generally varies with premium or membership volume. other variable costs, such as salaries and benefits, do not vary directly with changes in premium but are more aligned with changes in membership or services provided to our customers. the acquisition or loss of a significant block of business would likely impact staffing levels and thus, associated compensation expense. other variable costs include professional and consulting expenses and advertising. other factors can impact our administrative cost structure, including systems efficiencies, inflation and changes in productivity.
our results of operations depend in large part on our ability to accurately predict and effectively manage healthcare costs through effective contracting with providers of care to our members, product pricing, medical management and health and wellness programs, innovative product design and our ability to maintain or achieve improvement in our centers for medicare and medicaid services star ratings. several economic factors related to healthcare costs, such as regulatory mandates of coverage as well as direct-to-consumer advertising by providers and pharmaceutical companies, have a direct impact on the volume of care consumed by our members. the potential effect of escalating healthcare costs, any changes in our ability to negotiate competitive rates with our providers and any regulatory or market-driven restrictions on our ability to obtain adequate premium rates to offset overall inflation in healthcare costs, including increases in unit costs and utilization resulting from the aging of the population and other demographics, the impact of epidemics and pandemics, as well as advances in medical technology and pharmaceuticals, may impose further risks to our ability to profitably underwrite our business and may have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.
we intend to expand through a combination of organic growth, strategic acquisitions and efficient use of capital in both existing and new markets. our growth strategy is designed to enable us to take advantage of additional economies of scale, as well as provide us access to new and evolving technologies and products. in addition, we believe geographic and product diversity reduces our exposure to local or regional regulatory, economic and competitive pressures and provides us with increased opportunities for growth. we market and offer pharmacy services through carelonrx and other subsidiaries, and we expect carelonrx to continue to improve our ability to integrate pharmacy benefits within our medical and specialty platform. we have continued growing our government-sponsored business through organic growth and acquisitions. in all other markets, we intend to maintain our position by delivering excellent service, offering competitively priced products, providing access to high-quality provider networks and effectively capitalizing on the brand strength of the blue cross and blue shield names and marks.

business trends in 2023, we made the decision to expand our participation in the individual state- or federally-facilitated marketplaces (the "public exchange") for 2024. for 2024, we are offering individual public exchange products in 141 of the 143 rating regions in which we operate, in comparison to 138 of the 143 rating regions in 2023. changes to our business environment are likely to continue as elected officials at the national and state levels continue to enact, and both elected officials and candidates for election continue to propose, significant modifications to existing laws and regulations, including changes to taxes and fees. in addition, the continuing growth in our government-sponsored business exposes us to increased regulatory oversight.
carelonrx markets and offers pharmacy services to our affiliated health plan customers throughout the country, as well as to customers outside of the health plans we own. our comprehensive pharmacy services portfolio includes all core pharmacy services, such as home delivery and specialty pharmacies, claims adjudication, formulary management, pharmacy networks, rebate administration, a prescription drug database and member services. carelonrx delegates certain core pharmacy services to cvs, pursuant to the cvs agreement that is set to terminate on december 31, 2025. carelonrx also operates a specialty pharmacy and beginning in 2024, will assume responsibility for pharmacy mail order front-end intake and member services.
pricing trends:  we strive to price our health benefit products consistent with anticipated underlying medical cost trends. we frequently make adjustments to respond to legislative and regulatory changes as well as pricing and other actions
taken by existing competitors and new market entrants. revenues from the medicare and medicaid programs are dependent, in whole or in part, upon annual funding from the federal government and/or applicable state governments. product pricing remains competitive.
medical cost trends: our medical cost trends are primarily driven by increases in the utilization of services across all provider types and the unit cost increases of these services. we work to mitigate these trends through various medical management programs such as care and condition management, program integrity and specialty pharmacy management and utilization management, as well as benefit design changes. there are many drivers of medical cost trends that can cause variance from our estimates, such as changes in the level and mix of services utilized, regulatory changes, aging of the population, health status and other demographic characteristics of our members, epidemics, pandemics, advances in medical technology, new high-cost prescription drugs, provider contracting inflation, labor costs and healthcare provider or member fraud.
for additional discussion regarding business trends, see part i, item 1 "business" of this annual report on form 10-k.
regulatory trends and uncertainties under the consolidated appropriations act of 2023, congress decoupled medicaid eligibility redeterminations from the public health emergency initially declared in january 2020 relating to covid-19 (the "phe"). as a result, states were permitted to begin removing ineligible beneficiaries from their medicaid programs starting april 1, 2023, and the majority of our medicaid markets began doing so as of june 30, 2023. this process is anticipated to take up to 14 months to complete, although most states are expected to complete the redetermination process by june 30, 2024. as redeterminations have resumed, we have experienced a decline in our medicaid membership. over time, we expect growth in our commercial plans, including through the public exchanges, as members who are no longer eligible for medicaid coverage in our 14 commercial states seek coverage elsewhere. on may 11, 2023, the phe ended in accordance with the biden administration's january 30, 2023 announcement.
the inflation reduction act of 2022, which was signed into law in august 2022, contains a variety of provisions that impact our business including an extension of the american rescue plan act of 2021's enhanced premium tax credits ("ptc") through 2025; imposing a new corporate alternative minimum tax; providing a one percent excise tax on repurchases of stock made after december 31, 2022; allowing the centers for medicare and medicaid services ("cms") to negotiate prices on a limited set of prescription drugs in medicare parts b and d beginning in 2026; instituting caps on insulin cost sharing in medicare parts b and d; redesigning of the medicare part d benefit; adding a requirement that drug manufacturers pay rebates if prices increase beyond inflation; and delaying the implementation of the trump administration medicare drug rebate rule to 2032. the extension of the enhanced ptc has allowed for growth in individual public exchange enrollment as medicaid eligibility redeterminations have resumed, supporting continuity of coverage for more people.
the consolidated appropriations act of 2021 (the "2021 appropriations act") has impacted and in the future may have a material effect upon our business, including procedures and coverage requirements related to surprise medical bills and new mandates for continuity of care for certain patients, price comparison tools, disclosure of broker compensation, mental health parity reporting and reporting on pharmacy benefits and drug costs. the requirements of the 2021 appropriations act applicable to us had varying effective dates, some of which were effective in december 2021 and during 2022, and others which were extended into 2023 since the enactment of the 2021 appropriations act.
the health plan price transparency regulations issued by the u.s. departments of health and human services, labor and treasury required us in 2022 to begin disclosing detailed pricing information regarding negotiated rates for all covered items and services between the plan or issuer and in-network providers and historical payments to, and billed charges from, out-of-network providers. additionally, beginning in 2023, we were required to make available to members personalized out-of-pocket cost information and the underlying negotiated rates for 500 covered healthcare items and services, including prescription drugs. effective january 1, 2024, this requirement has expanded to include all items and services.
the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010, as amended (collectively, the "aca"), continues to impact our business and results of operations, including pricing, minimum medical loss ratios and the geographies in which our products are available. we also expect further and ongoing regulatory guidance on a number of issues related to medicare, including evolving methodology for ratings and quality bonus payments. cms also frequently proposes changes to its program that audits data submitted under the risk adjustment programs in ways that could increase financial recoveries from plans.
for additional discussion regarding regulatory trends and uncertainties, and risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in forward-looking statements made in this annual report on form 10-k, see part i, item 1 "business - regulation" and part i, item 1a "risk factors."
other significant items business and operational matters during the third quarter of 2023, based on a strategic review of our operations, assets and investments, management implemented the "2023-2024 business efficiency program" to refine the focus of our investments, and optimize our physical footprint. the 2023-2024 business efficiency program includes the write-off of certain information technology assets and contract exit costs, a reduction in staff including the relocation of certain job functions, and the impairment of assets associated with the closure or partial closure of data centers and offices. the 2023-2024 business efficiency program is expected to be substantially complete by the end of the third quarter of 2024. for additional information, see note 4, "business optimization initiatives," and note 18, "leases," of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k.
pursuant to cms's medicare advantage star ratings system, cms annually awards between 1.0 and 5.0 stars to medicare advantage plans based on performance in several categories. plans must have a star rating of 4.0 or higher to qualify for bonus payments. cms released our 2024 star ratings in october 2023, which will be used to determine our medicare advantage plans' star quality bonus payments beginning in 2025. based on our membership at september 1, 2023, 34% of our medicare advantage members were in plans with 2024 star ratings of at least 4.0 stars, compared to 64% of our medicare advantage members being in plans with 2023 star ratings of at least 4.0 stars based on our membership at september 1, 2022. this change in our 2024 star ratings is expected to impact our star quality bonus payments and plan level rebates beginning in 2025. we expect a reduction to our 2025 operating revenue of approximately $500, net of offsets from contracting provisions due to this change in star ratings. further, we expect to partially mitigate the financial impact to our 2025 operating gain and net income through various strategies such as contract diversification, operating expense efficiencies, capital deployment alternatives and network enhancements.

litigation matters in the consolidated multi-district proceeding in the united states district court for the northern district of alabama (the "court") captioned in re blue cross blue shield antitrust litigation ("bcbsa litigation"), the bcbsa and blue cross and/or blue shield licensees, including us (the "blue plans") previously approved a settlement agreement and release with the plaintiffs representing a putative nationwide class of health plan subscribers (the "subscriber settlement agreement"), which agreement required the court's approval to become effective. generally, the lawsuits in the bcbsa litigation challenge elements of the licensing agreements between the bcbsa and the independently owned and operated blue plans. the cases were brought by two putative nationwide classes of plaintiffs, health plan subscribers and providers. the subscriber settlement agreement applies only to the subscriber class. the defendants continue to contest the consolidated cases brought by the provider plaintiffs.
in august 2022, the court issued a final order approving the subscriber settlement agreement (the "final approval order"). in compliance with the subscriber settlement agreement, the company paid $506 into an escrow account in september 2022, for an aggregate and full settlement payment by the company of $596, which amount was accrued in 2020. four notices of appeal of the final approval order were filed prior to the september 2022 appeal deadline. those appeals were heard by a panel of the united states court of appeals for the eleventh circuit (the "eleventh circuit") in september 2023. in october 2023, the eleventh circuit affirmed the final approval order. petitions for rehearing filed by certain appellants in november 2023 and december 2023 remain pending. in the event all appellate rights are exhausted in a manner that affirms the court's final approval order, the defendants' payment and non-monetary obligations under the subscriber settlement agreement will become effective and the funds held in escrow will be distributed in accordance with the subscriber settlement agreement. for additional information regarding the bcbsa litigation, see note 14, "commitments and contingencies - litigation and regulatory proceedings - blue cross blue shield antitrust litigation," of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k.
selected operating performance during the year ended december 31, 2023, total medical membership decreased by 0.6 million, or 1.2%. the decrease in medical membership was driven primarily by attrition in medicaid due to the resumption of eligibility redeterminations and declines in our employer group risk-based business, partially offset by growth in bluecard, individual public exchange health plans and medicare advantage membership.
operating revenue for the year ended december 31, 2023 was $170,209, an increase of $14,549, or 9.3%, from the year ended december 31, 2022. the increase in operating revenue was primarily driven by higher premium revenues in our health benefits business resulting from premium rate increases to more accurately reflect the cost of care. the increase was further attributable to growth in our carelonrx pharmacy product revenue driven by growth in external pharmacy members and the acquisition of bioplus in the first quarter of 2023.
net income for the year ended december 31, 2023 was $5,991, an increase of $103, or 1.7%, from the year ended december 31, 2022. the increase in net income was primarily due to higher premium revenues in our health benefits business resulting from premium rate increases to more accurately reflect the cost of care. the increase was further attributable to growth in our carelonrx pharmacy product revenue driven by growth in external pharmacy members and the acquisition of bioplus in the first quarter of 2023. these increases were partially offset by the business optimization charges recorded in the third quarter of 2023.
our fully-diluted shareholders' earnings per share ("eps") for the year ended december 31, 2023 was $25.22, an increase of $0.94, or 3.9%, from the year ended december 31, 2022. our diluted shares for the year ended december 31, 2023 were 237.4, a decrease of 5.4, or 2.2%, compared to the year ended december 31, 2022. the increase in eps resulted from fewer diluted shares outstanding, as well as increased shareholders' net income.
operating cash flow for the year ended december 31, 2023 was $8,061, or approximately 1.3 times net income. operating cash flow for the year ended december 31, 2022 was $8,399, or approximately 1.4 times net income. the decrease in operating cash flow was primarily due to the timing of working capital changes, partially offset by higher net income in 2023, when excluding the non-cash impact of the business optimization charges recorded in the third quarter of 2023, as well as the non-recurrence of the subscriber settlement agreement payment made in september 2022.
membership our medical membership includes the following customer types: individual, employer group risk-based, employer group fee-based, bluecard®, medicare, medicaid and our federal employees health benefits ("fehb") program. we refer to members in our service areas licensed by the bcbsa as our bcbs-branded, or anthem bcbs, business. non-bcbs-branded business refers to members in our non-bcbs-branded, or wellpoint plans, which include amerigroup, freedom health, healthsun, mmm, optimum healthcare and simply healthcare plans. in addition to the above medical membership, we also serve customers who purchase one or more of our other products or services that are often ancillary to our health business.
•individual consists of individual customers under age 65 and their covered dependents. individual policies are generally sold through independent agents and brokers, retail partnerships, our in-house sales force or via the public exchanges. individual business is sold on a risk-based basis. we offer on-exchange products through public exchanges and off-exchange products. federal premium subsidies are available only for certain public exchange individual products. unsubsidized individual customers are generally more sensitive to product pricing and, to a lesser extent, the configuration of the network and the efficiency of administration. customer turnover is generally higher with individual as compared to employer group risk-based. individual business accounted for 2.2%, 1.7% and 1.7% of our medical members at december 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
•employer group risk-based consists of employer customers who purchase products on a full-risk basis, which are products for which we charge a premium and indemnify our policyholders against costs for health benefits. employer group risk-based accounts include local group customers and national accounts. local group consists of those employer customers with less than 5% of eligible employees located outside of the headquarter state, as well as customers with more than 5% of eligible employees located outside of the headquarter state with up to 5,000 eligible employees. in addition, local group includes student health members. national accounts generally consist of multi-state employer groups primarily headquartered in an elevance health service area with at least 5% of the eligible employees located outside of the headquarter state and with more than 5,000 eligible employees. some exceptions are allowed based on broker and consultant relationships. employer group risk-based accounts are generally sold through brokers or consultants who work with industry specialists from our in-house sales force and are offered both on and off the public exchanges. employer group risk-based accounted for 8.0%, 8.4% and 8.8% of our medical members at december 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
•employer group fee-based customers represent employer groups, local group, and national accounts, who purchase fee-based products and elect to retain most or all of the financial risk associated with their employees' healthcare costs. some fee-based customers choose to purchase stop loss coverage to limit their retained risk. employer group fee-based accounts are generally sold through independent brokers or consultants retained by the customer working with our in-house sales force. employer group fee-based accounted for 43.1%, 42.4% and 42.7% of our medical members at december 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
•bluecard® host customers represent enrollees of blue cross and/or blue shield plans not owned by elevance health who receive healthcare services in our bcbsa licensed markets. bluecard® membership consists of estimated host members using the national bluecard® program. host members are generally members who reside in or travel to a state in which an elevance health subsidiary is the blue cross and/or blue shield licensee and who are covered under an employer-sponsored health plan issued by a non-elevance health controlled bcbsa licensee (the "home plan"). we perform certain functions, including claims pricing and administration, for bluecard® members, for which we receive service fees from the bluecard® members' home plans. other administrative functions, including maintenance of enrollment information and customer service, are performed by the home plan. host members are computed using, among other things, the average number of bluecard® claims received per month. bluecard® host membership accounted for 14.6%, 13.6% and 13.6% of our medical members at december 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
•medicare customers are medicare-eligible individual members age 65 and over who have enrolled in medicare advantage, including special needs plans ("snps"), also known as medicare advantage snps; dual-eligible programs through medicare-medicaid plans ("mmps"); medicare supplement plans; and medicare part d prescription drug plans ("medicare part d"). medicare advantage plans provide medicare beneficiaries with a managed care alternative to traditional medicare and often include a medicare part d benefit. in addition, our medicare advantage snps provide tailored benefits to special needs individuals who are institutionalized or have severe or disabling chronic conditions and to dual-eligible customers, who are low-income seniors and persons under age 65 with disabilities. medicare advantage snps are coordinated care plans specifically designed to provide targeted care, covering all the healthcare services considered medically necessary for members and often providing professional care coordination services, with personal guidance and programs that help members maintain their health. medicare advantage membership also includes medicare advantage members in our group retiree solutions business who are retired members of commercial accounts or retired members of groups who are not affiliated with our commercial accounts who have selected a medicare advantage product through us. medicare supplement plans typically pay the difference between healthcare costs incurred by a beneficiary and amounts paid by medicare. medicare part d offers a prescription drug plan to medicare and mmp beneficiaries. mmp, which was established as a result of the passage of the aca, is focused on serving members who are dually eligible for medicaid and medicare. medicare supplement and medicare advantage products are marketed in the same manner, primarily through independent agents and brokers. medicare program business accounted for 6.3%, 6.2% and 6.2% of our medical members at december 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
•medicaid membership represents eligible members who receive health benefits through publicly funded healthcare programs, including medicaid, aca-related medicaid expansion programs, temporary assistance for needy families, programs for seniors and people with disabilities, children's health insurance programs, and specialty programs such as those focused on long-term services and support, hiv/aids, foster care, behavioral health and/or substance abuse disorders, and intellectual disabilities or developmental disabilities, among others. total medicaid program business accounted for 22.4%, 24.3% and 23.4% of our medical members at december 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

medical membership total medical membership declined during the twelve months ended december 31, 2023. this was driven primarily by attrition in medicaid due to the resumption of eligibility redeterminations and declines in our employer group risk-based business, partially offset by growth in bluecard, individual public exchange health plans and medicare advantage membership.
other membership our other membership can be impacted by changes in our medical membership, as our medical members often purchase our other products that are ancillary to our health business. life and disability membership decreased primarily due to lapses associated with our employer group risk-based accounts. dental membership increased primarily due to favorable sales in our fehb, individual and national businesses, partially offset by lapses in our employer group risked-based accounts. dental administration membership increased primarily due to favorable in-group change with other bcbsa plans associated
with the fehb program. vision membership increased due to sales exceeding lapses in our individual and medicare advantage businesses.

certain of the following definitions are also applicable to all other results of operations tables in this discussion:
includes interest expense, amortization of other intangible assets and loss on extinguishment of debt.
benefit expense ratio represents benefit expense as a percentage of premium revenue. premiums for the years ended december 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 were $142,854, $133,229 and $117,373, respectively. premiums are included in total operating revenue presented above.
total operating revenue increased primarily as a result of higher premium revenues in our health benefits business resulting from premium rate increases to more accurately reflect the cost of care. the increase was further attributable to growth in our carelonrx pharmacy product revenue driven by growth in external pharmacy members and the acquisition of bioplus in the first quarter of 2023.
net investment income increased primarily due to higher income from fixed maturity securities, partially offset by reduced income from alternative investments and lower dividends on equity securities.
net losses on financial instruments increased due to increased losses on other invested assets, partially offset by higher gains on marketable equity securities.
benefit expense increased primarily due to medical cost trends.
our benefit expense ratio decreased slightly, primarily driven by premium rate increases in our health benefit segment to more accurately reflect the cost of care.
cost of products sold reflects the cost of pharmaceuticals dispensed by carelonrx for our unaffiliated pharmacy customers. cost of products sold increased as the corresponding pharmacy product revenues increased.
operating expense increased primarily due to the business optimization charges recorded in the third quarter of 2023, including internally developed software impairment and severance costs, as well as expenses incurred for anticipated future growth.
our operating expense ratio increased primarily due to the business optimization charges recorded in 2023, partially offset by the favorable impact of operating revenue growth.
other expense increased primarily due to increased interest expense and increased amortization of other intangible assets. interest expense increased as we issued additional debt at higher interest rates. the amortization of intangible assets increased due to recent acquisitions as well as the rebranding of our products. the amortization period of certain intangible assets was shortened to align with anticipated dates the new branding will take place.
our effective income tax rate decreased from 22.5% to 22.3%, primarily due to the impact of geographic changes in our mix of earnings in 2023.
our shareholders' net income as a percentage of total revenues decreased in 2023 as compared to 2022 as a result of all the factors discussed above.

health benefits operating revenue and operating gain increased primarily as a result of higher premium revenues due to premium rate increases to more accurately reflect the cost of care.
carelonrx operating revenue increased primarily as a result of higher prescription volumes associated with growth in external pharmacy members served and the acquisition of bioplus in the first quarter of 2023.
the increase in operating gain was primarily a result of higher prescription volumes associated with growth in external pharmacy members served and the acquisition of bioplus in the first quarter of 2023, partially offset by lower service fees and expenses incurred for anticipated future growth.
carelon services operating revenue increased primarily due to the continued expansion of our post-acute care services performed for our medicare business and behavioral health services performed for our medicaid business.
the increase in operating gain was primarily driven by the continued expansion of our post-acute care services and improved performance in our medical management business, partially offset by medical cost trends.
corporate & other the increase in operating loss was primarily due to the business optimization charges recorded in the third quarter of 2023, as well as an increase in unallocated corporate expenses.
critical accounting policies and estimates we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap. application of gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes and within this md&a. we consider our most important accounting policies that require significant estimates and management judgment to be those policies with respect to liabilities for medical claims payable, goodwill and other intangible assets and investments, which are discussed below. our other significant accounting policies are summarized in note 2, "basis of presentation and significant accounting policies," of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k.
we continually evaluate the accounting policies and estimates used to prepare the consolidated financial statements. in general, our estimates are based on historical experience, evaluation of current trends, information from third-party professionals and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the known facts and circumstances. estimates can require a significant amount of judgment, and a different set of assumptions could result in material changes to our reported results.
medical claims payable the most subjective accounting estimate in our consolidated financial statements is our liability for medical claims payable. at december 31, 2023, this liability was $16,111 and represented 23.2% of our total consolidated liabilities. we record this liability and the corresponding benefit expense for incurred but not paid claims, including the estimated costs of processing such claims. incurred but not paid claims include (1) an estimate for claims that are incurred but not reported, as well as claims reported to us but not yet processed through our systems, which approximated 93.9%, or $15,123, of our total medical claims liability as of december 31, 2023; and (2) claims reported to us and processed through our systems but not yet paid, which approximated 6.1%, or $988, of the total medical claims payable as of december 31, 2023. the level of claims payable processed through our systems but not yet paid may fluctuate from one period-end to the next, from approximately 1% to 6% of our total medical claims liability, due to timing of when claim payments are made.
liabilities for both claims incurred but not reported and reported but not yet processed through our systems are determined in the aggregate, employing actuarial methods that are commonly used by health insurance actuaries and meet actuarial standards of practice. our reserving practice for claim liabilities is to consistently recognize the appropriate amount of reserve within a level of confidence required by actuarial standards of practice. we determine the amount of the liability for incurred but not paid claims by following a detailed actuarial process that uses both historical claim payment patterns as well as emerging medical cost trends to project our best estimate of claim liabilities. under this process, historical paid claims data is formatted into "claim triangles," which compare claim incurred dates to the dates of claim payments. this information
is analyzed to create "completion factors" that represent the average percentage of total incurred claims that have been paid through a given date after being incurred. completion factors are applied to claims paid through the period-end date to estimate the ultimate claim expense incurred for the period. actuarial estimates of incurred but not paid claim liabilities are then determined by subtracting the actual paid claims from the estimate of the ultimate incurred claims.
for the most recent incurred months (typically the most recent two months), the percentage of claims paid for claims incurred in those months is generally low. this makes the completion factor methodology less reliable for such months. therefore, incurred claims for recent months are not projected from historical completion and payment patterns; rather, they are projected by estimating the claims expense for those months based on recent claims expense levels and healthcare trend levels ("trend factors").
our reserve methodology, which relies upon historical information, must be adjusted to account for known or suspected operational and environmental changes. adjustments are carried out by our actuaries, drawing on expert knowledge and taking into account their estimate of emerging impacts to benefit costs and payment speed. factors such as changes in levels of utilization, unit costs, business mix, benefit plan designs, provider reimbursements, processing system modifications, claim inventory levels, claim processing and submission patterns, and operational changes resulting from business combinations are considered when developing our reserve estimates. we also compare prior period liabilities to revised claim liabilities based on subsequent claim development. in these comparisons, methods and assumptions remain constant as reserves are recalculated; rather, the availability of additional paid claims information drives changes in the re-estimate of the unpaid claim liability. to the extent appropriate, changes in such development are recorded as a change to current period benefit expense.
on a regular basis, we review cost trends and utilization assumptions set upon initial establishment of claim liabilities. we utilize subsequent paid claims activity to monitor and continuously adjust the claims liability and benefit expense. if actual results are determined to be materially different than assumptions regarding cost trends and utilization, future periods of our income statement and overall financial position could be impacted. adjustments made to prior year estimates may result in either an additional benefit expense or a reduction of benefit expense in the period the adjustment is made. the variability of healthcare costs necessitates that claim liabilities be adjusted each period and are sometimes significant compared to the net income recorded in that period. an actuary's judgment that a portion of the prior period liability is no longer needed or that an additional liability should have been accrued triggers the immediate recognition of prior period development. once sufficient information is available to ascertain that the re-estimate of the liability is reasonable, the determination is made.
while numerous factors contribute to our medical claims payable liability estimation, the two assumptions having the most significant impact on our incurred but not paid claims liability as of december 31, 2023, were the completion and trend factors. these vital assumptions can be affected by variables such as utilization levels, unit costs, mix of business, benefit plan designs, provider reimbursement levels, processing system conversions and changes, claim inventory levels, claim processing and submission patterns, and operational changes resulting from business combinations.
there is variation in the reasonable choice of completion factors by duration for durations of three months through twelve months where the completion factors have the most significant impact. as previously discussed, completion factors tend to be less reliable for the most recent months and therefore are not specifically utilized for months one and two. in our analysis for the claim liabilities at december 31, 2023, the variability in months three to five was estimated to be between 40 and 90 basis points, while months six through twelve have much lower estimated variability ranging from 0 to 30 basis points.
the difference in completion factor assumptions results in variability of 2%, or approximately $289, in the december 31, 2023 incurred but not paid claims liability, depending on the completion factors chosen. it is important to note that the completion factor methodology inherently assumes that historical completion rates will be reflective of the current period. however, it is possible that the actual completion rates for the current period will develop differently from historical patterns and therefore could fall outside the possible variations described herein.
the other major assumption used in the establishment of the december 31, 2023 incurred but not paid claim liability was the trend factors. in our analysis for the period ended december 31, 2023, there was a 330 basis point differential in the high and low trend factors. this range of trend factors would imply variability of 3%, or approximately $545, in the incurred but
not paid claims liability, depending upon the trend factors used. because historical trend factors are often not representative of current claim trends, the trend experience for the most recent six to nine months, plus knowledge of recent events likely affecting current trends, have been taken into consideration in establishing the incurred but not paid claims liability at december 31, 2023.
see note 12, "medical claims payable," of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k, for a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balance for medical claims payable for the years ended december 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021. components of the total incurred claims for each year include amounts accrued for current year estimated claims expense as well as adjustments to prior year estimated accruals. in note 12, "medical claims payable," the line labeled "net incurred medical claims: prior years redundancies" accounts for those adjustments made to prior year estimates. the impact of any reduction of "net incurred medical claims: prior years redundancies" may be offset as we establish the estimate of "net incurred medical claims: current year", or as we establish liabilities for premium refunds based upon the minimum medical loss ratio ("mlr"), the relative health risk of members, and other contractual or regulatory requirements. our reserving practice is to consistently recognize the actuarial best estimate of our ultimate liability for our claims. when we recognize a release of the redundancy, we disclose the amount that is not in the ordinary course of business, if material.
the ratio of current year medical claims paid as a percent of current year net medical claims incurred was 88.0% for 2023, 87.3% for 2022 and 87.8% for 2021. this ratio serves as an indicator of claims processing speed whereby 2023 claims were processed at a similar speed to 2022 and 2021.
we calculate the percentage of prior year redundancies in the current year as a percent of prior year net incurred claims payable less prior year redundancies in the current year in order to demonstrate the development of the prior year reserves. for the year ended december 31, 2023, this metric was 11.4%, largely driven by favorable trend factor development at the end of 2022 as well as favorable completion factor development from 2022. for the year ended december 31, 2022, this metric was 7.0% and was largely driven by favorable trend factor development at the end of 2021. for the year ended december 31, 2021, this metric was 18.1%, reflecting the estimation uncertainty due to covid-19 at the end of 2020, and was largely driven by favorable trend factor development at the end of 2020 as well as favorable completion factor development from 2020.
we calculate the percentage of prior year redundancies in the current year as a percent of prior year net incurred medical claims to indicate the percentage of redundancy included in the preceding year calculation of current year net incurred medical claims. we believe this calculation supports the reasonableness of our prior year estimate of incurred medical claims. for the year ended december 31, 2023, this metric was 1.4%, which was calculated using the redundancy of $1,571. this metric was 0.9% for 2022 and 2.0% for 2021. the 2021 metric was impacted by the estimation uncertainty due to covid-19.
the following table shows the variance between total net incurred medical claims as reported in note 12, "medical claims payable," of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k, for each of 2022 and 2021 and the incurred claims for such years had it been determined retrospectively (computed as the difference between "net incurred medical claims - current year" for the year shown and "net incurred medical claims - prior years redundancies" for the immediately following year):
given that our business is primarily short tailed (which means that medical claims are generally paid within twelve months of the member receiving service from the provider), the variance to total net incurred medical claims, as reported above, is used to assess the reasonableness of our estimate of ultimate incurred medical claims for a given calendar year with
the benefit of one year of experience. we expect that substantially all of the development of the 2023 estimate of medical claims payable will be known during 2024.
the 2022 variance to total net incurred medical claims, as reported of 0.6% was more than the 2021 percentage of (0.8)%. this was primarily driven by the fact that the change in prior year redundancy reported for 2022 as compared to 2021 increased, whereas the change in the prior year redundancy reported for 2021 as compared to 2020 decreased.
goodwill and other intangible assets our consolidated goodwill and other intangible assets at december 31, 2023 were $35,590, and represented 32.7% of our total consolidated assets and 90.5% of our consolidated shareholders' equity at december 31, 2023.
we follow fasb guidance for business combinations and goodwill and other intangible assets, which specifies the types of acquired intangible assets that are required to be recognized and reported separately from goodwill. under the guidance, goodwill and other intangible assets (with indefinite lives) are not amortized but are tested for impairment at least annually. furthermore, goodwill and other intangible assets are allocated to reporting units for purposes of the annual impairment test. our impairment tests require us to make assumptions and judgments regarding the estimated fair value of our reporting units, which include goodwill and other intangible assets. in addition, certain other intangible assets with indefinite lives, such as trademarks, are also tested separately.
we complete our annual impairment tests of existing goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives during the fourth quarter of each year. these tests involve the use of estimates related to the fair value of goodwill at the reporting unit level and other intangible assets with indefinite lives, and require a significant degree of management judgment and the use of subjective assumptions. certain interim impairment tests are also performed when potential impairment indicators exist or changes in our business or other triggering events occur. we have the option of first performing a qualitative assessment for each reporting unit to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, which is an indication that our goodwill may be impaired. these qualitative impairment tests include assessing events and factors that could affect the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible assets. our procedures include assessing our financial performance, macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, various asset specific factors and entity specific events. if we determine that a reporting unit's goodwill may be impaired after utilizing these qualitative impairment analysis procedures, we are required to perform a quantitative impairment test.
our quantitative impairment test utilizes the projected income and market valuation approaches for goodwill and the projected income approach for our indefinite lived intangible assets. use of the projected income and market valuation approaches for our goodwill impairment test reflects our view that both valuation methodologies provide a reasonable estimate of fair value. the projected income approach is developed using assumptions about future revenue, expenses and net income derived from our internal planning process. these estimated future cash flows are then discounted. our assumed discount rate is based on our industry's weighted-average cost of capital. market valuations are based on observed multiples of certain measures including revenue; earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization; and book value of invested capital (debt and equity) and include market comparisons to publicly traded companies in our industry.
we did not incur any impairment losses as a result of our 2023 annual impairment tests, as it was determined that it is more likely than not that the estimated fair values of our reporting units were substantially in excess of the carrying values as of december 31, 2023. additionally, we do not believe that the estimated fair values of our reporting units are at risk of becoming impaired in the next twelve months.
if estimated fair values are less than the carrying values of goodwill and other intangibles with indefinite lives in future annual impairment tests, or if significant impairment indicators are noted relative to other intangible assets subject to amortization, we may be required to record impairment losses against future income.

investments current and long-term marketable investment securities were $30,719 at december 31, 2023 and represented 28.2% of our total consolidated assets at december 31, 2023. we classify fixed maturity securities in our investment portfolio as "available-for-sale" and report those securities at fair value. certain fixed maturity securities are available to support current operations and, accordingly, we classify such investments as current assets without regard to their contractual maturity. investments used to satisfy contractual, regulatory or other requirements are classified as long-term, without regard to contractual maturity.
our impairment review is subjective and requires a high degree of judgment. we conduct this review on a quarterly basis, using both qualitative and quantitative factors. such factors considered include the extent to which a security's market value has been less than its cost, the reasons for the decline in value (i.e., credit event compared to liquidity, general credit spread widening, currency exchange rate or interest rate factors), financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer, including the credit ratings and changes in the credit ratings of the issuer, recommendations of investment advisors, and forecasts of economic, market or industry trends.
if a fixed maturity security is in an unrealized loss position and we have the intent to sell the fixed maturity security, or it is more likely than not that we will have to sell the fixed maturity security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, we write down the fixed maturity security's cost basis to fair value and record an impairment loss in our consolidated statements of income. for impaired fixed maturity securities that we do not intend to sell or if it is more likely than not that we will not have to sell such securities, but we expect that we will not fully recover the amortized cost basis, we recognize the credit component of the impairment as an allowance for credit loss in our consolidated balance sheets and record an impairment loss in our consolidated statements of income. the non-credit component of the impairment is recognized in accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income. furthermore, unrealized losses entirely caused by non-credit-related factors related to fixed maturity securities for which we expect to fully recover the amortized cost basis continue to be recognized in accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income.
the credit component of an impairment is determined primarily by comparing the net present value of projected future cash flows with the amortized cost basis of the fixed maturity security. the net present value is calculated by discounting our best estimate of projected future cash flows at the effective interest rate implicit in the fixed maturity security at the date of purchase. for mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities, cash flow estimates are based on assumptions regarding the underlying collateral, including prepayment speeds, vintage, type of underlying asset, geographic concentrations, default rates, recoveries and changes in value. for all other securities, cash flow estimates are driven by assumptions regarding probability of default, including changes in credit ratings and estimates regarding timing and amount of recoveries associated with a default.
we have a committee of accounting and investment associates and management that is responsible for managing the impairment review process. we believe that we have adequately reviewed our investment securities for impairment and that our investment securities are carried at fair value. we have established an allowance for credit loss and recorded credit loss expense as a reflection of our expected impairment losses. given the inherent uncertainty of changes in market conditions and the significant judgments involved, there is continuing risk that declines in fair value may occur and additional impairment losses on investments may be recorded in future periods.
in addition to marketable investment securities, we held additional long-term investments of $6,107, or 5.6% of total consolidated assets, at december 31, 2023. these long-term investments consisted primarily of certain other equity investments, the cash surrender value of corporate-owned life insurance policies and mortgage loans. due to their less liquid nature, these investments are classified as long-term.
through our investing activities, we are exposed to financial market risks, including those resulting from changes in interest rates and changes in equity market valuations. we manage market risks through our investment policy, which establishes credit quality limits and limits on investments in individual issuers. ineffective management of these risks could have an impact on our future results of operations and financial condition. our investment portfolio includes fixed maturity securities with a fair value of $30,490 at december 31, 2023. the weighted-average credit rating of these securities was "a" as of december 31, 2023. included in this balance are investments in fixed maturity securities of states, municipalities and political subdivisions and asset-backed assets of $993 and $0, respectively, that are guaranteed by third parties. with the
exception of 17 securities with a fair value of $9, these securities are all investment-grade and carry a weighted-average credit rating of "aa" as of december 31, 2023. the securities are guaranteed by a number of different guarantors, and we do not have any material exposure to any single guarantor, neither indirectly through the guarantees, nor directly through investment in the guarantor. further, due to the high underlying credit rating of the issuers, the weighted-average credit rating of the fixed maturity securities without a guarantee, for which such information is available, was "a" as of december 31, 2023.
fair values of fixed maturity and equity securities are based on quoted market prices, where available. these fair values are obtained primarily from third-party pricing services, which generally use level i or level ii inputs for the determination of fair value in accordance with fasb guidance for fair value measurements and disclosures. we have controls in place to review the pricing services' qualifications and procedures used to determine fair values. in addition, we periodically review the pricing services' pricing methodologies, data sources and pricing inputs to ensure the fair values obtained are reasonable.
we obtain quoted market prices for each security from the pricing services, which are derived through recently reported trades for identical or similar securities, making adjustments through the reporting date based upon available market observable information. for securities not actively traded, the pricing services may use quoted market prices of comparable instruments or discounted cash flow analyses, incorporating inputs that are currently observable in the markets for similar securities. inputs that are often used in these valuation methodologies include, but are not limited to, broker quotes, benchmark yields, credit spreads, default rates and prepayment speeds. as we are responsible for the determination of fair value, we perform analysis on the prices received from the pricing services to determine whether the prices are reasonable estimates of fair value. our analysis includes procedures such as a review of month-to-month price fluctuations and price comparisons to secondary pricing services. there were no adjustments to quoted market prices obtained from the pricing services during the years ended december 31, 2023 and 2022.
in certain circumstances, it may not be possible to derive pricing model inputs from observable market activity, and therefore, such inputs are estimated internally. such securities are designated level iii in accordance with fasb guidance. securities designated level iii at december 31, 2023 totaled $665 and represented approximately 1.9% of our total assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis. our level iii securities primarily consisted of certain corporate securities and equity securities for which observable inputs were not always available and the fair values of these securities were estimated using inputs including, but not limited to, prepayment speeds, credit spreads, default rates and benchmark yields.
for additional information, see part ii, item 7a, "quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk" of this annual report on form 10-k and note 2, "basis of presentation and significant accounting policies," note 5, "investments," and note 7, "fair value," of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k.
new accounting pronouncements for information regarding new accounting pronouncements that were issued or became effective during the year ended december 31, 2023 that had, or are expected to have, a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or financial statement disclosures, see the "recently adopted accounting guidance" and "recent accounting guidance not yet adopted" sections of note 2, "basis of presentation and significant accounting policies," of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k.
liquidity and capital resources introduction our cash receipts result primarily from premiums, product revenue, service fees, investment income, proceeds from the sale or maturity of our investment securities, proceeds from borrowings, and proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our employee stock plans. cash disbursements result mainly from claims payments, operating expenses, taxes, purchases of investment securities, interest expense, payments on borrowings, acquisitions, capital expenditures, repurchases of our debt securities and common stock and the payment of cash dividends. cash outflows fluctuate with the amount and timing of settlement of these transactions. any future decline in our profitability would likely have an unfavorable impact on our liquidity.
we manage our cash, investments and capital structure so we are able to meet the short-term and long-term obligations of our business while maintaining financial flexibility and liquidity. we forecast, analyze and monitor our cash flows to enable investment and financing within the overall constraints of our financial strategy.
a substantial portion of the assets held by our regulated subsidiaries are in the form of cash and cash equivalents and investments. after considering expected cash flows from operating activities, we generally invest cash that exceeds our near term obligations in longer term marketable fixed maturity securities to improve our overall investment income returns. our investment strategy is to make investments consistent with insurance statutes and other regulatory requirements, while preserving our asset base. our investments are generally available-for-sale to meet liquidity and other needs. our subsidiaries pay out excess capital annually in the form of dividends to their respective parent companies for general corporate use, as permitted by applicable regulations.
the availability of financing in the form of debt or equity is influenced by many factors, including our profitability, operating cash flows, debt levels, debt ratings, contractual restrictions, regulatory requirements and market conditions. the securities and credit markets have in the past experienced higher than normal volatility. interest rates on fixed debt income securities have increased since the beginning of 2022, which may increase our borrowing costs if we elect to issue debt. during recent years, the federal government and various governmental agencies have taken a number of steps to strengthen the regulation of the financial services market. in addition, governments around the world have developed their own plans to provide stability and security in the credit markets and to ensure adequate capital in certain financial institutions.
a summary of our major sources and uses of cash and cash equivalents for the years ended december 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 is as follows:
years ended december 31                                                    $ change
net cash provided by operating activities                                                          $8,061                      $8,399                        $8,364                     $(338)                           $35

liquidity-year ended december 31, 2023 compared to year ended december 31, 2022
the decline in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to the timing of working capital changes, partially offset by higher net income in 2023, when excluding the non-cash impact of the business optimization charges recorded in the third quarter of 2023, as well as the non-recurrence of the subscriber settlement agreement payment made in september 2022.
other significant changes in sources and uses of cash year-over-year included a) lower sources of cash from other sources of cash, net, issuances of short- and long-term debt, net of repayments and issuances of common stock under
employee stock plans and b) increased uses of cash from purchases of subsidiaries, net of cash acquired, purchases of investments, net of proceeds from sales, maturities, calls and redemptions, the repurchase and retirement of common stock, cash dividends, the purchase of property and equipment and other uses of cash, net.
financial condition we maintained a strong financial condition and liquidity position, with consolidated cash, cash equivalents and investments in fixed maturity and equity securities of $37,245 at december 31, 2023. since december 31, 2022, total cash, cash equivalents and investments in fixed maturity and equity securities increased by $2,201, primarily due to cash generated from operations. this increase was partially offset by cash used for common stock repurchases, acquisitions, purchases of property and equipment and cash dividends paid to shareholders.
many of our subsidiaries are subject to various government regulations that restrict the timing and amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid to their respective parent companies. certain accounting practices prescribed by insurance regulatory authorities, or statutory accounting practices, differ from gaap. changes that occur in statutory accounting practices, if any, or other regulatory requirements, could impact our subsidiaries' future dividend capacity. in addition, we have agreed to certain undertakings to regulatory authorities, including the requirement to maintain certain capital levels in certain of our subsidiaries.
at december 31, 2023, we held $1,564 of cash, cash equivalents and investments at the parent company, which are available for general corporate use, including investment in our businesses, acquisitions, potential future common stock repurchases and dividends to shareholders, repurchases of debt securities and debt and interest payments.
periodically, we access capital markets and issue debt ("notes") for long-term borrowing purposes, for example, to refinance debt, to finance acquisitions or for share repurchases. certain of these notes may have a call feature that allows us to redeem the notes at any time at our option and/or a put feature that allows a note holder to redeem the notes upon the occurrence of both a change in control event and a downgrade of the notes below an investment grade rating. for more information on our debt, including redemptions and issuances, see note 13, "debt," of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k.
we calculate our consolidated debt-to-capital ratio, a non-gaap measure, from the amounts presented on our audited consolidated balance sheets included in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k. our debt-to-capital ratio is calculated as total debt divided by total debt plus total shareholders' equity. total debt is the sum of short-term borrowings, current portion of long-term debt and long-term debt, less current portion. we believe our debt-to-capital ratio assists investors and rating agencies in measuring our overall leverage and additional borrowing capacity. in addition, our bank covenants include a maximum debt-to-capital ratio that we cannot and did not exceed. our debt-to-capital ratio may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. our consolidated debt-to-capital ratio was 38.9% and 39.9% as of december 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.
our senior debt is rated "a" by s&p global ratings, "bbb+" by fitch ratings, inc., "baa2" by moody's investor service, inc. and "bbb+" by am best company, inc. we intend to maintain our senior debt investment grade ratings. if our credit ratings are downgraded, our business, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted by limitations on future borrowings and a potential increase in our borrowing costs.
capital resources we have a shelf registration statement on file with the u.s. securities and exchange commission to register an unlimited amount of any combination of debt or equity securities in one or more offerings. specific information regarding terms and securities being offered will be provided at the time of an offering. proceeds from future offerings are expected to be used for general corporate purposes, including, but not limited to, the repayment of debt, investments in or extensions of credit to our subsidiaries and the financing of possible acquisitions or business expansions.
we have a senior revolving credit facility (the "5-year facility") with a group of lenders for general corporate purposes. the 5-year facility provides credit of up to $4,000 and matures in april 2027. our ability to borrow under the 5-year facility is subject to compliance with certain covenants, including covenants requiring us to maintain a defined debt-to-capital ratio of not more than 60%, subject to increase in certain circumstances set forth in the credit agreement for the 5-year
facility. as of december 31, 2023, our debt-to-capital ratio, as defined and calculated under the 5-year facility, was 39.1%. we do not believe the restrictions contained in our 5-year facility covenants materially affect our financial or operating flexibility. as of december 31, 2023, we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants under the 5-year facility. there were no amounts outstanding under the 5-year facility at december 31, 2023.
we have an authorized commercial paper program of up to $4,000, the proceeds of which may be used for general corporate purposes. should commercial paper issuance become unavailable, we have the ability to use a combination of cash on hand and/or our 5-year facility, which provides for credit in the amount of $4,000, to redeem any outstanding commercial paper upon maturity. at december 31, 2023, we had $0 outstanding under our commercial paper program. beginning in 2023, we have reclassified our commercial paper balances from long-term debt to short-term debt as our intent is to not replace short-term commercial paper outstanding at expiration with additional short-term commercial paper for an uninterrupted period extending for more than one year.
while there is no assurance in the current economic environment, we believe the lenders participating in our 5-year facility, if market conditions allow, would be willing to provide financing in accordance with their legal obligations.
we are a member, through certain subsidiaries, of the federal home loan bank of indianapolis, the federal home loan bank of cincinnati, the federal home loan bank of atlanta and the federal home loan bank of new york (collectively the "fhlbs"). as a member, we have the ability to obtain short-term cash advances, subject to certain minimum collateral requirements. at december 31, 2023, we had $225 of outstanding short-term borrowings from the fhlbs.
as discussed in "financial condition" above, many of our subsidiaries are subject to various government regulations that restrict the timing and amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid. based upon these requirements, we currently estimate that approximately $4,400 of dividends will be paid to us by our subsidiaries during 2024. during 2023, we received $4,909 of dividends from our subsidiaries.
in addition to regulations regarding the timing and amount of dividends, our regulated subsidiaries' states of domicile have statutory risk-based capital ("rbc") requirements for health and other insurance companies and health maintenance organizations largely based on the national association of insurance commissioners ("naic") risk-based capital (rbc) for health organizations model act (the "rbc model act"). these rbc requirements are intended to measure capital adequacy, taking into account the risk characteristics of an insurer's investments and products. the naic sets forth the formula for calculating the rbc requirements, which are designed to take into account asset risks, insurance risks, interest rate risks and other relevant risks with respect to an individual insurance company's business. in general, under the rbc model act, an insurance company must submit a report of its rbc level to the state insurance department or insurance commissioner, as appropriate, at the end of each calendar year. our regulated subsidiaries' respective rbc levels as of december 31, 2023 were in excess of all applicable mandatory rbc requirements. in addition to exceeding these rbc requirements, we are in compliance with the liquidity and capital requirements for a licensee of the bcbsa and with the tangible net worth requirements applicable to certain of our california subsidiaries. for additional information, see note 22, "statutory information," of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k.
future sources and uses of liquidity short-term liquidity requirements as previously described, our cash disbursements result mainly from claims payments, administrative expenses, taxes, purchases of investment securities, interest expense, payments on borrowings, acquisitions, capital expenditures, repurchases of our debt securities and common stock and the payment of cash dividends. we believe cash on hand, operating cash receipts, investments and amounts available under our commercial paper program, our 5-year facility and borrowings available from the fhlbs will be adequate to fund our expected cash disbursements over the next twelve months.
long-term liquidity requirements as of december 31, 2023, our long-term cash disbursements required under various contractual obligations and commitments were:
•debt and interest expense: future debt and estimated interest payments were $40,491, with $2,661 due within the next twelve months. for additional information, see note 13 "debt," of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k.
•operating leases: we lease office space and certain computer equipment, for which the future estimated payments were $956, with $195 due within the next twelve months. for additional information, see note 18, "leases," of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k.
•other liabilities: these liabilities primarily consist of future policy reserves, projected other postretirement benefits, deferred compensation, supplemental executive retirement plan liabilities and certain other miscellaneous long-term obligations. amounts due within twelve months were $31, with $1,210 due in future periods. estimated future payments for funded pension benefits have been excluded from these numbers, as we had no funding requirements under the employee retirement income security act of 1974, as amended, at december 31, 2023, as a result of the value of the assets in the plans. in addition, gross liabilities for uncertain tax positions and interest for which we cannot reasonably estimate the timing of the resolutions with the respective taxing authorities have not been included. for further information, see note 8, "income taxes," of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k.
•purchase obligations: these obligations include estimated payments for future services under contractual arrangements from third-party service vendors. amounts due within the next twelve months for these purchase obligations were $2,188, while longer term payments were $1,580. for further information, see note 14, "commitments and contingencies," of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k.
•investment commitments: these include unfunded capital commitments for alternative investments and low-income housing tax credits. estimated amounts due were $1,321, including $298 due within the next twelve months.
in addition to the contractual obligations and commitments discussed above, we have a variety of other contractual agreements related to acquiring materials and services used in our operations. however, we do not believe these other agreements contain material noncancelable commitments.
we regularly review the appropriate use of capital, including acquisitions, common stock and debt security repurchases and dividends to shareholders. the declaration and payment of any dividends or repurchases of our common stock or debt is at the discretion of our board of directors and depends upon our financial condition, results of operations, future liquidity needs, regulatory and capital requirements and other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors.
on january 23, 2024, our audit committee declared a quarterly cash dividend to shareholders of $1.63 per share on the outstanding shares of our common stock. this quarterly dividend is payable on march 22, 2024 to the shareholders of record as of march 8, 2024.
under our board of directors' authorization, we maintain a common stock repurchase program. as of december 31, 2023, we had board authorization of $4,200 to repurchase our common stock. no duration has been placed on our common stock repurchase program, and we reserve the right to discontinue the program at any time. we intend to utilize this authorization over a multi-year period, subject to market and industry conditions.
we believe that funds from future operating cash flows, cash and investments and funds available under our credit facilities and/or from public or private financing sources will be sufficient for future operations and commitments, and for capital acquisitions and other strategic transactions.
we do not have any off-balance sheet derivative instruments, guarantee transactions, agreements or other contractual arrangements or any indemnification agreements that will require funding in future periods. we have not transferred assets to an unconsolidated entity that serves as credit, liquidity or market risk support to such entity. we do not hold any variable interest in an unconsolidated entity where such entity provides us with financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support.
see note 2 "subsidiary transactions," of the notes to condensed financial statements (parent company only) included in part iv, item 15 of this annual report on form 10-k for additional detail on the elevance health, inc. parent guarantees of certain subsidiaries.

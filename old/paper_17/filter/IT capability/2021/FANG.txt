item 1a. risk factors the nature of our business activities subjects us to certain hazards and risks. the following is a summary of some of the material risks relating to our business activities. other risks are described in item 1. "business and properties," item 7. "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" and item 7a. "quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk." these risks are not the only risks we face. we could also face additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial. if any of these risks actually occurs, it could materially harm our business, financial condition or results of operations and the trading price of our shares could decline.
risks related to the oil and natural gas industry and our business our business and operations have been and will likely continue to be adversely affected by the ongoing covid-19 pandemic and volatility in the oil and natural gas markets. in addition, if commodity prices decrease, our production, estimates of proved reserves and liquidity may be adversely affected.
after turning negative in april 2020, nymex wti prices have recovered, closing at $85.43 per bbl as of january 18, 2022, as demand for oil and natural gas increased and many restrictions on conducting business implemented in response to the covid-19 pandemic were lifted due to improved treatments and availability of vaccinations in the u.s. and globally. the emergence of the delta covid-19 variant in the latter part of 2021 and the subsequent surge of the highly transmissible omicron variant, however, contributed to economic and pricing volatility as industry and market participants evaluated industry conditions and production outlook. despite the recent recovery in demand for oil and natural gas and commodity prices, we have kept production on our acreage relatively flat during 2021, using excess cash flow for debt repayment and/or return to our stockholders rather than expanding our drilling program. we intend to continue exercising capital discipline by maintaining our oil production flat in 2022 at the fourth quarter 2021 level. we cannot reasonably predict whether production levels will remain at current levels or the full extent of the events above and any subsequent recovery may have on our industry and our business.
due to the improvement in commodity pricing environment and industry conditions, we did not record any impairments in 2021. however, if commodity prices fall below current levels, we may be required to record impairments in future periods and such impairments could be material. further, if commodity prices decrease, our production, proved reserves and cash flows will be adversely impacted. reductions in our reserves could also negatively impact the borrowing base under our revolving credit facility, which could limit our liquidity and ability to conduct additional exploration and development activities.
the ongoing covid-19 pandemic continues to present operational, health, labor, logistics and other challenges, and it is difficult to assess the ultimate impact of the covid-19 pandemic on our business, financial condition and cash flows.
there are many variables and uncertainties regarding the covid-19 pandemic, including the emergence, contagiousness and threat of new and different strains of the virus and their severity; the effectiveness of treatments or vaccines against the virus or its new strains; the extent of travel restrictions, business closures and other measures that are or may be imposed in affected areas or countries by governmental authorities; disruptions in the supply chain; an increasingly competitive labor market due to a sustained labor shortage or increased turnover caused by the covid-19 pandemic; increased logistics costs; additional costs due to remote working arrangements, adherence to social distancing guidelines and other covid-19-related challenges. further, there remain increased risks of cyberattacks on information technology systems used in a remote working environment; increased privacy-related risks due to processing health-related personal information; absence of workforce due to illness; the impact of the pandemic on any of our contractual counterparties; and other factors that are currently unknown or considered immaterial. it is difficult to assess the ultimate impact of the covid-19 pandemic on our business, financial condition and cash flows.
market conditions for oil and natural gas, and particularly volatility in prices for oil and natural gas, have in the past adversely affected, and may in the future adversely affect, our revenue, cash flows, profitability, growth, production and the present value of our estimated reserves.
our revenues, operating results, profitability, future rate of growth and the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties depend significantly upon the prevailing prices for oil and natural gas. historically, oil and natural gas prices have been volatile and are subject to fluctuations in response to changes in supply and demand, market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control, including the domestic and foreign supply of oil and natural gas; the level of prices and expectations about future prices of oil and natural gas; the level of global oil and natural gas exploration and production; the cost of exploring for, developing, producing and delivering oil and natural gas; the price and quantity of foreign imports; political and economic conditions in oil producing countries, including the middle east, africa, south america and russia; the potential impact of any russian-ukrainian conflict on the global energy markets; the continued threat of terrorism and the impact of military and other action, including u.s. military operations in the middle east; the ability of members of the opec+ to agree to and maintain oil price and production controls; speculative trading in crude oil and natural gas derivative contracts; the level of consumer product demand; extreme weather conditions and other natural disasters; risks associated with operating drilling rigs; technological advances affecting energy consumption; the price and availability of alternative fuels; domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes, including the biden administration's energy and environmental policies; global or national health concerns, including the outbreak of pandemic or contagious disease, such as covid-19 and its variants; the proximity, cost, availability and capacity of oil and natural gas pipelines and other transportation facilities; and overall domestic and global economic conditions. our results of operations may also be adversely impacted by any future government rule, regulation or order that may impose production limits, as well as pipeline capacity and storage constraints, in the permian basin where we operate.
these factors and the volatility of the energy markets make it extremely difficult to predict future oil and natural gas price movements with any certainty. during 2021, nymex wti prices ranged from $47.62 to $84.65 per bbl and the nymex henry hub price of natural gas ranged from $2.45 to $6.31 per mmbtu. if the prices of oil and natural gas decline, our operations, financial condition and level of expenditures for the development of our oil and natural gas reserves may be materially and adversely affected.
a significant portion of our net leasehold acreage is undeveloped, or acreage on which wells have not been drilled or completed to a point that would permit the production of commercial quantities of oil and natural gas regardless of whether such acreage contains proved reserves. in addition, many of our oil and natural gas leases require us to drill wells that are commercially productive and to maintain the production in paying quantities, and if we are unsuccessful in drilling such wells and maintaining such production, we could lose our rights under such leases. our future oil and natural gas reserves and production and, therefore, our future cash flow and income are highly dependent on successfully developing our undeveloped leasehold acreage.
our development and exploration operations and our ability to complete acquisitions require substantial capital and we may be unable to obtain needed capital or financing on satisfactory terms or at all, which could lead to a loss of properties and a decline in our oil and natural gas reserves.
the oil and natural gas industry is capital intensive. we make and expect to continue to make substantial capital expenditures in our business and operations for the exploration for and development, production and acquisition of oil and natural gas reserves. in 2021, our total capital expenditures, including expenditures for drilling, completion, infrastructure and additions to midstream assets, were approximately $1.5 billion. our 2022 capital budget for drilling, completion and infrastructure, including investments in water disposal infrastructure and gathering line projects, is currently estimated to be approximately $1.75 billion to $1.90 billion, representing an increase of 23% from our 2021 capital expenditures. since completing our initial public offering in october 2012, we have financed capital expenditures primarily with borrowings under our revolving credit facility, cash generated by operations and the net proceeds from public offerings of our common stock and the senior notes.
we intend to finance our future capital expenditures with cash flow from operations, while future acquisitions may also be funded from operations as well as proceeds from offerings of our debt and equity securities and borrowings under our revolving credit facility. our cash flow from operations and access to capital are subject to a number of variables, including our proved reserves; the volume of oil and natural gas we are able to produce from existing wells; the prices at which our oil and natural gas are sold; our ability to acquire, locate and produce economically new reserves; and our ability to borrow under our credit facility.
we cannot assure you that our operations and other capital resources will provide cash in sufficient amounts to maintain planned or future levels of capital expenditures. further, our actual capital expenditures in 2022 could exceed our capital expenditure budget. in the event our capital expenditure requirements at any time are greater than the amount of capital we have available, we could be required to seek additional sources of capital, which may include traditional reserve base borrowings, debt financing, joint venture partnerships, production payment financings, sales of assets, offerings of debt or equity securities or other means. we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain debt or equity financing on terms favorable to us, or at all.
if we are unable to fund our capital requirements or our costs of capital increase, we may be required to curtail our operations relating to the exploration and development of our prospects, which in turn could lead to a possible loss of properties and a decline in our oil and natural gas reserves, or we may be otherwise unable to implement our development plan, complete acquisitions or take advantage of business opportunities or respond to competitive pressures, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our production, revenues and results of operations. in addition, a delay in or the failure to complete proposed or future infrastructure projects could delay or eliminate potential efficiencies and related cost savings.
our success depends on finding, developing or acquiring additional reserves.
our future success depends upon our ability to find, develop or acquire additional oil and natural gas reserves that are economically recoverable. our proved reserves will generally decline as reserves are depleted, except to the extent that we conduct successful exploration or development activities or acquire properties containing proved reserves, or both. to increase reserves and production, we undertake development, exploration and other replacement activities or use third parties to accomplish these activities. if we are unable to replace our current production, the value of our reserves will decrease, and our business, financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected. furthermore, although our revenues may increase if prevailing oil and natural gas prices increase significantly, our finding costs for additional reserves could also increase.
our failure to successfully identify, complete and integrate pending and future acquisitions of properties or businesses could reduce our earnings and slow our growth.
there is intense competition for acquisition opportunities in our industry. the successful acquisition of producing properties requires an assessment of several factors, including recoverable reserves, future oil and natural gas prices and their applicable differentials, operating costs, and potential environmental and other liabilities.
the accuracy of these assessments is inherently uncertain, and we may not be able to identify attractive acquisition opportunities. in connection with these assessments, we perform a review of the subject properties that we believe to be generally consistent with industry practices. our review will not reveal all existing or potential problems nor will it permit us to become sufficiently familiar with the properties to assess fully their deficiencies and capabilities. inspections may not always be performed on every well, and environmental problems, such as groundwater contamination, are not necessarily observable even when an inspection is undertaken. even when problems are identified, the seller may be unwilling or unable to provide effective contractual protection against all or part of the problems. even if we do identify attractive acquisition opportunities, we may not be able to complete the acquisition or do so on commercially acceptable terms.
competition for acquisitions may increase the cost of, or cause us to refrain from, completing acquisitions. our ability to complete acquisitions is dependent upon, among other things, our ability to obtain debt and equity financing and, in some cases, regulatory approvals. if these acquisitions include geographic regions in which we do not currently operate, we could be subject to unforeseen operating difficulties and difficulties in coordinating geographically dispersed operations, personnel and facilities. in addition, if we enter into new geographic markets, we may be subject to additional and unfamiliar legal and regulatory requirements. compliance with regulatory requirements may impose substantial additional obligations on us and our management, cause us to expend additional time and resources in compliance activities and increase our exposure to penalties or fines for non-compliance with such additional legal requirements. further, the success of any completed acquisition will depend on our ability to integrate effectively the acquired business into our existing operations. the process of integrating acquired businesses may involve unforeseen difficulties and may require a disproportionate amount of our managerial and financial resources. in addition, possible future acquisitions may be larger and for purchase prices significantly higher than those paid for earlier acquisitions.
any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. our financial position and results of operations may also fluctuate significantly from period to period, based on whether or not significant acquisitions are completed in particular periods.
we may incur losses as a result of title defects in the properties in which we invest.
it is our practice in acquiring oil and natural gas leases or interests not to incur the expense of retaining lawyers to examine the title to the mineral interest. rather, we rely upon the judgment of oil and gas lease brokers or landmen who perform the fieldwork in examining records in the appropriate governmental office before attempting to acquire a lease in a specific mineral interest. the existence of a material title deficiency can render a lease worthless and can adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
prior to the drilling of an oil or natural gas well, however, it is the normal practice in our industry for the person or company acting as the operator of the well to obtain a preliminary title review to ensure there are no obvious defects in title to the well. frequently, as a result of such examinations, certain curative work must be done to correct defects in the marketability of the title, and such curative work entails expense. our failure to cure any title defects may delay or prevent us from utilizing the associated mineral interest, which may adversely impact our ability in the future to increase production and reserves. additionally, undeveloped acreage has greater risk of title defects than developed acreage. if there are any title defects or defects in the assignment of leasehold rights in properties in which we hold an interest, we will suffer a financial loss.
drilling for oil and natural gas often involves unprofitable efforts, not only from dry wells but also from wells that are productive but do not produce sufficient oil or natural gas to return a profit at then realized prices after deducting drilling, operating and other costs.
as of december 31, 2021, we have approximately 9,314 gross (6,311 net) identified economic potential horizontal drilling locations in multiple horizons on our acreage at an assumed price of approximately $50.00 per bbl wti. as of december 31, 2021, only 602 of our gross identified economic potential horizontal drilling locations were attributed to proved reserves. these drilling locations, including those without proved undeveloped reserves, represent a significant part of our growth strategy. our ability to drill and develop these locations depends on a number of uncertainties, including the availability of capital, construction of infrastructure, unusual or unexpected geological formations, title problems, facility or equipment malfunctions, unexpected operational events, inclement weather, environmental and other regulatory requirements and approvals, oil and natural gas prices, costs, drilling results and the availability of water. further, our identified potential drilling locations are in various stages of evaluation, ranging from locations that are ready to drill to locations that will require substantial additional interpretation. in addition, as of december 31, 2021, we have identified approximately 2,531 horizontal drilling locations in intervals in which we have drilled very few or no wells, which are necessarily more speculative and based on results from other operators whose acreage may not be consistent with ours. we cannot predict in advance of drilling and testing whether any particular drilling location will yield oil or natural gas in sufficient quantities to recover drilling or completion costs or to be economically viable. the use of technologies and the study of producing fields in the same area will not enable us to know conclusively prior to drilling whether oil or natural gas will be present or, if present, whether oil or natural gas will be present in sufficient quantities to be economically viable. even if sufficient amounts of oil or natural gas exist, we may damage the potentially productive hydrocarbon bearing formation or experience mechanical difficulties while drilling or completing the well, possibly resulting in a reduction in production from the well or abandonment of the well. if we drill additional wells that we identify as dry holes in our current and future drilling locations, our drilling success rate may decline and materially harm our business. through december 31, 2021, we are the operator of, have participated in, or have acquired working interest in a total of 2,842 horizontal producing wells completed on our acreage. we cannot assure you that the analogies we draw from available data from these or other wells, more fully explored locations or producing fields will be applicable to our drilling locations. further, initial production rates reported by us or other operators in the permian basin may not be indicative of future or long-term production rates. because of these uncertainties, we do not know if the potential drilling locations we have identified will ever be drilled or if we will be able to produce oil or natural gas from these or any other potential drilling locations. as such, our actual drilling activities may materially differ from those presently identified, which could adversely affect our business.
our acreage must be drilled before lease expiration, generally within three to five years, in order to hold the acreage by production. in a highly competitive market for acreage, failure to drill sufficient wells to hold acreage may result in a substantial lease renewal cost or, if renewal is not feasible, loss of our lease and prospective drilling opportunities.
leases on oil and natural gas properties typically have a term of three to five years, after which they expire unless, prior to expiration, production is established within the spacing units covering the undeveloped acres. the cost to renew such leases may increase significantly, and we may not be able to renew such leases on commercially reasonable terms or at all. any reduction in our current drilling program, either through a reduction in capital expenditures or the unavailability of drilling rigs, could result in the loss of acreage through lease expirations. in order to hold our current leases expiring in 2022, we will need to operate at least a one-rig program. any non-renewal or other loss of leases could materially and adversely affect the growth of our asset basis, cash flows and results of operations.
we have entered into commodity price derivatives for a portion of our production. although we have hedged a portion of our estimated 2022 and 2023 production, we may still be adversely affected by declines in the price of oil and may be exposed to other risks, including counterparty credit risk.
we use commodity price derivatives to reduce price volatility associated with certain of our oil and natural gas sales. to the extent that the prices of oil and natural gas remain at current levels or decline further, we may not be able to economically hedge future production at the same level as our current hedges, and our results of operations and financial condition may be negatively impacted.
at settlement, market prices for commodities may exceed the contract prices in our commodity price derivatives agreements, resulting in our need to make significant cash payments to our counterparties. further, by using commodity derivative instruments, we expose ourselves to credit risk if we are in a positive position at contract settlement and the counterparty fails to perform under the terms of the derivative contract. we do not require collateral from our counterparties.
for additional information regarding our outstanding derivative contracts as of december 31, 2021, see note 15-derivatives to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.
if production from our permian basin acreage decreases due to decreased developmental activities, production related difficulties or otherwise, we may fail to meet our obligations to deliver specified quantities of oil under our oil purchase contracts, which will result in deficiency payments to the counterparty and may have an adverse effect on our operations.
we are a party to long-term crude oil agreements under which, subject to certain terms and conditions, we are obligated to deliver specified quantities of oil to our counterparties. our maximum delivery obligation under these agreements varies for different periods and depends in some cases upon certain conditions beyond our control. if production from our permian basin acreage decreases due to decreased developmental activities, as a result of the low commodity price environment, production related difficulties or otherwise, we may be unable to meet our obligations under our oil purchase agreements, which may result in deficiency payments to certain counterparties or a default under such agreements and may have an adverse effect on our company.
the inability of one or more of our customers to meet their obligations may adversely affect our financial results.
in addition to credit risk related to receivables from commodity derivative contracts, our principal exposure to credit risk is through receivables from joint interest owners on properties we operate (approximately $72 million at december 31, 2021) and receivables from purchasers of our oil and natural gas production (approximately $598 million at december 31, 2021). joint interest receivables arise from billing entities that own partial interests in the wells we operate. these entities participate in our wells primarily based on their ownership in leases on which we wish to drill. we are generally unable to control which co-owners participate in our wells.
we are also subject to credit risk due to the concentration of our oil and natural gas receivables with several significant customers. see "business and properties-oil and natural gas production prices and production costs-marketing and customers" for additional information regarding these customers. this concentration of customers may impact our overall credit risk in that these entities may be similarly affected by any adverse changes in economic and other conditions. we do not require our customers to post collateral. under certain circumstances, the revenue due to them can be offset by any unpaid receivables. the inability or failure of our significant customers or joint working interest owners to meet their obligations to us or their insolvency or liquidation may materially adversely affect our financial results.
we account for our oil and natural gas producing activities using the full cost method of accounting. accordingly, all costs incurred in the acquisition, exploration and development of proved oil and natural gas properties, including the costs of abandoned properties, dry holes, geophysical costs and annual lease rentals are capitalized. we also capitalize direct operating costs for services performed with internally owned drilling and well servicing equipment.
the net capitalized costs of proved oil and natural gas properties are subject to a full cost ceiling limitation in which the costs are not allowed to exceed their related estimated future net revenues discounted at 10%. to the extent capitalized costs of evaluated oil and natural gas properties, net of accumulated depreciation, depletion, amortization and impairment, exceed the discounted future net revenues of proved oil and natural gas reserves, the excess capitalized costs are charged to expense. we use the unweighted arithmetic average first day of the month price for oil and natural gas for the 12-month period preceding the calculation date in estimating discounted future net revenues.
our estimated reserves and eurs are based on many assumptions that may turn out to be inaccurate. any material inaccuracies in these reserve estimates or underlying assumptions will materially affect the quantities and present value of our reserves.
oil and natural gas reserve engineering is not an exact science and requires subjective estimates of underground accumulations of oil and natural gas and assumptions concerning future oil and natural gas prices, production levels, ultimate recoveries and operating and development costs. as a result, estimated quantities of proved reserves, projections of future production rates and the timing of development expenditures may be incorrect. the eurs for our horizontal wells are based on management's internal estimates. over time, we may make material changes to reserve estimates taking into account the results of actual drilling, testing and production. also, certain assumptions regarding future oil and natural gas prices, production levels and operating and development costs may prove incorrect. any significant variance from these assumptions to actual figures could greatly affect our estimates of reserves, the economically recoverable quantities of oil and natural gas attributable to any particular group of properties, the classifications of reserves based on risk of recovery and estimates of future net cash flows. a substantial portion of our reserve estimates are made without the benefit of a lengthy production history, which are less reliable than estimates based on a lengthy production history. numerous changes over time to the assumptions on which our reserve estimates are based, as described above, often result in the actual quantities of oil and natural gas that we ultimately recover being different from our reserve estimates. reserve estimates do not include any value for probable or possible reserves that may exist, nor do they include any value for unproved undeveloped acreage. the reserve estimates represent our net revenue interest in our properties.
the timing of both our production and our incurrence of costs in connection with the development and production of oil and natural gas properties will affect the timing of actual future net cash flows from proved reserves.
the present value of future net cash flow from our proved reserves, or standardized measure, and our related pv-10 calculation, may not represent the current market value of our estimated proved oil reserves. in accordance with sec requirements, we base the estimated discounted future net cash flow from our estimated proved reserves on the 12-month average oil index prices, calculated as the unweighted arithmetic average for the first-day-of-the-month price for each month and costs in effect as of the date of the estimate, holding the prices and costs constant throughout the life of the properties.
actual future prices and costs may differ materially from those used in the net present value estimate, and future net present value estimates using then current prices and costs may be significantly less than current estimates. in addition, the 10% discount factor we use when calculating discounted future net cash flow for reporting requirements in compliance with the financial accounting standard board codification 932, "extractive activities-oil and gas," may not be the most appropriate discount factor based on interest rates in effect from time to time and risks associated with us or the oil and natural gas industry in general.
the development of our proved undeveloped reserves may take longer and may require higher levels of capital expenditures than we currently anticipate.
approximately 33% of our total estimated proved reserves as of december 31, 2021, were proved undeveloped reserves and may not be ultimately developed or produced. recovery of proved undeveloped reserves requires significant capital expenditures and successful drilling and completion operations. the reserve data included in the reserve reports of our independent petroleum engineers assume that substantial capital expenditures are required to develop such reserves. we cannot be certain that the estimated costs of the development of these reserves are accurate, that development will occur as scheduled or that the results of such development will be as estimated. delays in the development of our reserves, increases in costs to drill and develop such reserves, or further decreases in commodity prices will reduce the future net revenues of our estimated proved undeveloped reserves and may result in some projects becoming uneconomical. in addition, delays in the development of reserves could force us to reclassify certain of our proved reserves as unproved reserves.
our producing properties are located in the permian basin of west texas, making us vulnerable to risks associated with operating in a single geographic area. in addition, we have a large amount of proved reserves attributable to a small number of producing horizons within this area.
our producing properties are currently geographically concentrated in the permian basin of west texas. as a result of this concentration, we may be disproportionately exposed to the impact of regional supply and demand factors, delays or interruptions of production from wells in this area caused by governmental regulation, processing or transportation capacity constraints, availability of equipment, facilities, personnel or services market limitations or interruption of the processing or transportation of crude oil, natural gas or natural gas liquids and extreme weather conditions, such as the severe winter storms in the permian basin in february 2021, and their adverse impact on production volumes, availability of electrical power, road accessibility and transportation facilities. in addition, the effect of fluctuations on supply and demand may become more pronounced within specific geographic oil and natural gas producing areas such as the permian basin, which may cause these conditions to occur with greater frequency or magnify the effects of these conditions. due to the concentrated nature of our portfolio of properties, a number of our properties could experience any of the same conditions at the same time, resulting in a relatively greater impact on our results of operations than they might have on other companies that have a more diversified portfolio of properties. such delays or interruptions could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
in addition to the geographic concentration of our producing properties described above, as of december 31, 2021, most of our proved reserves are concentrated in the wolfberry play in the midland basin. this concentration of assets within a small number of producing horizons exposes us to additional risks, such as changes in field-wide rules and regulations that could cause us to permanently or temporarily shut-in all of our wells within a field.
we depend upon several significant purchasers for the sale of most of our oil and natural gas production. the loss of one or more of these purchasers could, among other factors, limit our access to suitable markets for the oil and natural gas we produce.
the availability of a ready market for any oil and/or natural gas we produce depends on numerous factors beyond the control of our management, including but not limited to the extent of domestic production and imports of oil, the proximity and capacity of natural gas pipelines, the availability of skilled labor, materials and equipment, the effect of state and federal regulation of oil and natural gas production and federal regulation of natural gas sold in interstate commerce. we cannot assure you that we will continue to have ready access to suitable markets for our future oil and natural gas production. in addition, we depend upon several significant purchasers for the sale of most of our oil and natural gas production. see "business and properties-oil and natural gas production prices and production costs-marketing and customers" for additional information regarding these customers. the loss of one or more of these customers, and our inability to sell our production to other customers on terms we consider acceptable, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.
the unavailability, high cost or shortages of rigs, equipment, raw materials, supplies, oilfield services or personnel may restrict our operations.
the oil and natural gas industry is cyclical, which can result in shortages of drilling rigs, equipment, raw materials (particularly sand and other proppants), supplies and personnel. when shortages occur, the costs and delivery times of rigs, equipment and supplies increase and demand for, and wage rates of, qualified drilling rig crews also rise with increases in demand. we cannot predict whether these conditions will exist in the future and, if so, what their timing and duration will be. in accordance with customary industry practice, we rely on independent third party service providers to provide most of the services necessary to drill new wells. if we are unable to secure a sufficient number of drilling rigs at reasonable costs, our financial condition and results of operations could suffer, and we may not be able to drill all of our acreage before our leases expire. in addition, we do not have long-term contracts securing the use of our existing rigs, and the operators of those rigs may choose to cease providing services to us. shortages of drilling rigs, equipment, raw materials (particularly sand and other proppants), supplies, personnel, trucking services, tubulars, fracking and completion services and production equipment could delay or restrict our exploration and development operations, which in turn could impair our financial condition and results of operations.
our operations are substantially dependent on the availability of water. restrictions on our ability to obtain water may have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
water is an essential component of deep shale oil and natural gas production during both the drilling and hydraulic fracturing processes. historically, we have been able to purchase water from local land owners for use in our operations. over the past several years, texas has experienced extreme drought conditions. as a result of this severe drought, some local water districts have begun restricting the use of water subject to their jurisdiction for hydraulic fracturing to protect local water supply. if we are unable to obtain water to use in our operations from local sources, or we are unable to effectively utilize flowback water, we may be unable to economically drill for or produce oil and natural gas, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
recent regulatory restrictions on use of produced water and a moratorium on new produced water disposal wells in the permian basin to stem rising seismic activity and earthquakes could increase our operating costs and adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.
in september 2021, the texas railroad commission curtailed the amount of produced water companies were permitted to inject into some wells near midland and odessa in the permian basin, and has since indefinitely suspended some permits there and expanded the restrictions to other areas. these actions were taken in an effort to control induced seismic activity and recent increases in earthquakes in the permian basin, which have been linked by the u.s. and local seismologists to wastewater disposal in oil fields. these restrictions on the disposal of produced water and a moratorium on new produced water disposal wells could result in increased operating costs, requiring us or our service providers to truck produced water, recycle it or dispose of it by other means, all of which could be costly. we or our service providers may also need to limit disposal well volumes, disposal rates and pressures or locations, or require us or our service providers to shut down or curtail the injection of produced water into disposal wells. these factors may make drilling activity in the affected parts of the permian basin less economical and adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.
our development of and participation in an increasingly larger number of drilling locations has required and will continue to require substantial capital expenditures. the uncertainty and risks described in this report may impede our ability to economically find, develop and acquire oil and natural gas reserves. as a result, we may not be able to achieve or sustain profitability or positive cash flows from our operating activities in the future.
part of our strategy involves drilling in existing or emerging shale plays using the latest available horizontal drilling and completion techniques; therefore, the results of our planned exploratory drilling in these plays are subject to risks associated with drilling and completion techniques and drilling results may not meet our expectations for reserves or production.
our operations involve developing and utilizing the latest drilling and completion techniques. risks that we face while drilling include, but are not limited to, the following:
risks that we face while completing our wells include, but are not limited to, being able to:
•prevent unintentional communication with other wells.
furthermore, certain of the new techniques we are adopting, such as infill drilling and multi-well pad drilling, may cause irregularities or interruptions in production due to, in the case of infill drilling, offset wells being shut in and, in the case of multi-well pad drilling, the time required to drill and complete multiple wells before any such wells begin producing. the results of our drilling in new or emerging formations are more uncertain initially than drilling results in areas that are more developed and have a longer history of established production. newer or emerging formations and areas often have limited or no production history and consequently we are less able to predict future drilling results in these areas.
ultimately, the success of these drilling and completion techniques can only be evaluated as more wells are drilled and production profiles are established over a sufficiently long time period. if our drilling results are less than anticipated or we are unable to execute our drilling program because of capital constraints, lease expirations, access to gathering systems, and/or declines in natural gas and oil prices, the return on our investment in these areas may not be as attractive as we anticipate. further, as a result of any of these developments we could incur material write-downs of our oil and natural gas properties and the value of our undeveloped acreage could decline in the future.
fuel conservation measures, alternative fuel requirements, increasing consumer demand for alternatives to oil and natural gas, technological advances in fuel economy and energy generation devices could reduce demand for oil and natural gas. the impact of the changing demand for oil and natural gas services and products may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
the marketability of our production is dependent upon transportation and other facilities, certain of which we do not control. if these facilities are unavailable, our operations could be interrupted and our revenues reduced.
the marketability of our oil and natural gas production depends in part upon the availability, proximity and capacity of transportation facilities owned by third parties. our oil production is transported from the wellhead to our tank batteries by our gathering line, which interconnects with third party pipelines. our natural gas production is generally transported by our gathering lines from the wellhead to an interconnection point with a purchaser or into a third-party gathering system. we do not control third party transportation facilities and our access to them may be limited or denied. insufficient production from our wells to support the construction of pipeline facilities by our purchasers or a significant disruption in the availability of our or third party transportation facilities or other production facilities could adversely impact our ability to deliver to market or produce our oil and natural gas and thereby cause a significant interruption in our operations. for example, on certain occasions we have experienced high line pressure at our tank batteries with occasional flaring due to the inability of the gas gathering systems in the areas in which we operate to support the increased production of natural gas in the permian basin. if, in the future, we are unable, for any sustained period, to implement acceptable delivery or transportation arrangements or encounter production related difficulties, we may be required to shut in or curtail production. in addition, the amount of oil and natural gas that can be produced and sold may be subject to curtailment in certain other circumstances outside of our control, such as pipeline interruptions due to maintenance, excessive pressure, ability of downstream processing facilities to accept unprocessed gas, physical damage to the gathering or transportation system or lack of contracted capacity on such systems. the curtailments arising from these and similar circumstances may last from a few days to several months, and in many cases, we are provided with limited, if any, notice as to when these circumstances will arise and their duration. any such shut in or curtailment, or an inability to obtain favorable terms for delivery of the oil and natural gas produced from our fields, would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
our oil and natural gas operations are subject to various federal, state and local governmental regulations that may be changed from time to time in response to economic and political conditions. matters subject to regulation include discharge permits for drilling operations, drilling bonds, reports concerning operations, the spacing of wells, unitization and pooling of properties and taxation. from time to time, regulatory agencies have imposed price controls and limitations on production by restricting the rate of flow of oil and natural gas wells below actual production capacity to conserve supplies of oil and natural gas. in addition, the production, handling, storage, transportation, remediation, emission and disposal of oil and natural gas, by-products thereof and other substances and materials produced or used in connection with oil and natural gas operations are subject to regulation under federal, state and local laws and regulations primarily relating to protection of human health and the environment. failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of sanctions, including administrative, civil or criminal penalties, permit revocations, requirements for additional pollution controls and injunctions limiting or prohibiting some or all of our operations. further, these laws and regulations imposed strict requirements for water and air pollution control and solid waste management. significant expenditures may be required to comply with governmental laws and regulations applicable to us. in addition, federal and state legislation and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing could result in increased costs and additional operating restrictions or delays. even if federal regulatory burdens temporarily ease, the historic trend of more expansive and stricter environmental legislation and regulations may continue in the long-term, and at the state and local levels. see item 1. "business-regulation" for a detailed description of certain laws and regulations that affect us.
restrictions on drilling activities intended to protect certain species of wildlife may adversely affect our ability to conduct drilling activities in some of the areas where we operate.
oil and natural gas operations in our operating areas can be adversely affected by seasonal or permanent restrictions on drilling activities designed to protect various wildlife. seasonal restrictions may limit our ability to operate in protected areas and can intensify competition for drilling rigs, oilfield equipment, services, supplies and qualified personnel, which may lead to periodic shortages when drilling is allowed. these constraints and the resulting shortages or high costs could delay our operations and materially increase our operating and capital costs. permanent restrictions imposed to protect threatened or endangered species could prohibit drilling in certain areas or require the implementation of expensive mitigation measures. the designation of previously unprotected species in areas where we operate as threatened or endangered could cause us to incur increased costs arising from species protection measures or could result in limitations on our exploration and production activities that could have an adverse impact on our ability to develop and produce our reserves.
derivatives reform legislation and related regulations could have an adverse effect on our ability to hedge risks associated with our business.
the july 2010 dodd-frank wall street reform and consumer protection act, which we refer to as dodd-frank act, provides for federal oversight of the over-the-counter derivatives market and entities that participate in that market and mandates that the commodity futures trading commission, which we refer to as the cftc, the sec, and federal regulators of financial institutions, which we refer to as the prudential regulators, adopt rules or regulations implementing the dodd-frank act and providing definitions of terms used in the dodd-frank act. the dodd-frank act establishes margin requirements and requires clearing and trade execution practices for certain market participants and may result in certain market participants needing to curtail or cease their derivatives activities.
although some of the rules necessary to implement the dodd-frank act remain to be adopted, the cftc, the sec and the prudential regulators have issued many rules to implement the dodd-frank act, including a rule, which we refer to as the mandatory clearing rule, requiring clearing of hedges, or swaps, that are subject to it (currently, only certain interest rate and credit default swaps), a rule, which we refer to as the end user exception, establishing an "end user" exception to the mandatory clearing rule, a rule, which we refer to as the margin rule, setting forth collateral requirements in connection with swaps that are not cleared and also an exception to the margin rule for end users that are not financial end users, which exception we refer to as the non-financial end user exception, and a rule imposing position limits, which we refer to as the position limit rule, and also an exception to the position limit rule for swaps that constitute a "bona fide hedging transaction or position" within the definition of such term under the position limit rule, subject to the party claiming the exemption complying with the applicable filing, recordkeeping and reporting requirements of the position limit rule, which we refer to as the bona fide hedging exception.
we qualify for the end user exception to the mandatory clearing rule, we qualify for the non-financial end user exception and will not be required to post margin in connection with uncleared swaps under the margin rule, and each of our existing and anticipated hedging positions constitutes a "bona fide hedging transaction or position" under the position limit rule and we intend to undertake the filing, recordkeeping and reporting necessary to utilize the bona fide hedging exception under the position limit rule, so we do not expect to be directly affected by any of such rules. however, most if not all of our hedge counterparties will be subject to mandatory clearing in connection with their hedging activities with parties who do not qualify for the end user exception and will be required to post margin in connection with their hedging activities with other swap dealers, major swap participants, financial end users and other persons that do not qualify for the non-financial end user exception. in addition, the european union and other non-u.s. jurisdictions have enacted laws and regulations (including laws and regulations giving the european union financial authorities the power to write-down amounts we may be owed on hedging agreements with counterparties subject to such laws and regulations and/or require that we accept equity interests in such counterparties in lieu of cash in satisfaction of such amounts), which we refer to collectively as foreign regulations, which may apply to our transactions with counterparties subject to such foreign regulations, which we refer to as foreign counterparties, and the u.s. adopted law and rules, which we call the u.s. resolution stay rules, clarifying similar rights of u.s. banking authorities with respect to banking institutions subject to their regulation. the dodd-frank act, the rules which have been adopted and not vacated, the limit rule and the u.s. resolution stay rules could significantly increase the cost of our derivative contracts, materially alter the terms of our derivative contracts, reduce the availability of derivatives to us that we have historically used to protect against risks that we encounter in our business, reduce our ability to monetize or restructure our existing derivative contracts and increase our exposure to less creditworthy counterparties. the foreign regulations could have similar effects. if we reduce our use of derivatives as a result of the dodd-frank act and regulation, the u.s. resolution stay rules and foreign regulations, our results of operations may become more volatile and our cash flows may be less predictable, which could adversely affect our ability to plan for and fund capital expenditures. finally, the dodd-frank act was intended, in part, to reduce the volatility of oil and natural gas prices, which some legislators attributed to speculative trading in derivatives and commodity contracts related to oil and natural gas. our revenues could therefore be adversely affected if a consequence of the dodd-frank act and regulations is to lower commodity prices. any of these consequences could have a material adverse effect on us, our financial condition and our results of operations.
future u.s. tax legislation may adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flow.
from time to time, legislation has been proposed that, if enacted into law, would make significant changes to u.s. federal and state income tax laws affecting the oil and natural gas industry, including (i) eliminating the immediate deduction for intangible drilling and development costs, (ii) the repeal of the percentage depletion allowance for oil and natural gas properties; and (iii) an extension of the amortization period for certain geological and geophysical expenditures. no accurate prediction can be made as to whether any such legislative changes will be proposed or enacted in the future or, if enacted, what the specific provisions or the effective date of any such legislation would be. these proposed changes in the u.s. tax law, if adopted, or other similar changes that would impose additional tax on our activities or reduce or eliminate deductions currently available with respect to natural gas and oil exploration, development or similar activities, could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flow.
we operate in areas of high industry activity, which may affect our ability to hire, train or retain qualified personnel needed to manage and operate our assets.
our operations and drilling activity are concentrated in the permian basin in west texas, an area in which industry activity has increased rapidly. as a result, demand for qualified personnel in this area, and the cost to attract and retain such personnel, has increased over the past few years due to competition and may increase substantially in the future. moreover, our competitors may be able to offer better compensation packages to attract and retain qualified personnel than we are able to offer.
any delay or inability to secure the personnel necessary for us to continue or complete our current and planned development activities could lead to a reduction in production volumes.  any such negative effect on production volumes, or significant increases in costs, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
many key responsibilities within our business have been assigned to a small number of employees. the loss of their services could adversely affect our business. in particular, the loss of the services of one or more members of our executive team, including our chief executive officer, travis d. stice, could disrupt our operations. we do not have employment agreements with our executives and may not be able to assure their retention. further, we do not maintain "key person" life insurance policies on any of our employees. as a result, we are not insured against any losses resulting from the death of our key employees.
operating hazards and uninsured risks may result in substantial losses and could prevent us from realizing profits.
our operations are subject to all of the hazards and operating risks associated with drilling for and production of oil and natural gas, including the risk of fire, explosions, blowouts, surface cratering, uncontrollable flows of natural gas, oil and formation water, pipe or pipeline failures, abnormally pressured formations, casing collapses and environmental hazards such as oil spills, gas leaks and ruptures or discharges of toxic gases. in addition, our operations are subject to risks associated with hydraulic fracturing, including any mishandling, surface spillage or potential underground migration of fracturing fluids, including chemical additives. the occurrence of any of these events could result in substantial losses to us due to injury or loss of life, severe damage to or destruction of property, natural resources and equipment, pollution or other environmental damage, clean-up responsibilities, regulatory investigations and penalties, suspension of operations and repairs required to resume operations.
we endeavor to contractually allocate potential liabilities and risks between us and the parties that provide us with services and goods, which include pressure pumping and hydraulic fracturing, drilling and cementing services and tubular goods for surface, intermediate and production casing. under our agreements with our vendors, to the extent responsibility for environmental liability is allocated between the parties, (i) our vendors generally assume all responsibility for control and removal of pollution or contamination which originates above the surface of the land and is directly associated with such vendors' equipment while in their control and (ii) we generally assume the responsibility for control and removal of all other pollution or contamination which may occur during our operations, including pre-existing pollution and pollution which may result from fire, blowout, cratering, seepage or any other uncontrolled flow of oil, gas or other substances, as well as the use or disposition of all drilling fluids. in addition, we generally agree to indemnify our vendors for loss or destruction of vendor-owned property that occurs in the well hole (except for damage that occurs when a vendor is performing work on a footage, rather than day work, basis) or as a result of the use of equipment, certain corrosive fluids, additives, chemicals or proppants. however, despite this general allocation of risk, we might not succeed in enforcing such contractual allocation, might incur an unforeseen liability falling outside the scope of such allocation or may be required to enter into contractual arrangements with terms that vary from the above allocations of risk. as a result, we may incur substantial losses which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
in accordance with what we believe to be customary industry practice, we historically have maintained insurance against some, but not all, of our business risks. our insurance may not be adequate to cover any losses or liabilities we may suffer. also, insurance may no longer be available to us or, if it is, its availability may be at premium levels that do not justify its purchase. the occurrence of a significant uninsured claim, a claim in excess of the insurance coverage limits maintained by us or a claim at a time when we are not able to obtain liability insurance could have a material adverse effect on our ability to conduct normal business operations and on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flow. in addition, we may not be able to secure additional insurance or bonding that might be required by new governmental regulations. this may cause us to restrict our operations, which might severely impact our financial position. we may also be liable for environmental damage caused by previous owners of properties purchased by us, which liabilities may not be covered by insurance.
since hydraulic fracturing activities are part of our operations, we maintain insurance to protect against claims made for bodily injury and property damage, and that insurance includes coverage for clean-up costs stemming from a sudden and accidental pollution event. however, we may not have coverage if we are unaware of the pollution event and unable to report the "occurrence" to our insurance company within the time frame required under our insurance policy. we have limited coverage for gradual, long-term pollution events. in addition, these policies do not provide coverage for all liabilities, and we cannot assure you that the insurance coverage will be adequate to cover claims that may arise, or that we will be able to maintain adequate insurance at rates we consider reasonable. a loss not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
even when properly used and interpreted, 2-d and 3-d seismic data and visualization techniques are only tools used to assist geoscientists in identifying subsurface structures and hydrocarbon indicators and do not enable the interpreter to know whether hydrocarbons are, in fact, present in those structures. in addition, the use of 3-d seismic and other advanced technologies requires greater predrilling expenditures than traditional drilling strategies, and we could incur losses as a result of such expenditures. as a result, our drilling activities may not be successful or economical.
we may not be able to keep pace with technological developments in our industry.
the oil and natural gas industry is characterized by rapid and significant technological advancements and introductions of new products and services using new technologies. as others use or develop new technologies, we may be placed at a competitive disadvantage or may be forced by competitive pressures to implement those new technologies at substantial costs. in addition, other oil and natural gas companies may have greater financial, technical and personnel resources that allow them to enjoy technological advantages and that may in the future allow them to implement new technologies before we can. we may not be able to respond to these competitive pressures or implement new technologies on a timely basis or at an acceptable cost. if one or more of the technologies we use now or in the future were to become obsolete, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.
changes in environmental laws could increase our operating costs and adversely impact our business, financial condition and cash flows.
president biden has indicated that he is supportive of, and has issued executive orders promoting, various programs and initiatives designed to, among other things, curtail climate change, control the release of methane from new and existing oil and natural gas operations, and decarbonize electric generation and the transportation sector. it remains unclear what additional actions president biden will take and what support he will have for any potential legislative changes from congress. further, it is uncertain to what extent any new environmental laws or regulations, or any repeal of existing environmental laws or regulations, may affect our business or operations. however, such actions could significantly increase our operating costs or impair our ability to explore and develop other projects, which could adversely impact our business, financial condition and cash flows.
we are heavily dependent on electrical power, internet and telecommunications infrastructure and our information systems and computer-based programs, including our well operations information, seismic data, electronic data processing and accounting data. if any of such infrastructure, systems or programs were to fail or become unavailable or compromised, or create erroneous information in our hardware or software network infrastructure, our ability to safely and effectively operate our business will be limited and any such consequence could have a material adverse effect on our business.
terrorist activities, anti-terrorist efforts and other armed conflicts involving the united states or other countries may adversely affect the united states and global economies and could prevent us from meeting our financial and other obligations. if any of these events occur, the resulting political instability and societal disruption could reduce overall demand for oil and natural gas causing a reduction in our revenues. oil and natural gas related facilities could be direct targets of terrorist attacks, and our operations could be adversely impacted if infrastructure integral to our customers' operations is destroyed or damaged. costs for insurance and other security may increase as a result of these threats, and some insurance coverage may become more difficult to obtain, if available at all.
we are subject to cyber security risks. a cyber incident could occur and result in information theft, data corruption, operational disruption and/or financial loss.
the oil and natural gas industry has become increasingly dependent on digital technologies to conduct certain exploration, development, production, and processing activities. for example, the oil and natural gas industry depends on digital technologies to interpret seismic data, manage drilling rigs, production equipment and gathering systems, conduct reservoir modeling and reserves estimation, and process and record financial and operating data. at the same time, cyber incidents, including deliberate attacks or unintentional events, have increased. the u.s. government has issued public warnings that indicate that energy assets might be specific targets of cyber security threats. our technologies, systems, networks, and those of our vendors, suppliers and other business partners, may become the target of cyberattacks or information security breaches that could result in the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss or destruction of proprietary and other information, or other disruption of our business operations. in addition, certain cyber incidents, such as surveillance, may remain undetected for an extended period. our systems for protecting against cyber security risks may not be sufficient. as cyber incidents continue to evolve, we may be required to expend additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any vulnerability to cyber incidents. we maintain specialized insurance for possible liability resulting from a cyberattack on our assets, however, we cannot assure you that the insurance coverage will be adequate to cover claims that may arise, or that we will be able to maintain adequate insurance at rates we consider reasonable. a loss not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
we have relied in the past, and we may rely from time to time in the future, on borrowings under our revolving credit facility to fund a portion of our capital expenditures. unless we are able to repay borrowings under the revolving credit facility with cash flow from operations and proceeds from equity or debt offerings, implementing our capital programs may require an increase in our total leverage through additional debt issuances. in addition, a reduction in availability under our revolving credit facility and the inability to otherwise obtain financing for our capital programs could require us to curtail our capital expenditures.
we have historically relied on availability under our revolving credit facility to fund a portion of our capital expenditures. we expect that we will continue to fund a portion of our capital expenditures with borrowings under the revolving credit facility, cash flow from operations and the proceeds from debt and equity offerings. in the past, we have created availability under the revolving credit facility by repaying outstanding borrowings with the proceeds from debt or equity offerings. we cannot assure you that we will choose to or be able to access the capital markets to repay any such future borrowings. instead, we may be required or choose to finance our capital expenditures through additional debt issuances, which would increase our total amount of debt outstanding. if the availability under the revolving credit facility were reduced, and we were otherwise unable to secure other sources of financing, we may be required to curtail our capital expenditures, which could limit our ability to fund our drilling activities and acquisitions or otherwise finance the capital expenditures necessary to replace our reserves.
restrictive covenants in certain of our existing and future debt instruments may limit our ability to respond to changes in market conditions or pursue business opportunities.
certain of our debt instruments contain, and the terms of any future indebtedness may contain, restrictive covenants that limit our ability to, among other things: incur or guarantee additional indebtedness; make certain investments; create liens; sell or transfer assets; issue preferred stock; merge or consolidate with another entity; pay dividends or make other distributions; create unrestricted subsidiaries; and engage in transactions with affiliates.
under our revolving credit facility we are allowed, among other things, to designate one or more of our subsidiaries as "unrestricted subsidiaries" that are not subject to certain restrictions contained in the revolving credit facility. under our revolving credit facility, we designated viper, viper's general partner, viper's subsidiary, rattler, rattler's general partner and rattler's subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries, and upon such designation, they were automatically released from any and all obligations under the revolving credit facility, including the related guaranty. further viper, viper's general partner, viper's subsidiaries, rattler, rattler's general partner and rattler's subsidiaries are designated as unrestricted subsidiaries under the indentures governing our outstanding senior notes.
we and our subsidiaries may be prevented from taking advantage of business opportunities that arise because of the limitations imposed on us by the restrictive covenants and financial covenants contained in our and our subsidiaries' debt instruments. as an example, our revolving credit facility requires us to maintain a total net debt to capitalization ratio. the requirement that we and our subsidiaries comply with these provisions may materially adversely affect our and our subsidiaries ability to react to changes in market conditions, take advantage of business opportunities we believe to be desirable, obtain future financing, fund needed capital expenditures or withstand a continuing or future downturn in our business.
a breach of any of these restrictive covenants could result in default under the applicable debt instrument. if default occurs under our revolving credit facility, the lenders thereunder may elect to declare all borrowings outstanding, together with accrued interest and other fees, to be immediately due and payable, which would result in an event of default under the indentures governing our senior notes. the lenders will also have the right in these circumstances to terminate any commitments they have to provide further borrowings. if the indebtedness under our revolving credit facility and our senior notes were to be accelerated, we cannot assure you that our assets would be sufficient to repay in full that indebtedness.
our indebtedness is structurally subordinated to the indebtedness and other liabilities of our subsidiaries, and our obligations are not obligations of any of our subsidiaries.
our senior indebtedness obligations are obligations exclusively of diamondback energy, inc. and diamondback e&p llc, and not of any of our other subsidiaries. none of our other subsidiaries is a guarantor of our senior indebtedness. any assets of those subsidiaries will not be directly available to satisfy the claims of our creditors, including lenders under our revolving credit facility and holders of the senior notes. except to the extent we are a creditor with recognized claims against our subsidiaries, all claims of creditors of our subsidiaries will have priority over our equity interests in such subsidiaries (and therefore the claims of our creditors, including lenders under our revolving credit facility and holders of the senior notes) with respect to the assets of such subsidiaries. even if we are recognized as a creditor of one or more of our subsidiaries, our claims would still be effectively subordinated to any security interests in the assets of any such subsidiary and to any indebtedness or other liabilities of any such subsidiary senior to our claims. consequently, our senior indebtedness will be structurally subordinated to all indebtedness and other liabilities of any of our subsidiaries (other than diamondback e&p llc) and any subsidiaries that we may in the future acquire or establish. for additional information regarding our subsidiaries outstanding debt as of december 31, 2021, see note 11-debt to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.
our ability to make scheduled payments of the principal, to pay interest on or to refinance our indebtedness, including our senior notes, depends on our future performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow to service our debt, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as reducing or delaying capital expenditures, selling assets, restructuring debt or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive. however, we cannot assure you that undertaking alternative financing plans, if necessary, would allow us to meet our debt obligations. in the absence of such cash flows, we could have substantial liquidity problems and might be required to sell material assets or operations to attempt to meet our debt service and other obligations. we may not be able to consummate those asset sales to raise capital or sell assets at prices that we believe are fair, and proceeds that we do receive may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due.
our ability to refinance our indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at the time. we may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms, which could result in a default on our debt obligations and have an adverse effect on our financial condition.
we depend on our subsidiaries for dividends, distributions and other payments. we are a legal entity separate and distinct from our operating subsidiaries. there are statutory and regulatory limitations on the payment of dividends or distributions by certain of our subsidiaries to us. if our subsidiaries are unable to make dividend or distribution payments to us and sufficient cash or liquidity is not otherwise available, we may not be able to make dividend payments to our stockholders or principal and interest payments on our outstanding indebtedness.
we and our subsidiaries may still be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future, which could further exacerbate the risks that we and our subsidiaries face.
we and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future. the terms of our and our subsidiaries' revolving credit facilities and the indentures restrict, but in each case do not completely prohibit, us from doing so. further, the indentures governing our and our subsidiaries' notes allow us to issue additional notes, incur certain other additional debt and to have subsidiaries that do not guarantee the senior notes and which may incur additional debt, which would be structurally senior to the senior notes. in addition, the indentures governing the senior notes do not prevent us from incurring other liabilities that do not constitute indebtedness. if we or a guarantor incur any additional indebtedness that ranks equally with the senior notes (or with the guarantees thereof), including additional unsecured indebtedness or trade payables, the holders of that indebtedness will be entitled to share ratably with holders of the senior notes in any proceeds distributed in connection with any insolvency, liquidation, reorganization, dissolution or other winding-up of us or a guarantor. if new debt or other liabilities are added to our current debt levels, the related risks that we and our subsidiaries now face could intensify.
if we experience liquidity concerns, we could face a downgrade in our debt ratings which could restrict our access to, and negatively impact the terms of, current or future financings or trade credit.
our ability to obtain financings and trade credit and the terms of any financings or trade credit is, in part, dependent on the credit ratings assigned to our debt by independent credit rating agencies. we cannot provide assurance that any of our current ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if, in its judgment, circumstances so warrant. factors that may impact our credit ratings include debt levels, planned asset purchases or sales and near-term and long-term production growth opportunities, liquidity, asset quality, cost structure, product mix and commodity pricing levels. a ratings downgrade could adversely impact our ability to access financings or trade credit and increase our borrowing costs.
borrowings under our, viper llc's and rattler llc's revolving credit facilities expose us to interest rate risk.
our earnings are exposed to interest rate risk associated with borrowings under our and our subsidiaries' revolving credit facilities. the terms of our and our subsidiaries' revolving credit facilities provide for interest on borrowings at a floating rate equal to an alternate base rate tied to libor. libor tends to fluctuate based on multiple facts, including general short-term interest rates, rates set by the u.s. federal reserve, which indicated plans for multiple interest rate increases in 2022, and other central banks, the supply of and demand for credit in the london interbank market and general economic conditions. from time to time, we use interest rate swaps to reduce interest rate exposure with respect to our fixed and/or floating rate debt. our weighted average interest rate on borrowings under our revolving credit facility was 1.67% during the year ended december 31, 2021. viper llc's weighted average interest rate on borrowings from its revolving credit facility was 2.35% during the year ended december 31, 2021. rattler llc's weighted average interest rate on borrowings from its revolving credit facility was 1.41% during the year ended december 31, 2021. if interest rates increase, so will our interest costs, which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
on july 27, 2017, the u.k. financial conduct authority (the authority that regulates libor), which we refer to as the fca, announced that it intends to stop compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of libor after 2021. on march 5, 2021, the ice benchmark administration, which administers libor, and the fca announced that all libor settings will either cease to be provided by any administrator, or no longer be representative immediately after 2021, for all non-u.s. dollar libor settings and one-week and two-month u.s. dollar libor settings, and immediately after june 30, 2023 for the remaining u.s. dollar libor settings. in light of these recent announcements, the future of libor at this time is uncertain and any changes in the methods by which libor is determined or regulatory activity related to libor's phase-out could cause libor to perform differently than in the past or cease to exist. our current credit agreement provides for any changes away from libor to a successor rate to be based on prevailing or equivalent standards, however, changes in the method of calculating libor, or the discontinuation, reform, or replacement of libor or any other benchmark rates may adversely affect interest rates and result in higher borrowing costs. this could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, cash flow and liquidity.
risks related to our common stock the corporate opportunity provisions in our certificate of incorporation could enable affiliates of ours to benefit from corporate opportunities that might otherwise be available to us.
subject to the limitations of applicable law, our certificate of incorporation, among other things; permits us to enter into transactions with entities in which one or more of our officers or directors are financially or otherwise interested; permits any of our stockholders, officers or directors to conduct business that competes with us and to make investments in any kind of property in which we may make investments; and provides that if any director or officer of one of our affiliates who is also one of our officers or directors becomes aware of a potential business opportunity, transaction or other matter (other than one expressly offered to that director or officer in writing solely in his or her capacity as our director or officer), that director or officer will have no duty to communicate or offer that opportunity to us, and will be permitted to communicate or offer that opportunity to such affiliates and that director or officer will not be deemed to have (i) acted in a manner inconsistent with his or her fiduciary or other duties to us regarding the opportunity or (ii) acted in bad faith or in a manner inconsistent with our best interests.
these provisions create the possibility that a corporate opportunity that would otherwise be available to us may be used for the benefit of one of our affiliates.
although our common stock is listed on the nasdaq global select market, we cannot assure you that an active public market will continue for our common stock. if an active public market for our common stock does not continue, the trading price and liquidity of our common stock will be materially and adversely affected. if there is a thin trading market or "float" for our stock, the market price for our common stock may fluctuate significantly more than the stock market as a whole. without a large float, our common stock would be less liquid than the stock of companies with broader public ownership and, as a result, the trading prices of our common stock may be more volatile. in addition, in the absence of an active public trading market, investors may be unable to liquidate their investment in us. furthermore, the stock market is subject to significant price and volume fluctuations, and the price of our common stock could fluctuate widely in response to several factors, including our quarterly or annual operating results; changes in our earnings estimates; investment recommendations by securities analysts following our business or our industry; additions or departures of key personnel; changes in the business, earnings estimates or market perceptions of our competitors; our failure to achieve operating results consistent with securities analysts' projections; changes in industry, general market or economic conditions; and announcements of legislative or regulatory changes.
the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations in recent years that have significantly affected the quoted prices of the securities of many companies, including companies in our industry. the changes often appear to occur without regard to specific operating performance. the price of our common stock could fluctuate based upon factors that have little or nothing to do with our company and these fluctuations could materially reduce our stock price.
the declaration of dividends and any repurchases of our common stock are each within the discretion of our board of directors based upon a review of relevant considerations, and there is no guarantee that we will pay any dividends on or repurchase shares of our common stock in the future or at levels anticipated by our stockholders.
on february 13, 2018, we initiated payment of quarterly cash dividends on our common stock payable beginning with the first quarter of 2018. the decision to pay any future dividends, however, is solely within the discretion of, and subject to approval by, our board of directors. our board of directors' determination with respect to any such dividends, including the record date, the payment date and the actual amount of the dividend, will depend upon our profitability and financial condition, contractual restrictions, restrictions imposed by applicable law and other factors that the board deems relevant at the time of such determination. based on its evaluation of these factors, the board of directors may determine not to declare a dividend, or declare dividends at rates that are less than currently anticipated, either of which could reduce returns to our stockholders.
in september 2021, our board of directors approved a stock repurchase program to acquire up to $2 billion of our outstanding common stock, of which $431 million had been repurchased through december 31, 2021. the stock repurchase program has no time limit and may be suspended, modified, or discontinued by the board of directors at any time.
a change of control could limit our use of net operating losses and certain other tax attributes.
under section 382 of the code, a corporation that experiences an "ownership change" (as defined in the code) may be subject to limitations on its ability to offset taxable income arising after the ownership change with net operating losses ("nols") or tax credits generated prior to the ownership change. in general, an ownership change occurs if there is a cumulative increase in the ownership of a corporation's stock totaling more than 50 percentage points by one or more "5% shareholders" (as defined in the code) at any time during a rolling three-year period. an ownership change would establish an annual limitation on the amount of a corporation's pre-change nols or tax credits that could be utilized to offset taxable income in any future taxable year. the amount of the limitation is generally equal to the value of the corporation's stock immediately prior to the ownership change multiplied by an interest rate, referred to as the long-term tax-exempt rate, periodically promulgated by the irs. this limitation, however, may be significantly increased if there is "net unrealized built-in gain" in the assets of the corporation undergoing the ownership change.
as of december 31, 2021, we had an nol carryforward of approximately $2.5 billion and tax credits of $4 million for federal income tax purposes. due to an ownership change on march 17, 2021 in conjunction with our acquisition of qep in an all-stock transaction, our nols and tax credits, including those acquired from qep, are subject to an annual limitation under section 382 of the code. however, we have determined that our fair market value and our net unrealized built-in gain position resulted in a significant increase in our section 382 limitation. accordingly, we believe that the application of section 382 as a result of this ownership change will not have an adverse effect on our ability to utilize our nols and credits.
future changes in our stock ownership, however, could result in an additional ownership change under section 382 of the code. any such ownership change may limit our ability to offset taxable income arising after such an ownership change with nols or other tax attributes generated prior to such an ownership change, possibly substantially.
if securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, if they adversely change their recommendations regarding our stock or if our operating results do not meet their expectations, our stock price could decline.
the trading market for our common stock will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business. if one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to publish reports on us regularly, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline. moreover, if one or more of the analysts who cover our company downgrade our stock or if our operating results do not meet their expectations, our stock price could decline.
our certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue, without the approval of our stockholders, one or more classes or series of preferred stock having such designations, preferences, limitations and relative rights, including preferences over our common stock respecting dividends and distributions, as our board of directors may determine. the terms of one or more classes or series of preferred stock could adversely impact the voting power or value of our common stock. for example, we might grant holders of preferred stock the right to elect some number of our directors in all events or on the happening of specified events or the right to veto specified transactions. similarly, the repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences we might assign to holders of preferred stock could affect the residual value of the common stock.
provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and delaware law make it more difficult to effect a change in control of our company, which could adversely affect the price of our common stock.
the existence of some provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and delaware corporate law could delay or prevent a change in control of our company, even if that change would be beneficial to our stockholders. our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that may make acquiring control of our company difficult, including provisions regulating the ability of our stockholders to nominate directors for election or to bring matters for action at annual meetings of our stockholders; limitations on the ability of our stockholders to call a special meeting and act by written consent; the ability of our board of directors to adopt, amend or repeal bylaws, and the requirement that the affirmative vote of holders representing at least 66 2/3% of the voting power of all outstanding shares of capital stock be obtained for stockholders to amend our bylaws; the requirement that the affirmative vote of holders representing at least 66 2/3% of the voting power of all outstanding shares of capital stock be obtained to remove directors; the requirement that the affirmative vote of holders representing at least 66 2/3% of the voting power of all outstanding shares of capital stock be obtained to amend our certificate of incorporation; and the authorization given to our board of directors to issue and set the terms of preferred stock without the approval of our stockholders.
these provisions also could discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for you and other stockholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions. as a result, these provisions could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if doing so would benefit our stockholders, which may limit the price that investors are willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock.
item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this annual report. the following discussion contains "forward-looking statements" that reflect our future plans, estimates, beliefs, and expected performance. actual results and the timing of events may differ materially from those contained in these forward-looking statements due to a number of factors. see item 1a. "risk factors" and "cautionary statement regarding forward-looking statements."
overview we are an independent oil and natural gas company focused on the acquisition, development, exploration and exploitation of unconventional, onshore oil and natural gas reserves in the permian basin in west texas. we operate in two operating segments: (i) the upstream segment, which is engaged in the acquisition, development, exploration and exploitation of unconventional, onshore oil and natural gas reserves primarily in the permian basin in west texas and (ii) through our subsidiary, rattler, the midstream operations segment, which is focused on ownership, operation, development and acquisition of the midstream infrastructure assets in the midland and delaware basins of the permian basin.
we operate under a strategic approach that focuses predominantly on enhancing return through our low-cost development strategy of resource conversion, capital allocation and continued improvements in operational and cost efficiencies. we are also committed to delivering results in a socially and environmentally responsible manner.
•we turned 275 gross operated horizontal wells (including 207 in the midland basin and 64 in the delaware basin) to production and had capital expenditures, excluding acquisitions, of $1.5 billion during the year ended december 31, 2021.
•as of december 31, 2021, we had approximately 445,848 net acres, which primarily consisted of approximately 265,562 net acres in the midland basin and approximately 148,588 net acres in the delaware basin. as of december 31, 2021, we had an estimated 9,314 gross horizontal locations that we believe to be economic at $50.00 per bbl wti. in addition, our publicly traded subsidiary viper owns mineral interests underlying approximately 930,871 gross acres and 27,027 net royalty acres in the permian basin and eagle ford shale. approximately 54% of these net royalty acres are operated by us.
2021 acquisition activity and recent transactions on february 26, 2021, we completed the guidon acquisition, which included approximately 32,500 net acres in the northern midland basin, in exchange for 10.68 million shares of the company's common stock and $375 million of cash.
on march 17, 2021, we completed the qep merger. the addition of qep's assets increased our net acreage in the midland basin by approximately 49,000 net acres. under the terms of the merger agreement, we issued approximately 12.12 million shares of our common stock to the former qep stockholders, with a total value of approximately $987 million on the closing date.
table of contents on october 1, 2021, viper completed the acquisition of certain mineral and royalty interests from swallowtail royalties llc and swallowtail royalties ii llc (the "swallowtail entities") which included certain mineral and royalty interests for 15.25 million of viper's common units and approximately $225 million in cash (the "swallowtail acquisition"). the cash portion of the purchase price was funded through a combination of cash on hand and approximately $190 million of borrowings under viper llc's revolving credit facility.
on october 5, 2021, rattler and a private affiliate of an investment fund formed a joint venture entity, remuda midstream holdings llc (the "wtg joint venture"). rattler contributed approximately $104 million in cash for a 25% membership interest in the wtg joint venture, which then completed the acquisition of a majority interest in wtg midstream llc ("wtg midstream").
2021 divestiture activity on june 3, 2021 and june 7, 2021, respectively, we closed transactions to divest certain non-core permian assets, including over 7,000 net acres of non-core southern midland basin acreage in upton county, texas and approximately 1,300 net acres of non-core, non-operated delaware basin assets in lea county, new mexico, for combined net cash proceeds of $82 million, after customary closing adjustments. we used our net proceeds from these transactions toward debt reduction.
on october 21, 2021, we completed the divestiture of our williston basin oil and natural gas assets, consisting of approximately 95,000 net acres acquired in the qep merger, for net cash proceeds of approximately $586 million after customary closing adjustments. we used our net proceeds from this transaction toward debt reduction.
on december 1, 2021, we completed the sale of certain water midstream assets with a carrying value of approximately $160 million to rattler in exchange for cash proceeds of approximately $160 million.
on november 1, 2021, rattler completed the sale of its gas gathering assets to brazos for net cash proceeds of approximately $83 million at closing, after customary closing adjustments, and an aggregate of $10 million in contingent payments.
see note 4-acquisitions and divestitures for additional discussion of these transactions.
redemption of notes the net proceeds from the march 2021 notes discussed above were primarily used to fund the repurchase of $1.65 billion in fair value carrying amount of the qep notes that remained outstanding at the effective time of the qep merger for total cash consideration of $1.7 billion, and $368 million principal amount of 2025 senior notes, for total cash consideration of $381 million. giving effect to the repurchase of the 2023 notes discussed below, these refinancing transactions are expected to result in an estimated annual interest cost savings of approximately $40 million in addition to an estimated $60 to $80 million of previously announced expected annual cost synergies from the qep merger.
in august 2021 we redeemed the remaining $432 million principal amount of our outstanding 5.375% 2025 senior notes at a redemption price equal to 102.688% of the principal amount plus accrued interest. we funded the redemption with cash on hand and borrowings under our revolving credit facility.
table of contents on november 1, 2021, we redeemed the aggregate $650 million principal amount of our outstanding 2023 notes with the proceeds received from the divestiture of our williston basin assets and cash on hand.
for additional discussion of our 2021 debt transactions and the amendment to the second amended and restated credit facility, see note 11-debt.
stock and unit repurchase programs during the year ended december 31, 2021, we repurchased approximately $431 million of diamondback common stock, and as of december 31, 2021, $1.6 billion remained available for future purchases under our common stock repurchase program.
during the year ended december 31, 2021, viper repurchased approximately $46 million of common units under its repurchase program. as of december 31, 2021, $80 million remained available for use to repurchase common units under viper's common unit repurchase program.
during the year ended december 31, 2021, rattler repurchased approximately $48 million of common units under its repurchase program. as of december 31, 2021, $88 million remained available for use to repurchase common units under rattler's common unit repurchase program.
see "-liquidity and capital resources" below for additional discussion.
covid-19 and effects on commodity prices in early march 2020, oil prices dropped sharply and continued to decline, briefly reaching negative levels, as a result of multiple factors affecting the supply and demand in global oil and natural gas markets, including (i) actions taken by opec members and other exporting nations impacting commodity price and production levels and (ii) a significant decrease in demand due to the covid-19 pandemic. demand for oil and natural gas increased during 2021, as many restrictions on conducting business implemented in response to the covid-19 pandemic were lifted due to improved treatments and availability of vaccinations in the u.s. and globally. as a result, oil and natural gas market prices have improved during 2021 in response to the increase in demand. during 2021 and 2020, the posted price for west texas intermediate light sweet crude oil, or nymex wti, has ranged from $(37.63) to $84.65 bbl, and the nymex henry hub price of natural gas has ranged from $1.48 to $6.31 per mmbtu. on january 18, 2022, the closing nymex wti price for crude oil was $85.43 per bbl and the closing nymex henry hub price of natural gas was $4.28 per mmbtu. the emergence of the delta covid-19 variant in the latter part of 2021 and the subsequent surge of the highly transmissible omicron variant, however, contributed to economic and pricing volatility as industry and market participants evaluated industry conditions and production outlook. further, on january 4, 2021, opec and its non-opec allies, known collectively as opec+, agreed to continue their program (commenced in august of 2021) of gradual monthly output increases in february 2022, raising its output target by 400,000 bbls per day, which is expected to further boost oil supply in response to rising demand. in its report issued on february 10, 2022, opec noted its expectation that world oil demand will rise by 4.15 million bbls per day in 2022, as the global economy continues to post a strong recovery from the covid-19 pandemic. although this demand outlook is expected to underpin oil prices, already seen at a seven-year high in february 2022, we cannot predict any future volatility in commodity prices or demand for crude oil.
despite the recovery in commodity prices and rising demand, we kept our production relatively flat during 2021, using excess cash flow for debt repayment and/or return to our stockholders rather than expanding our drilling program.
table of contents outlook during 2021, we continued building on our execution track record, generating free cash flow while keeping capital costs under control, and our efficiency gains, particularly in the midland basin drilling and completion programs, were able to mitigate certain inflationary pressures on well costs and led to a total capital expenditure amount of $1.5 billion down 11% from our guidance presented in april of 2021. we expect to continue to build on these operational efficiencies by controlling the variable portion of our operating and capital costs, which we believe will help mitigate the inflationary pressures seen across our business. we remain committed to capital discipline by maintaining flat oil production in 2022 and expect to maintain our best-in-class capital efficiency and cost structure. we expect to be in a position to continue to deliver on the recently announced enhanced capital return program, where we expect to distribute at least 50% of our quarterly free cash flow to our stockholders. our capital return program is currently focused on our sustainable and growing dividend and a combination of stock repurchases and variable dividends. we expect to remain flexible on returning capital to our stockholders, depending on which method our board of directors believes presents the best return of capital to our stockholders at the relevant time.
in the midland basin, we continued to have positive results across our core development areas located within midland, martin, howard, glasscock and andrews counties, where development has primarily focused on drilling long-lateral, multi-well pads targeting the spraberry and wolfcamp formations.
in the delaware basin, we have now drilled and completed a significant number of wells in pecos, reeves and ward counties targeting the wolfcamp a, which we believe has been de-risked across a significant portion of our total acreage position and remains our primary development target. in 2022, we expect to focus development on these areas.
as of december 31, 2021, we were operating 10 drilling rigs and four completion crews and currently intend to operate between 10 and 12 drilling rigs and between three and four completion crews in 2022 on average across our current acreage position in the midland and delaware basins.
environmental responsibility initiatives and highlights in february 2021, we announced significant enhancements to our commitment to environmental, social responsibility and governance, or esg, performance and disclosure, including scope 1 and methane emission intensity reduction targets. our goals include the reduction of our scope 1 greenhouse gas intensity by at least 50% and methane intensity by at least 70%, in each case by 2024 from the 2019 levels. to further underscore our commitment to carbon neutrality, we have also implemented our "net zero now" initiative under which, effective january 1, 2021, we strive to produce every hydrocarbon molecule with zero scope 1 emissions. to the extent our greenhouse gas and methane intensity targets do not eliminate our carbon footprint, we have purchased carbon credits to offset the remaining emissions. we have also increased the weighting of esg metrics in our annual short-term incentive compensation plan to motivate our executives to advance our environmental responsibility goals.
in september 2021, we announced our long-term goal to end routine flaring by 2025 and a long-term target to source over 65% of our water used for drilling and completion operations from recycled sources by 2025. with respect to flaring, we flared 1.55% of our gross natural gas production in the fourth quarter of 2021. for the full year ended 2021, we flared 1.45% of our gross natural gas production, down 26% from 2020.
2022 capital budget we have currently budgeted 2022 total capital spend of $1.75 billion to $1.90 billion. should commodity prices weaken, we intend to act responsibly and, consistent with our prior practices, reduce capital spending. if commodity prices strengthen, we intend to maintain flat oil production, pay down indebtedness and return cash to our stockholders.
results of operations the following discussion focuses primarily on a comparison of the results of operations between the years ended december 31, 2021 and 2020. the midstream operations segment's revenues and operating expenses were not significant to our consolidated statements of operations for the years ended december 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019. .for a discussion of the results of operations for the year ended december 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2019, please refer to "part ii, item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" in our annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2020 (filed with the sec on february 25, 2021), which is incorporated in this report by reference from such prior report on form 10-k.
(2)hedged prices reflect the effect of our commodity derivative transactions on our average sales prices and include gains and losses on cash settlements for matured commodity derivatives, which we do not designate for hedge accounting. hedged prices exclude gains or losses resulting from the early settlement of commodity derivative contracts.
higher commodity prices during 2021 compared to 2020 primarily reflect a recovery from historically low prices experienced in 2020 due to the covid-19 pandemic as discussed in "-2021 transactions and recent developments" above. the increase in production for 2021 compared to 2020 resulted primarily from the guidon acquisition and qep merger during the first quarter of 2021 and an overall recovery in our drilling and production activities after curtailments in the second quarter of 2020 in response to the covid-19 pandemic. we expect to hold our oil production levels flat during 2022.
lease operating expenses for the year ended december 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2020 increased by $140 million, or $0.25 per boe, primarily due to an increase in production between periods driven by the guidon acquisition and the qep merger in the first quarter of 2021. the increase on a per boe basis is primarily related to the williston basin assets acquired in the qep merger which had higher lease operating costs per boe on average than our historical properties. we completed the divestiture of the williston basin properties in october 2021.
including the impact of our acquisition and divestiture activity in 2021 and future production plans, our total lease operating expenses in 2022 are expected to range from approximately $539 million to $618 million.
in general, production taxes are directly related to production revenues. production taxes for the year ended december 31, 2021 increased by $214 million, or $1.32 per boe. the increase in production taxes is attributable to an increase in commodity prices, as well as an increase in overall production due to assets acquired in 2021. the current year increase on a per boe basis is primarily driven by an increase in current year commodity prices. production taxes as a percentage of production revenues increased for the year ended december 31, 2021 compared to the year ended december 31, 2020 due primarily to the acquired williston basin properties which have a higher production tax rate than our other properties. we completed the divestiture of the williston basin properties in october 2021.
ad valorem taxes are based, among other factors, on property values driven by prior year commodity prices. ad valorem taxes for the year ended december 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2020 increased by $16 million primarily due to additional properties acquired in the guidon acquisition and the qep merger.
for the year ended december 31, 2021, the increase for gathering and transportation expenses are primarily attributable to the increase in production between periods. the current year increase on a per boe basis is primarily driven by production added from the assets acquired in the qep merger which, in general, had higher average gathering and transportation costs per boe than our historical properties, particularly those qep assets located in the williston basin, which we divested in the fourth quarter of 2021. after giving effect to the 2021 acquisition and divestiture activities, we expect gathering and transportation expenses to range from approximately $212 to $243 million in 2022.
midstream services expense represents costs incurred to operate and maintain our oil and natural gas gathering and transportation systems, natural gas lift, compression infrastructure and water transportation facilities. in the fourth quarter of 2021, we and rattler divested our natural gas gathering and transportation assets. midstream services expense for the year ended december 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2020 decreased by $16 million primarily due to decreased maintenance costs, partially offset by increased fees for use of third party disposal systems.
impairment of oil and natural gas properties. no impairment expense was recorded for the year ended december 31, 2021. in connection with the qep merger and the guidon acquisition, we recorded the oil and natural gas properties acquired at fair value. pursuant to sec guidance, we determined the fair value of the properties acquired in the qep merger and the guidon acquisition clearly exceeded the related full cost ceiling limitation beyond a reasonable doubt. as such, we requested and received a waiver from the sec to exclude the acquired properties from the first quarter 2021 ceiling test calculation. as a result, no impairment expense related to the qep merger and the guidon acquisition was recorded for the three months ended march 31, 2021. had we not received the waiver from the sec, an impairment charge of approximately $1.1 billion would have been recorded in the first quarter of 2021. the properties acquired in the qep merger and the guidon acquisition had total unamortized costs at march 31, 2021 of $3.0 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively.
table of contents as a result of the sharp decline in commodity prices during 2020, we recorded non-cash ceiling test impairments for the year ended december 31, 2020 of $6.0 billion which is included in accumulated depletion, depreciation, amortization and impairment on our consolidated balance sheet. impairment charges affect our results of operations but do not reduce our cash flow. in addition to commodity prices, our production rates, levels of proved reserves, future development costs, transfers of unevaluated properties and other factors will determine our actual ceiling test calculation and impairment analysis in future periods. if the trailing 12-month commodity prices fall as compared to the commodity prices used in prior quarters, we may have material write-downs in subsequent quarters. see note 8-property and equipment for further details regarding factors that impact the impairment of oil and natural gas properties.
general and administrative expenses for the year ended december 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2020 increased by $58 million primarily due to additional payroll and other employee driven costs of $32 million related to the qep merger and the guidon acquisition as well as $10 million of additional expense related to the implementation of a new enterprise resource planning system. additionally, equity compensation for the year ended december 31, 2021 increased by $14 million compared to the same period in 2020.
total merger and integration expense for the year ended december 31, 2021 includes $69 million in costs incurred for the qep merger and $9 million in costs incurred for the guidon acquisition. the qep merger related expenses primarily consist of $39 million in severance costs and $30 million in banking, legal and advisory fees, and the guidon acquisition related expenses consist primarily of advisory and legal fees. see note 4-acquisitions and divestitures for further details regarding the qep merger and the guidon acquisition.
revolving credit agreements                                  $11                           $20

net interest expense increased by $2 million for the year ended december 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2020. this increase primarily consisted of (i) $47 million in interest costs on the newly issued march 2021 notes (ii) $25 million due to incurring a full year of interest expense in 2021 related to our may 2020 notes and rattler's 5.625% senior notes due 2025, and (iii) to a lesser extent, interest expense incurred on the qep notes that remained outstanding following the qep merger completed in march 2021. these increases were partially offset by (i) $33 million in additional capitalized interest costs, (ii) interest cost savings of $23 million on the repurchases of our 2025 senior notes in march 2021 and august 2021, (iii) $8 million on the repurchase of our 4.625% senior notes of energen (iv) a $9 million reduction in borrowings under our revolving credit agreements during 2021, and (v) to a lesser extent, interest savings on the repurchase of our 2023 notes in november 2021. we expect interest expense, net of interest income to range from approximately $148 million to $178 million in 2022. see note 11-debt for further details regarding outstanding borrowings and interest expense.
(1)the year ended december 31, 2021 includes cash paid on commodity contracts terminated prior to their contractual maturity of $16 million.
(2)the year ended december 31, 2020 includes cash received on commodity contracts terminated prior to their contractual maturity of $17 million.
(3)the year ended december 31, 2021 includes cash received on interest rate swap contracts terminated prior to their contractual maturity of $80 million.
we are required to recognize all derivative instruments on the balance sheet as either assets or liabilities measured at fair value. we have not designated our commodity derivative instruments as hedges for accounting purposes. as a result, we mark our derivative instruments to fair value and recognize the cash and non-cash changes in fair value on derivative instruments in our consolidated statements of operations under the line item captioned "gain (loss) on derivative instruments, net." as part of the qep merger, we received by novation from qep certain derivative instruments which are included on our balance sheet as of december 31, 2021.
table of contents at december 31, 2021, we have a short-term derivative asset of $13 million, a long-term derivative asset of $4 million, a short-term derivative liability due in 2022 of $174 million and a long-term derivative liability due in 2023 of $29 million.
provision for (benefit from) income taxes. the following table shows the provision for (benefit from) income taxes for the years ended december 31, 2021 and 2020:
provision for (benefit from) income taxes       $631                          $(1,104)
liquidity and capital resources overview of sources and uses of cash historically, our primary sources of liquidity include cash flows from operations, proceeds from our public equity offerings, borrowings under our revolving credit facility, proceeds from the issuance of senior notes and sales of non-core assets. our primary uses of capital have been for the acquisition, development and exploration of oil and natural gas properties. at december 31, 2021, we had approximately $2.2 billion of liquidity consisting of $0.7 billion in cash and cash equivalents and $1.6 billion available under our credit facility. as discussed below, our capital budget for 2022 is $1.75 billion to $1.90 billion. further, we have $45 million of senior notes maturities in the next 12 months.
our working capital requirements are supported by our cash and cash equivalents and our credit facility. we may draw on our revolving credit facility to meet short-term cash requirements, or issue debt or equity securities as part of our longer-term liquidity and capital management program. because of the alternatives available to us as discussed above, we believe that our short-term and long-term liquidity are adequate to fund not only our current operations, but also our near-term and long-term funding requirements including our capital spending programs, dividend payments, debt service obligations and repayment of debt maturities, stock repurchase program and other amounts that may ultimately be paid in connection with contingencies.
future cash flows are subject to a number of variables, including the level of oil and natural gas production and prices, and significant additional capital expenditures will be required to more fully develop our properties. in order to mitigate this volatility, we entered into derivative contracts with a number of financial institutions, all of which are participants in our credit facility, hedging a portion of our estimated future crude oil and natural gas production through the end of 2023 as discussed further in note 15-derivatives and item 7a. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk-commodity price risk. the level of our hedging activity and duration of the financial instruments employed depend on our desired cash flow protection, available hedge prices, the magnitude of our capital program and our operating strategy.
as we pursue our business and financial strategy, we regularly consider which capital resources, including cash flow and equity and debt financings, are available to meet our future financial obligations, planned capital expenditure activities and liquidity requirements. our future ability to grow proved reserves and production will be highly dependent on the capital resources available to us. continued prolonged volatility in the capital, financial and/or credit markets due to the covid-19 pandemic, the depressed commodity markets and/or adverse macroeconomic conditions may limit our access to, or increase our cost of, capital or make capital unavailable on terms acceptable to us or at all. although the company expects that its sources of funding will be adequate to fund its short-term and long-term liquidity requirements, we cannot assure you that the needed capital will be available on acceptable terms or at all.
net cash provided by (used in) operating activities            $3,944                          $2,118
net cash provided by (used in) investing activities           (1,539)                         (2,101)
net cash provided by (used in) financing activities           (1,841)                            (37)
operating activities our operating cash flow is sensitive to many variables, the most significant of which is the volatility of prices for the oil and natural gas we produce. prices for these commodities are determined primarily by prevailing market conditions. regional and worldwide economic activity, weather and other substantially variable factors influence market conditions for these products. these factors are beyond our control and are difficult to predict. see item 1a. "risk factors" above.
the increase in operating cash flows for the year ended december 31, 2021 compared to the same period in 2020 primarily resulted from (i) an increase of $4.0 billion in our total revenues, and (ii) receipt of $152 million in refunds of income taxes receivable related to the carryback of federal net operating losses and the accelerated refund of minimum tax credits allowed under the cares act in 2020. these net cash inflows were partially offset by (i) a reduction of $1.5 billion due to making net cash payments of $1.2 billion on our derivative contracts in the year ended december 31, 2021 compared to receiving net cash of $250 million on our derivative contracts in the year ended december 31, 2020, (ii) an increase in our cash operating expenses of approximately $550 million primarily due to the qep merger and the guidon acquisition, and (iii) other working capital changes, primarily due to recording increases in accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued capital expenditure activity stemming from the qep merger and the guidon acquisition in 2021. see "-results of operations" for discussion of significant changes in our revenues and expenses.
investing activities net cash used in investing activities was $1.5 billion compared to $2.1 billion for the years ended december 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. the majority of our net cash used for investing activities during the year ended december 31, 2021 was for the purchase and development of oil and natural gas properties and related assets, including the acquisition of certain leasehold interests as part of the guidon acquisition. these expenditures were partially offset by proceeds from the sale of our williston basin assets, leasehold acreage and other gathering assets discussed in note 4-acquisitions and divestitures.
the majority of our net cash used in investing activities during the year ended december 31, 2020 was for drilling and completion costs in conjunction with our development program. our capital expenditures for each period are discussed further below.
table of contents capital expenditure activities our capital expenditures excluding acquisitions and equity method investments (on a cash basis) were as follows for the specified period:
drilling, completions and non-operated additions to oil and natural gas properties(1)(2)           $1,334                          $1,611
infrastructure additions to oil and natural gas properties                                            123                             108
additions to midstream assets                                                                          30                             140
(1) during the year ended december 31, 2021, in conjunction with our development program, we drilled 216 gross (203 net) operated horizontal wells, of which 175 gross (165 net) wells were in the midland basin and 41 gross (38 net) wells were in the delaware basin, and turned 275 gross (258 net) operated horizontal wells to production, of which 207 gross (194 net) were in the midland basin and 64 gross (61 net) wells were in the delaware basin.
(2) during the year ended december 31, 2020, in conjunction with our development program, we drilled 208 gross (195 net) operated horizontal wells, of which 133 gross (125 net) wells were in the midland basin and 75 gross (70 net) wells were in the delaware basin, and turned 171 gross (159 net) operated horizontal wells to production, of which 93 gross (85 net) were in the midland basin and 78 gross (74 net) wells were in the delaware basin.
financing activities net cash used in financing activities for the year ended december 31, 2021 was $1.8 billion compared to net cash used in financing activities for the year ended december 31, 2020 of $37 million. during the year ended december 31, 2021, the amount used in financing activities was primarily attributable to (i) $3.2 billion paid for the repurchase of outstanding principal on certain senior notes as discussed in "-repurchases of notes" below, as well as $178 million of additional premiums paid in connection with the repurchases, (ii) $525 million of repurchases as part of the share and unit repurchase programs, (iii) $312 million of dividends paid to stockholders, and (iv) $112 million in distributions to non-controlling interest. the cash outflows were partially offset by (i) $2.2 billion in proceeds from the march 2021 notes, (ii) $313 million of borrowings under our and our subsidiaries' credit facilities, net of repayments and (iii) $22 million in net cash receipts from the early settlement of interest rate swaps and commodity derivative contracts that contained an other-than-insignificant financing element.
net cash used in financing activities for the year ended december 31, 2020 was primarily attributable to $348 million of repayments, net of borrowings, on our credit facilities, $239 million in aggregate repayments on the energen notes and viper notes, $236 million in dividends paid to stockholders, $98 million of share repurchases as part of our stock repurchase program, and $93 million in distributions to non-controlling interest. these cash outlays were partially offset by net proceeds of $997 million from the issuance of the may 2020 notes and the rattler notes during 2020.
capital resources revolving credit facilities and other debt instruments as of december 31, 2021, our debt, including the debt of viper and rattler, consists of approximately $6.2 billion in aggregate outstanding principal amount of senior notes, $499 million in aggregate outstanding borrowings under revolving credit facilities and $58 million in outstanding amounts due under our drillco agreement.
at december 31, 2021, we have total principal payments due on our outstanding senior notes, including those of viper and rattler, of $45 million in 2022, $1.2 billion cumulatively in the years 2023 through 2024, $2.1 billion cumulatively in the years 2025 and 2026, and $3.4 billion thereafter. additionally, we expect to incur future cash interest costs on these senior notes of approximately $177 million in 2022, $371 million in the years from 2023 through 2024, $277 million in the years from 2025 through 2026, and $961 million between 2027 and 2051.
on june 2, 2021, we entered into a twelfth amendment, or the amendment, to the second amended and restated credit agreement which, among other things, decreased the total revolving loan commitments from $2.0 billion to $1.6 billion, which may be increased in an amount up to $1.0 billion (for a total maximum commitment amount of $2.6 billion) upon election of the borrower, subject to obtaining additional lender commitments and satisfaction of customary conditions). as of december 31, 2021, we had no outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility and $1.6 billion available for future borrowings under the revolving credit facility.
table of contents viper's revolving credit facility viper's credit agreement, as amended to date, provides for a revolving credit facility in the maximum credit amount of $2.0 billion, with a borrowing base of $580 million as of december 31, 2021, based on the viper's oil and natural gas reserves and other factors. at december 31, 2021, viper had elected a commitment amount of $500 million on its credit agreement with $304 million of outstanding borrowings. during the year ended december 31, 2021, the weighted average interest rate on borrowings under the operating company's revolving credit facility was 2.35%. viper's revolving credit facility matures in 2025.
rattler's revolving credit facility rattler's credit agreement provides for a revolving credit facility in the maximum credit amount of $600 million, which is expandable to $1.0 billion upon its election, subject to obtaining additional lender commitments and satisfaction of customary conditions. as of december 31, 2021, there was $195 million of outstanding borrowings under rattler's revolving credit facility. the weighted average interest rate on borrowings under the credit agreement was 1.41% for the year ended december 31, 2021. rattler's revolving credit facility matures in 2024.
for additional discussion of our outstanding debt as of december 31, 2021, see note 11-debt.
subject to market conditions, we expect to continue to issue debt securities from time to time in the future to refinance our maturing debt. the availability, interest rate and other terms of any new borrowings will depend on the ratings assigned by credit rating agencies, among other factors.
we are currently in compliance, and expect to continue to be, with all financial maintenance covenants in our debt instruments.
debt ratings we receive debt ratings from the major ratings agencies in the u.s. in determining our debt ratings, the agencies consider a number of qualitative and quantitative items including, but not limited to, commodity pricing levels, our liquidity, asset quality, reserve mix, debt levels, cost structure, planned asset sales and production growth opportunities. our credit rating from standard and poor's global ratings services is bbb-. our credit rating from fitch investor services is bbb. our credit rating from moody's investor services is baa3. any rating downgrades may result in additional letters of credit or cash collateral being posted under certain contractual arrangements.
capital requirements in addition to future operating expenses and working capital commitments discussed in -results of operations, our primary short and long-term liquidity requirements consist primarily of (i) capital expenditures, (ii) payments of other contractual obligations and (iii) cash commitments for dividends and share repurchases as discussed below.
based upon current oil and natural gas prices and production expectations for 2022, we believe that our cash flow from operations, cash on hand and borrowings under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to fund our operations through the 12-month period following the filing of this report and thereafter. however, future cash flows are subject to a number of variables, including the level of oil and natural gas production and prices, and significant additional capital expenditures will be required to more fully develop our properties. we cannot assure you that the needed capital will be available on acceptable terms or at all. further, our 2022 capital expenditure budget does not allocate any funds for leasehold interest and property acquisitions.
2022 capital spending plan our board of directors approved a 2022 capital budget for drilling, midstream and infrastructure of $1.75 billion to $1.90 billion maintaining our annualized fourth quarter 2021 cash capital expenditure guidance presented in november of 2021. we estimate that, of these expenditures, approximately:
•$1.56 billion to $1.67 billion will be spent primarily on drilling 270 to 290 gross (248 to 267 net) horizontal wells and completing 260 to 280 gross (240 to 258 net) horizontal wells across our operated and non-operated leasehold acreage in the northern midland and southern delaware basins, with an average lateral length of approximately 10,200 feet;
•$110 million to $130 million will be spent on infrastructure and environmental expenditures, excluding the cost of any leasehold and mineral interest acquisitions.
we do not have a specific acquisition budget since the timing and size of acquisitions cannot be accurately forecasted.
the amount and timing of our capital expenditures are largely discretionary and within our control. we could choose to defer a portion of these planned capital expenditures depending on a variety of factors, including but not limited to the success of our drilling activities, prevailing and anticipated prices for oil and natural gas, the availability of necessary equipment, infrastructure and capital, the receipt and timing of required regulatory permits and approvals, seasonal conditions, drilling and acquisition costs and the level of participation by other interest owners. we were operating 10 drilling rigs and four completion crews at december 31, 2021 and currently intend to operate between 10 and 12 rigs and between three and four completion crews on average in 2022, as we continue to execute on our strategy to hold oil production flat while using cash flow from operations to reduce debt, strengthen our balance sheet and return capital to our stockholders. we will continue monitoring commodity prices and overall market conditions and can adjust our rig cadence and our capital expenditure budget up or down in response to changes in commodity prices and overall market conditions.
other contractual obligations and commitments at december 31, 2021, our other significant contractual obligations consist primarily of (i) minimum transportation commitments totaling $878 million, (ii) asset retirement obligations totaling $171 million, and (iii) minimum purchase commitment for quantities of sand used in our drilling operations totaling $77 million. we expect to make aggregate payments of approximately $105 million for these commitments during 2022. see note 9-asset retirement obligations and note 18-commitments and contingencies for further discussion of these and other contractual obligations and commitments.
dividends and share repurchases we paid common stock dividends of $312 million and $236 million during 2021 and 2020, respectively. on february 18, 2022, our board of directors declared a cash dividend for the fourth quarter of 2021 of $0.60 per share of common stock, payable on march 11, 2022 to our stockholders of record at the close of business on march 4, 2022. the decision to pay any future dividends is solely within the discretion of, and subject to approval by, our board of directors.
in september 2021, our board of directors approved a stock repurchase program to acquire up to $2 billion of our outstanding common stock. the stock repurchase program has no time limit and may be suspended, modified, or discontinued by the board of directors at any time. we repurchased approximately $431 million of our common stock under this program during the year ended december 31, 2021, and have $1.6 billion remaining for future repurchases under the repurchase program at december 31, 2021 see note 12-stockholders' equity and earnings per share for further discussion of the repurchase program.
guarantor financial information in connection with the merger of certain of the company's wholly owned subsidiaries in an internal subsidiary restructuring on june 30, 2021, diamondback e&p became the successor borrower to diamondback o&g llc ("o&g") under the credit agreement, the successor issuer of energen's 7.125% medium-term notes, series b, due february 15, 2028 and energen's 7.32% medium-term notes, series a, due july 28, 2022, and the sole guarantor under the indentures governing the december 2019 notes, the may 2020 notes, the 2025 senior notes and the march 2021 notes.
table of contents guarantees are "full and unconditional," as that term is used in regulation s-x, rule 3-10(b)(3), except that such guarantees will be released or terminated in certain circumstances set forth in the ig indenture and the 2025 indenture, such as, with certain exceptions, (i) in the event diamondback e&p (or all or substantially all of its assets) is sold or disposed of, (ii) in the event diamondback e&p ceases to be a guarantor of or otherwise be an obligor under certain other indebtedness, and (iii) in connection with any covenant defeasance, legal defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the relevant indenture. the 2025 indenture was terminated in connection with the early redemption of the remaining $432 million principal amount of our 2025 senior notes in the third quarter of 2021.
diamondback e&p's guarantees of the december 2019 notes, the may 2020 notes and the march 2021 notes are senior unsecured obligations and rank senior in right of payment to any of its future subordinated indebtedness, equal in right of payment with all of its existing and future senior indebtedness, including its obligations under its revolving credit facility, and effectively subordinated to any of its existing and future secured indebtedness, to the extent of the value of the collateral securing such indebtedness.
the rights of holders of the senior notes against diamondback e&p may be limited under the u.s. bankruptcy code or state fraudulent transfer or conveyance law. each guarantee contains a provision intended to limit diamondback e&p's liability to the maximum amount that it could incur without causing the incurrence of obligations under its guarantee to be a fraudulent conveyance. however, there can be no assurance as to what standard a court will apply in making a determination of the maximum liability of diamondback e&p. moreover, this provision may not be effective to protect the guarantee from being voided under fraudulent conveyance laws. there is a possibility that the entire guarantee may be set aside, in which case the entire liability may be extinguished.
the following tables present summarized financial information for diamondback energy, inc., as the parent, and diamondback e&p, as the guarantor subsidiary, on a combined basis after elimination of (i) intercompany transactions and balances between the parent and the guarantor subsidiary and (ii) equity in earnings from and investments in any subsidiary that is a non-guarantor. the information is presented in accordance with the requirements of rule 13-01 under the sec's regulation s-x. the financial information may not necessarily be indicative of results of operations or financial position had the guarantor subsidiary operated as an independent entity.

table of contents critical accounting estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states.
certain amounts included in or affecting our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures must be estimated by our management, requiring certain assumptions to be made with respect to values or conditions that cannot be known with certainty at the time the consolidated financial statements are prepared. these estimates and assumptions affect the amounts we report for assets and liabilities and our disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. we evaluate our estimates and assumptions on a regular basis. critical accounting estimates are those estimates made in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles that involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and have had or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on the financial condition or results of operations of the registrant. any effects on our business, financial position or results of operations resulting from revisions to these estimates are recorded in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known.
we consider the following to be our most critical accounting estimates and have reviewed these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors.
oil and natural gas accounting and reserves we account for our oil and natural gas producing activities using the full cost method of accounting, which is dependent on the estimation of proved reserves to determine the rate at which we record depletion on our oil and natural gas properties and whether the value of our evaluated oil and natural gas properties is permanently impaired based on the quarterly full cost ceiling impairment test. further, we utilize estimated proved reserves to assign fair value to acquired proved oil and natural gas properties including mineral and royalty interests. as such, we consider the estimation of proved reserves to be a critical accounting estimate.
oil and natural gas reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and natural gas that cannot be precisely measured and the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment. our independent engineers and technical staff prepare our estimates of oil and natural gas reserves and their associated future net cash flows. the process of estimating oil and natural gas reserves is complex, requiring significant decisions in the evaluation of available geological, geophysical, engineering and economic data. significant inputs included in the calculation of future net cash flows include our estimate of operating and development costs, anticipated production of proved reserves and other relevant data. the data for a given property may also change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors, including additional development activity, evolving production history and a continual reassessment of the viability of production under changing economic conditions. as a result, material revisions to existing reserve estimates occur from time to time, and reserve estimates are often different from the quantities of oil and natural gas that are ultimately recovered. although every reasonable effort is made to ensure that reserve estimates reported represent the most accurate assessments possible, the subjective decisions and variances in available data for various properties increase the likelihood of significant changes in these estimates. if such changes are material, they could significantly affect future depletion of capitalized costs and result in impairment of assets that may be material. revisions of previous reserve estimates accounted for approximately $719 million, or 6% of the change in the standardized measure of our total reserves from december 31, 2020 to december 31, 2021. no impairments were recorded on for our proved oil and gas properties during the year ended december 31, 2021; however, material impairments were recorded during the years ended december 31, 2020 and 2019 as discussed further in note 8-property and equipment of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report. due to an increase in the historical 12-month average trailing sec prices for oil and natural throughout 2021 and into 2022, we are not currently projecting a full cost ceiling impairment in the first quarter of 2022.
additionally, costs associated with unevaluated properties are excluded from the full cost pool until we have made a determination as to the existence of proved reserves. we assess all items classified as unevaluated property (on an individual basis or as a group if properties are individually insignificant) on an annual basis for possible impairment. this assessment is subjective and includes consideration of the following factors, among others: intent of the operator to drill, remaining lease term with the current operator; geological and geophysical evaluations; drilling results and activity; the assignment of proved reserves; and the economic viability of development if proved reserves are assigned. at december 31, 2021, our unevaluated properties totaled $8 billion, which consisted of 214,151 net undeveloped leasehold acres with approximately 41,855 net acres set to expire in 2022. we did not record any impairment on our unevaluated properties during the year ended december 31, 2021, but any such future impairment could be material to our consolidated financial statements.
table of contents commodity derivatives from time to time, we use commodity derivatives for the purpose of mitigating the risk resulting from fluctuations in the market price of crude oil and natural gas. we exercise significant judgment in determining the types of instruments to be used, the level of production volumes to include in our commodity derivative contracts, the prices at which we enter into commodity derivative contracts and the counterparties' creditworthiness. we do not use these instruments for speculative or trading purposes.
we have not designated our derivative instruments as hedges for accounting purposes and, as a result, mark our derivative instruments to fair value and recognize the cash and non-cash change in fair value on derivative instruments for each period in the consolidated statements of operations. we are also required to recognize our derivative instruments on the consolidated balance sheets as assets or liabilities at fair value with such amounts classified as current or long-term based on their anticipated settlement dates. the accounting for the changes in fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and resulting designation, and is generally determined using various inputs and assumptions including established index prices and other sources which are based upon, among other things, futures prices, time to maturity, implied volatilities and counterparty credit risk.
these fair values are recorded by netting asset and liability positions, including any deferred premiums, that are with the same counterparty and are subject to contractual terms which provide for net settlement. changes in the fair values of our commodity derivative instruments have a significant impact on our net income because we follow mark-to-market accounting and recognize all gains and losses on such instruments in earnings in the period in which they occur.
see item 7a. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk-commodity price risk for additional sensitivity analysis of our open derivative positions at december 31, 2021.
business combinations we account for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting. accordingly, identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recognized at the date of acquisition at their respective estimated fair values.
we make various assumptions in estimating the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. fair value estimates are determined based on information that existed at the time of the acquisition, utilizing expectations and assumptions that would be available to and made by a market participant. when market-observable prices are not available to value assets and liabilities, the company may use the cost, income, or market valuation approaches depending on the quality of information available to support management's assumptions.
the most significant assumptions relate to the estimated fair values assigned to proved and unproved oil and natural gas properties. the assumptions made in performing these valuations include future production volumes, future commodity prices and costs, future operating and development activities, projections of oil and gas reserves and a weighted average cost of capital rate. the market-based weighted average cost of capital rate is subjected to additional project-specific risking factors. in addition, when appropriate, we review comparable purchases and sales of natural gas and oil properties within the same regions, and use that data as a proxy for fair market value; for example, the amount a willing buyer and seller would enter into in exchange for such properties. changes in key assumptions may cause the acquisition accounting to be revised, including the recognition of additional goodwill or discount on acquisition. there is no assurance the underlying assumptions or estimates associated with the valuation will occur as initially expected. see note 4-acquisitions and divestitures of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report for further discussion of the estimated fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the qep merger and guidon acquisition, including any significant changes in these estimates from the date of acquisition.
estimated fair values assigned to assets acquired can have a significant effect on results of operations in the future. in addition, differences between the future commodity prices when acquiring assets and the historical 12-month average trailing price to calculate ceiling test impairments of upstream assets may impact net earnings.
income taxes the amount of income taxes we record requires interpretations of complex rules and regulations of federal, state, and provincial tax jurisdictions. we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences of (1) temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of existing assets and liabilities and (2) operating loss and tax credit table of contents carryforwards. deferred income tax assets and liabilities are based on enacted tax rates applicable to the future period when those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. the effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period the rate change is enacted. a valuation allowance is provided for deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
the assessment of the realizability of our deferred tax assets, including the assessment of whether a valuation allowance is required, entails that we make estimates of, and assumptions about, future events, including the pattern of reversal of taxable temporary differences and our future income from operations. as of december 31, 2021, we had established a total valuation allowance of $315 million, including a valuation allowance for the full amount of viper's deferred tax assets. the valuation allowance remains in place based on the uncertainty of future events, including viper's ability to generate future taxable income in excess of special allocations to be made to diamondback, and management considered this and other factors in evaluating the realizability of viper's deferred tax assets. no such valuation allowance was determined to be necessary against rattler's deferred tax assets as of december 31, 2021 based on the relative predictability of its future income stream based on its long term customer contracts. any changes in the positive or negative evidence evaluated when determining if viper's or rattler's deferred tax assets will be realized, including projected future income, could result in a material change to our consolidated financial statements. in addition, the determination to record a valuation allowance on certain tax attributes acquired from qep and certain state nol carryforwards which the company does not believe are realizable prior to expiration was based on an evaluation of available positive and negative evidence, including the annual limitation imposed by irc section 382 subsequent to an ownership change and the anticipated timing of reversal of the company's deferred tax liabilities in the applicable jurisdictions. as of december 31, 2021, although the company's recent cumulative losses represent negative evidence regarding reliance on future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences, our balance of taxable temporary differences anticipated to reverse within the carryforward period provides significant positive evidence for the determination that our remaining deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realized. any change in the positive or negative evidence evaluated when determining if our deferred tax assets will be realized, including projected future taxable income primarily related to the excess of book carrying value over tax basis of our oil and natural gas properties, could result in a material change to our consolidated financial statements.
the accruals for deferred tax assets and liabilities are often based on uncertain tax positions and assumptions that are subject to a significant amount of judgment by management. these assumptions and judgments are reviewed and adjusted as facts and circumstances change. at december 31, 2021, our uncertain tax positions were insignificant, however, material changes to our income tax accruals may occur in the future based on the progress of ongoing audits, changes in legislation or resolution of pending matters.
